												Resident Evil Revelations is Capcom's attempt at a modern 'survival-horror' game, and makes claims to go back to the series roots. This isn't completely true, but that also does not mean this game isn't worth your time.Resident Evil Revelations primarily focuses on Jill Valentine before the events of Resident Evil 5. Chris has gone missing (which if Claire has anything to say on the matter, is not an uncommon thing), and a distress signal has been sounded off on a cruise ship left out on a stormy sea. Jill, and new-comer Parker, go in to investigate. And what commences is probably one of the cheesiest plots to exist in the whole series. Resident Evil being cheesy isn't anything new, but this is usually a result of voice acting or nonsensical doors. The plot of the game is just ridiculous, with over-the-top plot twists, extravagant characters even by the series standards, and almost feels like it's convoluted for the sake of being convoluted. But that's not to say it's bad. In a B-Horror sense it's actually rather entertaining, but I suggest you don't come to this game for some deep drama or serious tale and take it for the off-the-rails ridiculous story that it is.The game is split into 12 episodes, which in part have two parts each. Typically in each episode, you'll play one part of it as Jill in the 'present', exploring the ship and its horrors. The other half changes chapter-per-chapter of what it contains, but typically it stars some other character, either in the present or at some other time, doing something somewhere else that's somehow important to the story. These chapters are usually notably more action-packed than Jill's chapters, and honestly they're usually not quite as good as Jill's chapters either, but they're not terrible. And as the game has an episodic structure, episodes usually end off with a cliff-hanger, and when you start the next episode, it starts amusingly off with a, ""Previously, on Resident Evil Revelations..."" recap. The game plays sort of like Resident Evil 4 or 5, but there are differences to the system here. Firstly, the first big difference you may notice are the enemies. The Oozes, are what they're called, and they don't just look different, they chug along, waving their bodies all over the place making them a bit hard to hit. On top of this, they respond different to being shot than, say, Ganado or Majinni. And this takes a bit of adjusting too. Basically, the Oozes are hurt most in the head, but shooting them in the head doesn't actually stun them (and they won't explode in this game, either). It's actually sometimes far more worth your time to shoot their arms or legs. Oozes can lose use of their limbs temporarily, and can be noted when their limbs are damaged and unusable as they dangle around once damaged enough. If you shoot the legs of an Ooze, it'll start crawling around. Shoot an arm off, and it won't be able to use attacks with that arm for a time. Shoot both arms off, and the enemy will be stun-locked, letting you run-in and melee the enemy. Unlike RE4 or 5, you can hold-down the melee button to charge it up for a more powerful melee strike.There's other changes too that lead to the game feeling different. There's no red herbs, or first-aid sprays, only green herbs in this game, and they're full heals in the title so its often worth holding onto them until you're almost dead. The game has some swimming sections, where you can't shoot your gun but just swim around the flooded areas and make sure to get air every once in a while. You have an item scanner, which you mainly use to find hidden items or scan enemies to fill a percentage (as when it reaches 100%, it gives you a free green herb and resets itself back to 0%).  All of these changes lead to this feeling like a very different sort of game.The ship is atmospheric and moody, and while linear, does contain the sort of back-tracking and key-collecting you'd expect. Puzzles are underplayed unfortunately, but the game does throw some interesting twists and turns your way through the course of the game to keep things interesting.The enemies are also fairly varied. The main force being a selection of different types of Oozes, as mentioned earlier, but there's other types about, one returning BOW from the older series, and the game does a pretty good job at introducing new enemies up until the end of the game. There's also a few bosses, who work well for being intimidating, but also fun to fight.Music is actually rather fantastic. Some excellent songs help the mood and keep the cold ocean feel and melodic charm going. There are several stand-out tracks, but the entirety of it is pretty good.And let me get this out of the way. It's an excellent PC port. The game shows its handheld nature in many ways, but the graphics have been updated substantially since its original 3DS release. Lots of options to customize, and it runs rather well. Honestly the only issue I've really had at all with the port is sometimes when in windowed mode if you click out a lot, the game will on the rare occasion crash, but its a very minor thing, both as its fairly rare and the game saves progression automatically quite regularly.The only other thing to touch base on is Raid Mode, which is the replacement in this game to Mercenaries Mode. To best describe it would be to basically say imagine Mercenaries had a child with Monster Hunter, as in this mode you go through locations from the game (either alone, or with a co-op partner online) and hunt and kill monsters, get a ranking, and earn loot. Guns, mods, and the like. You can unlock a rather large variety of characters from the game, each who have their own unique skills (some better use certain weapons, some recover health over time, each has a different knifing style and melee attack, etc.), and a unique level. The level system is like an RPG, where you gain experience and gaining a level increases things like your defense and attack power. However, in a neat addition, you can select your level when selecting your character up to the point you've unlocked, so let's say I had a level 20 Jill but wanted to play with someone who was level 2, I could lower my level down to 2 to play with them a bit more fairly, and then raise it back up whenever I wanted, but not past the level I've unlocked, which is 20.Raid Mode is absolutely addicting, and probably what will keep you coming back to this title most if you take the delve into it. There's 21 levels, and each one gets longer, more extravagant, and as they go along, start throwing in things like multiple explorable areas and even boss monsters from the campaign. On-top of this, each level has four different difficulties, and these don't just make them harder, but change the layout of each where enemies spawn, where items are, and more. But you need to finish all the stages on one difficulty to unlock the next difficulty. That is, except the 21st level, which is kind of a bonus level that's only recommended if you're maxed out. The last level is a treat in itself that you have to work hard to tackle. It's basically the entire ship from the main game turned into an open-world, enemy-infested obstacle course, with multiple ending points, multiple paths through the ship, and lots of goodies to collect, including a hidden boss exclusive to this stage. It's a lot of fun and very challenging. Revelations may have a convoluted story, cheesy dialogue, key collecting, back-tracking, and interesting inhuman enemies... But it also feels more like a mash-up of new with the old, and not a true overall callback to the classic survival-horror of the series. But that doesn't mean it's a bad game, and completely worth your time if you either enjoy the series or enjoy these sort of action or horror type of games. It's a lot of fun, and has a good amount of replay value. It may not be the best in its series, but it's a fun, ridiculous ride while it lasts.			"

												CAMPAIGN REVIEW ONLY:Resident Evil: Revelations (RE:R) is a spin-off from the numbered RE game, since numbered RE's have become more + more blockbuster-esque + action-esque. Revelations takes some steps to bring the RE series a bit closer to its survival-horror roots, which long-time fans of RE series are going to appreciate. Also, RE:R keeps some of the things that were found in RE5 (i.e. you will often have an AI companion with you + KB-mouse controls were drastically improved) + RE6 (the game will have you playing from different agents' perspective). While RE's plot is typical RE stuff, if you've played any of the previous RE's, it's still enjoyable, ridiculous, quite over-the-top + hammy. Agents from different organizations are involved in a pair or so of ships that have a Virus on them - and the agents are here to clean-up the mess. With twists + turns in the story + plot, never is there a dull moment, even despite the dialogue + writing never ever really taking-off, staying quite serviceable.RE:R delivers a much more solid gameplay experience than RE6, never feeling like you will be replaying the same exact levels + boss fights numerous times that you did on another campaign. RE6 had tons of major highs + some major lows, while RE:R never ever does that at all - from start-to-finish, RE:R is, for the most part, is excellent. Unlike RE5+6, expect to constantly run out of ammo and be switching weapons - often bringing back the survival-horror feel that had been dwindling since RE5. Controls feel very similar to RE5+6 PC, in terms of the actual controls - so, you're fine with how those controlled with the KB-mouse, expect more of that. For me, it was best to turn-off Mouse Acceleration in the Options - to make the mouse actually move more properly - otherwise, the mouse didn't control correctly. When assets + backtracking get re-used, it is done in a way where something is twisted into a different way entirely - which was one of the biggest problems with RE6. RE:R's biggest problem is actually in its graphics quality, since its environments really show that this was a port from a mobile platform - with often some blurry environments, bland environments & not-detailed areas showing up on-screen. On the other hand - characters + enemy models look really good, showing that those are of a much higher + better quality. The game rarely dropped belong 60 frames per seconds on its highest settings, playing smoothly most of the time. There were a few stutters and framerate drops - which, oddly enough, were when going from area-to-area in one of the hubs, when nothing of much was happening, when waiting to move to the next area. When it mattered, during combat - most of the time, 60 frames per second on my PC (i7 950; 1 GB of GeForce GTX 560 Ti; 8 GB RAM; Win 7 64-bit). If you found RE6 disappointing for whatever reasons - and certainly many did, while I found it to be a gem, despite its numerous flaws - make sure to check out RE:R. RE:R is a return to the greatness that came from RE4 + also takes some of the elements of RE5+6 that were worthwhile. Certainly, RE:R is an improvement over in RE6 in terms of overall consistentcy + brings back some of the survival-horror elements that were missing in a majority of RE6. After 16 hours of playing, RE:R proves that graphics ain't always everything, when the overall gameplay is consistently fantastic.Final Grade = B+.ADDITIONAL NOTES On RE Series -> RE4,5,6 + Rev:Keep in mind, I have yet to play RE1-3, believe it or not.RE4 PC (Non-HD Edition) might've been the greatest RE game that I've played so far, despite it being a not-so-good PC port (in terms of PC controls for the KB-mouse). RE5 was a really good game-experience + major improvement in making a great PC version for a RE game. RE6 is just a flawed-gem of a game. RE:R fits in as being the best actual RE game that I've played since actually RE4.			"

												Mmm. This was my first real foray into Resident Evil, and I liked it so much that I finished the entire game in one sitting that went way er, late into the morning.Though I have no other RE benchmark to compare it to, I thought the campaign story was really neat and well done, lots of twists that kept me guessing. Most of the characters had interesting personalities, though as a new player to the RE series with no prior background knowledge of the characters besides knowing they exist, I feel not much was done with Chris and Jill outside of them obviously being ""the celebrity couple that won't admit it"" in the game. I suppose you're meant to know them from previous games, but as a standalone, they ended up being the flattest characters even though you get to play the both of them and thus like them by virtue of them being an extension of ""you"".I enjoyed the episodic sort of storytelling technique with a cutscene recap of the previous episode at the start of each next one as though it was a TV serial. Ammo shortages put a constant pressure on the campaign (on normal) but it was not overly scarce, so generally it was a good balance. Definitely had to use every single gun in the game and swap them in and out at times though.I seldom play games with this kind of 3rd person angled camera, and I was afraid I'd get motion sickness at first, but as it thankfully turned out it was not an issue for me through the game. I didn't have issues aiming or shooting but did have slight issues locating the enemy at times, but by the end of the game had become accustomed enough to it.The horror element in this game was mostly the gore/grotesque sort of horror, and not the kind of horror that keeps one awake at night from the sheer terror of a floorboard creaking in the kitchen.There are only two, maybe three fights in the game that would really count as ""bosses"" with a particular strategy/way to defeat them or stay alive against, and not just giant meatbags. There were a couple fun little turret shooting sessions too.The biggest negative, I would say, is that some quest objectives that were not marked on the map should have been. You are made to run back and forth to different parts of the ocean liner that most of the story takes place on, and the map is humongous and somewhat complex to comprehend. The story also jumps back and forth between the three pairs of characters and a fourth flashback pair, taking the player on and off the ship to different locations on a whim. Those together plus the nature of an episodic game encouraging people to take breaks between each chapter/episode, all leads to the fact that it's very easy to get lost in the ship and head in the entirely wrong direction. This can be especially bad since ammo does not respawn.The campaign is entirely solo, the listed co-op tag is solely for Raid mode, which seems to be some sort of wave survival rubbish that I plan to never play. There is a New Game+ available after you finish the campaign, which is you keeping your characters + some extra unlocked gear and starting a new campaign with them. I probably will look toward other games in the series/franchise instead, though.			"

General info~Genre: Action game with survival horror elements~Number of players: 1-2~Completion time: 8-30 hours~Multiplayer cooperation mode~Originally a Nintendo 3DS title~Downloadable content: availableStrong points+Atmosphere: Resident Evil: Revelations (RE:R)offers a combination of survival horror elements and action sequences. Explore an abandoned ship, read memos of former events, examine corpses, solve puzzles along the way, but be ready to survive a relentless undead assault at any moment.+That music made my day: The soundtrack, (mostly consisted of zombie growls, victim screams and background music) being atmospheric and experimental, transforms RE:R into an unforgettable experience. Headphone use strongly recommended. The soundtrack on Youtube by Canal de Redblogij:

			OST Resident Evil Revelations - 01. Revelations -Previous Story-		

 +Cast of characters: The original duet (Jill Valentine-Chris Redfield) has returned for a new dance with the undead. At the same time, some of the newest cast entries are quite interesting (Parker, Cadet, Jessica, etc.) and would definitely benefit future RE titles with their appearance.+Enemies: Instead of your ordinary, slow, rotting zombies, RE:R features a wide array of enemies, each with its own strength and weaknesses. Since the title revolves around an aquatic environment, your opponents were designed accordingly. Their forms are some of the best the series has ever presented.+Chapter separation: RE:R is divided into chapters. Each chapter offers new challenges and gives the player the opportunity to control different characters. Before each new chapter a summary of the previous one is shown, thus preventing the players from forgetting what has happened, in case they decide to play the game sporadically.+Scanning system: “Genesis” is a unique equipment which scans your surroundings for hidden ammo, herbs and items. Also, scanning enemies has its benefits.+Inventory system:RE:R demands clever use of herbs (only 5 can be carried at a time), bullets and grenades. Inventory is at first limited but can be expanded by finding certain inventory parts or weapon mods. Such limitation not only rewards the conservative and clever combatants but enhances the feeling of survival horror throughout the game.+Raid mode: The highlight of the game and the main reason you will be spending hundreds of hours on RE:R. Similar to the infamous Mercenaries mode of previous RE titles, Raid presents a new challenge: Enemies with special abilities and different levels swarm various locations from the single player campaign and the player must kill them all or advance to the end of the stage. As if the ordinary Hunter weren't enough, how about facing a Hunter boss or a sneaky Hunter baby with increased attack rating and tiny frame? Don't forget to spend your Battle points in the store after each raid for new weapons, mods and unlockable characters. Raid also features online or local cooperation for whole family entertainment!+Difficulty levels: Three difficulty levels to master. Having played almost all RE titles, I can assure you that Revelations can be hard and punishing to reckless players (during boss fights, for instance). Completing the game on the hardest difficulty is a great achievement, especially for hardcore gamers.+Weapon customization: Scattered around the map are special modification parts which can be attached to your weapons. Searching for them adds to the exploration and motivates the player to search remote or dangerous areas. The combinations are limitless and you can always change equipped mods at the iconic storage boxes from previous RE games.Weaknesses-Voice acting: It was always an issue with RE titles but that doesn't mean it should be considered a tradition. Dear voice actors, show some enthusiasm during the recording sessions!-Finishing/melee moves feel coarse and restricting. The dodging mechanism, albeit crucial for the latest parts of the game, seems deferred and difficult to master.-Respect the elderly: RE:R aged somewhat badly. In all honesty, I didn't get the feeling Capcom paid any attention to graphically upgrading the PC port.-Downloadable content of minor (or cosmetic) value.-The not so legendary Chris Redfield: The single player campaign lacks the cooperation mode of RE 6 and the AI controlled companions are rather weak.Neutral ground±Comparison to Nintendo 3DS :Albeit close to its older brother, I found the online matching search in Raid mode cooperation faster than that of the 3DS version. Other than that, the two versions are almost identical.My rating3/5 (Steam version) ~ 4/5 (Nintendo 3DS version)Revelations is one of the best modern Resident evil games. Its soundtrack is delightful and the Raid mode is positively addicting. Nevertheless, if you own it on Nintendo 3DS, skip the Steam version. If you insist on buying it, wait for a discount sale. "

												Originally released for the 3DS early last year, Revelations was an incredible game for the system and the series. A little over a year later, Capcom decided to release it on the consoles and PC.StorySet between Resident Evil 4 and 5, this game will have you playing as Jill Valentine, as she and her partner are sent to discover the source of creatures that have been washing up on shore. They soon discover a cruise ship filled with dead people and various monsters. Their day goes down hill from there. PresentationWhile not as pretty as Resident Evil 6, the visuals in this game are quite nice, and its easy to forget that this was original made for a screen only a few inches big. Some textures are a little blurry. Character models for both you and enemies look great though.The voice acting in this game works well, with there never being any problem understanding what characters are saying. No faults here. Music works well to set the mood of the locations, adding to the atmosphere. The sound effects are also great, with plenty of small things to enhance the scares.ControlsYou won't have any problems with controls, no matter if you prefer a gamepad like me or a keyboard and mouse. Both work well, using the standard controls for a third person shooter. GameplayWell the controls may have shifted to the standard for a third person shooter, you don't need to worry that this is all action and explosions like Resident Evil 6 was so fond of. This game frequently has you searching for just a bit more ammo and dodging monsters rather than destroying them. It even has some of the old fetch quest puzzles to keep you busy. You are simply able to move around better while dealing with the swarms of foes. The shambling monstrosities can still get in your way often enough, but its easy enough to take them down. Just don't forget to keep an eye on your ammo, and the other on your surroundings, as there are always more beasts looking to take you down. Many of the fights will involve numerous creatures looking to nibble on you. This game has streamlined the inventory. Now, you can hold at most three weapons and some grenades, several green herbs, and any key items as you find. The only time you will need the storage box is to switch between various weapons and upgrade them. These are one of the new changes, where you can find various parts to try out on your gear. Some will boost damage, others increase clip size or reload speed, and others will be able to boost other stats or add additional abilities to your favourite weapons.The last major addition to this game that should be mentioned is the Genesis. This device allows you to scan your surroundings and the enemies you come across. Enemies will boost the Genesis scan percentage, with it giving you an additional herbs, which scanning the landscape will reveal hidden items such as ammo or weapon parts.This game is incredible fun, but being a Resident Evil title, and one made for a handheld to boot, the game can be finished rather quickly if you are focused on just beating the story mode. My own playtime for the story was just over 6 hours.LifespanFortunately, there is no reason you have to stop there. If playing the story over in New Game Plus mode while on a higher difficulty isn't enough to tempt you, perhaps the Raid mode will. This is a series of levels based on the story mode, where you will need to reach the end of each level while taking down the enemies in your way, either while playing solo or with a friend online. As you go through each area and accomplish goals, you will earn additional weapons, weapon parts, costumes and experience. Your character will be able to level up and become more powerful, which will be wanted for the later Raid levels.ClosingThis is, in my opinion, one of the best Resident Evil titles available, and easily the best released in the last 8 years. Good story, great gameplay and an extra mode for you and a friend to continue enjoying well after you have tired of beating the main mode.			"

												This was a 3DS game?!Regardless - RE:Revelations fringes the border between older RE games and RE:4 - you won't be desperately scrounging up bullets or solving intricate emblem-based puzzles, but the traditional RE cheese is all there. For those of you who never took RE seriously in the first place, there's a good old cheesy story here.The fact that this is a 3DS port rarely, if ever, shows through - the loading between areas is an occasional reminder and can get a little annoying, but otherwise that's about it. Story-lenth wise, expect a full 10-12 hour campaign broken down into episodes.Lastly, RE:Rev has what's called ""Raid Mode"" - which feels like a cross between a Time Trial and Mercenaries - it offers a surprisingly deep combat system and plenty of replay value beyond the campaign, so if you're the completionist type, expect at least half a dozen or more hours of gameplay on top of what you already have.If you're an RE fan and you enjoyed RE:4 but understand the difference between RE0-3 and RE4, know very well that this is far closer to 4 than any of the others. Even then, it isn't without its challenges and I wholeheartedly recommend you give it a try anyways.			"

WTF Capcom?- No puzzles- *Don't expect a real horror game, it's a horror flavored shooter. Just like every other RE game, ever.BTW it's worth mentioning that Capcom got their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and released a patch that adds the option to disable mouse acceleration.

												I'm not sure why but I enjoy this more than RE6. OK probably due to the fact that I don't have a controller for it and I don't want to get it for my xbox 360 elite.I absolutely love this game. The sparkling of items reminds me of old times and the sound effects remind me of RE5 and previous.The gameplay mechanics are smooth and I have not encountered any bugs whatsoever. The characters are decent especially jill valentine who happens to be my favorite. I love the storyline, too. Going back and forth between two stories on a different timeline is pretty cool. I do wish they make another game like this but probably better in a way.I suggest to anyone who is a RE fan or just a fan of horror/thriller games to get this. Currently playing raid mode with legendary weapons :) Have fun gamers.			"

												Well, I have played this game for a number of hours. And unlike many people who writes these reviews, I have the game beaten. The game is fun if you are looking for action topped off with some horror elements. What I will say is that this game is far from survival horror. Basically, this game is a spirtual sucessor to Resident Evil 4 as far as gameplay; however, the game has more survival horror elements than Resident Evil 4 but it has a long way to go before it goes back to the roots. Now on to the game itself.        The game basically takes place between Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5 (prologue as well) making it in movie terms a interquel (a story that is set between the original and the sequel). As far as the story goes, the plot is basically revolved around Jill Valentine and her new partner Paker investigating a ship named the Queen's Zinoba (sorry if I spelled it wrong). There are many twists and turns through out the story so, I won't say any more.        On to the gameplay, I think the gameplay is smooth and responsive at 60 fps. The only issue I have is the game forcing you to have a partner 95% of the time. I know back during the Resident Evil trilogy that you had AI partners but I feel like getting rid of AI partners for the most part would make the game have more tension. Also, I didn't like the fact that there was a whole lot of ammo to be found. But the worst part is the scanner. I think this is a device for causals would can't seem to find items.     Overall, the game is a fun time for people who likes action with some survival horror elements mixed in. The old hardcore Resident Evil fans who want a game like the Resident Evil trilogy will not find what you are looking for here. So, let me summarize again. This game is a must buy for action fans while this game is a skip for surivival horror fans that want a challenge.			"

												Overview: Spoiler Free!This is the game fans that loved the games before Resident Evil 4 were waiting for. It has the horror aspecs, it has the asmosphere, it has the creepy soundtrack. It really does feel like survival horror until about the last couple of chapters in the game. Pros: - Good gameplay- Scary and creative enemies- Epic and disturbing boss battles- Chris Redfield is back! - Jill Valentine is back with a skin-tight suit ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)- More skin tight suits - Homage to old-school survival horror- Interesting setting, exploration is encouraged- Beautiful environments and graphics- Good difficulty, especially on higher diff. settings- Rage mode is good fun- Minimal loading screens- High replayabilityCons:- Facial animations are a bit wonky (not a big deal)- A bit short (again, not a big deal because replayability is high)- Keith and Quint are the most annoying friggin' characters yet! I thought Ashley Graham was a bit annoying but not at all compared to these doofuses!- Holds your hand a bit too much later in the game as you stockpile ammo easily by this time- No Jill Sandwiches ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)Verdict:Play it. Play it right now. Fans of horror and old-school Rezzie players will appreciate it! I have high hopes for Revelations 2!  "

												This was actually pretty a decent Resident Evil game overall. I think this is because the game actually quite feels a lot like the old RE games, and it truly feels like a survival horror. But the game still focuses a lot on action as well. I thought the game story and the graphics were rather, underwhelming, but I guess I can not really blame them as this game basically started out as a Nintendo 3DS game. The game actually feels like you are watching something like 24, kind of like a TV series that you would see on TV. And I thought that was an interesting idea.The gameplay overall is quite well balanced, it is something more like a mix of Resident Evil 3 + Resident Evil 4, with better control overall. I mean, the game is really good. But, it just does not exactly ""stand out"" as you'd expect it to be. Maybe Resident Evil: Raccoon City is a bit more fancier graphically, but then again, since it started out as an N3DS game, I can not complain.And if anything, I thought the final boss was ridiculously hard for no reason. I have a feeling that I do not have good weapons against him, but then again, I don't think I can go back and find the weapons.....the creators should've learned from Resident Evil 5. Overall, nothing much to say. Not bad, not that amazing, either. Still quite enjoyable though.7.1/10			"

												At first I didnt believe what people wrote about the game, it being closer to the atmosphere and feeling of Bio1-2. Turns out, its true. If you are sane and agree that the Bio series and its fanbase took a dive into a latrine, surely you will love Bio Revelations.Countless times I felt reminded of either Bio1, 2, 3, veronica or even what closely resembles inspirations from prototypes, mainly RE3.5. At times the wonderful blue tones the game can give even make you think of RE1.5.Its as though the team knew they would ignore some of the nasty turns the series took since the fourth installment and deliver something more true to the spirit of the original titles.The biggest bonus for me is, having grown up always playing the import versions of the first titles before they came out here, you can play it in glorious original japanese dub and text! Tasty.If only Capcom wouldnt drag the series more into an obscure ridiculous kids game since 4-5-6, I could cherrish the thought that there may be more titles akin to Revelations, likely however that will not be the case.

												Resident Evil Revelations is one of the best games in the series, surprisingly. After RE5 and 6, it seems like someone at Capcom finally realized that there was something wrong with making RE into a over-the-top 'Summer Action Movie'-esque game. Revelations is as scary as RE ever has been (which is to say, not very), and visually, it's wonderful. If you're playing with a controller, make sure you play with RE4-style controls, it makes the game far more enjoyable. Raid mode is a blast, as well, when you play with someone.			"

												Great graphics, great sound-layout, fantastic story. The good 'old Resident Evil is back putting all you know in the corner.Capcom gone wild making the girls even hotter than in the previous parts. Zombies (Rachel <3) where never so hot.There are many new characters included, but the core story deals about Chris and Jill (oh Jill <3). After RE 3 - Nemesis and RE 5 I thought i would never again see Jill Valentine. Unfortunately there is no cooperation-story mode included. If you want to play coop only raid mode (minigame).+ New mechanics with herb usement+ Fantastic music, sounds+ Cutscenes, the whole story was probably done by a film studio... great work (comparable to Metal Gear Solid - Story)+ Solid weapons.+ New concept of Zombies. In a new way scary as hell.- NO COOP in core game! Really sad.- I personally miss the weapon shopping stuff as it was in RE 4 and RE 5- RAID mode is quite funny, but there are none gamers online.- Not very much enviroment interaction.In Total: 9/10 -1 because there is no cooperation mode "

												Revelations is my new favorite Resident Evil game since the release of RE4. It brings back horror, and some action, just like the first installments. Sure, it's a port of the 3DS version but a very playable (and upgraded) one at that. The graphics aren't realistic, but I thought they were very well done and I like the way everything looked. The atmosphere was definitely good. The voice acting is also surprisingly good and not too cheesy.You'll be switching between several characters during the game which keeps things interesting, but the best parts are still the ones that play out on the big ship. You have a special camera that allows you analyze enemies and once the analysis reaches 100% you'll get a free health item. You can keep doing this but once you've captured the same enemy multiple times its progress will slow down. It's a very interesting game mechanic; do you risk getting attacked to analyze that one certain enemy, or do you just kill it and see if you can do it afterwards (which isn't always possible, because enemies disappear just seconds after being defeated).RER is a lenghty game, even though most of the other RE games take longer to complete. I finished this one in 10 hours, which is the ideal length if you ask me.In other words; thumbs up for this Resident Evil ![Rating: 86/100]			"

												Resident Evil Revelations was an exclusive game for the 3DS was released in 2012Capcom decides to Share Their Sweet Baby with us on Consoles/PC. for those like me who played this game on the 3DS you know that this baby is a must play on PC.Resident Evil Revelations is the most fun RE game I've played since RE4 and is much better than the disappointed Resident Evil Games that was released nowadays. Resident Evil Revelations takes place in between the events of RE4 and RE5.Familiar faces Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine will be in the story plus new characters such as the charming Italian male named Parker,the flirtatious Jessica,specialist operatives named Keith and Quint whom are military style units and Quint is a specialist with tech stuff,commander O Brian who works for the organization named BSAA that Chris and Jill helped create to stop bioterrorists and the red-haired Raymond who is an agent from another organisation who has a mysterious aura to him and you aren't sure to trust him or notThe story shows the events that happened to a once beautiful city named Terragrigia which was built on an artificial island (you'll see how it's surrounded by beautiful ocean scenery) and the city was high tech,used clean energy but a series of disasters happened to the city .The story takes you to before and after Terragrigia was destroyed.All I will say is a bioterrorist organisation named II Veltro whom are against government control come into the story and the BSAA are a group whom were created specifically to combat bioterrorism and the group was founded with the help of known RE characters Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine.Jill and her partner Parker go on an infiltration style mission to spy on or stop II Veltro but they go missing and Chris and his partner Jessica go searching for Jill and Parker and you'll also control Keith and Quint.The individuals in the pairing of characters can change too.I like how the story shifts it's focus on different pairs of characters because it makes the story feel more thrilling by making you wonder will they be able to find each other or not or will they surviveThe story does a good job to fill you in one what happened to Terragrigia and explains about Terragrigia in detail with some beautiful cinematics and it makes an attempt to fill you in on story elements that happened in past RE gamesThe story also has a bit of character flirting and romantic interests mixed with a lot of seriousness and personally I like how the story is that way because the story is still disturbing and very serious and can be emotional but the romantic interest/flirting stuff and humor give the characters/story a nice break from some of the intensity at timesThe gameplay in RE Rev is a great mix of classic survival horror and action gameplay.For much of the game you'll need to be conservative with ammo because ammo isn't plentiful like it is in RE4/RE5/RE6 which means you'll need to make headshots or cannot miss too often when you shoot(this adds more intensity to the gameplay as you'll try to make your last few remaining bullets count and was something that was missing in RE4/RE5/RE6.Overall: Probably the best original release title so far and it brings back the survival horror elements that classic style RE fans miss but uses the mechanics introduced in RE4 very well. so Add the creepy atmosphere, great graphics/beautiful cinematics, nd story/characters and you might care about make this game great/Superb			"

												The game is pretty long, offers some challenge and extras to make you replay it, but it get's fairly repetitive at certain points of the story even on a single walkthrough. You get to play as multiple characters throught the game, although they mostly play the same. The story not too deep, yet difficult to understand at times (might be easier for people familiar with other Resi games), but the ending is fairly satisfying, even though it leaves an obvious lead-in for the Revelations 2. There are many returning characters from older RESI games, but there are some interesting new ones, too.The game itself is rather a shooter than an actual (survival) horror and I doesn't contain usuall Resi-type zombies, but rather strange sea-animal hybrids. Most of the bosses lack charisma and boss fights generally are heavily based around finding a tactic and using it over and over again. The scenery lacks variety at times (a major part of the story takes place on a ship), but brings something new to the Resi series on the other hand.There are multiple minigames / sub-mechanics to bring some variety into the gameplay. I'll mention scanning for fingerprints and hidden items, hacking mini-game, arcade-style railway shooter, weapon upgrades and augmentations. There ARE quick-time events in this game, but they're not too frequent or annoying in any way. The controls overall work faily well on PC with Mouse & Keyboard.As far as I know, there is no co-op mode for the campaign, but there is a Raid Mode for multiplayer, with unlockable equipment and skillpoints.After finishing the campaign, I can say I enjoyed the game, even though I've hated it at some points and wanted it to end already. There were some nice plot twists I liked, there were some plot twists I didn't really understand. Just don't expect a survival horror and rather expect an action shooter with long cutscenes.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations is a survival shooter developed and published by CAPCOM.Resident Evil Revelations takes place after the event of Resident Evil 4 and before Resident Evil 5, it focus on revealing what really happen on Terragrigia and the T-Abyss virus. You can play as Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, Jessica Sherawat and Parker Luciani. As Jill, you will be playing on a cruise ship, Queen Zenobia. Well, it was a cruise ship, but you'll find that ship is scary, like Resident Evil games should be, monster ambush, somewhat rare ammo to find, it's quite scary on the dark hall. But the ship can be explored over and over again as you like if you miss something.Resident Evil Revelations gameplay are pretty much the same as any Resident Evil games but with some new freedom like we can now move while aiming, dodging and weapons customization instead of upgrading. The partner AI is somewhat questionable because most of the time they didn't bother shoot the enemy even when the monsters are so close on them. Pretty much we do anything by ourselves when it comes to killing. Still, nothing you can't handle.Resident Evil Revelations graphics is good, but kinda not as expected for a newer Resident Evil games. It's not ugly but could be better. Performance are also great.I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												First and foremost, yes the classic resident evil games are way better. However, Revelations isn’t that bad. The storyline is kinda meh, but the gameplay (except the dodging system) is fun most of the time. This game also has a addictive co-op mode, ''raid mode''. Do keep in mind that in order to unlock all of its stages, you have to beat the game first. I would not call this title a survival horror game. It has a sections where the atmosphere definitely creeps you out, but the game still contains (in my opinion) too much action movie sections. Warning: the boss fights can be very frustrating, even on casual difficulty. Especially the final boss is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥Rating: 7,5/10			"

												THIS IS A CAMPAIGN REVIEW ONLY(I didn't bother with playing the raid mode, more of a mercenaries fan here)Well, what can i say, It's a Resident Evil game and i'm a huge fan of the series.But this game has some pros and cons, majorly because it was a 3ds game ported to pc and the content it's not huge like other RE games.So here we go:+Nice story, takes place before RE5, kinda pulled away tho, it gets interesting and sometimes boring as ♥♥♥♥+Classic RE 4-5 gameplay (with the change that you have the ability to move while aiming, you can't do the menu reload thing that was in RE5 and you don't have an inventory)+Level design is great and i'm glad the story had those environment changes to kill the repetitiveness of the ship atmosphere (You know, the snowy mountains level, the terragrigia chaos, etc etc)+Guns and customization are ok, you have the classic types of guns that you can find in a RE game plus the custom parts that adhere damage, magazine size, fire rate, reduced spread and those kind of things to the guns+You get to watch Jill's glorious♥♥♥♥♥for a long period of time (7-8 hours wich is the campaign length if you have an idea of how to play the game and what you're doing)-Repetitive-Low variety of enemies-Short story mode-Bosses are a little bit easy with the exception of the final boss wich is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥It's a good Resident Evil game but i wouldn't pay the whole price for it (srsly $30 is a lot of money for this game), get it on a sale and enjoy it because it was a very fun game after all.

												Resident Evil: Revelations is the first game in RE's ""Revelations"" series, it's mainly focused on events that are not directly connected to the main series.The game starts with Jill and a new character, Parker Luciani, as they are ordered by the BSAA to look for Chris & Jessica (another new character) on a ship called ""Queen Zenobia"". The game takes place in 2005, about one year before the events of ""Lost in Nightmares"".First off, let me start with the setting. The ""Queen Zenobia"" makes for a great setting, it's atmospheric, mainly consists of tight corridors, and feels great to explore. Some other scenarios include Chris & Jessica or Quint & Keith (Again, new characters) wandering through a snowy mountain region and a kind of ""flashback"" scenario that shows the Terragrigia Panic. I don't want to talk further about the plot, since it would just spoil things. I think that the Queen Zenobia is overall the best setting. Secondly, the graphics. This game is a HD port of a Nintendo 3DS game, meaning that the graphics are not anything to brag about. However, I think they are sufficent enough to underline the mostly dark atmosphere. All the cutscenes are pre-rendered aswell.The gameplay is fairly slow-paced. It mainly feels like RE4/RE5 with some modernizations like walking while aiming/reloading. RE3's dodge mechanic also makes a return. Each character only has one, unique melee move. Ammo is very important, and enemies will be able to lower your health considerably with just one hit. The healing mechanic is simple: You press a button, your health refills. You can aquire a variety of weapons, but as so often you start off with your trusty old Beretta (Yes, this game uses real life weaponry). You can upgrade your guns with parts that you can find throughout the levels. These parts will, for example, increase the critical hit chance, damage or firing rate. Each weapon only accepts a certain number of parts at once.Something I somewhat dislike about the game are the silly character designs and some story elements. Most characters look out of place compared to the rest of the RE series, while others look as you would expect a BSAA/FBC field operative to look. The worst happened to Jill, as they decided to remodel her face for some reason. Horrible design choice.The whole Terragrigia plot seems to be a bit too sci-fi to me (An on water floating city that gets destroyed by a parabolic reflector satellite), and again, dosen't really fit into the rest of the events.Other than that I thought the plot was pretty good, better than Revelations 2 if you ask me.This is also the first time we get to play Raid Mode. This gamemode is focused on combat, and is mainly about getting from A to B, destroying foes and looting ammo/weapon cases/parts on your way. I'm a big fan of Raid mode, in both Rev and Rev2. It's a huge grind fest, but if you are into that kind of stuff then you will love Raid Mode. The Trinity reward makes the mode more challenging than in Rev2, since it requires you to take no damage throughout the whole stage (among two other requirements).Overall, I really like Revelations, I think it's a good mix between survival horror and action. Get it during sale.Final verdict: 7.6/10 "

												This is the RE game that you play on a rainy afternoon in lieu of a marathon on the Sci-fi channel. The episodic nature of this game really makes me feel that I am playing a well crafted action horror television series that will hopefully get another season. The story was well told through the eyes of different characters and at different times, but it all comes together really well. For me personally, the characters make the story work. Yes we all love Chris and Jill, but to me the stars were the secondary protagonists that you got to play as-Parker Luciani, Keith Lumley and Quint Ketcham. I know I'll probably never see these characters again, but they were nice to get to know in this story. On a personal note, this game made me cry. When I thought a certain character had died, I bawled. Then I felt bad that I had. This is Resident Evil! It's B action horror cheese! Yet, this game quickly invests you in these characters and you bond with them.  The game plays very well. The combat is very smooth, and the atmosphere reminds me a lot of the claustrophobic spaces of the first RE games. The inventory is very simplified but there are also places to store weapons and workbenches to upgrade weapons. The map screen has been done away with and a mini map in the corner of the screen shows the next waypoint. On the whole, I feel that the controls and the interface have been simplified.This was a nice game to go between RE4 and RE5. If had a lot of action but had a lot of the elements that reminded me of classic RESI: timed escapes, claustrophobic spaces, over the top bosses, and rocket launchers. This was a fun time, and what is comes to Resident Evil, what more could you want?			"

												Revelations is a difficult game to review. Yeah this ain't some artsy title with 90% emotional impact (and 10% QTEs) but it was certainly a challenge for me. If I had reviewed this game last year, last month or even last week I would have wrote ""This game is not what I was looking for in a Resident Evil title, I hate it."" But now I like RE:REV? Did the check from Capcom just arrive? Did mobsters threaten to break my kneecaps? No, I simply spent more time with the game.The plot is something you'd expect out of a Resident Evil game. There's a bio-terrorist organization, an enigmatic villain, Jill in a wetsuit*, and the answers will leave fans scratching their collective heads. It's alright because we wouldn't have it any other way. RE:REV is divided into two modes, Campaign & Raid. Raid is where you'll spend most of your game-time, but you gotta play through the Campaign first to unlock all of it. So for now let's explore the campaign. You spend about 80% of your mutant-blasting adventure on a ship. Most of the monsters are aquatic-themed, sometimes swimming is involved and...Oh No. RE:REV is nearly the equivalent of an over-long underwater stage. I hate underwater stages. There are floppy mutant fishes, a blue whale with tentacle-beasts(?), and even creatures you can't actually kill if you bump into them while swimming. There are also humanoids to contend with, and they're just...blech. They're simply gigantic bullet-sponges that aren't any fun to shoot.  Your partner in RE:REV is the most baffling decision in the campaign. Since RE5, partners have become a common game-design element in the series, I don't mind them. With this game however I find myself asking...Why? Unlike previous games, your partner can't do any damage. He'll shoot at the creatures, maybe even punch them, but he won't register any kills. At least they're invulnerable, but the monsters know that, because they're usually focused on you. This must have been a last-minute change by Capcom. They might have planned for the entire campaign to have online co-op, but it fell through. Actually that doesn't make any sense, because it'd make the campaign much easier having two people to kill monsters instead of just one. Why didn't they just write ""Partner AI does damage=1"" in their little RE config.ini file? The biggest ""Why?"" for me is...Why even have a partner at all? Most of the campaign takes place on a ship. The Queen Zenobia consists of cramped corridors, tiny rooms, and a couple set-piece locations. It's big enough to house a few soldiers and a ton of monsters, and not much else. It's natural to assume that Jill wouldn't go it alone, but how about we take Parker and...put him on the other side of the ship. He's not really affecting how the game is played, but he's still next to you, providing some sort of psychological ""buff"". Why don't we stick him somewhere else so that the game becomes scarier? Oh and the less said about the Genesis scanner, the better. All that said, RE:REV's campaign is still very solid. Unlike the more recent titles, it's better to avoid combat when you can. The creatures of the ship forgot how to open doors, so sometimes you should avoid them and move on. The infernal difficulty drills this idea into your head, as it removes the kid-gloves and throws tougher encounters at you from the beginning. I also enjoy finding parts and customizing guns. Wiping enemies out with the charging shot from a sniper rifle can be really satisfying. The Raid Mode is, as I said, where you'll spend the bulk of your game-time. It's comprised of 61 stages across three difficulties. There's more RPG elements at play here, since you have to level-up to unlock and use better equipment. This mode also has online co-op, so I get to play as the useless partner from the campaign. Unfortunately the player-base for this game is miniscule, but the players you run into are friendly and will help (carry) you through the Raids. In any case it's a very well-done mode. Originally I hated it; I thought that I might as well play Borderlands if I wanted to shoot stuff and look at numbers. With enough time, everything clicks.Like Capcom's popular Monster-hunting game (I forgot the name of it), winning a stage in Raid mode isn't just about staying alive, it's also about preparation. Having the right weapons, with the proper customizations, and a healthy set of grenades, will get you much further than reflexes alone. Replaying stages isn't only a necessity for gaining experience, this familiarity can eventually be crafted into mastery. Once you have the layout down, you can shoot through these stages in record time, which can be really entertaining. As far as RE side-games go I'm still a Mercenaries man, but I appreciate what Capcom went for here. For the most part, I'd say they succeeded. Although I wish the exp. gains were higher. Right now I'm grinding stage 2 on the chasm difficulty and..ehhh...It's starting to get old. Not Raid mode, just...that stage..and the blobs...yeesh.With a game like Resident Evil: Revalations, you can't expect to appreciate it in less than five hours. This game has some modern-era sensibilities that clash with its attempts at providing a more traditional RE experience. As a fan of RE4-6 I was taken aback by the differences in combat mechanics, and I'm still struggling with them (dodging in particular). Plus it's hard to ignore the fact that it's an up-port from the 3DS game. It looks better and runs at a constant 60 fps, but its environments and design-decisions due to the limited handheld are carried over. Still, I figure once you start creeping past the 10 hour mark you'll start liking this game, possibly even loving it. *Every other review mentioned Jill and/or her outfit. Just keeping up with the Joneses.			"

												Slow-paced suspensful game that returns to the classic-style horror feel of the earlier installments. although the control system is bleh and the partners that follow you around are so annoying and useless that you wish a Co-Op friend could take over, The Queen Zenobia setting is very well done and could possibly be one of the best settings in the Resident Evil franchise, apart from Raccoon city, which is just flat out Iconic, I wish I lived there.

												Resident Evil: Revelations tells the story of what happens between Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5 and is an extended remake of the Nintendo 3DS handheld game, which adds HD textures.Jill Valentine is on a mission to find her missing partner Chris Redfield, who was last heard from on the cruise ship Queen Zenobia.The Queen Zenobia is one of the best settings in a Resident Evil game since the Arklay mansion.Now stranded on board in the middle of the Mediterranean, Jill and fellow BSAA agent Parker Luciani soon discover they are not alone.Whereas the earlier Resident Evil games prioritized zombies, and recent entries revolved around the Las Plagas parasites, Revelations makes use of a new angle: freakish human/sea-creature hybrids.Along the way you will also play as Chris Redfield and a variety of other newer cast members. Jill’s sections are the main course containing all the exploration, key finding and item management as is expected. There is no co-op for the campaign; your only option in the way of multiplayer is Raid Mode. Raid Mode is a two-player cooperative gauntlet through small sections of the game that feel like small-scale, time-attack sessions of horde mode. It is fun for a while, but it quickly turns into a grind for XP and new items.The facial animations are a little stiff, and overall the visuals naturally are not as nice as Resident Evil 5 or 6.In my opinion is Revelations the best Resident Evil game of the past few years and the one that is the most true return to classic-style horror action.Resident Evil: Revelations is very much worth playing in its HD form for its atmosphere and scares alone.Sounds 9/10Graphics 7/10Gameplay 8/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

My Personal Score: 2/5PCGamingWiki Page[pcgamingwiki.com]Issues: none experienced during playthroughsDLC: There's 7 of them. 3 custom guns that aren't as useful as the ones unlocked in-game, 2 additional characters for the Raid Mode, and 2 custom parts set which can be unlocked in-game at a slower pace.Microtransactions: None.After the action-packed Resident Evil 5, Resident Evil Revelations looks back to the series' roots for an experience that many old-school fans will recognize. Revelations adapts the pre-rendered titles' defining traits to the modern RE, bringing back the series' name to a more grounded state, and actually knows what it wants to be this time: a survival-horror game that focuses on the atmosphere. Revelations reinforces this in the earlier hours of the campaign, where the player is greeted by distant eerie sounds, dark corridors, and the occasional jump scare that's done so effectively due to tension build-up. Some of the scariest parts of the game are the paths leading to the bosses because you can hear their cries echoing the hallways, either laughing from the thrill of the hunt or desperately crying for help. The tension does slow down during the latter half of the game, but the way leading there has been consistent in tone and quality.Revelations uses an episodic structure to move the plot forward. This was done by the developers because ""the game needed to be suitable for playing on portable hardware,""[web.archive.org] regarding the the original 3DS release. The 12 episodes featured in the game contain different scenarios from the perspective of three playable characters and their partners, all contributing small pieces of information and some backstory for the grand finale. While the game starts and ends exactly how a Resident Evil fan expects it too, this has got to be the most complicated series entry to date because there are a lot of character motivations to factor in, and the most important plot points are shown so poorly, with little explanation on why things happened the way they happened; Revelations isn't as straightforward as the games before it so some time is needed to fully grasp the story.Overall, a good game and a great entry to the RE franchise. It retains the B-movie feel that the rest of the series is known for, and the gameplay combines the best of both worlds to deliver a solid experience. Definitely a must-have for the RE fan.And there you have it.			"

												I have been a hardcore fan of Resident Evil since the original back on playstation. In my opinion the original REmake on Gamecube, and Resident Evil 2 have been the best entries in the franchise. How does Revelations compare? The gameplay is perfected and very smooth with responsive controls. The visual presentation is nice for a port from a handheld device, the accompaning music is good although hard to hear at times. The story can be convoluted however, a fault of most modern games it seems. Having just started into the raid mode, this game delivers plenty of replayable. Highly reccomended and the best Resident Evil game since 4 no doubt.			"

												With every Resident Evil game, there is always a sinister yet muddled conspiracy involving a virus. Your an agent of the BSAA (Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance) aboard Queen Zenobia, a large ship that has metallic infrastucture filled with lifts and boxes that resembles a freight zone; that coextends to elegant casino and stylish cabin areas of a pleasure cruiser. However, while searching for a missing agent, you are attacked and chased by slow bio-organic weapons in cramped  claustrophobic corridors. This flawed gem has plenty of suspenful action with your limited peripheral vision but its a pretend survival horror with a clichéd and predictable ending.			"

												As a fan of the originals, Revelations is a much welcomed return to its horror roots but with RE4's shoulder cam and weapon upgrade options (you'll also notice a couple of classic moments that pay homage to the original games).Two new playable characters, (as well as Jill and Chris) plenty of firepower and a lengthy campaign will easily feed your survival horror appetite until the HD REmake lands :)			"

General gameplay and difficulty modesResident Evil: Revelations is an action horror game. And unless you set the game's difficulty to hard, it plays very much like a third-person shooter, too. You see, on the hardest difficulty, you'll want to dodge the monsters as much as possible to conserve ammo, whereas on easy and normal difficulty, you can kill everything that moves.If you want to tackle the hard mode but you're not a masochist, I recommend you play the game on easy or normal mode first and then start a 'new game plus' for a hard mode run. 'New game plus' means you start the game with the weapons and the weapon upgrades you gathered in your previous playthrough(s). That way, hard mode is a bit more bearable but still very challenging. During the campaign you can collect 16 different weapons. With the exception of one special weapon, all weapons belong to one of the following categories: handguns, machine guns, shotguns, rifles and magnums. Each of these categories of weapons requires a different type of ammo. While playing, you collect various weapon upgrades that can increase damage, fire rate, critical hit rate, ammo capacity, and so on. At one of the 'weapon boxes' you'll find scattered throughout the ship, you can select up to three of your weapons to carry with you and apply upgrades to your  weapons.There's a limited supply of grenades to be found in the game. Grenades come in four different types and can be a real lifesaver in difficult situations.You'll collect 'green herbs' and use these to fully restore your health.A short while into the campaign, you'll get a scanner. You can use this scanner to find hidden items or to scan monsters. Scanning a number of monsters automatically yields a green herb.Raid mode (solo or two player co-op)By playing the campaign missions (on any difficulty), you'll open up missions for the game's raid mode. Raid mode is meant for two players but you can play the raid mode missions solo, too, if you prefer. In raid mode you need to go through one of the zones from the campaign but the monster placement is different and the monsters sometimes have special 'skills' like increased speed, defense or offense. In raid mode, your character gains levels from 1 to 50, allowing you to tackle more difficult raid mode missions. The weapons also have a level from 1 to 50, reflecting their power. Adding improved weapons and unique weapons to the mix, raid mode has a huge amount of weapons to find or buy.There's a shop in raid mode where you can buy weapons and upgrades. The currency is called BP. You collect BP by playing through both raid missions and campaign missions. This is the only way the campaign mode has an impact on raid mode.Story and settingsThe theme of Resident Evil: Revelations is bioterrorism. Terrorists use bio-organic weapons, meaning mutant monsters and viruses that cause such mutations. You'll mostly play as Jill Valentine, who belongs to an organization that combats bioterrorism. She teams up with a guy called Parker Luciani to look for her former partner, Chris Redfield, aboard the 'Queen Zenobia', a cruise ship that's adrift.Sometimes you'll play as another character for a while, like Chris or Parker. Those missions are either flashbacks or events happening elsewhere at the same time as the events on board the Queen Zenobia, and they are set in a wintry landscape or in a building. Although these side missions add to the story, they do break the main storyline each time, which is both a good and a bad thing: you're eager to continue the main story aboard the Queen Zenobia and would rather see how events unfold there, but the side missions do add a welcome variety of settings and atmosphere.The Queen Zenobia is an impressive location. Its narrow corridors and small quarters add to the claustrophobic feel a horror game should have. Its larger rooms, like the huge hall and the brightly lit casino, make for an interesting contrast with the smaller, darker spaces. And then there are parts of the ship that are flooded, adding a different kind of claustrophobia to the mix.Gameplay mechanicsMost of the time, you'll be accompanied by an AI-controlled partner. These partners are very weak though, dealing almost no damage and rarely attracting the monsters' attention. So the point of these partners is up for discussion. On the one hand, they often help further the story and they're welcome company in an eerie creepy setting. On the other hand, being alone in an eerie creepy setting does improve that scary, lonely feeling horror games usually aim for.Each room is a seperate game area. This means that monsters won't follow you through doors. It also means it's harder to retreat if you run into trouble in a small room.The game has a few situations in which it uses 'quick time events': when a monster knocks you to the ground or when a monster grabs you. The former requires you to mash a button and the latter requires you to shake your mouse left and right. I really disliked this mechanic as it breaks the flow of combat completely. Maybe it's less of a nuisance if you play using a controller.There's a lot of backtracking involved in the game. You'll revisit most parts of the ship several times. But the game does try to keep things interesting by adding new monsters or by allowing you to unlock a door you couldn't unlock before, leading to some loot or to new parts of the ship to explore.The half a dozen boss fights in Resident Evil: Revelations aren't extremely tactical but they're challenging and lots of fun. Also, some of the bosses look, sound and behave genuinely scary.Graphics and soundThis PC version of Resident Evil: Revelations is a port from an early 2012 3DS game. Although the game's graphics have been polished and upgraded for PC, this still shows. Human faces and expressions look mediocre, and shadows are below par. But on the other hand, the graphics are detailed enough to make the monsters look at least a bit realistic and scary. And the backgrounds and the lighting on the ship often look relatively nice, all things considered. The music is great. Not in the way that you'd want to listen to the soundtrack when you're not playing Resident Evil: Revelations, but in the way that it fits the game's atmosphere perfectly. The music is subtle and quietly in the background when you're exploring a creepy place, and it gets symphonic and bombastic when you're in an epic fight against a boss or running for your life against the clock.The sound effects are impressive. Basic things like the guns firing sound more than okay to me, but especially the ambient sounds and the monsters' sounds are great.The voice acting is top notch. The main characters' voice actors deserve the highest praise for adding a lot of personality and emotion to their characters despite the fact that the material they had to work with was pretty thin.On Steam's Extra FeaturesResident Evil: Revelations has 13 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 7 while running the game.The 50 Steam Achievements are challenging. There are only about 5 achievements you'll get just for playing through the game. There are a few collectibles achievements that require your attention throughout the whole game (or the use of a guide, of course). There are some challenges in the literal sense of the word, like 'kill 3 monsters with one grenade'. And then there are quite a few achievements for raid mode. Most of these can be achieved solo but some do require a partner, so co-op play is necessary if you want 100% completion.On an interesting note, some achievements yield in-game rewards like additional guns or upgrades, so even people who usually don't bother with achievements may want to not ignore them completely in Resident Evil: Revelations.

												Why is this game so underrated? People tend to look right over this game when talking about where resident evil has gone. This is the closest you'll get to the roots without playing 1-4. I highly reccommend this due to the horror and the ammo conservation that's similar to 4.			"

												Resident Evil RevelationsRevelations of a new future for a ruined franchiseFor the last few years this series has been in a rut, the influence of the Triple A Industry has been ripping apart what made this series iconic in exchange for a steroid induced protagonist and the Hollywood makeover. Resident Evil Revelations isn’t this though, it’s a shining example of how you can have your cake and eat it, and with a little polish, this game could lead the franchise into a bright future. Resident Evil Revelations starts off like most other Resi games, you even get the classic “Resident Evil” Voice line when you press start but compared to what we’ve been used to in the last few years, Revelations is a breath of fresh air. The Main setting of this game is the Queen Zenobia, a Cruise Liner stranded out in the Mediterranean Sea. You’ll start off as Jill Valentine with a new partner Parker Luciani, who acts as the bridge for the flashbacks in the story.Although this is not the only place you will see. Revelations takes you across different environments and settings and slowly reveals its story in a variety of interesting ways. Unfortunately the variance of environments and layout of the chapters can take you out of the setting. One moment you’ll be in a tense situation that needs to be resolved and then you’ll flash to other characters in a different environment doing things seemingly unrelated. The Cohesion between these scenes isn’t lost however they could be better arranged. Taking players out of a tense and important moment to shove plot down their throats is a sure fire way to take people out of the game.The game’s major strengths are purely in the game play and the scare factor that’s been retained. It’s definitely not a Resi 4 and it doesn’t ring in the same vein as the classics, but Revelations has its moments. It never resorts to using pop scares and it rarely seems to by trying too hard to scare you instead relying on the classic formula of pacing and fear. The execution is successful but isn’t spectacular, due to the developers mixed directions. We’re talking about a game struggling to choose between its survival horror mum and 3rd person shooter dad, both wanting the Childs custody in the estranged divorce. The Queen Zenobia excels in providing the best survival horror experience of all the settings, while other characters generally get way too much ammunition, powerful guns, and settings that don’t really incite any fear into the player. The experience on the Queen Zenobia isn't perfect and certainly doesn't give you the same kind of chills that most other Survival Horror classics do, but it certainly puts most of the more recent Resident Evil titles to shame.Some tropes that were established by previous games in the series make their return, and help provide some of the actually scary and powerful moments of the game. The plot while weak has its moments and is interesting enough to act as the bait that forces you through the scary moments, although the twists are predictable.My major complaints come from some of the controls and the port quality. The Port Quality, before we cause any arguments here, is great. A lot of support for PC and for the main platforms that helps the game stand toe-to-toe with others, but the almost full price is a heavy deterrent considering how some of the games assets are taken into account. The Textures still remain at a quality level of that on a portable title which makes the game appear in parts like you're walking through a level on a PS2 game. This is fine for the fact the game is ported from a portable device, but the almost full price for a portable game on a PC/Console is a little excessive.The Controls are an entirely different issue and the main gripe is the terribly designed dodge mechanic. It's unclear, un-intuitive, and one of the bosses actually depends on you using it, which is very hard when you can only ever get it to trigger by luck, and not by purpose. The B Button (Xbox360 Controller) could've been used in combat as a binary dodge button that would've worked a lot more effectively than the current system, which I can't even tell you because I don't fully understand how it works even after playing the game for 30+ hours. It's a problem but it doesn't ruin the experience, it just means you'll probably be chugging down more herbs than you should as a result of your inability to reliably dodge enemies.Some main aspects of the story also create some issues that can make the game seem out of place in the franchise. Revelations tries to insert some interesting plot into the gap between Resident Evil 4 and 5, but it seems unfitting. Some aspects like the city of Terragrigia don’t fit in with the time setting or the theme of the game. Every time I see the city it feels awkward to think this place is now a part of the Resident Evil Universe especially considering the conceived time it was supposedly erected in the world.The soundtrack of the game can be pretty forgettable. When thinking about what music or sounds there were that stuck out to me, I can only really think of one or two exceptions, the rest just slip from memory as barely noticeable ambience. Not to say the sound design is horrible, it's just not amazing either. It's ok, so-so, mediocre, acceptable.Some other notable mentions can include the side characters, Quint and Keith, who only really act as a comedy act that isn't very fun or very fun to play at all. Overall I would've preferred some more time with the main story instead of the two incapable BSAA agents. Enemy variety is also a bit missing. The only variety in the normal enemies generally comes from a shooter type that is quite annoying to deal with, and every now and then you might encounter an enemy with big claws, but it's generally pretty thin when you're not encountering any of the special enemies (B.O.Ws) but you won't really be dealing with enough of these enemies to warrant a large complaint.Revelations also comes with a small gimmick that takes up an entire controller button called the scanner, which is mainly used to deliver plot to you in an arbitrary manner and help you farm herbs from the enemies so you can deal with your broken dodge mechanic. It's implemented ok, but the lack of any real reason to use it without being forced questions the decision to put such a device in.One thing that really redeems this game out of a lot of its faults is Raid Mode. Raid Mode is a Single Player/Co-op mode where you will navigate different levels killing enemies in a more RPG style manner akin to borderlands or monster hunter. You'll get drops from the enemies and weapons that you can upgrade to take on the tougher levels and unlock new characters. The experience is quite addicting and playing it with friends can be fun, although one or two minor glitches can result that can cause some issues, like getting stuck behind a safe door or enemies sometimes desynchronizing from each other's matches which will result in confusion and most likely an unfair death. These bugs rarely occur though and the overall experience is really fun, but if you want to get the best out of it, I would suggest buying the game on a 3DS, as the time wasting abilities of this mode are good when you're on the go and have nothing to do.Revelations fills a good hole for those who are unable to find a decent resident evil game to suit their tastes. It's not the survival horror game that you want, but it comes pretty close and scratches that itch pretty well.Buy it, but if you're patient, wait for a sale. I wouldn't pay over £25-$40 for this game, but it's worth every cent up to that point. "

												I've come to learn that Resident Evil: Revelations is not a suitable introduction into the series. As someone unfamiliar with the franchise - apart from the films - there's the matter of being thrown between various timelines and characters with little exposition. Because of this I have almost no familiarity with each character's history or purpose throughout the game, so how can I be expected to care about their situation or understand the chemistry between each other when I don't understand their significance to the story? All I know is that Conan O'Brien's long lost brother, Raymond, makes several appearances.I did enjoy the game as whole but there were many issues I couldn't look past. For one, the disjointed story, as if inspired by the film Memento. The controls are quite sluggish; turning can be slow, as is aiming, even though the mouse sensitivity is comfortable for all other situations. Dodging may as well be avoided at all times, it's more of a gamble of whether it will or won't work. There's also the matter of an extremely tight and claustrophobic Field of View, please use a program called Widescreen Fixer to solve this as it works really well.The main missions consist of backtracking, being a semi-Metroidvania layout where further areas of the overworld will become unlocked over time, providing new additions and upgrades to the player's arsenal. The pacing is kept fresh as various secondary and tertiary characters will become playable in their own unique settings, serving to expand on the story, although each mission does not last long.It soon became clear that many enemy encounters are only difficult due to how claustrophobic the area can be, with its small rooms and corridors, rather than how menacing the enemies behave, and the difficulty is only increased further by the poor controls. An impending sense of doom that I'd once experienced with a game like this is soon lost after making the unexpected discovery where enemies would not continue chasing me through multiple areas. The boss battles can be difficult when ammunition becomes scarce, the way I adapted to this was to try avoiding all conflict with the basic enemies in order to conserve resources in preparation for the real battle ahead. As I mentioned earlier, enemies will not chase the player through closed doors.The most frustrating part of the game, story wise, is the amount of red herrings the writers threw my way. There are more twists here than found across M. Night Shyamalan's entire career, unfortunately none of them are as subtle.RE: Revelations really feels like some wasted potential, especially without local campaign co-op. The writing is poor and the enemies are more a nuisance than they are threatening. As this is my first impression of the series I must say I'm left unimpressed, it's pretty much on the borderline of a negative recommendation.			"

												A very good addition to the franchise and a very good game in general. I think the limitations of the original 3ds version holds this game back from being great because it is a limiting experience in a few areas like how it is very linear for example and a lack of interesting and detailed environments. Exploring the ship and looting each room is very enjoyable and the shooting is satisfying. The story was decent, very silly and cheesy at points making it hard to take it seriously at times but that is kind of resident evil tradition honestly. If it had more of an impact or if I was more emotionally invested or interested it might have made this game great. But for what the game offers, it is a very fun experience.  7/10 (Good)			"

												After Resident Evil 4 I had doubts that there will be a good RE game released. There was 5 which was medicore but enjoyable. Operation Raccoon city which is a big joke to me. Resident Evil 6 is enjoyable but not great either. RE Revelations finally delivered great experience after RE4. I recommend this game (dlc's are worthless but if you're collector, go ahead and get them). + Great story+ Improved gameplay+ Replayability Value (achievements, campaign and raid mode)+ Co-Op- Graphic's could be way better than direct port from 3DSWith clear heart, I'm waiting for RE Revelations 2 that has been announced last week.

Posted: November 22, 2014
												Very much a fun Resident Evil game, that harkens back to the slow exploration and unlocking of the older games. Played through it on 3DS and absolutely loved it enough to get the PC port. The control scheme and layout is very comfy, a nice mix of Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 6, without the annoying amount of QTEs. Those are thankfully absent here, besides a melee counter, and wiggle-to-free-yourself action.The graphics are very smooth and pleasing to look at, improved over its 3DS predecessor. Things like characters mouths not moving when speaking are nonexistant here, and the narmy voice acting is preserved. Little things remain however, like fps drop whenever you're moving from the grand hall to other locations, but that is probably the only time. The atmosphere and music is also a big step up from the newer Resident Evil titles. The dank, gooey, bloody tight halls and rooms of the Queen Zenobia are claustrophobic and the enemy design is unnerving at times (all about that first Scagdead). The ship is oppressive and very reminiscent of older Resident Evil locales, especially the Remake. Music is much more noticeable and a lot of themes stand out very well, especially the Main Hall and the final boss theme. However, the atmosphere and writing is where things get hit-or-miss. While the ship has fantastic atmosphere, the story itself jumps around to three pairs of characters, and as such the story is told in a linear fashion, with facts coming in from three different subplots, but the change in characters and locations can jar the mood and atmosphere a lot. Your mileage may definitely vary with the nonregular characters and their designs and voices. Another point of contention is the dodge mechanic, returned from Resident Evil 3, here implemented as a wonky directional press depending on certain timing, with no onscreen prompt. It won't be a problem if you play with a controller, as you can jiggle back and forth and pretty much nail it, but on keyboard and mouse, you'll be in for trouble.Another misstep that sullies the gameplay is the near constant presence of a partner character, that takes away a distinct amount of tension. It seems co-op was probably not added in time or something, because you'll almost always have an AI partner with you to chat with, which is a shame. The few times you go without, you will notice distinctly more tension, and the game could have benefited very much from drop-in/drop-out co-op similar to Dead Space 3's version of it.The enemies as well are very interesting, and have a neat and unique backdrop for their creation, but sadly do not have a lot of creativity. You will see a lot of the same 3 or 4 in waves later in the game, which gets repetitive. Even the return of the classic Resident Evil beasty the Hunters (including an invisible variant!), is somewhat neutered here, being easily killed, and due to the scrubbing of gore in the creation of the game, has their legendary leap-decap turned into an offscreen affair (and there are PLENTY of interesting seeming deaths that are way too clean for what they are). However, a recurring eerie mutant, and the final boss give a welcome boost of nostalgia and challenge. The game isn't perfect by far, but it is definitely a step in the right direction to being an enjoyable Resident Evil title, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. Even when you're done with the main story, Raid Mode can addict you to it very very easily, with just killing monsters, loads of weapons, as well as monster mutations, and playing co-op multiplayer with it can add even more.

Posted: October 24, 2014
												My personal relationship with the world-famous/infamous Resident Evil series has been a long and sometimes treacherous one.  The very first Resident Evil on the PlayStation 1 was nothing less than, well, a ""revelation"" to me when I first discovered it.  Having spent years prior basically disinterested in video games in favour of more ""respectable"" art/entertainment forms such as films, a funny thing happened on the way to the grave and I found myself no longer very ""scared"" by horror movies any more...a shame, since it has arguably been my single favourite of all genres since, well, at least my mid-teens or so.  Then I discovered that it was possible for a VIDEO GAME to have much the same effect, only perhaps more so...for in spite of the questionable graphics and clunky movement, it was officially now ME essaying the role of the lead protagonist in a horror story.  And that was a very scary proposition indeed!  The first time I discovered that giant shark in the mansion's basement...man, that was an epic moment...and the Resident Evil series was of course destined to become all the MORE epic, in time.  Though not necessarily in a GOOD way...    Resident Evil 2 took things to a SLIGHTLY more action-packed and, yes, ""epic"" level, but still managed to unquestionably maintain the horror credentials of its predecessor.  Resident Evil 3...well, it was still mostly favouring the fear over the fight, but with the first advent of a firearm-wielding monster, things were starting to veer just the teensiest, tiniest bit downhill.  Code Veronica thankfully steered things back toward a more staunchly horror-orientated direction shortly thereafter...but then of course came Resident Evil 4 (let's just ignore the Survivor/Dead Aim/Outbreak/etc games for the purposes of this review, since they honestly don't exist in the minds of most RE fans).  Yes, just when all seemed lost if the series were to indeed continue in the direction it was mostly heading in, RE4 managed to reinvigorate the waning faith of many a fan, not so much by taking the series in a less action-y direction, but by downright REINVENTING the gameplay in a way which better SUITED the increased amount of enemies and firepower and what-have-you.  And it managed to do so without compromising that all-important ""horror factor"" TOO much.      Which brings us to Resident Evil 5...sigh.  I mean, it wasn't that bad...at least until the utterly ridiculous rock-punching (!) climax set in a volcanic landscape, at which point those little hints of manga and anime which the series had harboured for so long took true hold and♥♥♥♥♥♥all over anything even vaguely resembling logic or atmosphere.  Its myriad sins seem pale in comparison, however, to part 6, which - from as much as I have been able to bear to play of it so far - appears to be a final declaration that the games which helped spawn a series of by-and-largely moronic MIlla Jovavich action movies were now SUBSERVIENT to said movie series, and it was officially a ""horror"" series no more.  Thankfully, however, the good people at Capcom saw fit shortly BEFORE this atrocity to give birth to a side-series which would better retain the ""survival horror"" flavour of the early games...    Resident Evil Revelations, please step forward for evaluation.    It's been described as ""Resident Evil 4.5"", and it can certainly lay claim to that title story-wise.  So what about...GAMEPLAY-wise?  Well...pretty much, yeah.  I'll admit I wasn't too impressed early on, finding myself essentially confused by all the episodic jumping back and forth between different characters in different places and what-not...which only served, incidentally, to compromise one of the single most important contributing factors to the tension generated in a successful ""survival horror"" game, namely that of ammo and/or healing conservation (that is to say, when you only have to make what few items you possess last until the end of one or two chapters, a good deal of this tension inevitably abates).  BUT...after a while the focus falls at least predominantly on the characters trapped out at sea, and it's in these segments that Revelations manages to capture some of that old-school ""isolation horror"" charm.     To some degree it's almost like the RE1 mansion set on a boat (well, three boats, but who's counting), with a bit of Tomb Raider-inspired swimming and butt-centric visuals - this is still aimed at young males, after all - to fill it all out.  But mostly, I gotta say...it's pretty good.  Not a TOTAL return to form - the AI is certainly about as♥♥♥♥♥♥as such things can get, including one bit where monsters were literally either walking or jumping straight past not ONE but TWO NPCs to get to my player-controlled character! - but it's about the best we can hope for for now, one suspects.  Though Revelations 2, horror of horrors, actually looks like a ♥♥♥♥ing SILENT HILL game in the screenshots!  So maybe there really is hope for this franchise after all.  It's pretty much like the film industry these days:  When in doubt, REBOOT.  It worked for the Batman movies, and it can work for the Resident Evil games.  We'll just have to wait and see, though, won't we? Verdict: 9/10.  (And speaking of Batman...you know that a video game series has been going on just a LITTLE TOO LONG when an otherwise perfectly straight ""rookie government agent"" character is designed with hair which makes him look like THE JOKER.  What, Leon's hair in RE4 wasn't over-stylish or impractical ENOUGH for you people?!  Saints preserve us...)			"

												Resident Evil Revelations or like I call it - ""REv"" is game ported from 3DS. It's an attempt to ""go back to the roots"" and quite successful too. It takes place between RE4 and RE5 at the times when BSAA was just recently formed. You're stuck on almost ghost-like ship fighting for your survival. The game offers actual moments of horror, eerie atmosphere, various ship locations, wacky story... all this makes the game closer to oldschool REs.I'll list all pros and cons I can think of (alphabetical order).Pros:-AI. Sometimes you'll have a partner with you. They're quite independent and won't ruin your game (*cough* RE5,6 *cough).-Characters. Jill and Chris are back and there are completely new characters as well.-Customizable weapons. You can add special attachments to your guns. They will alter/change your gun behavior.-Enemies. Ooze enemies can give you the chills. They look and move weird (Regenerator/Iron Maiden style), there are plenty of variations of them. Also Hunters. Yes, the hunters are back.-Inventory. You can carry 3 weapons at a time and do not have to worry about any item slots at all. There are ammo limits, but the inventory is made is simple as possible.-Raid Mode. It's a really big part of a game. Can be compared to The Mercenaries. The goal is to simply survive while moving through few areas of the ship. There are 20 levels and 3 difficulties. Each difficulty has it's own monsters in different places. It has RPG elements and for hardcore gamers there's 1 huge levels which covers most of the ship.-Soundtrack. There are actually a bunch of memorable audio tracks!-Statistics. You can use Residentevil.net to check advanced stats.-Story. It's wacky, but it's quite well presented.-Survival horror. This game actually includes it.-Unlockables. Free items can be unlocked by spending points (which you can earn in different ways (no pay to win)).Cons:-Characters. Some new characters are wacky/have wacky voice acting. Can be fixed by switching to Japanese audio.-Co-op. You can't play the main story in co-op. That's not exactly a con, but worth mentioning. Because it's pretty known that survival horror games should not be played in co-op.-Controls. They're quite tanky (especially when compared to RE6), however... you can counter/dodge (just like in RE3) and there's no real need to jump around.-DCLs. There are unique weapon and special character DLCs.-Enemies. The bosses sometimes come with other enemies which might get in your way.-Graphics. This is a port. There are improvements, but it's not exactly Ultra HD.-QTEs. When it comes to mechanics - just like any 3D RE there's a little bit of them... BUT... even less than in RE4.Considering that I usually forgot about something feel free to post in the comments about things I forgot about.Right now REv is my favorite 3D RE game.			"

												Great Game!!!  Has an old RE feel but the plot was too busy and unfullfilling.  Possibly the best setting in an RE game since part 1.Pros-Superb Setting-Fun Guns (with upgrades)-Old RE Feel-Hunters-Jill Valentine in a wet suit ;)Cons-Plot felt overthought and fragmented-Hunters were too jittery and not strong enough leaving them not very intimidating/scary.

												Clearly it is not a RE as the old school RE game, which has been happening since RE4. It's an interesting game, in some ways more than RE4, 5 and 6 combined. The story leaves much to be desired, but the gameplay is decent. It has its moments of suspense as the old RE, but that is not enough. Visually its quite inferior compared with the predecessors, but for being a port of handheld its not bad. The raid mode is very entertaining and addictive.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations is a third-person survival horror game. To many this may come as a surprise because Resident Evil 5 and 6 pretty much abandoned the survival horror aspect of the series. Revelations though takes inspirations from the newer titles while staying a true Resident Evil game at its core.For the most part of the game you are playing as Jill Valentine who is accompanied by her new partner Parker. However, for a majority of the game the action alternates between three teams: Jill Valentine and Parker Luciani, Chris Redfield and Jessica Sherawat as well as Keith “Grinder” Lumley and Quint Cetcham who are basically Cool Guy and Comic Relief Guy. This might sound as if I would not like the characters but they are actually pretty enjoyable.The plot takes place between Resident Evil 5 & 6. One year before the futuristic floating city of Terragrigia had been attacked by the terrorist organization Il Veltro. Veltro had released the new T-Abyss Virus as well as several packs of hunters, ultimately leading to the FBC using Terragrigria’s solar energy satellite to completely destroy the city in order to stop the spread of the virus. After the Terragrigia incident Veltro had completely vanished.Jill and Parker learn that Chris went missing during an investigation and set out to rescue him. Chris’ signal has been lost somewhere over the Mediterranean, not too far from the ruins of Terragrigia. Jill and Parker find the cruise ship Queen Zenobia that had been used by Veltro during the attack on Terragrigia and had not been seen since.Resident Evil is played in a third-person shoulder perspective like most entries in the series since Resident Evil 4. The camera is zoomed out a bit more though. The controls are slightly different from RE 4 and 5. You are able to strafe and to shoot while walking. Generally the player movement feels a tad faster than in previous Resident Evil games. Some of the enemies are pretty fast too.  Resident Evil Revelations also re-introduces the dodge move from RE 3. You can dodge pretty much anything if you time it right. Depending on the enemy it can be quite hard but it is always removing when you dodge successfully.The inventory system is streamlined compared to previous games. You have three weapon slots and can carry up to five herbs as well a fixed number of every type of grenades. It is a strange choice to remove every form of inventory management from a Resident Evil game and I have to say that I probably liked the way it was handled in RE 4 best. While the inventory system in Revelations is clearly not my favorite it does not hurt the game much.Weapons can be swapped and upgraded at boxes that are found on the Queen Zenobia. There are a lot of weapons to find or unlock. Most of them are not flat out better or worse than other. They all have their upsides and downsides. The upgrading system works differently from the previous games. Instead of spending money to apply fixed upgrades to your weapon you can find weapon attachments, most of which can be applied to any weapon. Every weapon has a certain number of upgrade slots. Upgrades can be switched or removed at the same boxes where you can swap your weapons. The system works pretty well but there is one thing I do not like about it. Personally I like to have all my weapons upgraded and ready for use. However since you will not have enough upgrade kits to put in every weapon you would like to use you will – at least in the beginning – be forced to swap upgrades when changing weapons, which is an unfortunate interruption to the gameplay.A completely new addition to the series is the Genesis. The Genesis is a scanner that is able to find hidden objects and enemies. While you are using the Genesis the game changes to a first person perspective. You can still move slowly but you cannot fight while using the device. Frequent use of the Genesis is highly recommended since you can find loads of ammo, upgrade kits and healing items with it.The thing I like most about Resident Evil Revelations is that it nails the atmosphere. While there are some changes to the Resident Evil formula Revelation has everything a good RE title needs: claustrophobic environments, hilarious puzzles and scary enemies. The plot is told in the style of a TV show and there are frequent recaps, which works fairly well. It reminded me of Alan Wake to a certain degree. The story has a lot of twists and while I think that the developers overdid it at times some of the twists were executed beautifully. Especially the “Semiramis” twist left my staring at the screen with my mouth open.The thing I like least about Revelations is how the developers handled the AI partners. The damage they deal is unbelievably low. Here is an example: At a point where I was able to kill basic enemies with two close range shotgun hits I shot an enemy once. After that my partner shot the same enemy four of five times. With a shotgun. At close range. However, the enemy still was not dead. That is how low the AI damage is. You should never trust the AI to handle anything on their own. Their damage is just sad and most of the time they cannot even tank because enemies mostly ignore them. At least the AI partners cannot die, so that is a plus.Aside from the campaign Resident Evil Revelations also offers Raid Mode which basically is the Resident Evil version of a dungeon grinder. There is a bunch of characters to choose from, all with their respective strengths. You can then choose a stage that is heavily inspired by a part of the single-player campaign. Your mission is always to get to the end and if possible kill all enemies. On your way you level up and get items drops that can either be weapons or upgrade kits. There is a surprisingly high amount of content here. It is also possible to play Raid mode in online-co-op. While I have some minor complaints about Resident Evil Revelations I think that it is a really good game. It tries out new stuff without abandoning what makes Resident Evil… well…  Resident Evil. I highly recommend it to veterans and newcomers alike.More reviews here "

The first time I played this game, I knew this game by heart because well, I own this on 3DS but then it ported to HD console, the version on PC is so much easier because of the aiming control (with the mouse) makes so much easier for you to aim and shoot. What's really amazing is that the game runs SMOOTHLY and it feels real... I love it.. I trutly recommend this to anyone who like and WANT to aim easily, especially with the mouse support, GET THIS! :)....			"

												Resident revelations is a decent game, but more worthy because of the Raid mode. Story: Mweh. It's bland. The voice acting is average, dialogue cringeworthy at times, the characters are not memorable or are even annoying. There are also a couple of missions I find quite boring. Hope you also like waterlevels. Gameplay: The scanning is actually a nice touch. I do find myself going through the rooms looking for items. I also enjoy collecting parts and weapons. The controls are also not bad to handle, only the dodging mechanic is a bit wobbly as it won't always dodge. Atmosphere:It lacked tension. Running through the halls didn't put you on edge. Only one route to a boss has you slow down and approach it more carefully.Monsters and bosses:They all look like plastic to me. Not scary at all and bad design.  But there were two bosses that actually had me on edge. Raid mode: This is the mode you will spend most time on. It's a lot of fun playing solo or in coop. Quite challenging as well. You have a lot of leveling to do, weapons and parts to collect and you keep on upgrading your character while trying to achieve a flawless run. I bought the game for pc to coop (had it on ps3 as well) and still enjoy it. In short: Campaign is worthy for one run, or maybe another run on the highest difficulty if you are up to the challenge. Then move straight to raid mode and get ready for the Ghost ship.			"

												Well i played this title right after RE6. so wanna compare it to that game which most ppl call ""action"" more than ""survival horror"". This one has many better things than RE6 and is more like the old RE games that we all used to play when we were young. so here we have a rich and deep story with a ridiculously happy ending. we have the classic RE specs which most locations are connected to eachother and instead of A to B thing that RE6 is all about....its some kind of openworld to me as u can go back to previous locations and experience new things. like oldschool ones, u have to collect items, solve puzzles and the most important one....open doors :Dother thing is that u cant slide or run like the way u do in RE6. the result is that it takes more effort to kill bosses and u have to dodge which is harder than RE6 counter-attacking as it has no indicator when to press key.and one bad thing......zombies are almost the same. if u ignore 4-5 bosses, other enemies are not that much different.another con....no chapter selection. although u have some slots which u can save on when u end each chapter.and last one....i wish enemies in raid mode had random spawn points. that way it could be waaaay more challenging. anyway, that raid mod ROCKS!btw, i think this game is much better than RE6-singleplayer. more classic more pure and better story so i doubt u can stop playing campaign before reaching the end.wish it had gore and also RE6 multiplayer modes (which are its strongest point) too.UPDATE: after almost 250 hours of gameplay, the game still has more things (parts and weapons) to show up in raid mode. so still im playing :D			"

												Resident Evil Revelations is an old school blockbuster like I didn’t think it was possible for anyone to make anymore. It somehow feels completely divorced from how big publisher games are supposed to be made today. It probably has to do with its heritage as a 3DS title. Everything about Revelations feels old school, in the style of Capcom from the late 90s and early 2000s.Whether you like this game or not will depend entirely on your affinity for the older Resident Evil titles. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve finished Resident Evil 1, and Resident Evil 4 is just a masterpiece, especially on Gamecube with its superior controller. Revelations combines elements of both of them. For some reason the ship you spend the majority of the game on has an interior that seems almost modeled after the Resident Evil 1 mansion, and larger encounters copy the arena style combat of Resident Evil 4 to great effect. I don’t think there’s any game out there which can make you feel as panicky as Resident Evil 4 & 5 when you’re running away from a mob, trying to find a good spot to deal with the masses. Revelations brought those feelings back.Every imaginable Resident Evil trope is present here. There’s a sci-fi lab near the end, there’s a guy in a helicopter throwing you a rocket launcher to help you fight a boss, there’s a self destruct sequence with a timer ticking down. And it all works. Even the music sounds like proper Resident Evil. It’s a synth orchestra for the majority of the soundtrack, but it tries its best to be as epic as it can. It even has opera singers, exactly in the style of Resident Evil 2.I had a great time with this game. It put a big smile on my face, and reminded me of why I like this silly franchise so much. If you don’t give a crap about Resident Evil then you will probably not have as good of a time as I did. But if you’ve played a bunch of the games in the series and enjoyed them, then this is a must play.A final note, the demo is terrible. It’s the opening 15-20 minutes of the game, which are by far the weakest. The second after the demo ends is when the game gets good, and unfortunately they didn’t include any of that in the demo. I got the game because every RE fan who had played it kept going on about how good it was. And they were right.			"

												UPDATE Dec. 2016 - Still holds up as one of my favorite REs. Definitely worth a play.This game is fantastic.It takes the Resident Evil series back to the days of survival horror! Don't get me wrong though- this game does have some action elements (and they are very well implemented), but much of your time is spent cautiously navigating forboding environments and scavenging for supplies along the way. Yes, you can actually run short on ammo and health in this RE entry!Graphics: The game looks great, although some might scoff at a few muddy textures (keep in mind this is a 3DS port).Sound: The sound design is stellar- great ambiance, sound effects, and grand orchestral soundtrack. Some tracks really get stuck in your head! The voice acting is pretty good and might sound cheesy at times, but that's the charm of RE!Story: The story is nice and complex- you won't get it if you bluff through the whole game without reading any side-notes.Gameplay: The combat is unbelievably fun and satisfying. Dodging seems absurd at first, but it becomes very fun once you get the hang of it. There's even a Raid Mode for the combat-hungry fans!Replayability: This game is very fun to replay- if you're looking for a hard challenge, try Infernal Mode on NG+. If you're looking for a satanic challenge, try Infernal Mode on a new save. Everything is remixed and amped up A LOT in difficulty. New scares, new surprises, you get the idea. Want a very stressful survival horror experience? Try Infernal.Long story short, get this game if you like a nicely done survival horror. You won't regret it!My rating: 9/10PS: In case anyone was wondering, this game is pretty creepy. No, it doesn't rely on cheap jump-scares (I think there was only one or two throughout the whole campaign) but rather works on building a fantastic atmosphere. Sometimes, the sense of dread can be overwhelming, especially on Infernal Mode.			"

												This game is - in a rather unexpected way - one of the best RE games out there.I got interested in the RE series again this May. I was interested before, but life happened, and I kind of forgot about RE. So yeah, I'm a huge fan of the series. I saw this at the mall, so I decided to buy it.Well... WOW. This game is a blast.After the incredible disappointments that were ORC and RE6 which were released the same year, I thought that the RE series would only go downhill. But then I played this game. And it rocks.The gameplay is basically the same as RE6, but instead of being more action based, it's actually scary. Yeah, you hear that? SCARY. Capcom decided to stop ♥♥♥♥ing around, making the game feel more horror based than action based, which is stunning. The atmosphere is fantastic and Queen Zenobia is one of the most interesting settings for a RE game. Capcom finally heard what the fans wanted and they delivered perfectly. The plot is great too. The characters are all memorable, the whole Terragrigia backstory is pretty interesting and it's pretty nice to have Jill back.Another thing I really like is the way the chapters work. Every chapter contains 3 sub chapters as I call them (there are exceptions of course). The first sub chapter describes the main events of the game with Jill and Parker and the rest may either continue directly what happened with those two or describe a different POV of what happened or a flashback. I find this idea to be mildly interesting and it's done pretty well in this game.However, this game is not perfect, and it has a lot of issues. First of all, some of the enemies and the bosses you fight are ultra cheap. What I mean is that if you don't avoid these enemies (which is pretty hard by itself), they will kill you instantly with one hit. That is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I know it doesn't happen too often, but it's still a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥The raid mode is also pretty addicting and it feels very different than any other generic TPS multiplayer mode of most games nowadays. Should you buy this game?   Yes. It's one of the best RE games out there and this game puts the other RE games that came out that year to shame. Fans will love this game, no matter how die-hard of a fan you are. It's proof that a RE game doesn't have to be centered around zombies or Raccoon City to be great. I utterly recommend this game. Go play it now. You won't regret it.			"

												For a 3DS port the game actually feels a lot better compared to RE5 and RE6. It has more of a RE4 feel with the survival elements of the previous games somewhat.

												Revelations is a solid sort of return to form in a series that's been going downhill for some time. It's a mix of the classic style RE games and the action of RE4 in the sense that while it’s still more actiony compared to the old games it tends to share elements like the pacing and confined areas. While it has its flaws, I think it works well enough and plays a lot better than RE5, which was a mess. Revelations isn't really scary but the game never acts like it is, it’s like RE4 in that the team knew the game is like a cheesy actiony B horror movie and they ran with it (Though not nearly as much as RE4 did) As a fan of both RE4 (One of my favorite games) and the classic series I think Rev is a nice installment in the series and hopefully Revelations 2 can continue in keeping the series afloat.

												Resident Evil Revelations is only different from other modern iterations of the Resident Evil franchise in that you occasionally get to spend time navigating the cramped corridors of a large ship in the middle of a sea. It can't help but throw you into action heavy sequences and constantly change who you play as that effectively breaks up any immersion you may start feeling as Jill, who is utterly isolated for a majority of the game. Overall it's a rather easy game even on the hardest difficulty. The Raid mode, a separate game mode that lets you play through the stages of the game to gain levels, find items and earn money to help you in progressing to the later levels. Repetitive, but fun enough. The DLC mostly just unlocks new gear for Raid mode, but isn't at all necessary to progress. I'd recommend the game if you can find it heavily on sale.			"

												General: A great Spin-off. It has that Survival Horror, but not what you think, more like Action-Horror Game.Coming this game from 3DS (And also played there) is so good, was a great purcharse for PC.Graphics: 7/10 It's kinda PS2 HD Graphics, but looks alright.Sound: 8/10Better than others RE, for me is Good. Soundtrack in tense moment catched me and felt quite terrified, hahaha. History: 7-6/10Clitché in some part, but what can i expect from a spin-off quickly made for 3DS. Gameplay: 8/10I have to say: THE GENESIS IT'S A PAIN IN THE BUTT. After that it's enjoyable, ported so well on Mouse/KeyboardDifficulty on this game is really well maded, but searching ammo and scanning♥♥♥♥♥♥with the GENESIS all the time pisses me off. Final Score 7			"

												Good edition to the series, and the new characters aren't all that bad. The scenary gets a little too repetitious for my taste, but it's better than RE 6 IMO. Worth the cash, but don't waste your money on the DLC items as they aren't necessary to have a fun time playing the game.			"

Resident Evil Revelations Unveiled Edition Review, made by ReaperResident Evil Revelations is a Japanese game made by Capcom, that was first released on January 26, 2012 in Japan, initially for the Nintendo 3DS, and later on was ported over other platforms under the title of 'Unveiled Edition', first released on May 21, 2013 in North America.The game is a return of the series in a classic survival horror style of gameplay, with returning characters and new ones.But is the game is really that worth buying? Well, as a long-time fan of the series, this review is here to aid you on it.Setting and PlotThe game takes place between Resident Evil 4 and 5 (2005), and it fits perfectly in my opinion. Kinda explains certain things that were not made so clear in RE5.The plot can be a little cheesy at times, but it's great, and at the same time confusing. To help the player on certain plot elements, the game has this ""TV series style"" catch up everytime you start/load a chapter.LocationsThe game takes place on three core locations. The Queen Zenobia luxury cruiser ship, the Valkoinen Mökki Airport and it's surrounding mountains/caves, and the floating city of Terragrigia.The main location of the game, where most of the gameplay takes place is truly amazing.The Queen Zenobia has this feeling into it that I haven't experienced for a long time in the series.Since the ship's designs were based on blueprints left by George Trevor before he ended up disappearing, some areas of the ship are reminiscent to certain areas of the Spencer Mansion, the location where the events of the first game of the series, and it's remake, takes place.It seems at first as a ghost ship. Where danger can be at every corner. For the first time ever in Resident Evil games, I've never been so scared of going into a particular room since RE2.And since certain parts of the ship feel like the Mansion, it helps a lot.The Valkoinen Mökki Airport and it's surrounding mountains/caves is quite interesting.The snowy areas seems too similar to the ones found in RE6, but that's about it.The floating city of Terragrigia is just not that good.But it serves it's point as a plot filling area.CharactersFor the first time ever in the Resident Evil series, the player will be likely taking control of multiple characters through the game's storyline.Most of these characters are really cool, but a few of them are just plot filling. Each of them feel kinda unique when you play as them.Gameplay ElementsThe game play-style is quite similar to that of RE4/RE5. Similar control scheme, but now you're able to walk while aiming/shooting/attacking.But it's too limited sometimes. While playing the game I wish I could kick through the doors, or slowly open a door, not doing the ""opening and going through the door"" animation.And there's no button used for running, instead it's all made with the analog stick, which is pretty bad.The lack of having a laser-sight aiming for the guns also bothers me.The crosshair isn't that much precise and reliable, since when you shoot a bullet in that style of game, the trajectory of it goes from where the gun is pointing at, not the crosshair.The laser sight aiming from RE4/RE5 makes up for that, because at least you have a reliable way of showing where your bullets are going to hit.And sadly, when making the port, Capcom removed both alternate versions of aiming in first person and laser sight, and kept only the crosshair.The game also gives you lot of different guns to choose from, and an inventory menu that shows the files you find, area map, key items, etc is back.But it's not perfect in my opinion.There's little to no inventory management at all. You only get to change the weapon slots.Key items do not take inventory space, neither does any ammo you find or herbs. But you do have a limit of how many ammo/herbs you can carry.Any sorts of grenades also don't take place.They also brought back the shop system of RE4/RE5. But only partially.It's not that great overall. You get to find custom parts for the weapons and then place them on the guns you have.You can remove the tuning parts any time you want, and place them back as well. Which is quite broken in my opinion.Due this weird tuning system, the guns no longer have ""realistic"" ammo magazine size, unlike the classic games.The shop is likely mostly made for Raid mode though.Another broken aspect is the ability to save and continues.You can't manually save your game, there's only auto-save checkpoints during the gameplay.Only manual save that exists is when you are at the results screen of a chapter.The were times I was playing, but I wanted to stop for a while and do something else, but the game wouldn't allow me to or ""I'd lose my progress"".I really wish the typewriter system was brought back. Even if it was just like RE4, with no ink ribbon limit.And the game has a continue option after you die. Which is pretty cheap and broken I might add, since this is a survival horror game.The level design is amazing. And yes, backtracking from older RE games was brought back, which I love it.But stills kinda bad in my opinion. The game always has a ""mission objective"" set all times during the pause menu, which kinda ruins the fun.The game tells you what you gotta do, unlike classic games, where the game lets the player decide the order of things that needs to be done.But there's barely no loading times, save for here and there, instead the whole are is accessible.The doors really connect to the other room, which makes it a lot better than the classic games, since there's no loading times between them, you can't use an exploit to reset the enemy positions.The enemies are amazing as well, so are the bosses. They're unpredictable in a way of attacks and movement.Their designs are also creepy looking and the sort of thing you would totally shoot if you spot one of 'em.Players can die pretty easily to the weakest enemies if they are not careful.And enemy placement is randomized and/or dynamic, kinda like RE3.The puzzles are quite meh, nothing really hard to it.They're quite easy and time consuming most of time.Item placement is quite scarce as well. If you get a herb, it never re-spawns.But it's just meh as well, due the Genesis Scanner mechanic. You can get ammo most of the time by scanning an area, and always be able to get an herb by scanning enemies.And unlike past games, there's only one type of herb. No combinations.The game doesn't feature a life status as well.Unlike past games where your life would show on HUD as a bar (RE4/RE5), or in the inventory menu as a status (Classic RE games), it's not shown at all.You can tell how much health you have left by the screen showing blood splatters on the sides, and the colouring of the game going into a black-and-white sorta of filter.And movement isn't affected by health status.The game is divided by chapters just like RE4/RE5. But there's no chapter select screen like RE5.Due that, the game has way too many cut-scenes sometimes (kinda like MGS games if you as me), which is pretty bad.And there's the subtle changes of game location/player character through the story, where it turns into a big shoot-out through enemies.It's kinda cool like, for taking a break of the survival horror thing, but it's done way too often.Raid Mode is a really fun extra gamemode, it reminds me of the Extreme Battle mode of RE2.But that's it. It's the only available extra gamemode, besides New Game+ for campaign.No Mercenaries, no gamemodes that changes the story (i.e. Invisible Enemy mode), no co-op story, no alternate/side story (i.e. Separate Ways), no nothing.ConclusionIt's a pretty decent game, but it can have it's flaws here and there.My final score for this game is 7.2 out of 10.It's worth buying if you want to play something different.

												This is honestly one of my Favorite Games Ever, and the game that got me into the Resident Evil series (i played RE2 back in the day, but never liked it as much as i like this). The story Isn't Terrible, which places it above a lot of games, and i really enjoy the sort of deliberately unrealistic and colorful characters that the series is known for-- it's preposterous, but on purpose, so i like it. Jessica thought the Mediterranean was a lake, your boss is Columbo, the obvious traitor is obvious, the Dante-quoting terrorist is the guy from Breaking Bad, Rachael is ON THE SCENE, everything is Italian for no apparent reason, the women are all going commando (in every sense), and Chris has the personality of a block of wood but gosh darn it i like him anyway. It's Big Fun and i love it. And i haven't even mentioned the Raid Mode yet, which exists alongside the story mode, almost as an entirely separate game......And it is by god the most capital-f Fun i've had with a game in years. If you like DOOM or Serious Sam-style shooters that are defined by matching the correct weapon against a varied set of visually distinct enemies, always prioritizing the most dangerous thing in the room, then this is precisely for you. Raid Mode in this game is a huge, sprawling thing filled with probably way too much gameplay, and frankly i'm still not really sick of it after more than a year. The challenge is just Exactly Right, and while there's admittedly a bit of grinding involved, beating the ultra-tough Ghost Ship is the rare achievement in video games that's actually worth doing. At first it seems literally impossible, but eventually you own it, Dark Souls-style, and the comparison is a fair one.Atmospheric, endlessly replayable, good Achievements, sexy people, addictive Raid Mode, and just flat-out FUN-- it's the best, i tell you. A millon out of ten. PS: the camera is zoomed in way too much, so download Widescreen Fixer and set the FOV to about 75 and you're good to go-- it's a super easy fix and makes it way more playable.

												(It may not show me having a lot of play time, but I played the 3DS version for 10+ hours, completing it and then some.)If you like the older, more horror-oriented Resident Evil games, then you're going to enjoy this title.If you like the newer, more actiony Resident Evil games, then you're going to enjoy this title.Revelations is the perfect marriage between the gameplay styles found in Resident Evil 1 and Resident Evil 4. It meets in a great middle ground.There's a tense atmosphere, a great story, and some chills to be had. The camera isn't fixed, but the ship is almost like a floating mansion. The puzzles aren't difficult, but there are a few here and there. You can actually aim your gun, but you won't find mountains of ammo sitting around.The new enemy types are interesting and varied enough to carry through until the end.The graphics are also pretty, but that's a secondary concern to me.I'm not sure this release is worth $50, but I picked it up for $9 and I have no regrets. Wait for a sale.			"

												Since RE6 ♥♥♥♥ed up things pretty badly (AND DON'T YOU DARE TO SAY NO), as a old school (since RE1) Resident Evil fan I can say. They ♥♥♥♥ing did it. Capcom made the best Resident Evil game since RE4 (RE5 was also good-ish). Revelations is kinda back to the roots Resident game, yes there are also action packed episodes, but overall game defends itself by giving you, the player - a solid story, B+ gameplay (since it is a 3ds port), good old resident evil feelings, and boobs and skimpy outfits.And zombiefied boobs, half-destroyed even more skimpier outfits.......Final score for the best Resident Evil since RE4 is!7/10!/someone pokes DeturisDeturis: What?!Subconscious: Zombiefied boobs bro!Deturis: 8/10 then!Seriously tho, 8/10Go buy this game instead of that ""wanna be shooter gallery"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t aka Resident Evil 6.

												For as long as I can remember, I have always loved Resident Evil. I remember my heli crashing and being locked in a church with dogs coming at me all the way back on the PS1. Rather it be movie or videogame based, the experience has always been enjoyable.As for Revalations itself, the game and story was great.Gameplay wise, everything felt smooth. Framerate was great, even when playing on my laptop. I could record with no issues at all, no lag or frame drop at all. The controls were set ideally for a PC gamer unlike Resident Evil 6 where you need to hit left control, shift, and S to do a roll. Looking more in depth, there was an ample amount of different weapons to use and an interesting ""weapon mod system."" As always, Mercenaries makes a return and is actually pretty fun due to the new weapon system, the 20 or so characters you can pick from, the 50 maps, and once again how smooth it runs.The story was good and fairly different from my experience even after Resident Evil 6. There were twists and turns and I did not expect anything that happened, it was a nice change in pace. The only two complaints are: 1. Once I got into the story and how to play the game, I flew through the story in nearly 6 hours.2. The opening of certain doors causes major frame drop.The only thing I could ask for is some campaign extensions, or another game soon.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations is a solid port of a 3DS game. The graphics look acceptable; there are some muddy textures on doors, but that is not a bad thing given that it is a port. Controls are a bit awkward, but that is due to game play mechanics. Game play wise, this game plays like Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5. The notable difference is that in this game, the player can move and shoot which is a welcomed change. The best aspect of this game is the game play. Fans of Resident Evil will like this game. The enemies are disgusting looking and the game aims for a classic Resident Evil type of feel. Unlike RE4 and RE5 alternative game mode, Mercenaries, Revelations has a new mode called Raid Mode. Raid Mode is fun, but to can become a grind fest. Raid Mode puts the player in certain maps from the main game with an objective. The objective can be get from A to B or eliminate enemies. Enemies health bars are visible and when the player shoots the enemy, numbers pop out. There are different weapons and upgrades to get in this mode that are necessary to progress and prepare player for the difficult bonus stage. To remedy the monotonous grinding, Raid Mode can be played online with another player. Overall, Resident Evil Revelations a solid port and game that fans of the series most likely will like.			"

												I enjoyed this title, for the most part.First off, this is a port. It's a damn fine port. It runs like butter on my Radeon HD 7770 and 2.9 ghz x4. Only bit of performance issues is the loading of areas, but that never interfered with the gameplay.Though the environment was kind of small in the overall scheme of the game, it was charming and I grew fond of it.Gameplay wise, it was quite good. It never felt samey. There were sequences that defied the usual combat of the game (I won't spoil it), which were arcady and they were arcady in a GOOD way. My only complaint is the final boss fight was a huge spike in difficulty. The story was interesting. I think you may want to have at least a basic familiarity with Resident Evil in order to get what's going on, though you don't need to have that understanding in order to enjoy the game. Overall, this is a FUN game. I didn't have to drag myself through the game just to get my money's worth. The pacing was perfect.			"

												A spin-off of the main series of the Biohazard/Resident Evil franchise, Biohazard Revelations expands the lore of the core series and offers a good challenge to players. Set between the events of Biohazard 4 and 5, the player controls Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield and a cast of new, interesting characters, trying to gather information to bring down a bioterrorist organization known as Il Veltro. The player should expect plot twists, of course, as we're dealing with a Biohard game over here.Graphics are A-OK, with good character and environmental modeling and nice special effects. Great voice acting (well, at least the original, Japanese voice acting is excellent), sound effects and good soundtrack comprise the sound department. Controls are pretty much the same as Biohazard 4, with an over-the-shoulder third person view and good input response. Sadly, the horror, which made the franchise so famous in first place, is nowhere to be found. The game has its moments, and the relative lack of ammunition, herbs and other items scattered across the different places that the player gets to explore makes things a little bit harder, requiring strategic use of such itens and good reflexes in order to dodge enemies and run away safely, but, in the end, it still is an action-oriented game, much like Biohazard 5.Biohazard Revelations may not be a real classic like the three first iterations of the series, but it is a very fun game anyway, and its difficulty and secrets may keep the player busy for quite a while. A must-buy! - 9/10			"

It's pretty hard when playing those missions single. Might get a bit boring after a while cause you keep walking around at the same places over and over again (at least in my case). Ofcourse new locations are added each time but it's just running around back to where you came from. But new things keep coming so that will keep your attention up. Really recommended.			"

												If you've played this game to death on the 3DS, there is still a ton of game here. New characters for Raid mode (including Jessica) awesome visuals, superb controls, and overall just an awesome game. This is easily one of the best RE games to date, and stands up to the best of them (In my opinion RE2/4). I purchased the complete pack for 14 bucks via 2014 holiday sale, however the regular price is still very much worth the buy. All the DLC, the campaign, new game plus, and while i've literally only played for 15 min so far i can easily say this is far better than I had exected. I jammed on a raid mode game and have not played the campaign at the time of this review, but what I did play was still fun. Jessica is a beast in bother her regular human outfit and her enhanced skill sets that she has as the ooze (enhanced melee, regenerative health, etc) which even this small addition is awesome. Characters have differences. This is what the game should be.PC MASTER RACE!			"

												Resident Evil Revelations is mostly based on a cruise ship that becomes a watery grave that no one swims away from.And that is why I like this game. It's not like your other typical RE games that are mainly in a know-it's-for-sure-it's-this environment. The main storyline mostly focuses on this ship, though there are instances where the attention is shifted to other areas that are not related to this ship.Capcom has done well in making this game enjoyable. OST that are slow and gloomy which subtly fits into a dead-sea, and I think, have built enough attention onto this ship that has not lost it's main focus on.Glad that I bought this :)			"

												From a non Resi fan: Revelations is great!OK so I don't like the series on the whole. Kinda liked the Alone In The Dark adventure game roots of the first game, and the more natural controls that came with 4 (and the creepy atmosphere in the slower, early parts of both games)... and that's about it. I heard the two revelations games felt like a return to Resi roots so I decided to give this a try.I loved it! What you've got here is some very light puzzling that recalls the earliest Resi, and straightforward but challenging combat with controls that improve on the changes 4 brought to the series, while ditching some of its annoyances. To my delight, there is no inventory tetris and weapon upgrades can be removed and reused on later weapons. The scanner is a pretty nice touch, and combined with the setting reminds me of an old Dreamcast Resi clone called Carrier (this is much better ;P ).The story is the usual Resi nonsense (had no expectations here; wasn't disappointed). I'm a huge horror fan, but this ain't it, it's just monster schlock with a few jump scares. Having said that, some of the combat and action sequences really do ramp up the tension in a satisfying way. Chris and Jill are totally bland, but it was a nice surprise to find some of the supporting characters quite likable and entertaining. And, considering its 3DS origin, the game looks really good too (and works in 3D - more on this below*). The episodic structure really works; the pacing is good, the occasional, brief changes to different characters and locations keep things lively, and it helps with the mundane task of fitting a bit of gaming into the inconvenience of Real Life. My only (minor) gripes with the gameplay are that the puzzling elements and scanner could have been developed into something a lot more interesting, and the final boss was poor (but even the best games fail that test).Another nice surprise: the UI, options and keyboard & mouse controls are great. The menus aren't exactly what I was used to but are smartly designed and work really well during play. There's a 30, 60 or uncapped frame rate option**, which is fantastic. The mouselook felt a bit odd at first (bit of inertia) but I got used to it in no time. Overall a much better PC version than I'm used to when it comes to big-name, primarily console titles.All in all, my favourite Resident Evil so far. I'd say it's worth the full price (campaign is 9+hrs) and a bargain on sale. On to Revelations 2!* I played in Nvidia 3D Vision with Helixmod fix applied, on default settings. I thought it looked great with negligible issues (eg markers on your map at wrong depth; nothing during gameplay). Note, crosshair is switched off by default, enable it each time you run the game (I used F11. Read the instructions!)http://helixmod.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/resident-evil-revelations.html** I played at fixed 60fps, but it forgot this setting and I had to reset it each time I ran the game. Check your options before you start. All other settings saved fine.			"

												This reminds me alot of the PSX Resident Evil games, where there is a nice mix of action and puzzle solving to move towards your objecive. The story is a step above the psx classics, due to some interesting twists in the plot.I'm playing these in order, so I previously finished Resident Evil 4 and the next one I'll tackle is Resident Evil 5.Revelations has the AI Co-oP buddy system used from Resident Evil 5, Its not 100% helpful but it assists when it can. Its not perfect, but it helps. Thankfully its not needed for the most crucial of moments that can break a game, all because the AI Co-op partner was lacking to assist.Since this is a HD remake of a Nintendo 3DS title, many say the graphics are low/2004-ish. It does the job well and did'nt annoy me at all while playing it.To buy or avoid?If you like Resident Evil, you'll probably already have thisIf you are starting out into Resident Evil, this is a good buy when it is on sale, since it can go as low as 75% off.

Back to its roots... sorta.Resident Evil: Revelations is an action-horror game developed by Capcom. Set in between Resident Evil 4 and 5, you play as series veterans Chris and Jill (as well as other members of the BSAA) to uncover a sinister plot which threatens the world.The plot is descent, if somewhat jumbled. Chris and Jill have established the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA) an organisation bred to prevent and eliminate bio-terrorism. You can follow most the plot, however the 'flashback' sections and switching between four characters might leave people confused.Sound effects do a great job at instilling a creepy atmosphere. Creepy music is played during the scenes on the deserted ship. Action music is played during the shooty segments. Weapons sound as they should. The voice acting of the main charcters (ie Chris and Jill) are good, however the other characters acting range between boring or annoying (which isn't a surprise for veterans of resident evil).Gameplay is the highlight here. The game is split into episodes, with each one playing either Chris, Jill or other members of the BSAA. Taking on elements from previous entries (mainly 4,5,6), gameplay is a mix of horror, action and puzzle solving. When playing Jill's segments, the campaign is close to survival horror with close quaters, puzzle solving, moving back and forth areas, limited ammo and intense fights. While playing as Chris and other characters however, the game becomes an action game (similar to resi 6) with lots of ammo, linear levels, limited horror and puzzles. Unlike other games in the series, you don't have an inventory system where you have to manually move items like guns, ammo and herbs around. You can only carry three weapons (ie pistol, magnums, shotguns, smg, rifles). There are no stores in the game, so you can't buy weapons and ammo. Instead you will need to find these items during your play through. There are weapon containers located somewhere in the area which you can use to store primary weapons and switch between them should the need arises. The game also saves automatically during various points in the game and at the end of each episode.  Only the green herb is prevailent in this game and it basically restores full health (like green + red combination). You can only carry a limited number of them, but they can be used via pressing a single button to quickly regenerate loss health. There is also no healthbar in the game, with the a larger area of the screen turning red as you recieve damage. Similar to resident evil 5, you generally have an ai partner to assist you in each episode. Thankfully, you don't have to baby sit them (as they as invincible) and don't do much damage anyway (leaving most of the action to you). Partners do assist you in reaching different areas and offer some banter and weak distractions for enemies. There are variety of creatures you face including dogs, various ooze monsters (which can either have melee or range attacks), hunters etc which each have weakpoints. There are also terryfying bosses to contend with which require different strategies and tatctics to defeat. A personal improvement is the removal of quicktime events, which often forced the player to press randomised buttons quickly or spam them (especially during cutscenes) to avoid an 'unfair' death.  A new addition to the game is a scanner which you can equip to locate items on the map, find hand prints or find enemy weakpoints.Besides the main campaign there is also raid mode.  In raid mode, you need to reach the exit by going through areas on the each map. As you move to the exit, enemies may spawn which can either be eliminated or avoided. There are three special challenges which are not getting hit, eliminate all enemies and doing both of them. There are plenty of maps to choose from which new ones unlocked by completing previous ones. There are three  diffculty levels per map which alters the enemies strengths and changes which foes spawn. After each stage you earn credits which you can use to buy weapons, ammo, grenades etc via the store. You also earn expereince points to level up in order to acquire stronger weapons. Weapons may be either bought from the store or found during raid matches.There are a variety of character skins to choose from, with each one having a uniques set of perks which alter how well they use certain weapons. New characters are unlocked via playing the campaign or completeing raid mode missions. Controls are a step up from previous entires. The mouse controls are great. You can also move and aim at the same time. You move at a slower pace than resi 5, but faster than 4. You can also sprint. Overall it feels less clunky than previous installments in the series.Graphics are decent, especially for 3DS port. The dark lighting in the ship scenarios do a excellent job at creating a creepy atmosphere. Textures, while not as good as resident evil 6, are a huge improvement over the 3DS counterpart.If you are looking for a resident evil game with both horror and action, more modern controls and no annoying quicktime events, this game will not dissappoint.

												Every Resident Evil game cannot be considered complete without those moments of fear, anxiety, suspense, pressure, and relief, and Resident Evil Revelations delivers them. There is nothing like being in the middle of the ocean on a tightly confined cruise ship with infected monsters seeking blood. With each turn down a corridor or opening of a door you always be thinking to yourself about what could be waiting for you there. You will also find yourself checking every nook and cranny just to make sure you have killed everything, only to find that all of a sudden out from the depths of an elevator shaft or air duct comes a slimy eight foot monster reaching out to lend you a hand. While I was surprised by, and at times felt some of the pressure of, too many enemies, I quickly realized that they tend to be rather dumb and sluggish and that I could just run away.Revelations looks incredibly good considering this is a DS port.  Graphics are not grounbreaking but are nice and have decent effects that are utlitized well on the PC.  I really enjoyed the character models myself and thought that Jill looked good as well as the rest of the cast. The sound and music are typical RE flare and add a great sense of ambience and spooky moods.  What is consistent throughout all Resident Evil games is the sense of anxiety when blowing through a ton of ammo and feeling like you are on the verge of not having enough, when low and behold the ammo gods bless you with more. One of the new ways the game has you searching for ammo and health outside of the usual opening of lockers and smashing of boxes is by using the Genesis.  The Genesis is a scanner that detects items around the environment that wouldn't normally be seen with the naked eye. The scanner can also be used on the enemy, and with each successful scan you accumulate a percentage number; when the numbers total up to 100% you are rewarded with a health potion.  Yes this is not RE6, which I have not played but it is very fun and has decent story length of gameplay.  There is replayability also with New Game modes and Multi/CoOp play.  Remember that flashy graphics and latets tech does not always equal a stellar game usually it is the gameplay that makes ot breaks it... again RE6 seems to have been disappointing from what I have read, so I opted for this game instead and am gald I did.  It brings back that old school Resident Evil feeling and that I have missed lately.			"

												I perhaps expected too much having seen many people describe this as the best in the series since RE4 - a positive review but for me personally its a middling game. The game has its plus points.....Chris & Jill, Veltro, the general plot, the mansion-esque interiors of the ship, the underwater areas, weapon attachments, the Genesis (to a degree) and omission of the tank like controls, however, it lets itself down in several key areas. Aside from Chris and Jill the other characters are hokey to say the least, *cough* Jackass? *cough*. Raymond and Jessica pick up some slack but are let down by exceptionally cheesey dialogue even for a RE game, this is widespread across all characters in RE:R. The episodic nature of the game hops and jumps around across characters/timelines/locations to the point where story and gameplay don't flow. The visuals whilst impressive for a handheld port on closer inspection reveal some awful looking textures. Gameplay elements such as the Genesis are initially fun but again personally I found it very apparent that this was something that was designed with a second screen in mind i.e. the second screen of a handheld or the controller screen of a Wii U. Genesis fealt pointless after the first few chapters, an idea that hadn't been fully realised, not even on the games lead platform which was a great shame as it would have been excellent usage of a secondary handheld screen.It's an 8-10 hour campaign, it's enjoyable in spurts. It's not the modern day savior of the series as some people would have you believe, not even close. It's light on horror, heavy on gunplay and another game in the series which will divide fans.			"

												The game is great from a survival/action genre standpoint.  It is much better than RE 6, but I would not put it in the same vein as RE 4.  The game will have you scratching for ammo, especially during boss battles.  The story is relevant, but could have been more coherent.  I was a bit lost sometimes.  Also, the developers did a good job porting this from 3DS.  Sometimes you can hardly tell this used to be a 3DS game.  A great game all around, great challenging bosses, and a decent story.  +Weapons+Updated HD Graphics+Scarce Ammo -Story could have been told better-Not really ""scary""			"

												This, this is a step in the right direction. I'm not sure if they could ever get to their glory days again. But this game was pretty good shot at it. There are some parts I groan at redoing when I replay it, but overall pretty damn good. There are even pretty creepy and unsettling parts. Stuck on a ship, with small corridors, enemies in unknown places, and of course...doors that require emblem keys. Not for everyone but if you want something a bit different from the latest Resident Evils, then worth a go.			"

												Keep in mind that this game was initially a Nintendo 3DS game that was ported to console and PC after the fact. The graphics and animations might seem a little dated because of this. That being said, this port is not bad at all, at least for PC. The graphic quality resembles Resident Evil 4.Gameplay and controls are very well done. It's 3rd person over the shoulder. Campaign is singleplayer only but you will have an AI partner. Your partner... isn't the best or most helpful, but thankfully they won't cause a game over if they get hit too much and sometimes serve as a nice distraction, except on bosses. Difficulty ranges from easy early on and nicely becomes more challenging toward the end. There is one glaring problem with the gameplay though. The dodge mechanic is incredibly shoddy. On a 360 controller, you're supposed to press A and a direction at the same time to avoid an attack at the right time, but it only ever seemed to work half the time I did it. Either it's broken or the timing needs to be perfect, but it's very frustrating. I also had an incredible amount of frustration with 2 of the Bosses in this game due to their rather odd mechanics, one of which isn't helped by the wonky dodging. This game is a LITTLE short, but that's forgivable since it was initially a 3DS game. It's also broken up into 14 episodes, some of which are very short. It also makes the game feel disjointed, because you'll be flashing back to earlier events a lot. It's mostly non linear on the ship later on in the game once you progress, so you can go back and find different weapons, ammo, health, and weapon mods (the weapons and the different mods are a great aspect to this game). The game's story is very interesting with a nice plot twist. You'll be playing and partnering with a bunch of very interesting new and returning characters, with Jill Valentine the one you'll be playing the most and the only one who can access the weapons and mods you find. Side note: I had an issue with the cutscenes having audio desync issues, but I'm not sure if this is only my issue. Overall, if you're a Resident Evil fan, you're gonna want to play this game, as the story alone is worth it and captures the mood from the earlier games in the series, with some new elements as well as other elements from later games in the series. Other than that I recommend waiting until it is on sale if you want to play it. But you'll be getting your money's worth.I haven't tried Raid Mode, but that may add some replay value if you're interested.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations... This game was really good even though there were somethings that were kind downers. For example, the enemies, they arent old school fun to kill zombies, no. They are some kind of boring mutant, who cant be dismembered or anything awesome. Then you have the mechanics which are kinda weird like dodging, for example. The story is super super good the only thing is that it might be kinda boring at first, but it gets better with time. Coop on raid mode is very very good, but unfortunately you have to play the whole campaign to unlock the different stages for Raid Mode.Now those things like the gameplay and the enemies, I think it might be because it was a Nintendo 3DS game at first but anyways, the game is pretty cool. I would give it an 8.5/10 Totally recomended ;)			"

												It's good to see Resident Evil series going back to its roots, horror/survival gameplay instead of action/adventure (RE 4-5-6) is where Resident Evil truely belongs, since 4, the series has felt very different but with this amazing remake of a 3DS game we are treated to the best from both the original trilogy (1-2-3) and the new trilogy (4-5-6) in regards to gameplay and atmosphere.The visuals are great considering the original game was on the Nintendo 3DS, the campaign clocks in at about 5-7 hours, depending on skill/difficulty, the sound design is supurb, the atmosphere is spooky and the gameplay extremely challanging, which is a problem I found all the latest Resident Evil games were lacking, my main complaints would be the lack of puzzles, which is a main staple of Resident Evil games, the original trilogy were full of them and as the series continued you see less and less... and Zombies.. where the hell are the zombies?! and finally... the lack of Co-Op, you are followed 90% of the time by a partner... whos AI is terrible and pretty much useless, was Co-Op really that difficult to implement? No Co-Op.. but we do have RAID mode, which is actually pretty awesome, lots of characters, weapons, mods and levels to gain on over 20+ stages, extremely fun with a friend and very challanging at times, lots of time will be spent in this mode, considering over 1/2 the achievments are for it. Overall, a very solid game, one of my favorites in the series, it isn't perfect but it's well worth the playthrough and I'm glad Capcom decided to bring this to the PC.8/10			"

Rank: 7/10Recommendation(s): Like Resident Evil a lot.Major Theme: An OK port, with OK mechanics.Bought at Price: $0.00 (Humble Bundle – No Developer Donation)I try to go out of my way sometimes to at least experiment with new games, titles, software, and what have you. Resident Evil Revelations was one of those times. I do have to say, Revelations didn’t fail as much as Resident Evil 4 did in my eyes – you can read my review on RE4 in about 30 seconds.I knew fully well that the Resident Evil series is one heck of a console port family, but I gave it shot anyways. The Humble Bundle offer was too tempting not to take, heck I could even make sure the developers didn’t get any coin from me. So it ticked all the right boxes from the start.

Strangely enough the title grew on me, but I enjoyed watching it more than playing. I was able to lend this title out to a friend of mine, and they seemed to enjoy playing it.The plot is ok, I wouldn’t give it 10 out of 10, but it does the job. The one thing I noticed right off the bat was the use of checkpoints. Oh my, do I hate them. The linear gameplay felt like it took a page out of a mobile game design textbook, with narrow passage ways and over the shoulder view. Tie in the “tape your face to the screen” field of view – I don’t see myself playing this game on my PC. I’d have to play in on a big screen, on my couch with a steam controller.


Besides this choking FoV, the graphics seem reasonable but certainly could be much better.

COOP is ok, but requires the other player to match your progression in the main story line. This can kind of be an annoyance as really you should just be able to play together without one of you having to go and catch up with the other.With all of the negatives, there are fixes luckily. I was able to use a save file from someone else to match their progress, and there are widescreen fixers that work with this game.  Using fixers for the FOV do cause issues with COOP, so be forewarned.

												Resident Evil Revelations: King of Tedious HorrorPros+Good visuals! Surprising since this is a remaster from a 3DS game.+It's closer to the style of the originals than the recent numbered releases.+I actually liked the upgrade system for the guns. A lot of times you wouldn't have a lot of parts, so it made you think about what weapons you use the most, or what ones you had the most ammo for.Cons-Really clunky controls. Sad, but this is coming from a 3DS game. I even played with a controller, assuming that would help, but it really didn't.-Story. An incident happens that you don't care about, so you try and cover it up for a corporation you don't care about, there was something about a city that I'm sure the citizens care about... Some boat no one cares about... For a brief period of time you play as two guys no one cares about... It's pretty impressive to not care this much. None of the new characters seem unique or interesting in the slightest, and as a result a LOT of this game feels like filler.-Puzzles are tedious. Go here, collect this, suddenly a new area opens up, we get it.-Enemies. Hint: Enemies aren't scary if they take a million shots to kill and your only threat is running out of ammo in a room where enemies infinitely respawn! That's just called annoying.To be fair, there is a bit of lore between Chris and Jill that may be neat for a Resident Evil fan. For everyone else, avoid like the T-Virus.			"

												a diferencia de los otros resident, vuelve hacer mas un shooter de terror,no hay tanta accion como el resident evil 6. el modo campaña gira entorno a un barco en el cual se desarrollan casi la mayoria de las misiones. puede ser un poco confuso el mapà para gente que recien lo esta jugando pero poco a poco te vas memorisando cada lugar. su modo asalto es lo mas llamativo de este juego a parte de la excelente historia que tiene.

												Apparently revelations was meant to be a return to ""Classic Resident Evil"" style gameplay. A return to item, ammo and health management. It's ""attempt"" at doing this was to make every enemy and boss be a bullet sponge. Of course I'll be low on ammo if it takes what feels like 100 bullets to take down bosses. Encounters outside the typical standard enemy are not fun and you'll come to hate fighting anything in this game while you struggle with a garbage dodge ability and camera. Outside of the extremely disappointing gunplay the game continues to be a dull and average experience with bland grey corridors and a boring story and characters. It's hard to recommend this game to fans of either classic RE or action RE as it spectacularly fails at both action and survival elements.			"

												This game is very similar to the older Resident Evil games, and as stated in the headline, it did make me hump a few times. It has difficulty, even on the Normal difficulty setting, and a lot on Infernal, and is very enjoyable, with lots of unlockables and reasons to keep on playing for massive amounts of hours! There are lots of characters and costumes to unlock for Raid Mode, and weapons to unlock for the Campaign, along with challenging bosses and some slightly difficult puzzles filled with traps, and lots of ways to die if you don't manage your ammo and herbs correctly. I would recommend this to any RE fan, new or old!			"

												The best of the modern Resident Evil game mechanics combined with classic Resident Evil game level design makes this the best RE title to date. The story telling isn't too bad either considering the over-the-top Japanese/Anime drama moments. I'm really surprised this was originally a Nintendo 3DS game. It's a long, complete game. Coming from a handheld that is quite impressive.			"

												To be precise, a side story of Resident Evil series, with classic taste and scenario.A good game, but not as awesome as Resident Evil 1, 2, 3 (well, at least it's not all action-packed like Resident Evil 5 and 6). I still like it, as an another adventure featured old people from original Resident Evil series. One more positive point, Raid mode, which is pretty indentical with Mercenary mode in Resident Evil 3, supports co-op gameplay and tons of hard-to-earn achievements.Good job Capcom, but next time, we need something better than this.

												Here is what everyone has been waiting for!! a scary mixed with a little action game. Graphics amazing, physics a little overboard as far as the knock backs. Really good story, probably the best one since 4 which i know isnt saying much. Die hard fans will love this game, you still get a little coop action but also some solo time to try to scary you :-) The monsters i must say are getting more ridiculous, as far as the dlc, if your going for looks on character go ahead, but they are just like a dollar, so if you have a dollar to spare by all means!! Big improvement was the movements on the third person and made it a more smoother transition. I will recommend this game for all fans new and old.			"

												I originally played Resident Evil Revelations on the 3ds but i didn't play it for long due to the small screen of the 3ds (don't have the 3ds XL), than a year after it releases on consoles and pc so i decided to purchase it. It is a really good port overall i really enjoyed playing it on the big screen and the graphics look really nice, capcom did a great job with this addition to the series.So I myself have played just about all of the resident evil games and i have to say I am a huge fan of this series although in my opinion resident evil 5 was a bit of of a disappointment, (it didn't feel like a resident evil game).Revelations was a lot of fun it had a good story with some of our favorite characters returning like Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield and some new characters like Parker Luciani, Jessica Sherawat, Keith Lumley and etc.Pros:New Game plus mode Extra story difficulty levelRaid Mode multiplayer Great HD GraphicsCons:Limited customization A short Story No ZOMBIES!!Gear Grinding in raid mode OverallAs a resident evil fan I enjoyed this game a lot, it may have had a bit of a short story but i still managed to enjoy it and it still has that raid mode mode that you can play solo or run through with a friend as well, I highly recommend this game for the fans of the series and for the newcomers to the series as well.

												Yeah, have to agree pretty much with most of the other reviews for this game, the closest thing to RE1-3 in a 3d / RE4 style game you'll get. The graphics / FMV are lush in places but show there 3DS origins in places, the controls are tight (as far as an RE game is concerned) and the most importantly the gameplay is nice.The main reason the gameplay is good is because of the even pacing between item finding / scaning, light puzzling and exploration mixed in with the combat. Also you 'WILL' have to watch the ammo as you'd expect in a true survival horror and the best thing is the main setting is spot on, the ship is very reminiscent of RE1's mansion even in puzzle / interaction elements and the light backtracking required to unlock a weapon or open that room previously locked by a symboled key, love it, feels like a true RE game in 3d clothing for me, keep on this route Capcom!PS. Oh +1 also for the return of Jill's original nose, now we just need some silent audio moments and static cams to bring back the fear factor.			"

												This is actually a really good game, far better than RE6. Revelations has that familiar Resident Evil feel, while maintaining it's action-horror blend. It has some minor flaws like repetitive animations, a few poor quality environment textures and the lack of local/campaign co-op, but it's the raid mode that you will keep coming back for.

												One of the best entries into the series since 4. The game starts very slow, as if determined to show you it's intent on creating an eerie atmosphere. Sadly this awfully slow start just made the first hour a complete and utter bore. However beyond that the game really starts to get going and picks up. The game is eerie and the tone it sets is great. The game's music was also very good throughout. It was a reasonable length as well unlike some of the shorter single player games out there. Between this selling well and Resident Evil 6 beying slammed by critics I hope Capcom remembers their own identity again and start to focus on the survival horror which created it's core fanbase in the first place.

												Revelations is a rather interesting part of the Resident Evil series. On one hand, it does feel like a side-story, not part of the main series. On the other, it often plays more like what Resident Evil used to be, than the newest entries. It feels like a more focused and better put together game, than Resident Evil 6 (released same year). But at the same time, doesn't evoke the same feelings, RE6 does, feels like designers lacked confidence and built the game by the checklist, not by their inner desires.Basic gameplay and the main parts of the game are really well done. Controls and some of the principles feel almost a perfect fit for a potential remake of the classic RE games, both in a more survival horror auto-aim style, and survival action over the shoulder more action style. Stuff no longer falls from enemies (escept for rare cases of mini-boss encounters, most of which can be skipped), ammo is rather scarce, running away is very often a very viable and even preferable option. Many locations are very narrow, but there is a rather well implemented dodge move, which is quite important to master. There's more freedom of exploration and good old ""hey I found a key, let's open the door from before"" moments, than even in Resident Evil 4. Although, it never quite truly tries to go full RE0-CV in terms of allowing you to roam free, since game is divided into chapters and quite a lot of them limit your options by some story reasons.However, there's a bigger issue with chapters. Sadly, despite the main part of the game being good and very classic RE-like most of the time, developers constantly shoehorn boring, repetitive and action heavy chapters from other characters perspectives into the flow of the game. Those tend to reuse areas from before, don't use the same weapon/herb/weapon upgrade setup as the main game and are, ultimately, completely disposable except for several key moment, which could've been done as non interactive cutscenes and nothing of value would've been lost. Part of the reason behind their existance is probably due to Capcom's fear, that game will sell less if there's not enough action in it.And another part is due to the silly story the game has. Now, Resident Evil games always had silly stories, but they tend to be awesomely silly, when you know that events you're watching unfold are dumb, all the characters are quite over the top, but it's so awesome you can't help but love it. And, besides, there was always a layer of seriousness in the story, which made for a good contrast with all the silliness. RE6 is that. Revalations is not. It's just plain stupid, always trying to look smart with all the plot twists and out of order side-chapter releals. But at the end of the day, it's just all dumb, full of new characters with crazy outfits and hairstyles, whom we will never ever see again, most likely, apart from the main duo of Chris and Jill and one small character, who had minor appearence in RE5. Also, Parker is quite clearly the result of developers wanting to have Barry Burton but not being able to for story reasons. And also, Jill is rather weirdly redesigned and looks a bit creepy.Creepy mostly due to the fact, that this game wasn't vastly visually improved over the 3DS version, so facial animations are crap, and many models and textures are rather ""meh"". Game still looks quite good, but there's a huge difference between it and RE6 even in how dynamic enemies' reactions to being shot are in RE6, and how boring shooting enemies in Revelations is. It doesn't detract much enjoyment from the game, but is rather noticeable.There's also an interesting bonus mode, called Raid mode. Unlike RE4-style Mercenaries (which I could never get into, to be honest), it plays much more like Mercenaries: Operation Mad Jackal from RE3 or The 4th Survivor from RE2. There's no time limit (but time affects your rating), you don't *have* to kill every enemy, and the main point is getting to a specific place on the map. But along the way you can (and sometimes have to) kill enemies, potentially find ammo, upgrades and new weapons. It's a really fun mode that can be played solo or co-op. It has one big issue, though, which ties with the fact, that the game was designed to be portable. In a ""gotta catch 'em all"" way, there's a lot of stuff to get, get leveled up and such, but it's very grindy in nature, meant to be played in short bursts and gets quite repetitive fast otherwise. Hence, on a portable device it's a definitely more fun mode to play, than on a PC or console.Overall, a really solid game, with nice return to the oldschool ideals for most of the time, and disposable annoying sequences inserted inbetween the enjoyable main game.

												I em not gone repet what other reviwers write about game, so i just give my impresion.Is a game with a decent story and decent graphics, but the fun beggin when you open raide mode.Keep in mind that is worth playing the story/campaign but is only singleplayer, the raide mode is coop.For a small game like this guns customization are huge, almost all the story and raid mission are on a ship...clear is a big ship but still is just a ship.Some weapon parts i think from a point of level design should have been on a armor not on weapon, but in original was a DS game so yes may be some constraints make the game how it is now.In raid mode you gone spend a lot of time, campaign is nice like old Resident Evil game, i finish it 2 times, normal and hard.Tips to make a better experience in game:-do not rush through game, taste the atmosphere-you will want to instal some mods that could make you more happy in game...I mean how could they think that is gone be more appealing for players if Jessica has one naked leg...what a shark eat the pants and she escape with no scratches but with the pants ripped???Let say that Jessica may be interesting like this for some players, but what about Rachel???Level designers of the game dident heard abut principle ""Chekhov's gun""??? Why !!!!???? a character should cary in the back a diving tank if she dosent use it any more??? It was logic if Rachel scuba version could have like swiming infinit under water.And also the drop for weapons is sadic/masochist, and all good stuff come from hardest level Ghost Ship...is a big error for design should have been placed in all maps, and also should have been more weapons drop in corelations with your level.So now i like more the game thanks to some wonderful moders:Thank you ""LeonPlisken"" for making full pants for Jessica, link to his work and download if someone feel same need like me: http://z6.invisionfree.com/Resident_Evil_4_PC/index.php?showtopic=25445Thank you ""Yoichi"" for takeing down that ugly scuba tank, i play a lot with Rachel so i like it more like this without the tank an her back, link to his work: http://z6.invisionfree.com/Resident_Evil_4_PC/index.php?showtopic=26877And a very big thanks to ""tomas18"" for fixing what should have made capcom from the day one when they build the game, drop in game for weapons is much better and we are not force any more to play like maniacs only ghost ship.His mode like he said ""...it WILL give you level 47-50 weapons regardless of what stage you're playing. It will also greatly increase your chances of having a special weapon like Revelator, Raider, Thunder Raptor, High Roller II, etc.""Link to his work: http://z6.invisionfree.com/Resident_Evil_4_PC/index.php?showtopic=25391I run all this mods without problems but always make a backup, a copy of every file that is replace by mods...make a folder like ""originals"" on your descktop so you know where they are all the time.In the end of my words about this game, is worth to buy it and playit and after the campaign check the group raide hunters and discussion pages for this game, always you will find nice partners for raide mod in coop...do not give up if no one is online, let a message on forum page.Have a nice gameplay to all, and i hope we meet in sesion for hunting ugly monsters...

												I've played this before on console. i gotta say i really liked it. i was renting the game and the disc had an error and it was stuck. So i never finished it. Finally im ready to go back in. So I think the game itself is scary, those monsters can really gang up on you and fast. Something about how they are much taller than you and oddly formed is brutal, not to mention they have a face only a mother could love. Achievement hunters can hunt atleast get half on camp rather than raid mode (which i've hardly tried). Im curious to see how this all ends. My favorite RE game was 4, Lets see if it can top that.

												I was a big fan of Resident Evil 1 & 2 and I can't say I care a lot for the action-oriented new games. Resident Evil 5 & 6 were particularly disapointing and only the co-op option managed to keep me playing until the end. Revelations does stand out.You will be controlling Jill Valentine (for most of the game anyway) and explore an abandonned ship filled with monsters. It happens to be a descent Third Person Shooter with a few good ideas, like the ""genesis"", a scanner that can be used to find hidden objects and analyse your ennemies.Let's get rid of the cons first. The port is a little lazy, basically identical to the nintendo 3DS version, which makes it an amazing game for 3DS but a just ok game for PC. Though most of the game involves a compagnion AI, coop wasn't added to the game, which I find hard to understand. Then come the usual Resident Evil problems: the writing is pretty bad, scenario is much better than RE5&6 but tries to be overcomplicated for no real added value and you have some problems with the storytelling.Then why should I recommand this game ? Well first of all, the main point of any good Resident Evil game is here: the atmosphear. Though not particularly scary, the game immersse you in its environment. The graphics are absolutely descent (I still can't believe they managed to put that on a 3DS). The game features some surprisingly attaching side-kicks for a Resident Evil game and a few very well executed plot twists. The gameplay is entertaining and THANK GOD controls are not taken away from you all the time to show you pretty cutscenes in a middle of action scenes (hello Resident Evil 6).In conclusion, Resident Evil Revelations is not a mind blowing experience but definitely enjoyable. Let's hope the next Resident Evil will be inspired by Revelations and not the dreadful Resident Evil 6.			"

												Revelations is a rather interesting part of the Resident Evil series. On one hand, it does feel like a side-story, not part of the main series. On the other, it often plays more like what Resident Evil used to be, than the newest entries. It feels like a more focused and better put together game, than Resident Evil 6 (released same year). But at the same time, doesn't evoke the same feelings, RE6 does, feels like designers lacked confidence and built the game by the checklist, not by their inner desires.Basic gameplay and the main parts of the game are really well done. Controls and some of the principles feel almost a perfect fit for a potential remake of the classic RE games, both in a more survival horror auto-aim style, and survival action over the shoulder more action style. Stuff no longer falls from enemies (escept for rare cases of mini-boss encounters, most of which can be skipped), ammo is rather scarce, running away is very often a very viable and even preferable option. Many locations are very narrow, but there is a rather well implemented dodge move, which is quite important to master. There's more freedom of exploration and good old ""hey I found a key, let's open the door from before"" moments, than even in Resident Evil 4. Although, it never quite truly tries to go full RE0-CV in terms of allowing you to roam free, since game is divided into chapters and quite a lot of them limit your options by some story reasons.However, there's a bigger issue with chapters. Sadly, despite the main part of the game being good and very classic RE-like most of the time, developers constantly shoehorn boring, repetitive and action heavy chapters from other characters perspectives into the flow of the game. Those tend to reuse areas from before, don't use the same weapon/herb/weapon upgrade setup as the main game and are, ultimately, completely disposable except for several key moment, which could've been done as non interactive cutscenes and nothing of value would've been lost. Part of the reason behind their existance is probably due to Capcom's fear, that game will sell less if there's not enough action in it.And another part is due to the silly story the game has. Now, Resident Evil games always had silly stories, but they tend to be awesomely silly, when you know that events you're watching unfold are dumb, all the characters are quite over the top, but it's so awesome you can't help but love it. And, besides, there was always a layer of seriousness in the story, which made for a good contrast with all the silliness. RE6 is that. Revalations is not. It's just plain stupid, always trying to look smart with all the plot twists and out of order side-chapter releals. But at the end of the day, it's just all dumb, full of new characters with crazy outfits and hairstyles, whom we will never ever see again, most likely, apart from the main duo of Chris and Jill and one small character, who had minor appearence in RE5. Also, Parker is quite clearly the result of developers wanting to have Barry Burton but not being able to for story reasons. And also, Jill is rather weirdly redesigned and looks a bit creepy.Creepy mostly due to the fact, that this game wasn't vastly visually improved over the 3DS version, so facial animations are crap, and many models and textures are rather ""meh"". Game still looks quite good, but there's a huge difference between it and RE6 even in how dynamic enemies' reactions to being shot are in RE6, and how boring shooting enemies in Revelations is. It doesn't detract much enjoyment from the game, but is rather noticeable.There's also an interesting bonus mode, called Raid mode. Unlike RE4-style Mercenaries (which I could never get into, to be honest), it plays much more like Mercenaries: Operation Mad Jackal from RE3 or The 4th Survivor from RE2. There's no time limit (but time affects your rating), you don't *have* to kill every enemy, and the main point is getting to a specific place on the map. But along the way you can (and sometimes have to) kill enemies, potentially find ammo, upgrades and new weapons. It's a really fun mode that can be played solo or co-op. It has one big issue, though, which ties with the fact, that the game was designed to be portable. In a ""gotta catch 'em all"" way, there's a lot of stuff to get, get leveled up and such, but it's very grindy in nature, meant to be played in short bursts and gets quite repetitive fast otherwise. Hence, on a portable device it's a definitely more fun mode to play, than on a PC or console.Overall, a really solid game, with nice return to the oldschool ideals for most of the time, and disposable annoying sequences inserted inbetween the enjoyable main game.

												Only played a for a few minutes.  The first boat seen and what I assume is the first part of chapter 1 when you scan the flesh on  shore.It really looks impressive.  Smooth game play, fairly easy to control, just all around impressive.  Excellent port from the 3DS.Really smooth on my laptop.  I have an i7 quadcore with a geforce gt 745m and it's just fine.This is a pretty good resource if you want to compare your geforce hardware with the recommended specs:http://www.notebookcheck.net/Mobile-Graphics-Cards-Benchmark-List.844.0.html "

												A good addition to the Resident Evil series. Similar in style to Resident Evil 4, much of it set however, in some welcome new locations such as aboard a ship, the Queen Zenobia. I think the monsters you encounter are a bit uninspired, but if you enjoy playing the likes of Resident Evil 4, this game is well worth playing.			"

												Resident Evil: Revelations is a solid game in this series that takes what made the originals great, and combines it with the modern controls of the newer games. This is one of the more accessible games in the series as it has some the best contols in the series while remaining creepy. While Resident Evil 5 is a fun action game, this is probably what that game should have been. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in the Resident Evil series.Score - 7/10 "

												I can't help but feel that anyone who says this is a return to the series' roots is a clueless person who never completed any Resident Evil after 4 or any Resident Evil before 4... It's not bad, by any particular means outside of story and character dialog (it's not even cheesy, it's just very, very, very bad) but it sure as heck is NOT a return to its roots. It's basically a mix of 5 and 6 with some aspects of 4, but only a tiny bit, thrown in for good measure. It has customizeable weapons similar to 4, it has terribly boring, generic and uncompelling enemies similar to 5, and the overall gunplay/damage/mindlessness of 6.At fifty bucks this game is a total rip off, even with RAID mode and co-op (both of which do add a lot of fun to this otherwise terrible story and mediocre gameplay/enemies). It can be beat at very leisure 6 hours. Get it massively on sale and don't buy into the mindless hype. This is still a VERY modern Resident Evil and that isn't always a good thing. Play this then play Code Veronica or heck the remake of 1 and say this game is about horror. Sure, maybe the first episode, if that, but not much after it besides laughter and eyerolling.Co-Op and RAID mode saves this game from a thumbs down, but just barely.			"

												This game is phonomenal! The campaign is absolutely survival-horror, it's actually the best survival-horror game I've ever played. You're outnumbered by creatures you've never even seen before, and trying to escape the Queen Zenobia (it's set on an abandoned ship) alive. This definetely gave me a good couple of scares, and some of the creatures you'll encounter will seriously creep you out (Rachel, anyone?). After you've finished the campaign, you can start a new game+, which allows you to replay the game with all your current gear, to relive the horror once more. There are 30 handprints to find throughout the campaign, which gives achievement hunters some satisfaction in searching. Once you're through the campaign, your fun has only begun; as there is also Raid Mode to accompany it. Raid Mode is a great multiplayer experience that allows you to go through sections of the game as stages, and each time you complete a stage you'll get new weapons and/or weapon parts, depending on how well you've done. There are a multitude of stages to do, as well as 3 difficulties to do them all in. If multiplayer isn't really your thing, you can do Raid Mode solo if you like. The price tag may be $50, but it is well worth it as you'll definetely clock in a considerable amount of hours. This is a great gmae to get if you're either looking to get into the Resident Evil series, find a good survival-horror game, or just want to have a really fun time. A must-buy :)			"

												Harkens a bit back to the older, scarier Resident Evil themes while maintaining gameplay that isn't itself harkening to 1996.  The campaign mode is engaging and well thought out with an Alan Wake-style episode system, constantly changing points of view, playable characters, and fleshing out more and more of the setting.  The Raid mode is bare bones until the campaign is unlocked; then, you get to work solo or with an ally using the roster from the main game in various maps with a good bit of challenge.  Not exactly worth full price (Steam is aiming high here) but $20 for the base game w/ DLC is a steal.			"

In this MMO styled shooter you can play as all your favourite characters such as Spiderman, Don Cheenis, and even Hitler! The combat is turn based and there are plenty of cards to collect as you traverse the land of Gahool. One complaint I do have is the unrealistic features of the donkey character and in no way would the donkey wield an M3, everyone knows that the donkey character should use the M9. I have to say though the physics of the rainbow level on stage 59 realy emerses you in the no way horror oriented gameplay.

												A very solid game. It has a decent story, exploration (my favorite), all right shooting and simple puzzles. Not too short, not too long, nicely split into episodes. Negligible negatives. It requires a little too much backtracking. Dodging was a bit awkward and hard to use. Save for visuals this is what the main Resident Evil series should have become.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations is a survival horror game that was initially presented to 3ds in early 2012 and later in May 2013, was released for Playstation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U and PC. The game was initially launched as a spin off, however after a while Capcom, developer and distributor, announced that Revelations saga became a sub franchise that takes place between the events of RE 4 and 5, however is with story and gameplay focused the longtime public that cherished the real survival horror, and the main franchise would be directed to the masses and what was SH became an action game. However over time the CAPCOM seems that began to lose the main franchise giving as an example RE6 which had three campaigns, each of which had a different gameplay, one of them had survival horror, in another action and another campaign balanced containing elements of the other two. Something that should be clear is that the games did not become bad, just left to please an audience to pleaseother.To understand part of the story:""... Portrays the events shortly after the creation of a group to combat terrorism Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA). One year before the game events, the Federal Bioterrorism. Commission (FBC) sent Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat agents to keep the ""floating city"" of Terragrigia under control after the bioterrorist Il Veltro organization launched an attack against the city using genetically modified living organisms, known as organic biological weapons (BOW) in opposition to the development of solar energy Terragrigia. At present, head BSAA Clive R. O'Brian sends agent of the BSAA Jill Valentine and Parker to search the agent of the BSAA Chris Redfield and Jessica in her last known location, the Queen Zenobia Cruise in the Mediterranean Sea ... "".About Gameplay:The drive is too slow with certain characters are running or not, almost no difference, as well as pre configuration of the mouse crosshairs too, but it can be modified in sensitivity as well as one or another basic configuration. Wasd are used to move, the space serves to turn around, the mouse can use knife and aim, and the aim the knife button turns shooting the gun. The numbers mean the type of weapon you use and not to change the size, eg grenade to smoke bomb. thus switching arms defined, may occur by mouse wheel and the letters ""Q"" and ""E"". G means throwing items such as grenades and smoke bombs. ""Shift"" is walking and F are various functions as well as finalizing the enemy finally the F's (F1, F2, F3 ...) have functions from commands to another character to inventory.The amount of weapons is good, and each has its own properties, but there are perks that are placed in slots (depending on the gun, it may have or not and if it has there may be more than one). Nevertheless, sometimes it seems that the weapons are unbalanced because it has weapons that can kill with one shot and others that need more than 6 or 7 shots to kill in this case even if you get to have more than 50 bullets that does not mean exactly what is enough. The character is very fragile taking an average of three blows to die, but there are herbs that can cure life completely. Tips: 1- use the dodge when with a few bullets, so saving. By the time the enemy is attacking press ""W"" or ""space"".2- try to use herbs only when the screen is outlined in red.3- shoot the legs of the enemy with the gun, so he will fall down and crawl, and can get away, recharge or use that time to finish unhurried.Things that caught my attention in particular:- The game is divided into chapters, and each time it will continue to match, we can see what happened in the previous chapters to reach the time in question.- The game makes you spend a lot of items and to try to prevent a possible critical situation, we must explore every room to try to ensure the maximum possible items. That makes you better enjoy every detail of the game and also guarantees you more playing time.- Files are found during the phases, containing information that best cover the story and expands the knowledge about the same.RER it is an attempt to get back the feeling of a true survival horror, although not even close to the first, the game can do very well. I believe that last feeling at the start of the game was extended by the game completely, he would have got his goal. Unfortunately shortly after the game back to make the same mistakes and becomes just another action game. But not wrong understand the game is amazing, as well as all other franchise, but the game always ends up leaving the feeling of missing something...For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit  steamified [steamified.com].Also you're welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.

												This game is a ode to how far Capcom has fallen from grace, the jewel in the crown.Revelations lacks any kind of horror which made previous iterations great, and that's just the start.Clunky controls characters are very difficult to orientate correctly, broken mechanics (The dodge mechanic is hit and miss, I did not once successfully dodge an attack on purpose, it just happens when it wants to.)Your ""partner"" throughout the game is gimped, they can only stun enemies with their gunfire,they do zero real damage, offer no assistance such as ammo or healing (Something RE5 actually did right) and serve no actualy purpose. At least they can't die, or this game would likely have been deleted and a refund sought.Horribly outdated graphics (Looks like an early xbox 360 on Ultra). Annoying camera, your character taking up most of the field of view in the cramped environments.No character development with needless love story undertones thrown in for good measure.My main beef with this game however is the eminent lazyness obvious throughout, frequent backtracks (At one one point you are asked to fight through the same area again are just beating it). Lazy writing obvious from the ludicrous amount of plot holes and very basic, cliche dialogue.Lazy animations for basic tasks (when cutting a door open you blowtorch the centre and it falls over)Lazy level design, I seriously have to manually open each door and watch the animation? Doors close automatically?Environments look the same, difficult to tell apart, non inuitive and results in a lot of wondering (The map is no help whatsoever, also lazy.)The AI is lazy, BOW dogs literally run at you, dart back to original position and enter the attack animation.Enemies are lazy, BOW dogs come in 2 varieties, small and grey, big and black. The main enemies througout use largely the same character model with slight adjustments for ranged and melee opponents.Whilst the game is largely easy it experiences 2/3 incredible difficulty spikes, completing most missions without a death on normal, at these spikes I died 5+ times each.Very poor optimization is obvious, entering new areas which are really not that large or detailed needs 15/20 seconds of in game loading and a serious stutter in frame rate. This is also a travesty considering the game environment is very small, a ship at night, undoubtably to save on dev time.Copy and paste story from previous RE games, bad gameplay and bad optimization makes this game the final nail for Capcom.I bought this game for 10 euros, unless it goes down to 5 or less and you've a day of boredom ahead, spend that ten euro on six cans of booze, you'll get more enoyment out of it.

												I loved old resident evil series back in the old days, the old psx days.Back where you just sat down and just played the game.This game gave me the exact same feeling, it is my first game on my arsenal which i got so addicted by.The plot was like tv series, which i'm also fond of. ""Previously in Resident Evil Revelations""Allthough some little improvements should have made, like watching the overall map where you have to go exactly.Sometimes it was really confusing where the heck should i go now, where the heck is the elevator??!!When you look at the map, it twitches around, mouse interactions is zero like.Graphics is not good, you can see so many sqaures on shadows at rubik's cube if it were gray.This game remembers me Resident Evil 4, the graphics isn´t much, but that game has a heart which you get fond of it.This series is like twelve year old dog, it has puppy eyes, and you just wont dare to shoot him to face, instead you shoot some zombies. Play on people, this game is worth of money, if you like Resident Evil! "

												The only decent game to come out of the post-RE4 games. While, near the end, ammunition is a non issue, the rest of the game has the serious concern that you will run dry.

												The best Resident Evil addition I've palyed in a while, with a good story, combat, and fimilar characters have made this game a generally fan favorite. However, the lack of CO-OP campaign as promised before release was a huge disappointment having your 2nd partner being simply and useless NPC that literally does no damage or anything beyond, just following you.Also with this game comes the fimilar Raid Mode, though fun for hours eventually you will reach max level. At this point the Raid Mode takes a terrible dive in the fact at max level there are only 2-3 maps worth playing for any kind of progrerssion upgrades. This leads to a boring grind fest, doing the same waves, of the same spawn, in the same rooms, over and over.Due to the new flavor the game as offered over Raccoon City and RE6 I'd give this game a 7/10 and is worth playing.

												Best Resident Evil since RE4 in my opinion. It manages to refine the system and mechanics of RE4 with out going all Bro-ops Dewrito mode that RE6 did. As long as you're playing on normal difficulty or higher, it's a pretty intense ride.Set between Resident Evil 4 and 5, Revelations details Jill and Chris' early days in the BSAA, with the plot switching back and forth between locations, characters, and time. While nothing significant happens here that affects the series' cannon, it does a decent job of telling it's own self-contained chapter of the RE Universe.Raid mode takes the place of Mercenaries this time around, and is best described as a Resident Evil/Borderlands hybrid. You run through levels from the main game (solo or in co-op) to earn new weapons, upgrades, and to level up your characters. Its a fun distraction to the main campaign, and if it hooks you, you'll sink a good 10+ hours into it.There are a few downsides:-While RE has always had a thing for bad dialog, this installment has some of the biggest cringers in the series.-If you already own it on 3DS, there isn't really anything new (aside from improved visuals and an improved control layout) to make you come back for a second round.Overall however, Revelations is a great direction for Resident Evil to go in. Even with the flaws, none of them are dealbreakers, and if you liked Resident Evil 4 or 5, you really should give this a try.			"

												Welcome to Resident evil revelations...   This game is an adaptation to the 3DS version. The graphics are enhanced and the gameplay is actually pretty fun. When they released it on other platforms i had my sketpical thoughts on this game but in all honesty it is definitely a good game. Let me start by saying the story is interesting and it has a story play a lot like resident evil 6. By that i mean it alternates characters. The game is obviously fun, it has a bit more of an arcady feel to me but it still feels more like Resident evil 4 than the newer fast paced shooter versions. So to continue with this review let me say that the graphics aren't amazing. I mean the fingers look a bit blocky but i mean if you seriously are a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ then i don't want to even see one of you people play Minecraft or any of these blocky games. The gameplay is smooth and the only issue i had was that it occasionally had a lag in frames.    If you're a resident evil fan this game is definitely one that you would most likely like to play. Not to mention the raid mode is really fun. Especially with the weapon drops makes it so you can play for hours. Enjoy the horror and enjoy the game.			"

												After beating Resident Evil Revelations on all difficulty levels, spending more than 100 hours in Raid Mode and beating almost all stages (Ghost Ship, why you are so hard?) I think I earned myself a right to write this review.For the starters I want to say that I'm big fan of Resident Evil franchise. I remember how scared I was as kid playing first Resident Evil game on Playstation console. I had tons of fun and scary jumps and even after so many years old Resident Evil games can scare me to death. I saw fall down of Resident Evil games when the sixth main entry in franchise was released yet I still remained a fan of it. It's part of my life, and even with so many terrible routes it had taken, nothing will change that. So this review might be kind of biased, full of comparisons to other Resident Evil games, if you want a review that will be made from normal gamer and not life for fan of series, please stop reading it. Thank you.When for the first time I heard that Resident Evil game is coming out only on Nintendo 3DS I was disappointed. ""RE game on portable consoles? Why would they skip big consoles and PC? There must be something fishy going around... yup, another bad game in series!"". I truly regret saying those things. Resident Evil Revelations made it on PC later than infamous Resident Evil 6. To be honest, I didn't expected much. Some action game, maybe again full of QTEs but since it's Resident Evil game I will try my best do enjoy it. Well, I didn't needed to try much because Resident Evil Revelations is one big surprise.Prologue made me really into this game. It's mix of old Resident Evil formula and the new one. There is still action but much more less of it than in Resident Evil 5 and 6. For the first time after so long I felt like game in this franchise have something more - yup, this magical atmosphere of horror! Even without tanky controls, limited field of view and zombies, there is a Resident Evil game that can be enjoyed even by fans of older RE titles. It's not too scary, there aren't many jump scares but it's filled with atmosphere of insecurity. R(esident)E(evil)velations is game which made me think that Capcom can do a great job if they wants to.I was happy to see Jill once again as main character. There is also Chris and few new faces. I will skip the story's part because all of it you can read on Steam - it's full of twists anyway. Hope Capcom will continue it because they way it ended... yeah, there SHOULD be a sequel. New B.O.W. - Ooze, is my least favorite of Bio Organic Weapons. Those really lack in everything when compared to Hunters or Lickers. Tho I liked mutated Rachel design, she is really creepy. Big ship as the main stage was also to my like.Graphic and music are good but there wasn't anything worth mentioning. Maybe Jill's lower back of body...So moving from the ""general"" things, there is this Raid Mode. It's like a mixed Mercenaries mode from 4/5/6 and from Resident Evil 3. You don't need to kill enemies ASAP and makes your score big. You simply moves from point A to B and killing things on your way. With every completed stage you get exp, more powerful weapons, parts and some unlockables - next stages and alternative costumes for this mode. Amazing things is that after 2 years there are still events going on residentevil.net for it. If you will ever want to beat most hard stage in REvelations then you will need ultra rare weapons and parts they are giving for event participants or powerful friend.While I'm writing this review I'm sure that I have forgot about something. Well, maybe I will add this something when I will remember it. Resident Evil Revelations is a game which finally can please fans of older RE games. Playing through story on hardest difficult mode will makes you feel good old times once again, when every bullet in the magazine was really important and once enemies got you, there was no mercy. It would be awesome to be able to play story mode in cooperation but it's good you can play at least with your friends on Raid Mode. You can see that REvelation is experiment product and it was received well. Hope it will make Capcom think more about how next Resident Evil main game should be like.			"

												This is a very fun game, but I would recommend you wait for it to come on sale for 25 dollars or less.  The game plays a lot like resident evil 4 and 5 with the over the shoulder view.  The controls are really good, and they aren't like the action controls for RE6.  The menu's had a little bit of trouble.  It's kind of weird how you select the weapons and eveything is blue so it can be hard to select a gun quickly.  They work, but I would prefer the type of menu from RE4 or even 5 over this one.   The story is over the top and fun just like most RE games.  There's a conspiricy theory, and a bunch of destruction and blood, so if you've played the other resident evil games this is more of the same.  One thing I really like about the story is the setting.  The majority of the game takes place on an old abandoned cruise ship.  The location reminds me of the mantion from resident evil 1 and is very creepy.  Even though the game isn't super scary, it is a lot more scary than the newer ones.  I would rank the scares in this game somewhere between resident evil 4 and 5.The game ran really well for me and does not have super high system requirements.  I did have trouble getting the game to run in 1366 × 768 resolution for some reason.  I don't knonw if that has been changed yet, but I found it odd that I couldn't get the game to run in the resolution I wanted.  I ended up playing the game with a black border around my screen which was annoying.  I'm sure I could have messed around with it or found some sort of fix, but I wasn't really in the mood to do that when I played the game.  So just know you might have to look for a fix online if you want certain resolutions.  All in all I would recommend this game.  It is a turn back to the older games and even though it isn't that scary, it offers a couple scares for horror fans like me.  I would recommend you get this game if you really liked RE4 or even RE1 because of the setting.  They are releasing a sequel soon, and I hope that they build on this success to make a classic RE experience.			"

												What can I say about Resident Evil: Revelations ? I bought the game during the Steam summer sale 2014 for 9,99€ and believe me when I say that this game is worth every single Euro of it, especially if you are a fan of the older Resident Evil titles. I almost regret it that I did not bought it earlier.I do not know how much I can actually write about the game without spoiling it at least a little bit so be aware of it. You have been warned. Capcom tried to get back to the roots with this game after the more action based Resident Evil 5 and 6.Therefore you will encounter a lot less of the ""Call of Duty"" feeling where you have to shoot your way through the levels. In addition to that there are no real quick time events either. However, there are some little passages within the game where you have to shoot your way through the monsters. Thankfully, these passages are rather short and do not ruin the game to much.You play the game mainly as Jill Valentine who was sent out with her partner Parker Luciani to find Chris Redfield. Even though the main character is Jill you will have to play some different characters as well. The story might be confusing at first sight, because there are some jumps here and there, but it will all make sense in the end.The biggest part of the game plays on a ship, which is huge by the way. During your progress you will unlock new rooms and areas of the ship and some of them are really pretty. You will need to backtrack a couple of times to get new keys etc. to open new areas so a good memory or good map reading skills are recommended otherwise you will run in circles =)There are even some riddles in the game, but sadly they are not really worth mentioning. Oh I almost forgot about the ""shock moments"". Some of them really catched me off guard. I really recommend to play this game with lights out in the evening, preferably with a good headset. I did my first playthrough on the normal difficulty and in comparison to Resident Evil 5 and 6 I actually managed to run out of ammo sometimes so do not waste you bullets. I can only imagine how brutal the hardest difficulty must be which I will definitely try to beat. By the way the last boss of the game really deserves to be called ""boss"". Personaly, I think it was one of the most hardest bossfights in my Resident Evil history. Maybe because I did not upgrade my weapons or did not use a rocket launcher (easy mode). Believe me you will be so much satisfied after you beat him words just cannot describe it. Dark Souls is a piece of cake in comparison, really it is.I needed 12h more or less for my first playthrough, but I was really trying to look at every corner and soak up the atmosphere of the game. I guess you can finish it in 8-9h if you rush through it.I do not know what else to say. Buy it, play it, love it.  "

												If you are a fan of any of the newer Resident Evil games, 4, 5, or 6, then you'll love this game. The campaign mode is fun, but the real ""meat"" of this game is in the Raid Mode. With plenty of stages and unlockables to discover, Raid mode offers almost infinite replay value. I got this game when it was on sale for $13, but after seeing all the content the game offers, I'd say the game is worth the full price cost. The only downside is the lack of players; I have yet to find a joinable match online. So if your considering getting this game, I would recommend convincing one friend to get the game as well. Single player is enjoyable, but nothing beats playing co-op with a buddy.			"

Having grown up with the earlier Resident Evils and suffering through the mess that was Resident Evil 5, I had little hope that Capcom could recover from the damage they've done to the franchise. But, hey, they thankfully proved me wrong with a game that was originally a 3DS spin off. With Revelations, the series once again gains survival horror like settings, atmosphere, and mechanics while still maintaining all the improvements made with the controls. For the older fans: You'll get a decent amount of survival horror atmosphere, along with the ammo conservation mechanics. It's nowhere near the golden days of Resident Evil 1-CV but it's leagues above the stuff they pulled with Resident Evil 5. Heck, it's a start in the right direction right? The story as well actually feels like a throwback to the earlier games with a lot of chess moves going on in the background and you the player trying to figure out the mystery before the game reveals it. Of course most importantly, they brought the item chest back. I only serves to hold extra fire arms in this game but having inventory management in a RE game after such a long time, was a nice surprise.For the newer fans: All the great things about Resident Evil 4's controls are still there, ammo isn't limited enough that you can't go on a small shooting spree on normal or lower difficulty, and action sequences are sprinkled through the entire game. So if you like the action side more of the franchise, you can have fun with Revelations with the understanding it's not 4 or 5 in terms of shooting everything that comes at you.To wrap this up, this is a great game compared to the junk Capcom has released in the RE franchise these couple of years. Good story, exploration, running from enemies, good narrative, and interesting enemy designs(though they get repetitive after a while.) I hope Capcom lets the team behind this game continue to do their own thing of bringing back the series closer to its original form because fans will response to that with purchases. Meanwhile, Capcom can use the main series to continue to try and force a square peg in a round hole with their ""No, no, it's not a rip-off of Call of Duty. It's action survival, trust us."" With the magic that was Resident Evil 6, I'm sure that's working beautifully for them. "

												THIS GAME HANDS DOWN RE-INVIGORATED A LONG RUNNING SERIES BACK TO IT'S SURVIVAL-HORROR ROOTS, AND IT COULDN'T BE MORE GLORIOUS.You have the option to change between modern shooter controls or the classic RE controls. (I.E. Choosing to either run and shoot, or stand in place and shoot.)You can carry up to three weapons on you at all times, each with slots for weapon modifcations that you find by exploring the ship. There are multiple difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Hard, & Infernal - a new one that randomizes not only the enemy's spawn locations, but also the enemy-type as well. That means that enemies which were once exclusive to specific stages of the game are now able to spawn at any point in the game. Ridiculously ridiculous.It includes New Game +, so you can go back through with your upgraded gear and not feel like such a sissy.Includes Raid Mode - single player or online-coop game mode that tests your skills.In this you can play as different characters, each with their own skills and weapon load-outs. You go through the stages from story mode, but they now have different challenges including time limits, boss fights, and hazardous obstacles.**Yes, it is a Nintendo DS port, but Knights of Colombus, if it isn't the best DS port I have ever experienced. They most definitely optomized it with love for PC gamers.**12/10 WOULD KILL RACHEL AGAIN.			"

Resident Evil Revelations UE managed to both meet and exceed my expectations. It's a game that pays homage to it's roots and is told to be the kickoff of a parallell Resident Evil series with more focus on horror and less on the action of later titled such as Resident Evil 6. As a gamer who never had a PS system, I grew to love the original series playing RE 4 and RE Zero on my Gamecube. I've yet to play the first three games but from what I've seen and heard RE Revelations doesn't go all out back to the start and serves up a pure survival horror game but it does a great job taking the good mix between action and horror that was RE4 (arguably the most popular installment of the franchise) and adapt it into a more claustrophobic experience and giving fans of the series something to play since the series injected itself with the T-virus, spawning the abomination that is Resident Evil 6 - frankly a far too action oriented mess.I really respect the design decisions in RE Revelations UE]. For the first time in the series the the player can aim and move at the same time. To balance this enemies have been given more unpredicable movement patterns and having almost all of the fighing set in really close quarters. The claustrophobic maze that is the ghost ship Queen Zenobia acts as a great backdrop to the games plot. This is a game that encourages exploration with its metroidvania-esque level design, and also rewards it with weapon upgrades and some ""collectibles"". The fact that resource management never really comes into play (the game almost consistently hands out more ammo than you can carry) is really the only way in which Revelations UE deviates from the ""core"" survival horror concept, making it somewhat more of a shooter in some of the episodes.At the end of the day though, Resident Evil Revelations UE is a really good game and a great Resident Evil title that - for me - competes with RE4 as the best one in the series. So if you enjoyed RE4, Revelations UE is a sure buy even with its current MSRP of 40€ (or regional equivalent) even if I would suggest picking up any game with that price tag on sale. The campaign will last you between 7-10 hrs depending on how much exploration you do. The game offers New Game+ adding some replay value, and also comes with a co-op Raid Mode where you fight off waves after waves of enemies. Revelations UE is also probably one of the most accessable titles to players who have never played an RE title before.8/10 "

												Great zombie killing 3rd person shooter with horror elements. Nice environments, though they may get repetitive if you plan to replay a lot. Some scenes are not advised for people under the age limit. Great character design and shapes, especially on Jill and Rachel, and particular bosses.A lot of weapons and customization, character and weapon unlockables. Story is poor, like any other zombie game, there's outbreak, infection, bla-bla, we have to kill stuff and save earth. But what's important is the killing of things that are dead, because you don't really kill anything, because they are dead.In this one you will mostly be on your own, in single player that is, usually you and your partner will be separated and occasionally meet up. In co-op mode however you play stages from selection of single player levels together with your friend, to clear the stage and not die. It's fun and may get boring after a while, like any repeatable thing, unless it's sex... well if you do 10-20 sexruns each day, you might get exhausted and also bored eventually. But don't get your hopes up that high, because there's rarely anyone that does that. Enjoy.			"

												Revelations is, by all accounts, a sub-par game. It's not exactly terrific, and all the fan hype about this being a 'return to roots' and 'hope for the future' had me expecting an incredible game. An incredible game it is not; a 6 hour long game that is decent it is.RE:Rev. plays much like every other Resident Evil game of the modern era, only that the enemy count is much lower, possibly due to the 3DS' technical limitations. Which means this game's absence of action and mayhem is only due to circumstance. You spend most of your time exploring a ship and switching between several characters as the game's plot is unfolded through recollections and various vantage points starring different characters. The new characters are bland and uninteresting, and the game spends more than half the time dragging you through various plot points without ever explaining just what the ♥♥♥♥ is happening. There's even a scene with a character putting on the greatest exposition and display of ''alright I will reveal everything now no really this is how a good writer unfolds a plot'' ♥♥♥♥ery only to have something happen just as he says ''I will reveal everything now''. I'm pretty sure he literally said that word for word.So the plot and writing is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥(it's Capcom, no surprise there); but the gameplay is somewhat decent. You don't encounter hordes of zombies, the game paces itself more than its full fledged console release bretheren, and there's a bit of atmosphere building at the beginning. But it all feels rather small; the rooms are tiny, the hallways can barely have two creatures standing side by side, maps outside of the ship are pathetically tiny, your arsenal of moves (and movement speed) is a fraction of what it is in the other titles, and chapters can be completed in 20 minutes. It's all down to its handheld origins, but I'll only marginally excuse it because if Persona 4 Golden can be on the Vita and clock in at over 60 hours, RE:Rev. has no excuse.You won't exactly be scavenging for ammo or herbs (they're everywhere), and you won't be praising its new gameplay innovations. All that is taking place is an RE game that dialed back the explosions and threw in some fairly basic puzzles. About the only scary thing in the game is this one B.O.W. that seems to show up randomly to attack you, which was a nice touch but shows up infrequently and isn't the central plot element in the game as much as a miniscule plot point that no one seems to care about. Missed opportunity.All in all it's not offensive (as a reviewer put it). Not a bad game, not a great game, barely a good game, a pretty forgettable experience. With all the♥♥♥♥♥♥I'm throwing at it you'd wonder why I filed this under ''reccommend''. Because it's still an enjoyable experience that doesn't drag on due to its length. Like a small pizza that has an interesting, albeit weird flavor; RE:Rev. isn't that great but short enough and decent enough for me to reccomend it. It doesn't overstay its welcome and try to hash out a 90 hour plot out of nothing, and it's over before you start to get bored of it.PS, this supposedly takes place between RE4 and RE5. Remember in RE5 where there were constant flashbacks and a plot about putting an end to the founder of Umbrella and going to a castle? Yeah, none of that happens here. You're on some boat. It's a simple marketting trick; nothing gets revealed here.			"

""Previously in Resident Evil Revelations""Allthough some little improvements should have made, like watching the overall map where you have to go exactly.Sometimes it was really confusing where the heck should i go now, where the heck is the elevator??!!When you look at the map, it twitches around, mouse interactions is zero like.Graphics is not good, you can see so many sqaures on shadows at rubik's cube if it were gray.This game remembers me Resident Evil 4, the graphics isn´t much, but that game has a heart which you get fond of it.This series is like twelve year old dog, it has puppy eyes, and you just wont dare to shoot him to face, instead you shoot some zombies.

												I know as of when I wrote this review I only have 0.1 hours in the game but I have played through this game 2 times on my 3DS already and messed around with the HD port on Wii U at a friend's house a little bit.This is the only Resident Evil game I have played so I have nothing to compair it to. Story I enjoyed the story it had a nice twist about half way through that really surprised me. The game being slip up into chapters seemed to fit really well which I usually hate when games do that. As far as character devlopment goes it never really explain who was who and kind of expected you to have played the other games. Gameplay The game play really felt like a pretty standard shooter, but I still enjoyed playing it. This game honestly wasn't all that scary though it was more in the gore of the monster you found then jump scares and stuff like that. The map was extremely confusing and not all that helpful leaving me to wander around quite a bit. Co-op I really enjoyed the co-op you basically play trough small parts of the story with a friend who controls the character that is usually controled by AI. However when playing on the 3DS and Wii U no one was ever online and I have heard from friends that it is hard to find people on PC as well. So if you can find a friend who also owns the game your in for a good time. Specs Processor: Intel i7 6700HQ Quad core @2.6GhzGraphics Card: Notebook GTX1060 with 6GB VRAMRAM: 16GB DDR4			"

												Welcome to Resident evil revelations...   This game is an adaptation to the 3DS version. The graphics are enhanced and the gameplay is actually pretty fun. When they released it on other platforms i had my sketpical thoughts on this game but in all honesty it is definitely a good game. Let me start by saying the story is interesting and it has a story play a lot like resident evil 6. By that i mean it alternates characters. The game is obviously fun, it has a bit more of an arcady feel to me but it still feels more like Resident evil 4 than the newer fast paced shooter versions. So to continue with this review let me say that the graphics aren't amazing. I mean the fingers look a bit blocky but i mean if you seriously are a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ then i don't want to even see one of you people play Minecraft or any of these blocky games. The gameplay is smooth and the only issue i had was that it occasionally had a lag in frames.    If you're a resident evil fan this game is definitely one that you would most likely like to play. Not to mention the raid mode is really fun. Especially with the weapon drops makes it so you can play for hours. Enjoy the horror and enjoy the game.			"

												Any Resident Evil fan needs to play this!When I first started Resident Evil Revelaitons, I didn't know what to expect. However, this game ended up being one of my favourites of the series.As fans of the series will know, the Resident Evil series changed a great deal with Resident Evil 4. And although that was a great game, it felt very different from its predecessors.Luckily, Revelaitons does a brilliant job of recapturing the feel and flavour of those classic Resident Evil games. The story may not be brilliant, but then again, the series was never renowned for its narrative. What's important is that Revelaitons gives a greater focus on delivering fear to the player, and the limited amount of ammunition forces you to pick your foes wisely.For me, the original Resident Evil and Resident Evil Zero will remain my favourites of the series. Revelaitons, however, comes a close third.True Resident Evil fans will appreciate the cheeky little nods to previous entries of the series in this fantastic game filled with unspeakable creatures which leave you with nothing to say except, ""what is this?""

												It's no re4.This game got a lot of praise for being more of a return to the roots of survival horror, bringing back the survival factor with ammo management and atmosphere and all that. It really didn't, the game wasn't scary and running out of ammo was never even close to being a problem. I also didn't like the hidden handprints, bringing out the genesis scanner to scan every single room slowing my walking speed down to a crawl was boring as ♥♥♥♥, finding objects such as medals hidden around a level as seen in previous re's was much more enjoyable.That said, the game was alright. Shooting zombies was enjoyable enough, the mod system added some cool variety and the campaign didn't last too long. If you want an above average third person shooter, this could be it. Haven't tried out raid mode.Hot tip: put infighter 3 and damage 7 on the M40A1 and no enemy will ever be a problem again.			"

Revelations also assures contrasting difficulty settings within stages to the player's preference. While co op is accesible at introduction, the player must play the campaign mode first before admittance to stage 4 or higher.

												After beating Resident Evil Revelations on all difficulty levels, spending more than 100 hours in Raid Mode and beating almost all stages (Ghost Ship, why you are so hard?) I think I earned myself a right to write this review.For the starters I want to say that I'm big fan of Resident Evil franchise. I remember how scared I was as kid playing first Resident Evil game on Playstation console. I had tons of fun and scary jumps and even after so many years old Resident Evil games can scare me to death. I saw fall down of Resident Evil games when the sixth main entry in franchise was released yet I still remained a fan of it. It's part of my life, and even with so many terrible routes it had taken, nothing will change that. So this review might be kind of biased, full of comparisons to other Resident Evil games, if you want a review that will be made from normal gamer and not life for fan of series, please stop reading it. Thank you.When for the first time I heard that Resident Evil game is coming out only on Nintendo 3DS I was disappointed. ""RE game on portable consoles? Why would they skip big consoles and PC? There must be something fishy going around... yup, another bad game in series!"". I truly regret saying those things. Resident Evil Revelations made it on PC later than infamous Resident Evil 6. To be honest, I didn't expected much. Some action game, maybe again full of QTEs but since it's Resident Evil game I will try my best do enjoy it. Well, I didn't needed to try much because Resident Evil Revelations is one big surprise.Prologue made me really into this game. It's mix of old Resident Evil formula and the new one. There is still action but much more less of it than in Resident Evil 5 and 6. For the first time after so long I felt like game in this franchise have something more - yup, this magical atmosphere of horror! Even without tanky controls, limited field of view and zombies, there is a Resident Evil game that can be enjoyed even by fans of older RE titles. It's not too scary, there aren't many jump scares but it's filled with atmosphere of insecurity. R(esident)E(evil)velations is game which made me think that Capcom can do a great job if they wants to.I was happy to see Jill once again as main character. There is also Chris and few new faces. I will skip the story's part because all of it you can read on Steam - it's full of twists anyway. Hope Capcom will continue it because they way it ended... yeah, there SHOULD be a sequel. New B.O.W. - Ooze, is my least favorite of Bio Organic Weapons. Those really lack in everything when compared to Hunters or Lickers. Tho I liked mutated Rachel design, she is really creepy. Big ship as the main stage was also to my like.Graphic and music are good but there wasn't anything worth mentioning. Maybe Jill's lower back of body...So moving from the ""general"" things, there is this Raid Mode. It's like a mixed Mercenaries mode from 4/5/6 and from Resident Evil 3. You don't need to kill enemies ASAP and makes your score big. You simply moves from point A to B and killing things on your way. With every completed stage you get exp, more powerful weapons, parts and some unlockables - next stages and alternative costumes for this mode. Amazing things is that after 2 years there are still events going on residentevil.net for it. If you will ever want to beat most hard stage in REvelations then you will need ultra rare weapons and parts they are giving for event participants or powerful friend.While I'm writing this review I'm sure that I have forgot about something. Well, maybe I will add this something when I will remember it. Resident Evil Revelations is a game which finally can please fans of older RE games. Playing through story on hardest difficult mode will makes you feel good old times once again, when every bullet in the magazine was really important and once enemies got you, there was no mercy. It would be awesome to be able to play story mode in cooperation but it's good you can play at least with your friends on Raid Mode. You can see that REvelation is experiment product and it was received well. Hope it will make Capcom think more about how next Resident Evil main game should be like.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations is the most recent RE game that, in my opinion, comes closest to the classic survival horror RE fans love.I could do a massive in depth review, but I'll keep it short...I'll mention the atmosphere and the gameplay, though.The atmosphere is done quite well in this game. Most of this game is set on an abandoned cruise ship crawling with horrors. One of the strengths of RE is that they are able to bring any setting into the horror, and here it is no exception. I found myself genuinely creeped out by the many things on this haunted ship.However I wish they didn't change settings during the course of the game. Because of flashbacks and attempts to advance the plot, the game sometimes changes its setting to a city on fire or a mountain range, which aren't quite as scary. But it's a fairly minor quibble, as this game still manages to overal creep the player out.The gameplay is reminiscient of RE4 and RE5, with lots of shooting abound. But, I did appreciate the fact that ammo is actually quite limited in this gamel while past REs tend to have so much ammo you could go in guns blazing. This game, while it does have a noticeable amount of ammo, you had to be a bit careful in how much you were shooting. Granted, it isn't as scarce as in REmake, but go too trigger happy and you might just...well, die.I could go more in depth, but I'll probably bore you all.In the other fields, I think the music and plot do a decent job at what they need to do. (Granted, the plot here isn't the greatest, but it's RE - when were they ever realistic?)I think overall, while this game didn't scare me as much as the early REs did, it does manage to stay true to its roots and give a great survival horror experience.

												You should definetly get this game if you are looking for a good scare. It offers high pressure scenarios with an oose coming from the left and an ooze coming from the right, you have 3 bullets and a knife. Dang. But yeah, difficult bosses, annoying minor enemies. Really its more like a rage game than a survival-horror. Well, there goes my childhood.			"

												This is exactly what modern Resident Evil should look like. Too bad this is still portative version with better graphics and its disadvantages But! It has more various gameplay, better atmosphere, re4like(or even some metroid-like) gameplay, weapon upgrades instead of stupid skills. Even plot seems like more entertaining, though it still Resident Evil style story. And thank god its non co-op story mode. Capcom should made this game for PC and consoles from the begining and in the numerous Re series instead of Re6. Not calling Re6 a bad game, but me personaly enjoyed far more in this game. And of course - Jill Valentine <3			"

												Português / EnglishGameplay: 10/10Story: 10/10Music and Sound: 10/10Raid Mode (Online Gameplay): 9/10Graphics: 8/10Não posso dizer que sou fã da série pois meu histórico com Resident Evil é com RE 1, RE 2, RE 3 e Code Veronica.Não joguei o 4, 5, 6 e quaisquer outros pois os achei uma grande porcaria.Dito isto, fico muito feliz de ver como a Capcom ""recuperou"" muito do que um dia já foi Resident Evil nesta nova versão chamada Revelations. Sinceramente, havia muito tempo que não tinha o sentimento de ""valeu cada centavo"".Demorei 12 horas para zerar no modo Infernal, o meu primeiro contato com o jogo já foi logo na dificuldade mais difícil porque eu achei que os outros modos não teriam graça, tenho mania de fazer isso, mas valeu a pena, apesar da grande dificuldade principalmente no início do jogo, o modo Infernal proporciona um clima maravilhoso de dificuldade muito semelhante ao Dark Souls, sua munição acaba rápido e não há tantas ervas espalhadas pelos cenários, então, prepare to die!A história é ótima, por não ter acompanhado a série eu não sei exatamente quanto tempo depois de Raccon City se passa o Revelations.Além disso, temos o modo ""Raide"" com um ótimo toque de RPG no jogo, é um co-op online que vale muito a pena, inicialmente eu havia comprado o game apenas pelo Raid mas depois que joguei o modo campanha eu fiquei muito satisfeito com tudo o que vi.Os único pontos negativo são os gráficos que por ser um port de 3DS não te vislumbrará tanto, mas está bem razoável e não deixa tanto a desejar, e a jogabilidade em controle. Acredite em mim, jogue no teclado/mouse, principalmente se for jogar no Infernal, este inclusive é ao mesmo tempo um ponto positivo, a jogabilidade foi PERFEITAMENTE adaptada para o teclado/mouse, muito fluído e fácil.Eu não costumo escrever reviews, quem me conhece sabe o quanto sou chato e exigente e que só escrevo review quando o jogo é bom e vale a pena, então compre. Se não tiver grana sobrando, espere uma promoção qualquer e compre, me adicione e me chame para jogar um raid.I'm not a fan of Resident Evil, I only have played RE 1, 2, 3 and Code Veronica, after that I just feel pain for every RE out there. Capcom did a great job to revive the real old times in RE Revelations, with a great story and very good gameplay we have the raid mode, a co-op online with some RPG elements that simply works perfectly in RE.We have only two 'cons', the graphics and the joystick gameplay.We have a port here, so you will not get stuned for a graphic awesomeness moment, but it's just ok.The joystick gameplay isn't good, but at the same time Capcom did a great job in the keyboard/mouse adaptation so believe me, play in keyboard/mouse.I start the game playing my first time directly in the Infernal game difficulty, it's very hard but worth, the game have a great atmosphere of difficulty similar to Dark Souls, you need to know how to shot and take advantage of the game cause you don't have too much herbs and ammo, so prepare to die.Really worth every cents.

												Resident Evil Revelations is a great game for fans of the series or just survival horror fans in general. The game is a perfect mix of new RE gameplay mechanics (third-person perspective, moving while aiming, and instant switch between items without having to enter the inventory menu) and classic RE structure (dark scary atmosphere, puzzles, and limited ammo and health items). The new scanner equipment allows the player to search areas for hidden items and rewards the player with health once 100% scanning requirement of enemies is met. This is a welcomed and smart addition to the series. The enemy designs are really great and creepy as well. They are reminescent of original RE designs and Silent Hill monsters.  Aside from some weak dialog and a couple of just downright terrible side characters, this game is fantasic and will hopefully set a standard for future Resudent Evil titles.			"

												If you are a fan of any of the newer Resident Evil games, 4, 5, or 6, then you'll love this game. The campaign mode is fun, but the real ""meat"" of this game is in the Raid Mode. With plenty of stages and unlockables to discover, Raid mode offers almost infinite replay value. I got this game when it was on sale for $13, but after seeing all the content the game offers, I'd say the game is worth the full price cost. The only downside is the lack of players; I have yet to find a joinable match online. So if your considering getting this game, I would recommend convincing one friend to get the game as well. Single player is enjoyable, but nothing beats playing co-op with a buddy.			"

												A damn site better than RE6, actually felt like a RE game brought back some of the old values with the ""keys"" n all. Still felt it could have done with abit more improvements for example the first boss your came accross is nearly imposible on normal mode if you havent saved your ammo up and i mean saved all that you have come accross n dodged every enemy you have seen. I would recommend this game and im hoping the Remake of RE 1 when is arrives isnt going to be a total murder scene, that would kill the franchise for me, in my opinion its already on its last legs due to other companies bringing out better survival horror games now adays and to be honest the ""Resident Evil"" name itsself is probably whats been keeping players hanging on but if they mess up on RE 1 by changing it to much i dont see them lasting long. Again in my opinion if your going to remake something remake it exactly as it is! but with better graphics I have the same gripe over movies a remake comes out and all of a sudden big vital chunk of the film has changed...... Thats when i i lose intererest.			"

												Revelations does have the survival horror feeling from older RE's. The Ooze zombies movement remind me of ""The Ring"" movies, kind of creepy. The control and movement style is pretty similar to RE5 except that you can aim and walk this time!. Inventory system is managed differently aswell. Originally released for the 3DS and now for consoles & PC and thought was ported pretty well, some textures are pretty low but it's expected being a port from a handheld device. Another reason to play is because it starrs the most badass (IMO) characters in the franchise, can't get enough of Jill Valentine :O. The only optional game mode available other than story is Raid which uses the campaign levels to go through a different set of objectives, with an RPG mix into it. Good weapon and character customization for Raid mode. Must say I preffer the action style from RE6 but Revelations was a pretty good experience, well recommended.			"

												Nice game, controls with the mouse and keyboard are much nicer than on the original 3DS layout. Even with the Pro Pad thing. It can sometimes stutter int he framerate at spots, usually when it's loading in a map, but smoothes back out a few seconds after.The music and sounds are rather well done, too. In-game, everything has 3D positional surround. Only the FMVs seem to be in stereo.Capcom could probably have spent a bit more time in effort on the textures and models, but overall it does have an increase compared to the original. It's a shame that no one seems to be playing the RAID mode online anymore, though. So the co-op aspect seems dead in terms of random play online. got it during the 75% off deal, felt it was worthwhile for the cost even having 'conquered' it on the 3DS prior.			"

												This is probably the ""best"" Resident Evil (on the PC at least) so far. It takes all the strenghtes in atmosphere and storytelling of the first three entries and combines it with a control scheme that acutally makes sense. This game is a great throwback to the original RE 1. Despite the many differences and improvements, it still has countless stylistic references to the original and it ""feels"" a lot more like RE 1 than RE 4 - 6 did. Gameplay is very solid (with a controller), difficulty is challenging but not too stressfull and the pacing is very well done. On top of that, a very nice action mode is added for short burst of monster hunting. Having played all PSX and PC RE games, I never really liked the first three REs due to the completely unusable controls. RE:R fixes those. I also liked the ""actionized"" RE sequels (including 6, which is nice, but only for fans willing to accept change). Effectively, RE:R combines the controls of RE 5 with the strength of the RE 1 - 3 story and atmosphere. All in all, you can see that a lot of very smart design choices have been made in regards of the game, keeping frustration to a minimum. But, all said and done. This is still a Resident Evil game. That means a a completely bonkers (but not bad) plot, a lot of narm and very unique character design. You either like it or not. If you can live with that, RE:R is a great entry into the series for players who haven't played any RE yet. For fans of the series it is a must play.			"

												Very disappointing...My last RE game was with RE5 on PS3 (RE6 didn't appear impressive from the trailers I previewed and later from the player base review).Then I read Revelation is considered better than RE6 - boy did I not understand how low the bar was set.1. Gameplay: 7/10RE4 set the de facto standard with ""over-the-shoulder"" 3rd person action and I have no problems with it.I used the keyboard and mouse setup - whole reason why I bought the PC version.Camera can be a bit wonky at times but for 97-99% of the time I had no problems.Difficulty wise, definitely harder than RE4 and RE5 (from what I remembered on Gamecube and PS3 anyway); Boss fights are challenging enough to require expending nearly all your ammunitions and proper aiming (no EZ rocket for you! RE4 boss fights haha...).Also, no weapon can become ""overpowered"" in the sense they can't be upgraded beyond what the weapon mods allow for.From what I can tell, the DLC weapons offer no significant advantage over what is available in the stock game.2. Duration/replayability 4/10OK, I may have rushed it a bit, (I actually completely missed the magnum pickup in episode 7 and only bothered to look it up online after completing the game).It may also have to do with the game design (Raid mode doesn't do anything for single player; Capcom trying to squeeze EVERYONE's story in 10 hours).3. ""Story"": 3/10Seriously, I hated the constant switching of characters in each episode (WTF, can't we just pick a character, follow-through on their one story and replay the game from another character's view?)RE4 had the right idea - main campaign with Leon, separate ways with Ada.To Capcom and other players, if you want another perspective from another character? That should be considered DLC material right there and I have no problems with it as long as its of good quality.The story is also full of cliches, but its the RE series, I don't expect an Epic.*New* Raid mode: 7/10The RNG loot mode. I suppose its a decent grinder; 5-20 minutes on each stage (around 30 total) looking for random loots with map levels based on the campaign.Bonus weapons in raid mode are available from time to time from residentevil.net apparently (most have expired already however...)Online co-op has not been working for me.Overall 6/10 (Edited):I bought this game for 15$ on sale with all of its included DLCs and I feel that is about the right value from my experience. Other players may differ in opinion, but I felt RE4/5 were worth their full retail price (40~50$) at release compared to this entry.Rumors hold that Revelations  2 is to be an episodic release... I will be holding onto my credit card and be waiting for the completed edition; and I will be waiting for actual players experience feedback before purchasing.Edit: This review was edited after going through raid mode. I now rate this as an acceptable, but not great purchase.			"

												Revelations does have the survival horror feeling from older RE's. The Ooze zombies movement remind me of ""The Ring"" movies, kind of creepy. The control and movement style is pretty similar to RE5 except that you can aim and walk this time!. Inventory system is managed differently aswell. Originally released for the 3DS and now for consoles & PC and thought was ported pretty well, some textures are pretty low but it's expected being a port from a handheld device. Another reason to play is because it starrs the most badass (IMO) characters in the franchise, can't get enough of Jill Valentine :O. The only optional game mode available other than story is Raid which uses the campaign levels to go through a different set of objectives, with an RPG mix into it. Good weapon and character customization for Raid mode. Must say I preffer the action style from RE6 but Revelations was a pretty good experience, well recommended.			"

Resident Evil Revelations: 8/10 - RECOMMENDEDResident Evil Revelations Impressions:Best Resident Evil since Resident Evil 4 and 5 (and REmake)... its handheld origin is all over the place. The levels are narrow corridors, there is max 2 creatures per Level... I think at one instance there wee 3 or 4.... But still, the dialogue is as corny as ever, the story as convulted as we might expect, but in the end, THIS one should have gotten the 6 attached to the title... even if this is befor Resi5.... but that hardly matters.If you loved this franchise at some point... than it's time to love it again :D			"

												Best entry to the series after some time in my opinion. I had finished RE 6 before long time and i got this one. I had only played the demo until now. I have to say that it was the first ever demo to get me hooked like that and now that i played this i know why. Very interesting and hooking storyline, back and forth traveling like the old Resident Evil titles, creepy music and incredible sound effects and all these match perfectly the awesome graphics of our era make this game is just ..incredible. All in all i greatly recommend!			"

												This game hella dope. It ain't scary but its fun as fug. 7.5/10, it was nice. Jills♥♥♥♥♥was great, loved it. Chris's♥♥♥♥♥remains subpar. Why this game make me play as Porker? What a tubba blubba. Raid mode as Lady HUNK was great, she has nice legs. How come there never is any cute guys in RE games? Probably because they're dead in this universe. Rip in peace.Jessica's 1 exposed legged diving suit was probably the dumbest thing I've ever seen, and I've seen Jill fight zombies while in a pirate costume and Chris dress up as a stripper and Hunk forget his pants.The knife is USELESS. It does NOTHING. Shanking mutants for hours they just don't drop. Game is super misleading about how to dodge. It tells you to press UP or DOWN plus A. What it doesn't tell you is that it's UP and DOWN+A, not UP+A and DOWN+A. And you don't tap it, you have to hold it. Doesn't tell you that. What a joke.Obrian for President, Magnums are OP, Rachel is mai waifu, Comms officer is my husbando, Terragrigia was an inside job, Jessica is a♥♥♥♥♥♥for dinners(she wants 2 whole dinners wtf fatty), 50 ♥♥♥♥ing twists are too many, Jackass needs to calm down.

												I really enjoyed this game but it's weirdly structured. The weapon customization is deep and addicting, finding mods and combining them in a way that suits your playstyle is 50% of the fun. There's a downside to this : the early game is quite boring as you face lots of bullet sponge enemies with nothing but a peashooter. The shotgun you get after that is slightly better but it still pales in comparison to other Resident Evil games. It takes a few hours before you start to get weapons that have a visible impact on your foes. I'd go as far as to say the core game loop of shooting and improving your guns doesn't get really fun until new game +/infernal difficulty. Infernal difficulty is very smartly done, adding monsters in new places so you really gotta stay on your toes and use every tool at your disposal. The game becomes slower paced and you start to notice the little things, like the dynamic music, cool animations...it feels like the right way to play. It's a shame because I think a lot of people stopped after one playthrough.Random thoughts :- Sidekicks need to go. They keep breaking the atmosphere by spouting out atrocious one liners, they deal virtually no damage and are immortal so you never care for them. - Raid mode is really good if you're into skinner box type of gameplay- I still don't know what the story's about- Jill sounds like a burned-out mom			"

												This is one of those games where even the flaws are something you look over as being beauty marks. Raid mode makes it a game you can pick up and kill some time on any time you really want to, but because of raid mode you'll want to finish the story just to unlock more levels of raid mode. This is not to say the story is bad in any way, as many new characters such as Grinder and Jackass are interesting and funny characters that could easily be desearving of their own game. However Raid mode is a huge selling point. A good amount of the time you'll invest may be in finding your perfect gun, or the fastest route through a map or just trying to beat an old score. Normally grinding and leveling like that isn't for everyone but I feel like its something a lot of people would enjoy if they played it. Tied with RE4 For favorite Resident evil game.			"

												For a game that was ported from the 3DS & was made after RE6 this game is surprisingly good.  Not great, but good.PROS-Solid Controls & Gameplay-Decent Survivor Horror Elements-Better Companion System-Metroidvania-like Exploration-Weapon Upgrades-Online Multiplayer Modes-Decent Graphics (IMO)CONS-Stale Level Design-Scanning is kind of pointless-Too much Action Elements-Not enough Horror Elements-Takes itself too seriously-Stale Character Development-Companions are Still Pretty UselessSTORYThe Story revolves around a cruise ship being hijacked by zombies & a town that was destroyed in similar style of Racoon City.  You play Primarily as Jill & switch between other characters in flash back segments.  Most of the flash back segments revolve around Action & Fast Paced Shooting while the ship segments are more based on Survival Horror in the style of RE4.  While not as good as RE4 or previous renditions it still does a decent job at the scares every now and then.FEATURESThis game is a port of the handheld versions, so don't expect anything amazing.  It is an amazing game on the handheld, as I have been playing that version as well.  I do think that some things were lost when ported to the PC but that's mostly a small gripe.The game's graphics are alright.  Not amazing but they aren't terrible either.  It's sort of a combination of RE4 & RE5 style of graphics.  They don't mesh out well but it's not really displeasing to look at.  There are no super astounding shading or lighting effects, though.  I actually think some lighting effects were done better on the 3DS than in this PC port.  The FMV Cutscenes are really good looking though.  It makes me wish the whole game looked like that because they are so good looking.I haven't gotten too far into the game, I think.  I'm about halfway into the fourth chapter, but the one complaint I have is the enemy variation.  It's mostly the same enemy, reskinned with new attacks & flesh weaponry.  There's one with arm maces, one with arm blades, one with an arm crossbow, etc.  The first huge annoyance I've suffered with this game was the first real boss fight.  A big bullet sponge with instant kill attacks surrounded by tough enemies that keep respawning.  There is no real tension or fear in this fight, just blatant annoyance forcing you to place one or two shots then keep running & repeat.  It would have been a lot better if they just made the boss tougher & didn't have the annoying enemy respawns.  More annoying in this version though is the first Rifle that you find in the 3DS version before the boss fight seems to have been moved in this version, but the ammo is still there.  Why bother moving a gun if you're not gonna replace the ammo with ones I need?  That's just stupid.Then there's RAID mode!  It's basically a mode that allows online multiplayer against the zombies, but zombies are more varied in size & difficulty.  There are small quick ones, large lumbering slow ones, & of course, raid bosses.  This is basically what it sounds like.  A run & gun collectathon for items & equipment.  You have to play through the Main Campaign to unlock more levels of Raid Mode.   Raid Mode also has a solo mode but is much harder since it doesn't make enemies weaker.  It's balanced enough for both single & multiplayer, but you need proper leveled guns in order to complete a level.  Don't bother going into a level 7 mission with level 1 guns.  You will fail & run out of bullets prematurely due to lack of damage being dealt.You also have a scanner in the Campaign, which serves as a collectathon device.  You use it to find hidden items, ammo & hand prints.  You also need to scan enemies in order to recieve more healing items.  I don't know why they did it this way.  You also recieve less ""Scan Points"" if you scan the same enemy constantly or scan them after they die.  So, if you need healing items you need to scan them while they're alive to increase the point gain.  It's kind of like Metroid Prime, except not as well done.  You don't get any enemy lore or hints on how to beat them easier when you scan.  It just serves as a heal item generator & invisible ammo finder.  Honestly, I think it was kind of a pointless addition.  I get it is supposed to be a ""Risk & Reward"" system for recieving healing items, but I'd much rather just have an extra herb or two put in a room with enemies than being forced to leave myself open to attack so I can scan them to get a healing item that I'm probably gonna have to use right away now because I was attacked while scanning them.You also get to upgrade weapons with mods.  Mods are also earned in raid mode & give a variety of bonuses such as increased fire rate, damage, & ammo capacity.  You find mods scattered throughout the levels hidden in safes or just in the scenery.  Keep an eye out for anything useful like this, especially ammo bags.  They increase the max amount you can carry.Another improvement is the Companion System.  No longer are you forced to babysit, but there's also a lack of a co-op through the Campaign mode & companions are still relatively useless.  They don't need ammo, they don't need healing, but they don't really serve a purpose.  They fire maybe one shot every few seconds, usually missing, & mobs don't bother attacking them.  So, the only reason the companions exist is for the story itself & maybe as an introduction to them for Raid mode.  Also, they tend to stand around in an area while you do all the work somewhere else.  It's a better system than RE5's terrible companion who if dies you fail the mission & basically forced you to play on easy or with online co-op, but it's still not a very good system in general.The level design leaves a bit to be desired.  You're on a huge cruise ship, but most of the time it feels like you're in a huge mansion.  The game allows you to explore it freely to an extent, as some areas are cut off until you get a specific key through the story progression but those keys often lead to extra rooms filled with goodies like ammo or upgrades.  And trust me, you need all the ammo you can get in this game because it is pretty scarce.  I found myself completely out of ammo after the first boss fight & had to run from enemies & knife them.  Good luck fighting some more annoying enemies without any ammo. OVERALLI'd say this game is actually better than I thought it would be.  It's not great, not ground breaking in any way & doesn't do anything that other Resident Evil or other games haven't done already but it's not bad at all.  It does take itself too seriously at times.  There's no witty banter between characters & not really much dialog inbetween cutscenes or mission directive but it's still a decent game worthy of picking up on a good enough sale.  It's also worth picking up on the N3DS if you have one.			"

												It was so refreshing to be back in the Resident Evil universe after a long break since the failure that was Resident Evil 5, and Revelations has done a magnificent job of reviving my faith in the franchise. Let me first state that I am, indeed, one of those purists that thinks RE1 was the pinacle of the franchise, and that the decision to move away from fixed camera angles really took something of the dread away from every corner and corridoor you couldn't quite see the end of. With that out of the way and taken as a given, Revelations is a good action game. Good, not great, good.Let's get the bad stuff out of the way shall we? As an action game, the controls don't really cut it in comparison to other fast-paced action titles. Strafing is a little too slow, particularly for those of us who are used to using strafe to get around corners, and made me feel like I was driving a fire engine rather than an athlete in a cat suit. The bindings are an improvement on previous games, but I still found myself modifying them to match ""the norm"". There was a distinct lack of hoard activity, which is something I discovered while playing Revelations, that I have come to take for granted since RE2, and was a little confused in the end as to why they were not implemented. What they have done to Hunters also made me shed a tear, and I can only assume it was in order to make dodging have a reason to be included.On to the good stuff! By an absolute country mile, the best thing about Revelations is the story, as you would expect from a long-running franchise. The plot twists and cut scenes were great, and were just as much part of the game as the gameplay itself. Playing as other characters to fill out the story didn't feel like a chore as it does in a lot of games, and I think the key to that is taking the RPG element out of it, and rather focussing on gun modification instead. Kitting said characters out in a somewhat OP fashion always helps though. I thought the inclusion of the ""Last time on..."" cut scenes after loading a save (and the ability to make them go away too - I'm looking at you AMC) was a great inclusion, especially if I hadn't played for a couple of days. Pretty much the only saving grace for Revelations, as an action game, were the boss fights. If anything, I wish there had have been more of them and against different BOW's, but the variation in what was there in terms of enemies was good.I bought Revelations on sale, and having played it, I probably wouldn't pay the $40 or whatever they are asking for it at the moment, but for anything under $15 it's great value. There's an arena-style multiplayer element to it as well, but after playing Dead Island I'd had my fill of that, so didn't explore it too much. I'm keen to see how Capcom plans to put this series back in the Survival Horror genre, and really aplaud them on splitting Revelations from the other Resident Evil mainstream titles (which they plan to keep as action games), in order to give fans like me what they have been asking for repeatedly after Resident Evil: Nemesis.

												This is a very good port work for a mobile game ( I even forgot I was playing a port!).  The graphics are still top notch.  Dialog is a bit cheesy at times just like any Resident Evil game. Not really as much survival horror as some of the other RE's in the past, but more so than RE5 and RE6 for sure. Had more fun in the overall story than what I did with RE6 I think.  Wasnt cursing at the screen because of the controls as much thats for sure.  I do remember going with ""RUN B!!!!!!!!iiiIIIII555HHHHHHH THAT BUZZSAW ZOMBIE VERSION OF WAYNE KNIGHT IS RIGHT BEHIND YOU!!!""RAID mode has much more ""fun"" than what I'll ever use.  It's kind of a level up, get more guns, fight harder enemies type of cycle that borderlands has.  Can be a bit hard if you go over your level too much though.  I would like to see more RAID mode type items in future, more action related entries of Resident Evil.			"

RECOMMENDATION LEVEL|-|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|▓▓▓▓▓▓|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|+|Being an HD remake of the original 3DS game Revelations is not going to win awards neither on ps3 or pc for its visuals. Character models are decent, while most of the environmental objects are rather simplified and textures are also quite low resolution. While I traversed through the ""world"" I got used to it however. In the end the muddy visuals even add to the atmosphere.Controls while being the best in the series, still far worse than most of the shooters I have played. And believe me I tried a few really bad one. I used keyboard and mouse, which is far better than anything on console, even modified the fov to 85 degrees, so I had the most pleasant way. Still, as the previous titles, RE's controls are still rather clunky and they simply cannot be compared to a refined control system.Revelations mostly takes place on a luxury cruiser abandoned in the open ocean. This means that there are rather dark and tight corridors in the crew area and a few more open and better lighted spaces like a hall, a solarium, a casino and a cafeteria. The overall feeling while exploring is quite similar to the first game's. You have to collect a bunch of different keys to open up initially closed parts of the ship. Bactracking is quite usual. Resource management is also taken into account, however it feels somewhat simplified. In addition the player has a scanner which can be used to search for hidden items in the vicinity. I think that exploration is the strongest part of the franhchise and Revelations definitely has some of it. My biggest problem was the other half of the game which was featured sequences. In these parts of the campaign the player controls different characters in various places and dates. This pretty much adds to the story element while basically negating any advancement the player gained through item upgrades as these segments are using separate and partially fixed weapons and ammo. I feel that there is a need for these snippets to glue the story together, but there are too many of them, some of them even being annoying and almost pointless.Music is a mixed bag. More intense scenes have annoying background tracks, while the slower exploration parts have less prominent, but decent enough soundtrack to aid the the atmosphere. Overall sound quality is decent. Guns and monsters sound generic, but they are immersive enough. Voice acting is acceptable.Raid mode lets players replay segments from the campaign with unique enemy spawns and scattered loot. It is pretty simple and cheap at times. There is a score system based on accuracy, finish time and taken damage similarly to the campaign. Finishing longer levels with the no damage medal is frustrating due to mechanics and monster spawn. Better gear can be gained and upgraded with parts which also gathered through levels. Additional upgrades can be bought from the raid store which expands inventory size for various items for example. A few of them carries over to the campaign, I heard. I did not see any of it, but who knows.In addition for those who are finished the campaign there is a NG+ mode with all the weapons and upgrades maintained. An option to change outfits will also appear in the campaign menu. This is definitely adds some variety on the second run.Overall, I am not a big fan of the Resident Evil series, mostly due to the infamous tank controls scheme. This is the first game that I could play through. I like the exploration, but I need proper mechanics to enjoy it which is while far not perfect, but still decent enough in Revelations' case.MY OPINION: 7.5/10 (GOOD)Graphics: 7/10World Design: 8/10Gameplay: 7/10Sound: 7/10Replay Value: 8/10			"

												Im going to completley ignore the graphics, after all it is a port from a handheld, however this game has way too many flaws to make it worth buying. One of the first things I noticed is that the bullet sponges they used in place of enemies have no clear death animation which led to me pumping them full of extra bullets by accident becuase the twtichy ♥♥♥♥ers dont show they have taken any real damage.There are way to many situations in the short time i played this game where i was thrust into a room with a stack of ammo that couldnt fill even half of my inventory and then have a plethora of enemies shoved at me in a locked room in a predictable attempt to elongate the gameplay.The story feels more like a teen fanfiction with cardboard cutout and self-insert characters that are incapable of showing any emotion that dosent include the word grim. Some of the plot developments are so nonsensical too. Spoiler, there is a scene where a city is destroyed by using what is effectively a giant mirror to focus sunlight on one spot which leads to the buildings collapsing controlled demolition style.Finally there is so much fan service here. the amount of times the camera panned across Jills body or focused on♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥♥was ridiculous. At least we know why the games so bad, it was built in a swing of postmasturbatory shame. And thats what it feels like, A build up of excitement as you start up the next resident evil only to leave yourself sticky, tired and ashamed of what you just did.			"

One of the first things I noticed is that the bullet sponges they used in place of enemies have no clear death animation which led to me pumping them full of extra bullets by accident becuase the twtichy ♥♥♥♥ers dont show they have taken any real damage.There are way to many situations in the short time i played this game where i was thrust into a room with a stack of ammo that couldnt fill even half of my inventory and then have a plethora of enemies shoved at me in a locked room in a predictable attempt to elongate the gameplay.The story feels more like a teen fanfiction with cardboard cutout and self-insert characters that are incapable of showing any emotion that dosent include the word grim. Some of the plot developments are so nonsensical too. Spoiler, there is a scene where a city is destroyed by using what is effectively a giant mirror to focus sunlight on one spot which leads to the buildings collapsing controlled demolition style.Finally there is so much fan service here. the amount of times the camera panned across Jills body or focused on♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥♥was ridiculous. At least we know why the games so bad, it was built in a swing of postmasturbatory shame. And thats what it feels like, A build up of excitement as you start up the next resident evil only to leave yourself sticky, tired and ashamed of what you just did.			"

RECOMMENDATION LEVEL|-|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|▓▓▓▓▓▓|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|+|Being an HD remake of the original 3DS game Revelations is not going to win awards neither on ps3 or pc for its visuals. Character models are decent, while most of the environmental objects are rather simplified and textures are also quite low resolution. While I traversed through the ""world"" I got used to it however. In the end the muddy visuals even add to the atmosphere.Controls while being the best in the series, still far worse than most of the shooters I have played. And believe me I tried a few really bad one. I used keyboard and mouse, which is far better than anything on console, even modified the fov to 85 degrees, so I had the most pleasant way. Still, as the previous titles, RE's controls are still rather clunky and they simply cannot be compared to a refined control system.Revelations mostly takes place on a luxury cruiser abandoned in the open ocean. This means that there are rather dark and tight corridors in the crew area and a few more open and better lighted spaces like a hall, a solarium, a casino and a cafeteria. The overall feeling while exploring is quite similar to the first game's. You have to collect a bunch of different keys to open up initially closed parts of the ship. Bactracking is quite usual. Resource management is also taken into account, however it feels somewhat simplified. In addition the player has a scanner which can be used to search for hidden items in the vicinity. I think that exploration is the strongest part of the franhchise and Revelations definitely has some of it. My biggest problem was the other half of the game which was featured sequences. In these parts of the campaign the player controls different characters in various places and dates. This pretty much adds to the story element while basically negating any advancement the player gained through item upgrades as these segments are using separate and partially fixed weapons and ammo. I feel that there is a need for these snippets to glue the story together, but there are too many of them, some of them even being annoying and almost pointless.Music is a mixed bag. More intense scenes have annoying background tracks, while the slower exploration parts have less prominent, but decent enough soundtrack to aid the the atmosphere. Overall sound quality is decent. Guns and monsters sound generic, but they are immersive enough. Voice acting is acceptable.Raid mode lets players replay segments from the campaign with unique enemy spawns and scattered loot. It is pretty simple and cheap at times. There is a score system based on accuracy, finish time and taken damage similarly to the campaign. Finishing longer levels with the no damage medal is frustrating due to mechanics and monster spawn. Better gear can be gained and upgraded with parts which also gathered through levels. Additional upgrades can be bought from the raid store which expands inventory size for various items for example. A few of them carries over to the campaign, I heard. I did not see any of it, but who knows.In addition for those who are finished the campaign there is a NG+ mode with all the weapons and upgrades maintained. An option to change outfits will also appear in the campaign menu. This is definitely adds some variety on the second run.Overall, I am not a big fan of the Resident Evil series, mostly due to the infamous tank controls scheme. This is the first game that I could play through. I like the exploration, but I need proper mechanics to enjoy it which is while far not perfect, but still decent enough in Revelations' case.MY OPINION: 7.5/10 (GOOD)Graphics: 7/10World Design: 8/10Gameplay: 7/10Sound: 7/10Replay Value: 8/10			"

												For everyone disappointed by Resident Evil 5 and 6, Resident Evil Revelations delivers the update Resident Evil experience that 5 and 6 wanted to be. A fine entry into the series, especially if you were a fan of Resident Evil 4. Though not as skin crawlingly creepy as say RE2 or Code Veronica, it will having jumping at shadows for at least a couple of days.			"

												This biohazard is more of a throwback to the first game. One main location that it takes place in with some minor cuts into other scenes to add to the main plot. Nicely done Capcom, too bad this was only released for 3DS and pc. The mouse controls are amazing, no longer does it feel sluggish and clunky like it did in the previous PC Biohazard releases. The issues that people have with stuttering on the doors is due to the game loading the area map, all you're doing is waiting in a room anyway; I'd rather have it stutter there loading rather than have the game stuttering w/ texture popins as I'm walking around a corner. The story for the game takes place between Bio 4 and Bio 5, it depects how the BSAA was formed and introduces a lot of new characters to the Biohazard mix.			"

												Well I really want to say this game is great, I like the monster designs, the game has extremely intense, creepy and difficult moments. But lord does this game drag out the story, It's like at some point the developers were punishing the consumer for buying the game by keeping the story running past the point of interest. Raid mode, is well raid mode, not a bad experience and is enjoyable, which of course is made better when playing with a friend.The game controls are awkward and stiff and what you would expect in a Resident Evil game (I came from Resident Evil 6 to this so I was a bit disappointed in character movement).However, in comparison to many other AAA titles with an extremely large price tag (that never drops) and questionable season pass you do get what you pay for in Resident Evil Revelations.

												A post Resident Evil 4 game so you more or less know what to expect. The combat system/gameplay is pretty much the same as Resident Evil 4 so there aren't too many surprises here. Unlike the earlier Resident Evil games, this one holds your hand. I played it in normal and though there were moments that I found difficult/scary, the game did a lot of the work for me. An example of this would be in the instances where a password was needed to advance through the game. I'd either click on an item or read through a file, return to where this password was needed and without having to input it myself, it was done for me. This really surprised me because I'm a diehard fan of the original Resident Evil games. In the earlier games, I would've had to read through the file myself, discern what was of importance, and eventually input the password myself. This doesn't ruin the game, but it is one of the flaws I've noticed in modern Resident Evil games. Despite this flaw, I enjoyed this game and I definitely recommend that you play it. I give it a 3.5/5.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations (from here forward known as Resilations) is a pretty solid Resident Evil game, not amazing or revolutionary, but it's enough to get your survival horror mojo going if you're a fan of the series. If you've never played a Resident Evil I recommend the HD remake of the original to Resilations.As a Resident Evil game it fits somewhere in between Code Veronica and RE4 in terms of the horror/action/hilariously convoluted storytelling ratio. It does a good job of making itself feel like it's more challenging and is putting you in more danger than it really is and the Queen Zenobia is a pretty good location to set the game in. The early moments where the game lets the atmospheric groan of the empty ship surround you as the screen shifts every so slightly to the rhythm of the ocean are the most unnerving parts of the game. Eventually it becomes obvious that ammo and health is pretty plentiful and you're feel too well equipped by the end of the game for it to be scary or even more than a little tense.It's pretty obvious that this is a port from the 3DS. While very impressive on that piece of hardware even an HD facelife doesn't keep it from looking dated, even the cutscenes have a stange grainy/poorly compressed look to them. It's also still apparent that it was meant to be played in small chunks. The game is split into little episodes that usually run roughly 45 minutes and end on a big cliff hanger (which usually resolves in the silliest way possible) it was obviously designed around playing on a commute or lunch hour. It even plays a little ""last time on Resilations"" recap before each episode like it's assuming you're not going to play the game for long periods. Playing it sporadically probably helped hide some of the games issues with backtracking. At one point you escape a flooded area and the the next episode you just dive back in and swim though it all over again.The best parts of the game revolve around Jill Valentine investigating the Queen Zenobia, but you're constantly being pulled from that storyline the plotlines of other characters and when you're back to Jill you end up backtracking a decent amount meaning that, in an already short game, you just don't get enough of the best parts. Tht being said Resilations is overall a solid games and is still a good game even when you're not in the Jill Valentine segments. The RE4 style mechanincs for fighting are fun even if Resilations doesn't have that game's excellent level design to play around with it in. Raid mode adds some life to the short campaign although your milage may vary with it.			"

												A step in the right direction for the series, but still falls short of greatness from some really terrible voice acting, short chapters, and fairly shallow twists. At the base of it all, though, it's still a fun game. Boss fights can be somewhat challenging, though they don't hold a candle to RE4. Definitely worth a playthrough, but it's not the best game in the series.			"

												Best Resident Evil of the 2000s. Slightly returns to survivial horoor which is great! The camera angle is still over the shoulder but brings back the creepy dark atmosphere. Playing as Jill and Chris for most of the story is a huge plus. While the story is good some of the monsters are a little lame which is only downside I can say about the game. The bonus game mode ""Raid Mode"" is where most of the fun comes in. Raid mode is both challenging and fun and even to this day I still have a good time playing it.			"

Posted: March 29, 2016
												Quick Summary: Third person action shooter very similar to Resident Evil 5, but at times noticeably lower graphics and some actual downgrades in gameplay mechanics. This is likely due to the fact that Revelations is a port of a Nintendo hand held game, later upgraded with HD graphics, and was never meant to be the next “great” Resident Evil game. Still, it’s fun and time consuming so you’ll get your money’s worth even if you didn’t buy the various DLCs. Despite the fact that Revelations was released a few years after Resident Evil 5, the story of Revelations actually takes place earlier, as a kind of prequel (though unrelated plot-wise). You play BSAA agent Jill Valentine for the most part, but in each chapter you’ll regularly control different people such as Chris Redfield or other BSAA agents.  You know Jill is the main character though since she’s the only one who can mod her weapons with upgrade kits, and swap guns at the various loadout crates scattered around the area. Jill and her partner Parker are on a mission exploring an abandoned cruise ship related to terrorist activity from years before. As usual in Resident Evil games, “terrorist” means bio-weapons that create monsters to be unleashed on the world. This time around the weapon in question is the T-Abyss virus, that doesn’t make traditional zombies, but instead makes “oozes” which look kind of like humanoid tubeworms with claws and spiky teeth. Of course, that’s just the weak stuff. There are a bunch of giant bosses and super creepy monsters wandering the cruise ship as well. If you’ve played Resident Evil 5, the gameplay should be very familiar to you, except that now you can just press the mouse button for a quick jab attack. Just like in RE 5 though, regular melee isn’t much use except for breaking boxes in the campaign (it’s more useful in Raid mode). You still have special contextual power hits that do a lot of damage to stunned enemies, but it’s a lot harder to set up stuns in Revelations. To kill most enemies you’ll have to rely on your guns. Various guns are found throughout the game (you can’t buy them in campaign) and they can only be upgraded with weapon “parts” that you find lying around. For example, your basic pistol may have 3 upgrade slots so you can add up to 3 weapon upgrades like + damage, faster shooting, and larger magazine, and swap for better ones that you find later. There’s no “money” used in the campaign for buying upgrades. Also note that even though you are usually with a partner throughout the campaign, this is not a co-op game. You cannot go through the story with a friend. Another new feature for Revelations is the Genesis device, which is just a scanner despite its fancy name. You can quickly switch to the scanner at almost any time to scan enemies (alive or dead) and it adds a % to your “data.” For example scanning an ooze could give you 10% and scanning a tougher enemy might give you 20%. Every time you reach 100%, you get a healing herb added to your inventory, and the % resets to 0. It’s a slow but steady way to gain herbs at various points in the game. The Genesis can also be used to locate hidden items (like ammo or herbs) lying invisible on the ground.Pros:+A spooky Resident Evil game with enemies more gruesome than zombies, and no “human” enemies so you don’t need to hide from enemy gunfire (though there are some ranged oozes). There is a lot of backtracking in this game, and you’re going to go through most areas of the cruise ship several times. This means you have opportunities to pick up things that you missed the previous times through. +The story is compelling, but it’s episodic which means every chapter starts with a “previously on Resident Evil Revelations” cutscene to catch you up in case you didn’t buy every episode. +The Raid mode is the highlight of the game and allows you and a partner to level up by playing through areas from the game’s campaign. You also acquire BP (kind of like money) that you can use to buy weapons and weapon upgrade parts. You’ll need to get new gear when you level up because weapons have fixed levels. For example you start at level 1 with a level 1 gun, but when you’ve advanced, you may want to buy a level 2 gun, etc.Cons:-Since this is a mobile game port, the graphics and handling isn’t quite up to snuff compared to Resident Evil 5 or 6. There’s some frame rate stuttering on my computer (which ran RE 5 smoothly), and like Resident Evil 6, every time you start the game there are half a dozen little load screens to wait through. -The game’s co-op Raid mode doesn’t have that many people playing anymore apparently. This may be because you can’t “drop in” to someone’s game. The host has to set up a game and wait for people to join, sometimes for a long time if nobody is searching for a match that very second. Most people probably don’t have the patience for that. This means if you want to play co-op, you need to set it up with a friend beforehand. Also, like RE 5, there’s no text or voice chat in the co-op.Overall, the game is a fun continuation of the action shooter style of Resident Evil games, and the creepy deserted cruise ship has a nice atmosphere for horror. Raid mode will occupy a lot of your time after you’ve finished the story. Once you’ve mastered Raid mode’s Abyss tier of levels, the campaign’s Infernal difficulty (hard mode) will seem like a walk in the park.			"

												The days of the old gritty mysterious Resident Evil are over and I will miss them...BUT as much as I do, I thinkthe franchise took a step forward in the right direction with Revelations at least for the meantime. Storytelling is episodic and gameplay is what you would expect from any other resident evil game with a twist of action, you get to play as many different characters on many different missions folding into eachother to tell this decent and very interesting Resident Evil story. Theres even a ""Raid Mode"" that you can unlock by playing the entire 8 to 10 hour campaign. Raid Mode will have you run through familiar terrain killing water zombies with large health bars for rank, bonuses, enemy spoils, BP and EXP. You can play with a friend or test yourself. I would say this is the equivelant of Zombies in COD.I give this game a 7/10 for its decent story and familiar gameplay with the addition of Raid Mode and New Game+. Hopefully in the very near future the franchise will start making newer Resident Evils with the originals in complete thought.			"

												pros+ Great horror atmoshpere! Something that had been lost to the series since RE4, IMHO.+ Action-packed gameplay. + A pretty decent storyline with legitimately exciting and thrilling scenes.+ Interesting weapon customization system.+  Raid mode is quite fun. And New Game+ also adds a lot of replay value, IMHO.+ Jill is really sexy. ^^neutral> It's considerably harder to stun enemies compared to other RE4, 5 and 6. It adds to the challenge and makes the game scarier, but at the same time, it reduces one of the most fun aspects of modern RE games.cons- No campaign multiplayer. :(- Enemy design is somewhat uninspired and repetitive. Only bosses look somewhat creative.CONCLUSION:Resident Evil Revelations is my favorite game of the franchise. No other installment mixed so well the horror atmosphere of the classic games with the action-based gameplay ofthe newer ones. Overall, a great experience, and a must-have for all fans of the series, in my humble opinion.			"

												It just baffles me how anybody can give this game a positive review. This game is a mess. It is one of the worst games I have ever played. Why? Because it just ♥♥♥♥♥ on everything the predecessors have done. Remember the sense of near death which was omnipresent in the last RE games? ♥♥♥♥ that we will just give you tons of healing stuff n♥♥♥♥♥♥ Low on ammo? ♥♥♥♥ that too - almost unlimited ammo. Searching for ammo and herbs in cabinets or boxes? Too illogical! Let's give you a scanner so you can search for ammo in SOLID METAL WALLS and freakin terminals. Money? Nope don't need that♥♥♥♥♥♥ Zombies? HELL NO, THIS IS NO DAMN ZOMBIE GAME!  Big Areas in which you can get surrounded? naha narrow hallways (enemies almost always spawn in front of you) all up in that ♥♥♥♥♥♥. [...]I can't even describe how♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I am that i even bought this piece of crap. I got it while it was on sale and still feel bamboozled. On top of all that they put a damn weak storyline, insanely bad dialogues (even the voice actors seem bored), plastic weapons (sometimes your bullets seem to just do nothing - kinda reminds me of an MMO where all enemies just got health bars), very badly written characters, bad pacing, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AWFUL QTE's (move mouse from left to right 10 times. YAY!), a broken dodge system (that works at a 100% success rate with a controller but sometimes is pure luck with the keybord [freaking button to dodge is ""W""!]),.... this list goes on forever.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!2/10 (for sometimes nice visual design and nice♥♥♥♥♥			"

Product received for free
【NOTE】 I did my first playthrough on Infernal difficulty, meaning I can only review the game on the hardest difficulty.Rating: Super Positive <3Game Progress: Completed the campaign on Infernal difficulty with 20-ish collectibles out of 30, Raid Mode is untouched.Actual Campaign Playtime: 09:30:'21"" (HH:MM:SS)Campaign Total: 80% Accuracy (A) 35 Deaths (A)Game Knowledge: In-game manual, keyboard settings, basics and infernal difficulty.【Instructions for first timers】 Okay right off the bat, not even the game wants you to pick the highest difficulty on your first run because you get a warning. Which is understandable. But if you play Infernal despite the warning that the game gives you then the game simply expects that you know what you're doing. The game has a manual in your inventory that you can read to understand some basics. You also get right into enemy action which is great so that you can do some practice to understand how the game works. I think the game does a great job for first timers. It warns them about the highest difficulty, it offers a game manual and you get in-game tips when you need them the most. Even for bosses!【Unique Resident Evil Stuff】Now this game is special. Never have I ever seen anything in Resident Evil like Revelations. Revelations has a unique mechanic in the form of a scanner which you can use to scan a area for ammo, herbs, custom parts or just secrets in general. You can even scan the enemies you face, either dead or alive. The scanner is a very useful and cool item that adds a nice touch to the atmosphere and you feel alot more like you're inside the game when you carefully scan each area with caution to find all the hidden stuff. It's a great touch! It makes back tracking way more fun and finding those super cool secrets just makes it extra thrilling. Not to mention that you get a herb (Healing item) everytime your scanner reaches 100%. It's an useful mechanic and I love the fact that they went from traditional items in plain sight to completely hidden items that required you to use an optional yet highly useful item to find the items. It adds to the 'sea' atmosphere. Where divers have to scan for treasures, if you feel me. The Resident Evil series does have sea creatures, plenty of sea creatures to say the least. BUT, I've never seen a Resident Evil with this much focus on sea creatures ever before! The game has a great style in creatures. The creatures really gives a deep sea feeling. They look wet from water and they look very 'sea crispy' - Very strong looks that resembels already existing creatures of the sea. From my own Resident Evil experience have I never seen a 'partner-swap' before. In a story-related moment in the game, the characters swap partners with each other which will obviously add a more interesting twist in story where you get to see new character interactions! Revelations is different, well I'll tell you that the game has no store in the campaign. There are weapon boxes scattered around but that was only to upgrade your weapons or swap weapons but that was upgrades and weapons that YOU HAVE FOUND YOURSELF. Revelations was a straight up exploration game above all and I think it's an excellent move to turn a game with such mystery and atmosphere into a exploration game. That was a thing I highly liked. Obviously the game can be fun with buying your way through but I think it added a bit more of a nicer touch that you HAD to explore in order to get anywhere. Top-notch, full glass for Capcom here!【Combat】Similar to Resident Evil 6 you can quickly melee your enemies with a quick click on the left mouse button though it's alot more risky in Revelations since you move slower, you are vulnerable and you don't really stun your enemy when you use your melee attack. I barely used melee at all, only on THE MOST SAFE MOMENTS POSSIBLE. You can also hit F when the enemies are stunned to perform a takedown (Won't always kill) which can save you about 3 bullets or so. The guns were very well played-out. You could use each firearm without ever feeling like picking a side. Handguns were just fine with decent damage and lots of ammo, machine guns were really great if you went into trouble of a crowded hallway if you have fire rate upgrades, Shotguns was used when I felt bullied by the enemies to knock them back to save me some time and ammo so I could get past them. Sniper rifles were used when I got to those sneaky moments where the enemy hasn't detected me yet so I could sneak a headshot on them. Magnums were used for those big fellas that I just wanted to murder away, such as bosses. But I love the fact that each weapon felt useful and that there wasn't a single weapon that just screamed MEH. Ammo wasn't ever an issue. You used your scanner ""Genesis"" to find ammo until you were filled. And during bosses you could use your surroundings in order to save your ammo. Combat was really fine and fun!【Locations】 The game is not just on a ship. You get backstories set before the ship and you get to play different sides throughout the story. Keith, Parker, Chris and Jill is all there for you to play as!【Conclusion】 I'd highly recommend this for Resident Evil fans! Combat is really well done, game runs super smooth and ost is 100% <3(Text limit) Ask me if you wanna know more :)			"

												Now that I unlocked all achievements I can finally put the game aside and never play it again in the near future. The only reason might be to S rank the remaining campaign chapters I haven’t done yet or to unlock even more achievments in the free online portal found on residentevil.net. So here we begin this in two sections separated review. First we sink into the campaign mode before we head on to the action packed Raid Mode.CampaignPeople will tell you that Revelations was the first step of Capcom to bring the series back to its survival horror roots but I can’t completely agree with that. The campaign is split into 12 chapters. The majority of chapters take place on a cruise ship while others are more of the typical action shooter the series is known for today with various changing locations and time periods. The cruise ship chapters feature narrow corridors, somewhat creepy atmosphere and are surprising the best chapters of the game while the action oriented chapters are mediocre at best compared to other action shooter games out there.The storyline is one gigantic puzzle jumping back & forth between events and can be very confusing the first time around. But it’s not as convoluted as they say. It’s easy to differentiate who are the bad guys & good guys in this soap opera. To put the pieces together can be a very entertaining & is a motivator to continue playing until the end.You run around mostly solo and if a partner is on your toes then it’s only an AI controlled partner. Unlike other entries the AI partner in Revelations doesn’t need to be instructed because he/she is basically invincible, got infinite ammo and shoots or doges when the need to shoot or dodge is required. The player is the true source of power in the roughly 11hour campaign here. He/she is is the one to deal the damage & the one that needs to heal himself.Gameplay mechanics are very simple. This is after all a 3DS game ported & remastered for PC. Healing, throwing grenades, using the knife are bound to only a button and can be executed quick without much time of preparation which is a good thing compared to the clunky, overloaded mechanics used in other entries of the series. The only game mechanic that is poorly implemented is the Dodging-System. You basically have to push the action button & the analog stick short before an enemy hits you. But this button is bound to other actions like opening doors, shooting with the gun & picking up items and doesn’t work most of the time and requires lots of practice to be used to its fully extend.Raid ModeFirst introduced in Revelations 1 is the so called Raid Mode. This mode spawns three difficulties with 20 stages that must be unlocked as you play along. Raid is basically an Arcade Shooter in which you will be throw in all the locations of campaign mode and to solve tasks like killing all enemies or reaching the goal. Enemy spawns are fixed so they can be learned easily. You either play it alone or you invite one of your Steam Friends or search for strangers to play it in Co-Op. After each stage you will be rated on accuracy, enemies routed & damage taken and earns you XP that level up your characters. Perfect players will be awarded with bonuses for no damage taken, elimination of all enemies and completing a stage at the recommended level. This results in higher currency which then can be used to buy new weapons and weapon upgrades in the in game shop.Leveling up will raise the level of all characters. Characters are mere avatars with different skill sets. Some are good with SMGs, while others are better in using Shotguns, to take less damage or to dodge easier.The only negative I have to write about Raid Mode is the lack of stages & the sheer amount of time investment to reach a new player level. Leveling up is so freaking slow that you replay some stages 10 or more times before you are able to survive in the next. Playing stages below recommented level & with an online partner is the key for faster level up, but it is a tedious process that gets you bored very quickly.ConclusionRevelations 1 is a fun little action shooter with horror elements that got so much to offer that you will be entertained for hours. Fans of the series should buy it without giving it a second thought. Achievement Hunters as well as casual gamers should think twice before they hit the purchase button, unless they are willing to spend time on the good but not perfect Raid Mode.			"

												This game is a port from a handheld console and it shows. While it's still fun to play theres a few things people should know before buying. The overall gameplay is not as deep as recent RE games.The ""coop"" is not like other RE games you cannot play the campaign coop. This was a major disapointment for me as I bought 2 copies to play with the missus. The coop they advertise is only the minigame you can play on the side and even then it's nothing like the Fight for your life maps in mercenaries mod like re 4 5 and 6. It's more of a small mission to get from point A to point B collecting xp and leveling up. I didn't like it anywhere near as much as it just seems like a grind rather then the frantic carnage that is mercenaries.I'm going to say no to recommending this game, Not because its bad like operation racoon city was but just because I can't imagine any of my friends enjoying it. It's good for a DS/vita game. Unfortunately it just can't compete with the big boy RE games.			"

The deception I feared before the game was released and more than confirmed once I played it.So I was like, ok man, what can be worst...?In fact I was actually surprised. I did like it very much! RE Revelations was actually pretty fun to play! Sure it is not a great game, but it's fairly good! Well I mean only when you play as Jill on the boat. The rest is crappy, useless. But honestly, for you old RE fans, it is a nice experience. Don't expect to be as good as the old ones, with charismatic characters and appealing plot. But the game has some nice features and interesting mecanics that I invite you to give them a shot. In solo, it's way better than RE5 and RE6 combined (I know, the challenge wasn't hard to overcome). If you guys have played Cold Fear, from Darkworks, you may enjoy this game as well.			"

												First off, only get this if it is $20 or less. Now, let's dig into the game:It's pretty much a 'classic' resident evil when you play as Jill with all the improvements of aiming and moving. I must clarify AS JILL because when you play as any other character the game is garbage. Seriously. In Resident Evil 4 and previous games, you spent a lot of time wandering around, collecting keys, and solving puzzles. All of that only happens as Jill while playing as other characters is basically go there, shoot that, and get bored from the truely horrifying bad story.Let's put more emphasis on the fact that the story is the only scary thing about this game. It's bad. Very bad. How bad? It has 'Revelations' as a tagline which suggests a twist in the story! This twist is predictable and EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts they are from a senior high drama class. I would say something about them being on drugs, but drugs would have improved the story, dialog, and characters.It took me about 5 hours to beat this game, and only 3~3.5 of it was with Jill. I didn't try Raid mode because who gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												In short, it feels like a streamlined hybrid of the earlier Resident Evil games mixed with Resident Evil 4, yet without all the shortcomings of Resident Evil 5 and 6. Revelations, at it's core, is a solo adventure with strong survival horror elements (lack of ammo/health). However, CO-OP elements return in a seperate mode from the main campaign called RAID mode, which is essentially RE4's mercenaries with RPG elements. Revelations ditches the open environments for tighter corridors in vein of the original Resident Evil's Spencer mansion. Puzzles return and new elements to the series such as swimming are introduced. Also, the chest box makes a welcome return, but it is only used for switching and customizing weapons. The storyline is good, but not quite as strong or dark as Resident Evil 4. At times, it feels more intune with Code: Veronica's wackiness, complete with cheesy B movie dialog and outragoues characters. However, that is all part of why most of us love Resident Evil...and this entry actually feels like a Resident Evil title for once. Just like Resident Evil 4, Revelations provides a good balance of action and survival horror, however, Revelations puts more emphasize on backtracking and conserving ammo. It's not as scary or polished as RE4, but introduces some great new features to the formula. This is the survival horror you've been craving for from Capcom.			"

												Action, thrilling moments, surprises, and zombies! What more could a surival-horror fan hope for? Well, this is one game that delivers! True to the Resident Evil games, this is an experience that's familiar to gamers, but all new in several ways. With the usual slew of disgusting mutated creatures, and fun weaponry to take them out with, there's not a whole lot to dislike here. Challenging in its' gameplay, it's a little more than just a button-mashing ammo fest. You might find different areas of the envirnoment to aid you... or trap you in a corner. It's up to your skills to decide. Definitely a must-have for any die-hard Resident Evil fan!			"

												I have completed 7-8 chapters out of what I think is 12. So far the game is good and I have enjoyed playing it. The whole abandonded boat theme is pretty original for a zombie game. However my only negative feeling is a lot of the 'creatures' seem to be repetitive or look pretty similar which gets a little boring. There are a few good boss type monsters and the split gameplay between characters makes it more enjoyable.			"

												This game shows how every resident evil title should look like!Gameplay is amazing and story is awesome!- Singleplayer story is simple but in my opinion way too easy!- Game is a good port- Multiplayer is pretty much alive- Community is pretty much positive and kind- You can play and get stuff from RE.netMy Suggestion:- Worth every money, if you're into RE games, BUY IT!

												Now that I unlocked all achievements I can finally put the game aside and never play it again in the near future. The only reason might be to S rank the remaining campaign chapters I haven’t done yet or to unlock even more achievments in the free online portal found on residentevil.net. So here we begin this in two sections separated review. First we sink into the campaign mode before we head on to the action packed Raid Mode.CampaignPeople will tell you that Revelations was the first step of Capcom to bring the series back to its survival horror roots but I can’t completely agree with that. The campaign is split into 12 chapters. The majority of chapters take place on a cruise ship while others are more of the typical action shooter the series is known for today with various changing locations and time periods. The cruise ship chapters feature narrow corridors, somewhat creepy atmosphere and are surprising the best chapters of the game while the action oriented chapters are mediocre at best compared to other action shooter games out there.The storyline is one gigantic puzzle jumping back & forth between events and can be very confusing the first time around. But it’s not as convoluted as they say. It’s easy to differentiate who are the bad guys & good guys in this soap opera. To put the pieces together can be a very entertaining & is a motivator to continue playing until the end.You run around mostly solo and if a partner is on your toes then it’s only an AI controlled partner. Unlike other entries the AI partner in Revelations doesn’t need to be instructed because he/she is basically invincible, got infinite ammo and shoots or doges when the need to shoot or dodge is required. The player is the true source of power in the roughly 11hour campaign here. He/she is is the one to deal the damage & the one that needs to heal himself.Gameplay mechanics are very simple. This is after all a 3DS game ported & remastered for PC. Healing, throwing grenades, using the knife are bound to only a button and can be executed quick without much time of preparation which is a good thing compared to the clunky, overloaded mechanics used in other entries of the series. The only game mechanic that is poorly implemented is the Dodging-System. You basically have to push the action button & the analog stick short before an enemy hits you. But this button is bound to other actions like opening doors, shooting with the gun & picking up items and doesn’t work most of the time and requires lots of practice to be used to its fully extend.Raid ModeFirst introduced in Revelations 1 is the so called Raid Mode. This mode spawns three difficulties with 20 stages that must be unlocked as you play along. Raid is basically an Arcade Shooter in which you will be throw in all the locations of campaign mode and to solve tasks like killing all enemies or reaching the goal. Enemy spawns are fixed so they can be learned easily. You either play it alone or you invite one of your Steam Friends or search for strangers to play it in Co-Op. After each stage you will be rated on accuracy, enemies routed & damage taken and earns you XP that level up your characters. Perfect players will be awarded with bonuses for no damage taken, elimination of all enemies and completing a stage at the recommended level. This results in higher currency which then can be used to buy new weapons and weapon upgrades in the in game shop.Leveling up will raise the level of all characters. Characters are mere avatars with different skill sets. Some are good with SMGs, while others are better in using Shotguns, to take less damage or to dodge easier.The only negative I have to write about Raid Mode is the lack of stages & the sheer amount of time investment to reach a new player level. Leveling up is so freaking slow that you replay some stages 10 or more times before you are able to survive in the next. Playing stages below recommented level & with an online partner is the key for faster level up, but it is a tedious process that gets you bored very quickly.ConclusionRevelations 1 is a fun little action shooter with horror elements that got so much to offer that you will be entertained for hours. Fans of the series should buy it without giving it a second thought. Achievement Hunters as well as casual gamers should think twice before they hit the purchase button, unless they are willing to spend time on the good but not perfect Raid Mode.			"

Played them through but I wasn't so convinced about their new style.This game on the other hand is pure RE to me. Feeling is so close to the original trilogy that it makes you shiver when you hear steps around the next corner or something breathing behind a door. There is so many same elements present as in originals.Cant' really say anything bad about it, reeeeeal good!			"

												Great addition to the resident evil series. The 3DS roots shine through the low quality graphics but if you can look past this you are in for a treat. Took me about 6 hours on normal to complete (probably a little more as steam time is inaccurate). The game has New Game + and Raid mode for more playability, which is a mini rpg where you level up, grind for new weapons to play more challenging maps, this can be played online for co-op which the story mode lacks.

												Is it the perfect Resident Evil game?No.But is it a fun Resident Evil game...?Heck yeah, and here's why:Nice story, good atmosphere, fluid action, a good voice cast, and Raid mode (go through the different stages and shoot through different difficulties of enemies, unlocking weapons, parts, etc through beating them). Though, of course, this game isn't without problems:The graphics are ok at best, though that's likely because it was originally on the 3DS. Also, while certain new characters like Parker and Raymond are great, others like Jessica, Quint, and Keith are... not so much. Playing the game on Normal, ammo is abundant, so a harder difficulty is recommended if you want to feel more of an actual challenge.  Lastly, the final boss is about 50/50 when it comes to enjoyability. To me, it was frustrating until I figured out its pattern, which didn't take too long. Overall, not my favorite Resident Evil, but still an enjoyable one for sure. If you get it discounted (or in my case, gifted), it's well worth your time.			"

												Revelations takes the Resident Evil series back to its origin and delivers a true survival horror experience.

												Resident Evil Revelations is a nice addition to the Franchise.  Although the fact that it was originally a 3ds game both surprises and disappoints me - it's a game much more deserving of a higher budget.Pros:+Multiple sides of the Story to see, reminds me of Resident Evil 6 without multiple campaigns.+I actually felt scared at a few points.  They successfully did horror.  Woohoo!+Game is pretty long for one that was handheld.Cons:-In my Opinion, the ending of the story isn't as satisfying as the buildup presents it to be.-The puzzles in the game are of very small variety.  Although they do bring back that Resident Evil 1 searching around the Mansion feel, I wish there were many different types of puzzles.  There is one type where you unscrew the panel next to a locked door and move some glowing circles around to unlock the circutry.  This got so tedious, so fast.  Not fun.-You can tell the controls aren't really perfected to pc, or even joystick for that matter.  They're just not that great.-No local or online coop campaign support.  Strange, considering you're with a partner 90% of the time.  I suppose this makes sense, because sometimes your partner is in a different place than you.  But, they could've gotten creative with that.-I'm going to be straight up with this one: the character models' faces in the game world outside of cutscenes are poor, to say the least.  Jessica looks like a Bratz Doll who's constantly smelling flatulence.  -No laser sights, which were present on the 3ds version.  That's right, they removed them for no reason whatsoever.  Overall, I enjoyed Revelations.  I believe it deserved the budget Resident Evil 5 got, which would've allowed co-op, better animation, and probably better voice actors (the current ones are pretty meh). due to it's return to its roots with pretty much everything but the fixed camera angles, making it a more enjoyable game.  I'd say get it on sale, because it very much looks and feels like a 3ds game regardless of it's ""HD"" qualities.  7.5/10			"

The gameplay is very boring and the story is mind-numbing. You can safely skip this and just play revelation 2 which a much better resident evil game.			"

												Capcom returns to its roots somewhat with its latest offering, Resident Evil Revelations. Though the game still feels somewhat like a shooter, as opposed to a survival horror game, it captures a good bit of the feel of the original Resident Evil games, and while ammunition is plentiful, enemies take a significant number of rounds to take down, giving it more of a sense of desperation as ammunition supplies drain rather quickly.

												Resident Evil Revelations is actually a good game. i personally got really surprised when i played its demo and actually got scared by one of the creatures but that's temporary. the main fear you gonna feel in that is not dying because when you die (and on the hardest difficulty you gonna die alot) you go back kinda a lot and that's annoying. Graphics - i'd give something around 7/10 considering the time it came out (2013) and not 2016 even tho that would be unfair. the graphics are good for its time also considering that is a port from a 3DS game so. Controls - they are great. i play with a joystick but even with mouse and keyboard they can be really comfortable. on the mouse i'd sorta of recommend to turn the sensibility down and the mouse acceleration off because it can be a bit too much for some people including meStory - well. meh seriously. i mean the story is good but at least didn't catch me till the part i played. i hope this changes i really do but for now imo is meh at least in that point. what kinda of made me play this game was Jill valentine because i'm a huge fan of her as a character. Gameplay - Is very resident evil 6 tbh. is pretty much action with some darker parts which i didn't really feel fear onCONCLUSSION If you want a good modern Resident Evil Experience. this game is for sure worth a shot in my opinion.  it is entertaining if you are looking for that.However if you are expecting horror. no. just no. go and get one of the remasters of Resident evil 1 or 0 (or wait for the remake of resident evil 2) because this one is not for you			"

												This game is awesome. Stuck on a ship (great claustrophobic environment checked) after being misled, Jill Valentine and her partner Parker has to survive the horror that awaits them, and uncover a greater conspiracy.The story is great with everyone's favourite Jill Valentine returning as the lead cast, comedic moments with the other supporting BSAA members, and a twist in the story. However, it is pretty straight forward, and gets boring by my 3rd play through, more notes could be left around to explain the backgrounds and motivations of the other characters.Gameplay is not much different from Resident Evil 5 and 6, with the 3rd person shooting angles. However, no more confusing inventory system! Instead your weapons and upgrades will be stored in the classic storage box, and you can only take 3 weapons at a time. Key items does not take up inventory space, so there is no 'inventory puzzles' to solve.The previous 2 Resident Evil games brough more action than horror to the storyline, which is expected as Chris and Leon are now part of anti-bioterriorism forces (who still expects them to be afraid of zombies?). However, the slower pace of RE: Revelations. limited ammo, narrow pathways filled with 'zombies' blocking your exit, and a 'stalker' type monster that refuse to die, managed to create the perfect creepy environment on board a ship. At times Jill will have to wander off alone and makes you wonder why her partner is such a wuss despite being a big man (not that he's of much use anyways). Decisions have to be made over fight or flight, especially on your first play through on normal or insane mode, although for those gamers who have to kill everything, the genesis scanner will help to uncover additional bullets. Do note that flash back and side missions which helps explain the story are more action oriented. Overall, i find the game having a good balance of horror and action done through great graphics, environmental sounds, back ground music, and dialogues. Afterall, as our favourite characters matures and become adapt at handling such situations, it is impossible for Resident Evil to have a pure horror storyline that makes logical sense. Lastly, there is the raid mode which can be insanely difficult especially if you're an achievement hunter. This mode allows you to play RE: Revelations like a classic arcade shooter with weapons, trophies and high score to collect, and add on countless hours of fun for those up to the challenge.In conclusion, RE: Revelations is worth spending time on. However, the steam sales ranging from 50-75% would be worth waiting for as the full retail price of S$62 is slightly costly. Whether you are a Resident Evil fan or not this game will surely not disappoint.			"

												If you like Resident Evil or heck third person slow paced horror-ish shooters then this is probably the best one of those since the likes of Resident Evil 5 or Dead Space.  Though it is a HD port of a handheld game so its not deep in regards to systems or content but I've played through twice as of writing this and its still a very nice fun little game.  Graphics are held back a bit by its handheld origins but the art direction helps get around that and the animation is superb while the story stuff is the usual super dumb but lovable capcom experience.  Definitely a must play for series fans.Controls are fantastic for both mouse n gamepad, no bugs or weird glitches, the port overall seems very well done.			"

												TLDR: If you're a Resident Evil fan buy it at 12$ or less, if you're not, buy it at 7$ or better yet get Dead Space instead.Pros:- Jill's a$$- Playable with a mouse and keyboard- Inventory management (yes, that's a feature nowadays)- Weapon mods- Multiplayer Raid Mode (which I haven't played nor am I interested in)Cons:- Jill's face- Dated graphics (pre-xbox360 era)- Too much backtracking- Running speed is too slow (which wouldn't be an issue if there wasn't so much backtracking)- FOV which will give you tunnel vision- Scanner with an even lower FOV, which you have to use to find necessary items, that are invisible/unobtainable otherwise- Completely unnecessary storyline intermissions in which you don't play as Jill, that take you out of the experiece of exploring an abandoned ""ghost ship""- Worthess AI partner (he doesn't deal any damage and monsters ignore him anyway)- The most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ plot of all of the Resident Evil games (seriously)- Bland, uninteresting and ugly support characters with cringeworthy dialogue			"

												6/10 Gameplay is ok, but since it's a DS port controlls are a little bit wonky. There is no FULL controller support, because there is no sufficient analog stick support (only 8 directions like on a D-Pad, instead of full 360° which makes aiming kind of awkward)The whole bioscanner thing is annoying (you have to activate the bioscanner every 10 steps to not miss an item).Long and frequent loading times (even with a SSD) and very small areas (since it's a DS port).And the story was probably written by the son of one of the programmers during bring-your-child-to-work-day... It's really stupid, unlogical, boring and full of overused ""plot twists"" á la ""Surprise! You saw me dying but I am somehow still alive!"" The Game would be better without the story and no dialogues at all^^ I mean seriously... who writes this crap?! You don't miss much if you skip this one.			"

The gameplay is very boring and the story is mind-numbing. You can safely skip this and just play revelation 2 which a much better resident evil game.			"

												Not bad. It's not as scary as dead space or resident evil 2 but it makes up for it with great gameplay mechanics. It's an incredibly well done console port - both movement and mouse aiming are tight and responsive. My only complaints are that the coop mode isn't fully integrated (no campaign coop mode), it's a separate arcade style series of missions. Disappointing because you have an AI partner with you for a large portion of the campaign, woulndn't have been difficult to implement. I don't care much for the approach capcom took in trying to develop the story with this game. It basically creates a bunch of 'episode' segments, the majority of them you play as Jill but some of them toss you into alternate character side missions that really don't contribute much to the game.Also, the game is a little too easy. Even playing on infernal mode with a brand new game I didn't have to worry about ammo management after 2 or 3 chapters (Although the first chapter is pretty tricky). If you have good aim this won't be terribly challenging for you.TL;DR  - Pros: Great gameplay and controls; Jill has a nice♥♥♥♥♥br>             Cons: No campaign coop mode; Too many side character missions; Kinda easy on max difficulty "

												This wasn't my favorite Resident Evil but it had a interesting story. I haven't done any research to see how or what game this ties into, but I feel it was worth the play. The graphics were okay considering this is a port. Some times the movement was a little off on the cameras. The actual game play was fun and scary at times, and kept me wanting to move forward. I'm not interested in raid mode so this ends my review. I give this game a 8 out of 10 for ""scary action"". Of course I bought it on sale and recommend you pick it up when you can.			"

												It's alright!Resident Evil: Revelations is a continuation of the action / survival horror hybrid that started in Resident Evil 4 and, in this case, was originally developed for the 3DS. As such, though the visuals have been brought up roughly to a Gamecube-era RE game, the environments are more limited and closed than its predecessor. While you can still leap off of high points, hurdle over some rare obstructions, and aim in first person, a lot of the environmental interactivity is relatively limited. In general it's ""Resident Evil 4 Lite: Boat Edition"".Similarly, weapon upgrades are just discovered in the course of the game. In general, the weapon layout isn't going to have many surprises for RE veterans, though there are some nice new improvements in the latter half of the game. The emphasis is largely on action this time - though there's keys to find and some pointedly simple puzzles, for the most part the focus is on aiming and shooting baddies. Shooting enemies remains satisfying, though sometimes feedback on the enemies part is lacking - it wasn't until late in the game I realized you could tell if an enemy was dead or not by whether or not the crosshair is lit. I probably wasted a decent chunk of ammo firing at slowly-slumping, melting enemies where it just wasn't clear I'd already finished them off.Though it has some tension, the horror is generally absent this time around. While not as enjoyably schlocky as RE4, it does have some fairly ridiculous moments that stand out. The new fish-hybrid enemies aren't particularly frightening, and mostly it just feels you're fighting pale piles of goo without much personality. The bosses are solid, but fall more than a bit into frustration due to their ability to soak damage even on normal.The big change is Genesis, a first-person scanner akin to Batman's detective vision (in Arkham Asylum) or Eagle Vision in the Assassin's Creed series. This lets you find hidden items (and a set of collectibles), and scanning enemies regards you with extra health kits. It's a bit of a misfire, because though the extra health kits come in handy and it can increase tension early on when you're scanning just to get that extra kit, it doesn't do anything interesting like reveal new weak points or at least give you a library of scanned monsters.The boat environment is kind of a mix of neat ocean liner nods and boring grey hallways, and the forward motion of the game keeps it from ever developing too much personality. Though there's backtracking, it's relatively mild. Having Jill return (along with her prominently featured third-person butt) as the main character is welcome,  given the treatment she had in Resident Evil 5. You'll regularly swap out to a few other characters for different chapters, including series mainstay meathead Chris. The plot is pretty much just interesting enough to keep you going but its twists and turns are generally predictable for a series veteran like myself.In general, it's a decent little side game for the series, nowhere near the best but also nowhere near the worst. It does just well enough to hold together on its own and to earn a recommendation, but not a ringing one. If you've already experienced Resident Evil 4 and would like a little more in that vein, this is probably worth your time more than Resident Evil 5 or 6.Played through on normal difficulty to story completion, didn't mess around with raid mode.

												Excellent as I heard, I always wanted to buy this game but I was on low money, until my close friend (though far from location) gifted me with this game on steam, so thank you (AliceDBC/DarknessBunny!)This game promises just like all the praise you heard, its really a great return to horror, finally and now Revelations 2 is coming, I can't wait, I love you CAPCOM for doing this game and porting it, I knew a port will come, though im saddened the cutscenes are still pre-rendered and Jill's face was not fixed, and the fact that Mercenaries 3D wasn't made HD and bundeled with this, Jill's front hair doesnt animate, but who cares ! xDGraphically its excellent for a remaster of a ""3DS"" game, which would look terrible if CAPCOM didn't decently improve it for HD platforms. But this game really has no physics, you break boxes and its like an explosion, no realistic breaking physic mechanic from RE5 and doors are basically bulletproof (which wasn't the case in the beta).The door opening sequence is also annoying, its basically LIN style without the camera ""focus on door"" zoom. And it's very annoying (which again, wasn't the case in the beta / Pilot Demo).This game was intended to have coop but it was taken out thanks to the extremist ""we are the True Fans"" group and no, you're not true fans, you don't even read the mangas, drama albums, watch the plays, play all the games, but you complain instead of buying and claim to be ""True Fans""The AI in this game, you can't command it like RE5, you can't give or take items from it (him or her), they don't damage enemies at all but shoot basically nothing; they also don't get damage, this is MUCH worse than Sheva, yes she kept dying on Pro in RE5/BIO5 but this Partner AI here is terrible and this game should've Had COOP. Raid Mode in this game is fun, but to be honest its still a dwongrade in terms of verbal commands, no animations when commanding not even lip sync, not much variety (RE5 had MANY unused lines which were usable by hacking them) and finally, Revelations 2 Raid Mode is another downgrade, yes it has new features but CAPCOM has a habit of cutting down features. But it's still a great game and a very good port. That's all I'm gonna say.To keep it short...Jill undergoes a plastic surgery and faces the terrors of veltro as they vulture from the past, Terragrigia is suddenly the first public disclosure of bio organic weapons. P.S. this game manages to freak you out multiple times. Great storyline, good preqeul to RE5, Jill looks ugly, Chris looks okay but somehow plain, Jessica is annoying, good music and very hollywood-ish and orchestral, good horror, good gameplay, not the quality I expect of remaster but its defenitely a very good remaster, I expect physics to get added back though among other things.

												Well it was fun. Right up until the underwater missions. Checkpoint system combined with the cliched timed underwater escape with no way to fight back is a real failure, in any game. Survival horror should be about monsters (human or not), not choosing between boredom and suffocation. Not to say that its difficult, just time consuming. And any time a game producer chooses to throw me in a maze with no scenery and no monsters for an hour, I'm done with them and their product.			"

Well, no, pretty hard to be. But don't let the people desperate for a ""throwback"" lie to you, this is a very bad game in all aspects. First off...it's an HD remake of a DS. So, the graphics suck. The new characters introduced are all horrible and unlikable, the enemies are generic and boring (yes...compared to IDENTICAL LOOKING ZOMBIES THEY'RE STILL GENERIC AND BORING. wut?), the story is completely uninteresting, the whole ""scan every room you walk in with this rad scanner to find secret hidden items right in front of you you can't see without it"" is terrible, a 3DS touch screen minigame was left in, only now it's an annoying mini-cutscene to watch (fast paced screw driver/panel action!), bosses are just as boring as the regular enemies and no challenge whatsoever...It's just a bad game. Completely. Pretty much the only positive thing I can say about it is at least it's not Operation Raccoon City.			"

												I am not sure if me and the other reviewers have played the same game. I have to say that I was incredibly dissapointed in it (though I suppose no more than in say, RE6), and I honestly cannot recommend this game to anyone, not even fans of the franchise. I know this is a port from a handheld, so I suppose there is no point in complaining about graphics, however, the game is really really short (the entire campaign takes under 6 hours), you are being thrown from character to character, from location to location and it is disorienting, makes it difficult to manage your items or anticipate what you might need, and some of the characters you have to control are absolutely atrociously written. Speaking of writing, it is rather convoluted, even for a Resident Evil game. The fact that you will play through flashback sequences presented without much rhyme or reason is not helping. The voice - acting is almost as bad as RE 1 times, but this time there is no excuse of being a pioneering game. Overall it is tedious, often boring, unrewarding awful game with clunky controls. Do yourself a favour and buy the RE 1 HD Remaster or RE 4 HD instead.Bonus: There are two characters supposedly provided as comic relief that boils down to saying ""THIS BLOWS"". All. The. Time.			"

												Bought it for the coop experience .. and it is a nightmare.There is no story in the coop missions just guns and many monsters. Gun them all down, go to the end of the level, repeat - but only till you reach mission4. In order to get access to more missions you need to complete more singleplayer missions .. hooray. Furthermore these levels are extrem short. It took us ~10 Minutes to complete these 4 missions.Singleplayer seems to be much better but didn't play much of it.If you want to buy it only to play coop - don't do it.			"

												Dear Capcom,I have been passionately in love with you since age 3, and I will continue to cherish you and sing your praises until the day I die. And because I care so much about you and your future (...our future), I have no problem letting you know that this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥and has no business being branded as a Resident Evil title.What am I even playing? Like, seriously?  1. ""here, have a control scheme / camera that feels like a sloppy mix of RE4 and Max Payne""    - movement / strafing is really tacky, and looking around feels super awkward  2. ""here, have a ub3r 1337 scan gun and scan every single square inch of the map for bonus pointz!""    - are we playing Metroid Prime now???  3. ""here, run around with a useless buddy character who does nothing except add corny dialogue""    - ok.. he/she *occasionally* shoots Hunters, buy only after I've dumped an entire magazine into them  4. ""here, have a bunch of sequenced, linear missions as opposed to exploring the map and solving puzzles""    - RE4 was a game changer and many games copied its style. But it's time to rethink the formula again.  5. ""here, have a bunch of awkward, poorly written cutscenes that could have been straight out of a Michael Bay film""    - ......no words  etc. etc. etc.Overall, this game feels like the outcome of a summer project, thrown together by interns who were too high for their own good. I know what you're capable of, Capcom. With a passionate team and a proper budget, you can create an absolute masterpiece. But this ain't one of them. Not even close.P.S. I realize I'm ~5 years late playing this. I'm really looking forward to RE7, which so far looks to be about 10000x better than this heap. All my <3			"

												Take Resident Evil 4. Take away all the unique aspects of the shooting (shooting specific enemy parts, inventory management, etc.). Add some bad shooting and lots of walking and getting lost with pointless fetch quests. Call it a ""return to horror roots"" when actually it's a snorefest.Congrats, you have RE Revelations. There's better shooters, better horror games, and better combinations of both. Play RE4 instead.			"

												Very disappointed. No co-op campaign mode. It only has co-op 'raid mode' where you spawn together, take out a handful of mutations to get from A to B, very short campaigns with absolutely no story or context, you just spawn, run for your life and try to do it fast for points. If I wanted to grind zombies with my friends I'd play Left 4 Dead again. I was really looking foward to this game, I love this franchise, in game, in L.A. movies and C.G.I. movies. I hope this, after Raccoon City, doesn't tank the franchise so they can have a chance at redeeming themselves with options.

												The main reason I got this game was so I could play it with my friend and it's co-op, however the story on this game is not actually co-op and the only part we can play together is some minor survival missions. Even with those ones, the controls are extremely finicky, when aiming down the sights if moving the mouse, the crosshair won't move at all.Overall I found it a more frustrating experience, if it just hadn't said that it was actually co-op I feel it would have spared me the feeling of wasting my money.Though, I haven't played through the story part much at all, just the multiplayer setting. So if you're a Resident Evil fan playing for a solo experience with the story it might still be of interest, I just found the amount of aggrevation while doing simple things like aiming a turn-off from playing the rest of it.

												This is a game about a loser guy named Cristopher trying to find his wife, but then it turns out she's actually on a boat full of monsters. Ring any ♥♥♥♥ing bells yet? It should, because that exact same thing was done years ago, and it was called Silent Hill 2 and was actually good. Too bad Crapcom can't make good games without ripping off people who know what they're doing. Anyway, Cris gets a letter from Jane Valentine (Is she supposed to be related to Vincent Valentine from Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children? Get REAL, Crapcock.) and has to find her on a boat. But he can't ♥♥♥♥ing find her. How hard is it to find a boat, Cris? IT'S AN OCEAN. THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING IN IT BUT BOATS. So you have to play as Jane, and you have to spend all your ♥♥♥♥ing time looking at people with your Fisher Price Monster Scanner kit, to figure out if they're monsters or not. Meanwhile Cris is suddenly on a ♥♥♥♥ing MOUNTAIN? What. There are no ♥♥♥♥ing boats on a mountain, you prick. Crap♥♥♥♥ is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developer who can not even REMEMBER what it happening IN THEIR OWN GAMES. It just gets worse from there. Really, it would be a lot better if this wasn't such a HUGE Silent Hill ripoff, except set on a boat. And don't even get me started on the Raid Mode, which is pretty much all the worst elements from World of Warcraft, slapped into a half-baked retard grind marathon.SCORES:Graphics: 6/10. This used to be a Game Boy Advance game, and you can tell. However, one chick gets horribly and painfully turned into a terrible monster and begs you to kill her, except she has her♥♥♥♥♥♥out the entire time, and it's pretty clear that the devs were literally masturbating while designing their ♥♥♥♥♥ Zombie. So it gets points for zombie♥♥♥♥♥♥Music: 3/10. The game does not have music.Gameplay: 7/10. You point the Scan Man 3000 at a zombie, and a little bar fills up and you get a herb. Then I guess you smoke that herb or something. Since the game is 420 friendly it gets bonus points.Story: 5/10. Again, Silent Hill did it better.FINAL SCORE: B-YOU MIGHT ENJOY THIS GAME IF...You get crazy boners from bloody zombie ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												The game is listed as coop, but the campaign is not coop.  Multiplayer should never be listed as coop, it should be listed as multiplayer whereas coop insinuates that the game has coop campaign.  Very disappointed.  Also kind of misleading because in the campaign you have a follower or companion too which leaves the impression that the game truly is coop, but nope.  also to go along with this RES 5 and 6 had coop campaign.  Misleading, Valve needs to fix their labels for games because this is an all too frequent issue when half the games listed as coop in Steam are not even coop but have multiplayer.			"

												I've played this game for a little over an hour. I couldn't stand to play it for any longer. I watched DansGaming play it a bit during his Halloween Horror Game Marathon.____I had a choice. Spend my funds on RE4 or on RE Revelations. For the sake of going with something new, I chose the latter and now I deeply regret my decision. I should have done a bit more research. Like another reviewer pointed out, RE Revelations plays like a boring and stripped down version of RE4. And it adds a new, super annoying feature whose purpose I do not understand. A bioscanner. After you kill monsters you can scan their bodies and if you scan enough of their bodies you get some sort of bonus (I think it was a life bonus or something like that). That doesn't sound too bad, does it? Well, it's not bad. The part that infuriates me is that you need the scanner to find ALL ITEMS. Walk into a room, it's empty. Wait, use your bioscanner scanner to look around the room, and aha! There's that apparently organic ammo you needed. Or that keycard you need to open that door. What an absolutley silly, timewasting, and nonsensical feature.Unfortunately, this game has bigger problems than just a silly loot finding system. The graphics are bad, the atmosphere is mediocre, the characters and dialogue are terribly written, and the combat is unrefined, depthless, and above-all, boring.  I don't understand the positive reviews for the game. If I could return this game, I would in a heartbeat.			"

												Don't let the hours on this game fool you, I've played it before (this was gifted to me). Trying to give this another go after failing to peak my interest the first time, I couldn't do it. I have problems sleeping, unless I play this game. This game is so mind numbingly boring that it makes me sleepy. Running from room to room gunning down the same types of monsters gets obviously repetitive and the game has absolutely no scare factor. I've played every single Resident Evil game I can think of, and I even like the terrible first person Resident Evil more than this back in the day of the first Playstation. The only thing horrific about this game is that it is an abomination to the Resident Evil classic feel. Those that claim it has that feeling must be delusional, or they don't remember the older games. I've played it on the hardest difficulty and rarely ran out of ammo, there was absolutely nothing that made me jump or think ""Oh man, I can't believe that one guy I don't remember died"". I honestly think I'm only going to play this until I get the maximum amount of trading cards possible from this.If you're itching for that Resident Evil feeling, don't play this. If you wan't to play it for the story, just watch the sequences on youtube or something. Or read the wiki. I'd slap the person who gifted this to me, as I think it was more of an insult to me.			"

												This game is a mobile game turned PC/ console without any major changes to it whatsoever.     The gameplay is the same, so for a PC, it is extemely limited. You'd have a hard time squeezing more than 30 hours out of this title for what little there is to do in the game.     The sheer quality of the game is lackluster at best. They didn't add or improve any textures at all to fit a larger screen than a 3DS. The enemies and enviroment are bland in the best case scenario, and most of the enviroments are repeated in the game. It feels like a lot of pointless running around because of the lack of fresh content.     The story was pretty terrible if you never read the Divine Comedy, because you just have nothing to relate to the plot's only allusion. The story lacks any form of symbolism, and frankly the character line up is worse than ever (ANY other title). It looks like they turned from even moderately paced action shooters like 4 or 5 and tried to tie the experience to a survival horror. The problem is that it lacks any of the puzzles that a survival horror should have, and without a story, it has nothing to offer the player motivation to complete the title.			"

With the mutations and all the other random stuff that caused zombies it made me sad that the franchise went into this direction.  I loved the Survival horror aspect of the resident evil. This has since long changed. Not really any puzzles just shooting the same types of ""Zombieish"" things over and over again.  capcom makes me sad with the "" new"" resident evil. But if thats what this generation of fans want. Thats what capcom has to give them.   I would not recomend this game to any Resident Evil Purist... Unless it was to complete your collection.			"

Btw, I beat and loved Resident Evil 4. The thing that makes me not recommend this game is the fact that on the Steam Store Page for RE:Revelations it states that is co-op. I, along with many other fans of the series, believe this to be very misleading. True, there is a Raid mode, but I want to experience an entire game's campaign with a good friend, and make awesome memories and have amazing experiences that we can laugh about for years to come.Campcom seems to be going the way of SquareEnix, that is to say, money grubbing and misleading their fans al for a few (million) bucks.Please Campcom, add a co-op campaign!

I was looking for a game that I could play for the story, I was a fan of the original resident evil 1,2,3 and maybe even 4 because it had a compelling storyline and I get emerged into the world, the puzzles that needed to be solved to gert ahead where just the icing, then the best thing for me in the originals was the camera angles, it just added so much. For me, the first three games where perfect.So to anyone reading this, I dont know if anyone agrees with me or not, but I would not recommend this, its something that will ruin your fond memories of the original.

Story is pretty typical of modern RE so theres no real serious surprises, the enemies are over all fun to fight and weapons are solid.overall 7/10Raid: oh man.... what the hell were they thinking? I've played Free to play mmos with less grind than this, horribly slow level system that serves purely as a gate, a grind you must get through just to be ""this tall to ride"" the next grind which is grinding to get weapons and custom parts.  Unless someone boosts you raid will take stupidly long to get anywhere, and still terribly long even with a boost. On top of this fact that the two early teirs; Chasm and Trench, may as well not even exist as you get nothing substantial from it. Raid doesn't even ""begin"" till abyss cause thats when you start to get your more perfect weapons and custom parts that actually can change gameplay styles. so imagine suffering through 30 levels or so and roughly around 50 hours to even get to abyss and thats if you got a partner and think if that sounds fun.overall 2/10I still recommend the game for the campaign only really. I have not gotten to play raid in RE:RE:2 but I can only hope they improved on the formula cause alot of bad gameplay choices here.			"

												I haven't played most of the RE series so it's hard for me to be a fair judge of this. Basically, from what I've read and watched on the internet, this goes more back to its roots in the first RE series, where it's supposed to be survival horror. The thing is, is that the survial element is in, but not the horror; I've played games like Slender, Dead Space, and Alan Wake, and sorry to those who like RE, there is NO horror element found here. Just the frustrating survival element that's more irrate than survival.Pros: The game looks really nice; graphics, textures, modles, the works. Everything looks nextgen.Cons: Aside from what I've listed at the top, that's pretty much it. There is nothing good here. The story is dry, and boring (seriously, first 5 minutes in the game I was watching a cutscene, I was like ""I don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥, SKIP"".), the characters are as planned as the story, and the voice acting was subpar at most.Gameplay: Now like I said, I never played the first RE titles, just RE5, which I loved. But in accordance to that, it feels like I'm not some bad♥♥♥♥♥agent, but more like someone saving every single bullet I come accross, which is what most combat is like; you're not killing the zeds, you're running from them. Because heaven forbid you come accross a hallway blocked by zeds, and you can't shoot your way out, you have to ♥♥♥♥ing knife them. If not, you have to run and dodge them. The dodge system is simlar to Alan Wake's in that you have to time you're enemies attack to get out of the way. This would be good, except that it's the same button as the 180 degree turn. If you don't time it perfectly, which I suck btw at stuff like this, you'll turn and face the wrong way and eat♥♥♥♥♥♥ The enemies vary their attacks to a quick jab, to a haymaker type punch; hard to time this♥♥♥♥♥♥ but then again, that's just me. They also done away with the life bar; basically, three hits and you're dead. I preferred more an action based game, not...what ever this is. Again, I've never played the originals, but if they were anything like this, I'd stay away.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations is kind of Capcoms apology about Resident Evil 5 & 6 being more about shooting zombies and less about horror gameplay, and it tries to be a bit like Resident Evil 4, but fails at it.Resident Evil Revelations's greatest shortcoming is that it's mostly just boring and average. The story is boring, the characters are boring, the gameplay is boring, the graphics are average. When this game originally released on the 3DS it looked very impressive on the small screen, but now it's not so impressive on a 1080p screen.If you are desperate for a horror game to play, RE Revelations is probably better than 90% of the indie horror games that are currently flooding Steam, but that isn't saying much.

												Revelations is Resident Evil done right. This game was AMAZING on the 3DS, and I'm currently re-downloading it for the PC for another playthru. The main campaign is decently lengthy, and the upgrade system is decent. I'm not one for extra modes or Mercenaries on the other games, but Raid Mode is a blast. Great for challenge-seekers. If you've never played this before, or are just curious about the series, this is a good place to start, provided youread a little about the story first. If not, you'll get to know the characters soon enough, but the background helps a little. Just buy it. You won't regret it.			"

												i liked the idea of a maritym mutation so i bought that game.But the monster variety was poor even though they could have created some really scary monsters but they didntTheyre just grey low resolution models that wobble around ... if you like nasty monsters go buy dead space 1-2 they did it rightThe ship was boring cause everything was just grey and green .. if a horror game wants to score with mapdesign it should atleast look dirty but it was just clean, so clean more like steril that you could eat from the toilet seatsThe sound was bad ...all 9m handguns sounded the same and not powerful more like from a cheap browser gameIf anyone remembers those Hunters from resident evil 3 (with their trippling footstep sound), in revelations theyre just cute like a little puppy and they used them as cannon fodder! as cannon fodder! the fearsome Hunters that you really dont wanted to encounter in resident evil 3!!I dont know why they added these useless side stories maybe for the more action parts where you just run and shoot every hunter like in any random shooter with unlimited ammo.killed enemies just melt into a blood soup or disappear There havent been any ""real"" puzzles like they promised(atleast not like in resident evil 3 or code veronica x)If they really want to go back to horror survival they should add real zombies and crazy monster types.Zombies shouldnt be used as cannon fodder like in resident evil 6 that you just run over with your karate kicks Even watching Jills smooth as.s for 6 hours couldnt change my mind for a positive review			"

												In quality and overall fun, it far outstrips its status as a mere ""gaiden"" game!  Lightly textured but nicely modeled and animated, it exhibits an attractive ""Hyper Dreamcast"" style that doesn't overload the optic nerves with absurdly realistic textile weave.  Limited ammo and herbs make things a lot more survival horror-esque than 4, 5 and 6, but when you run out of something, you can scan your surroundings with a little viewfinder that identifies hidden items.  It's a great crutch to have if you find yourself in a sloppy gameplay session!  Viewfinder usage is never too onerous, and it's downright AWESOME if you've got an obsessive-compulsive inner beast that craves a massage.  The contextual dodge mechanic (you joggle the stick in a certain direction right before the blow falls) is a little weird at first, but it actually works beautifully in one-on-one encounters.  You're better off running from mobs, but let's face it; what game lets you duck an entire horde of misshapen gropers? Revelations has a perfect RE story, one that's even worthy of a mainline game.  You know what that means, RE fans:  it's a convoluted, monster-packed mess dripping with so much cheese sauce that it will give you gout, and it is positively glorious!  Let me explain something to the uninitiated; RE stories are good not just because they're cheesy fun, or just because they've got oodles of hideous monsters, but because they are leavened with real creativity and intelligence.  It's wonderfully dumb spectacle plus deep mythos.  Unkillable action heroes with one-liners striving against organizations with (sometimes insanely) complex motivations.  Ridiculously twisty plotting with expert pacing.  Not many AAA actioners (game or film) can suck you in like an RE can into its coincidence-laden universe of pustulant monsters!			"

												Bought with a 75% discount... I wish I had paid the full price. That's a GREAT and satisfying game. You'll find everything that there is to love in RE series here. Actually, is a damm fine horror experience even if you're not into the Resident Evil thing yet.Too underrated game.			"

												Returning to its roots as a survival horror franchise, Resident Evil Revelations is a top notch game with a storyline that will have you on the edge of your seat for the length of the game wondering just what the heck is going on. When you think you've figured it out, you begin to realize that you were wrong all along. I cannot recommend this game enough to anyone whether a fan of Resident Evil, or of survival horror games in general. This is one game you do NOT want to miss!			"

												As a huge fan of RE4 and even RE5, I really enjoyed this 3DS port. What I enjoyed of the previous games was the over the shoulder camera and having to watch your ammo while you fight monsters. There are many differences of course, good but not necessarily better, though certainly not worse.GENERAL INFOIf you've played RE4/5 you'll know generally what to expect here, if not check out screenshots and videos for this game. The vast majority of the game takes place on a large cruise ship. During the course of the game you will explore it and find keys that unlock more of the ship to progress the story. Every once in a while the game will switch to a different duo and play as them for a little while with preset weapons. Not my favorite parts but they do help break up the monotony of the ship and explain more of the story.GUNSWhere the game shines are the weapons and upgrades. You can have any 3 weapons equipped, even 3 pistols if you wanted though that's stupid. There are pistols, shotguns, smgs/assault rifles, long range rifles, and magnums. For each weapon type there are different guns you will find with differing stats. When you find a gun and take it back to your storage box thing you will have it forever (the gun you dropped is returned too). This is how you switch out your guns and change their upgrades, you can't do it anywhere for obvious balance reasons. Upgrading guns is a lot of fun. Each gun has anywhere from 1 to 5 slots for upgrades, and you can apply upgrades and take them off at will. Upgrades include the standard fare of higher damage, higher bullet capacity, faster reload, etc. and many more unique ones.YOUR AI PARTNERBy far the biggest advantage this game has, especially over RE5, is that although you have an AI partner he can safely be ignored. In RE5 even if you were playing solo, you still had to manage your AI partners inventory and keep them alive, but thankfully they were generally fairly smart though still a hassle. Here your AI partner is invincible, the enemies pretty much always push past him to come after you, and while your partner can shoot they rarely seem to. Are they useless? Yes. Do they stay out of your way and present no hassle for you and let you enjoy the single player experience you want? Thank goodness yes! Of course you can play co-op if you wanted, but it's far from forced.PLAYTHROUGH INFOYour first playthrough on normal if you are reasonably thorough and don't try to rush it will take you about 8-10 hours. Like in RE4 there is a new game+ mode where you keep all your weapons and ammo from before and start over. That's already fun, but this game has an infernal difficulty which you can, and are probably expected to, play on a new game+. This mode features a lot more enemies, enemies in different places than normal, and even enemies early on you wouldn't normally see until later in the game. Furthermore, items are in different places and nothing at all like on normal. Infernal mode is practically a whole new game!RAID MODEAs if all this wasn't awesome enough there's this RPG-progression-like mode called Raid Mode. In it you do a quick mission where your goal is to find the exit. There are many of these missions, and as you do them you gain experience which allows you to level up. The higher level missions will let you find higher level weapons, of which you need to be the appropriate level to wield. The weapons will have increased stats and effects, very similar to Borderlands random gun drops. You can prepare for each mission using what you've earned/bought. Yes there is a store which resets every time you enter it. You can easily spend dozens of hours on this mode alone. This mode can also be played in co-op if you wish.CONCLUSIONIf you liked RE4/5 definitely check this game out, you aren't likely to be disappointed. If you've never played them before take a look at some lets plays for a good idea.P.S. Review was 1700 chars too long, had to shorten >.<.			"

												I originally played the 3DS demo of this game. Initially having second thoughts concerning that it was part of the horror genre, it wasn't 2spoopy but spoopy enough to put me into shock but genunely is a good game. I bought this game on sale, and needless to say, I don't want to refund this game. It's engaging with it's story, gameplay, and raid mode and runs well. Overall, i'm most likely going to purchase the other games in the series.			"

												Long time resident evil fan, by no means would I say this is my favorite. Has a RE6 feel to it just with water. . . lots of water. The Dodging action is not easy to pull off and I feel it is a bit glitchy.I enjoy the style of upgrading weapons in this game. Each firearm has a certain amount of upgradables which you have to collect throughout the game, some are pretty interesting. The storyline is okay, get to know more about hunk which is pretty neat. More on Claires brother (even get to play as) It is ripping off metroid primes scanning but it is how you find extra items while scouting out things.Two who gives a ♥♥♥♥ game characters are in the campaigne you have to play as and they remind me of those racist autobots from transformers. Supposed to be some elite group but one of them is disty and falls making a loud noise very start of their chapter?Female hunk, bought that package because I was curious but dissapointed to find out it is hunk with no pants?If hunk is playable, why the hell is Tofu not!?!?!? (RE2 reference)A lot of the game characters look ""greasy"" especially this redhead tht remins me of Syndro from The Incredibles Movie! Right? Right?Still would recommend, but hate where RE is going with the game controls mimicking Call of Duty in a way. They seem to be moving away from, ""Survival"" horror.			"

												Slow, boring, ugly and souless.  This feels like one of those half finished cheap early access games that have long been abandoned that always seem to be in bundles. Resi 5 was decent, 6 was poor and this is beyond abysmal.  The graphics on the monsters looks like they are from 1997. The voice acting and cut scenes are terrible.  Truly the low point in the Resident Evil franchise (yes even below the movies). "

												The game has correctly scaled back to the idea of ammo conservation, claustraphopic atmospheres and suspense.However,It's shoddy music, cheap jump scares, beyond awful combat mechanics and insultingly easy fights and puzzles that are more irritating than tricky - make me concerned that this was made by an actual legit company. The only sign of actual effort in this is the generally large size of the game and its levels. Even though it is a cakewalk it will kill a good 10+ hours.Oh yeah, and Jill is still hot. But youll soon forget that the second the horrific, stupid, pointless side characters turn up, with thier own mini missions and humourless jokes.An irritating 5/10 even if you love the old Resi's			"

												The game started pretty promising, it had that feel of vulnerability, that focus on exploration. But there is ONE thing that stopped me from playing.Forget the crappy textures, the dumb story, the ridiculous enemies called B.O.Ws (they're more disturbing than scary), or the silly scanning system (at least in Metroid Prime we could actually read on the stuff we scan, here its just for getting health and finding invisible items). Nay, one thing, made me say NEVER AGAIN.That boss. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥that boss. Made me♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants man.There's a reason why survival horror is so distinct from other shooters : you don't want to fight. If you fight, its because you got backed in a corner, that you have no other choice. You use precious resources that you need to manage. You avoid areas with many monsters and use stealth to survive. Sometimes, like in Amnesia : the Dark Descent, you have no weapon at all and must avoid monsters at all costs.Not this game. This game broke my suspension of disbelief so hard I laughed. Don't be fooled, its a silly 3rd person action shooter just like the other ""modern"" Resident Evils.What happened is this : you arrive in this area. Theres a few monsters, so I pick them off with my pistol. Its a shopping mall. I secure the area (since you can't stealth), get some items, lift open a gate. I hear this weird voice. ""Mayday, mayday, help us (...)"". Its the comms officer I'm supposed to go find for the key to the communications room. Then i see something wrong : a door is being banged on and shaked and theres a lock on it. Let me ask you : what would any sane person do? Especially in a survival situation? You'd probably GTFO OF THERE RIGHT?But no, you're expected to shoot the lock and release teh creature within. Cuz you need the key. Nevermind that you could pick the lock, or smash the door down. No, its much easier to fight A FRIGGIN' ABOMINATION WITH A FLESHY CHAINSAW FOR AN ARM, THAT RUSHES AT YOU AND INSTA-KILLS YOU!!!Its a typical boss fight. It chases you around the area, enemies spawn EVERYWHERE, and you can only slow it down and damage it by blowing up conveniently placed gas tanks at every corner of the level. Only, theres a few problems.Number one : its the ugliest most disturbing thing ever.Number two : this is an insane difficulty spike compared to the things before.Number three : its dumb and ruined the atmosphere.I was like ""NOPE!""

												The overall game is great.It did sometimes feel a little bit boring in the beginning but after that its really great.The game is really scare, I sometimes had to stop playing for a bit LOL.The gameplay is the same as 5. You have a partner and he sometimes helps you but unlike 5 you dont give him items.You can move while aiming which made it more intense when i was being chased and was trying to kill someone.There was this high tech binoculars that you used to find things and examine them. I thought it was a bit over used (i think it was only neccecary in one mission) but now that i think about it, it was OK.I thought the final boss was a let down. I was really excited to fight a final boss but i finished him in a couple of minutes and it was boring. I even felt that he was put in there without any real reason and he wasnt teased or built up in the game or if he was then not a lot he just came out in the end.			"

												Been doing this, been satisfied. I'm unsure why people bash Revelations right and left. Granted, it's not the same as the old Resident Evil series on Playstation, for example machine puzzles etc, but it has its own good points. More action oriented for sure.Aside of some minor problems (regarding low sound volume but I've found the fix), RE: R is pretty much ok performance wise. In its early release it was stuttering right and left on my rig, now with the same graphic settings it is silky smooth - after several patches of course.AI wise, can be rather dumb at times and I'm sure it's an annoyance also for many people, but at least it is sufficient to beat Single Player part. As far as I can tell, of course.Story-line wise, well... I'd prefer with the continuation of the latest RE's storyline but can live with this one. Can't complain too much I guess but no spoiler written in this review, though.Coop mode is pretty fun if you can find workaround the lag. Granted my connection ain't da best but I find it a bit weird I can play coop RE6 and Dota 2 just fine when this one can't - after several sessions.And lastly, Jill. <3 What else is there to be said?

												It's a handheld game, and for that it's a pretty good one. For a 30€ PC game.. not so much. It's simple and tries to be entertaining just by being a third person shooter and the raid mode grabs this concept well. Shoot stuff, for the sake of shooting stuff, nothing fancy. But the campaign is horrid.So if you're into just shooting monsters with your friends than this may just be your game, but for me Resident Evil is not about this.			"

												I am a fan of all resident evill games. I love resident evil 6!At first this game looks terrible, increadibly bad graphics, boring atmosphere, feels like timewaste. However as you progress and finnish first two chapters, It starts to get very interseting and quite good. It is still not good as RE6 but it is still quite good.I would reccomend you to play it. It is fun, but if you gotto to choose RE6 or this, go with RE6			"

												This game is a really mixed bag. There is some fun to be had, but also a lot of frusteration and the ratio leans more towards frusteration.

												One of the best RE games in the last year/s. I compare Revelations with titles like RE5 and RE6 and the difference is HUGE!.The game have amazing 3D graphics, good atmosphere, terrorific enemies and awasome campaign / history. Also I find it a good idea to tune up your weapons with special pieces for make them more stronger (RE4 and RE5 have this too but with other style)The Raid Mode expand the game for make more fun. Its also playable in CoopI recomend this game. No only for be the best RE game in the last years, also for what he have: IS A TRUE SURVIVAL HORROR!			"

												An obvious but enjoyable schlock side-story to the franchise with a new type enemy archetype and solid fundamental game play. The overall game is old-school resident evil but with over the shoulder controls and the usual silly plot. The game is as focused on over the shoulder combat as RE 4-5-6 but the plot, map, exploration and setting that remind me heavily of resident evil 2.The inventory system is a system of magic-boxes that holds your stored list of gear and weapons and equip-able buff labels that you can find, swap and equip on weapons (closest comparison is warframe F2P game but less confusing).The downside as I see it are that the weapon upgrade and storage system does not fit in will with the story led game-save focused, poorly chaptered game progression. The system has a strong hint of being only half-implemented or something added in mostly for new-game plus (or to allow for more weapon types) it's almost like a first attempt at a DLC platform for some cheeky ""bonus"" paid for content but with access being strictly limited to in-game storage crate use the save-game based inventory system feels an odd choice.

												This is a really good game for RE fans. The campaign is really entertaining, you can get many different weapons and customize them with many weapon modifcations you find as drop or hidden in the game. The Infernal Difficulty adds an additional challenge and a few further weapon modifications. The raid mode is okay, the idea with different stages, a leveling system and weapons in different variations with upgrades has a nice touch. But it's just a small extra.The only negative thing about this game is, that the coop mode is missing. The game would be even more fun with one.			"

												This game's story is absolute trash. The plot twists are predictable as ♥♥♥♥ or just plain stupid.If you're looking to shoot zombies, this game isn't for you either. Your main activity will consist of walking through empty hallways hoping to find a zombie to kill or tediously looting lockers for ammo. Killing a zombie never feels rewarding, since their death animation is total garbage, and for some reason there's close to no blood-splatter, regardless of your weapon. The boss fights are unoriginal, and barely require any skill or stratey, just a lot of ammo.  The worst part is that this game completely misses the mark when it comes to horror. Throughout the whole game, you have a literally useless follower tailing you, which completely breaks immersion, and the zombies have♥♥♥♥♥♥AI that allows you to kite them for days. The raid mode is equally disappointing; you get to shoot a few more zombies, but it's really similar to the campaign gameplay. And there's no one playing raid mode online, so don't even bother buying the DLC. The only good part of the game is Jill Valentine's rear. But even that gets dull after the first few chapters.

												Story mode is decent, creating a nice hybrid between modern and classic resident evil (right down to the story taking place pretty much all in one location), but choose your multiplayer partner wisely! Because the raid mode is extremly repetitive and RPG grindy, so you'll need a great partner or a hell of a lot of love for the series to play through it all. It's also worth noting that this is a port of a 3DS title, that's not a bad thing per say, but it is noticable in terms of the scale and variety in the game.The games at it's best the few times it manages to pull off even a half decent jump scare and how they've broken the story mode into chunks like episodes, but besides that? It's just capcom trying to reclaim the series' glory days and only somewhat succeeding.			"

												I'm a big RE fan, platinum on RE5 and a ridiculous game saves on past installments. RE6 originally rustled my jimmiesso badly that I skipped this game on the 3ds, and I don't think I really missed all that much on relase. You don't exactly have a big array of enamies, and instead of having things you can easily take out by being smart you have some enemies that are just there to soak up bullets if you can't run, wait, I mean merrily jog away. Where the heck is the run button??? Maybe the low speed adds some tension, but more often then not I found myself getting really frustrated with backtracking through enemyless segments with Jill having a happy jog through rooms that all look the freaking same! What son of a biscuit did the level design for this game? Aside from there being more than one ship that is EXACTLY THE SAME TO THE POINT WHERE ONLY THE CASINO IS OPEN ON BOTH OF THEM WHY. Even when you're grounded in that you're on the same ship, the game tends to have rooms that look so similar that you end up going in the opposite direction. Objective cursor is inconsistant.If you can't look past a lot of things and accept its flaws this game might not be for you.			"

												8/10It is true to it's original 3DS version. It still holds up as an excellent co-op game. Don't expect too much horror. The game itself is more action focused with a horror esthetic. The stages are fun to explore and there are so many ways to customize guns.My only real knock against this game has to do with the story mode. You'll have to switch up player characters frequently. Most of the characters are reasonably equipped, with the exception of one -who feels under-equipped for the game.Regardless, this game is good in single player and co-op. Raid Mode is the best!			"

												I had a lot fun with this. Good o'l cheesy narrative like in the first resident evil's, the gameplay is simple. It's a sort of a good ""casual game"" graphics are ok, i don't understand the dilemma. I recomend it a lot. 1 thing i didn't like is that the campaign doesn't have the co-op, but it's reasonable it would mess up the narrative. And another negative it's not that scary at all, so if you're looking for a ""scary horror game"" no, that isn't for you  it's more action than horror.			"

												I'm not sure why this game was made, I would have rather they put their resources into making a PC/console Mercenaries game. The limitations of the 3DS hardware were more apparent when playing this PC port and overall I didn't like any of the new characters or the story. Mechanically it felt more rigid than RE5 as well due to hardware limitations. People claim it's better than RE6, but I find that hilarious when the whole game takes place on a ship or a snowy mountain and RE6 had BOTH those environments plus A COUPLE DOZEN MORE, and it was overall a way more ambitious and complex game than this. Mercenaries is also way cooler than Raid mode. I mean there's been worse RE games than Revelations, but I was really not impressed by it.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations is an amazing game. It goes back to what made the original games survival horror icons. It is much more for the fans of those types of games rather than something like Resident Evil 5 or 6. I highly recommend this game. If you love Resident Evil in all its forms, maybe excluding The Umbrella Chronicles, you will love this game. I myself haven't played that one but I don't hear great things. I love how it has some modern elements while also sticking more closely to its roots. No wonder the sequel is also doing so well. I highly recomment this to any Resident Evil fan especially fans of the old survival horror elements mixed with RE 4 over the shoulder and controls.			"

												An obvious but enjoyable schlock side-story to the franchise with a new type enemy archetype and solid fundamental game play. The overall game is old-school resident evil but with over the shoulder controls and the usual silly plot. The game is as focused on over the shoulder combat as RE 4-5-6 but the plot, map, exploration and setting that remind me heavily of resident evil 2.The inventory system is a system of magic-boxes that holds your stored list of gear and weapons and equip-able buff labels that you can find, swap and equip on weapons (closest comparison is warframe F2P game but less confusing).The downside as I see it are that the weapon upgrade and storage system does not fit in will with the story led game-save focused, poorly chaptered game progression. The system has a strong hint of being only half-implemented or something added in mostly for new-game plus (or to allow for more weapon types) it's almost like a first attempt at a DLC platform for some cheeky ""bonus"" paid for content but with access being strictly limited to in-game storage crate use the save-game based inventory system feels an odd choice.

												I've been playing Resident Evil since the beginning and I must admit that I still prefer the first couple of games.This is not a puzzle solving game any more it's pure action. Like so many other games. Dammit...Everything looks shiny and there is nothing to really complain about in that area... But...Why go and bring an oversexualized character like Jessica into the mix. Resident evil have always respected the female characters enough for them to equipped them with clothing that fits the situation. Maybe with the exception of Ada Wong.So why change that now?But I guess that's a minor detail and perhaps it's just feminist babble.Anyways, it's a good action game even if it's lost the ol' RE charm.

												This game's story is absolute trash. The plot twists are predictable as ♥♥♥♥ or just plain stupid.If you're looking to shoot zombies, this game isn't for you either. Your main activity will consist of walking through empty hallways hoping to find a zombie to kill or tediously looting lockers for ammo. Killing a zombie never feels rewarding, since their death animation is total garbage, and for some reason there's close to no blood-splatter, regardless of your weapon. The boss fights are unoriginal, and barely require any skill or stratey, just a lot of ammo.  The worst part is that this game completely misses the mark when it comes to horror. Throughout the whole game, you have a literally useless follower tailing you, which completely breaks immersion, and the zombies have♥♥♥♥♥♥AI that allows you to kite them for days. The raid mode is equally disappointing; you get to shoot a few more zombies, but it's really similar to the campaign gameplay. And there's no one playing raid mode online, so don't even bother buying the DLC. The only good part of the game is Jill Valentine's rear. But even that gets dull after the first few chapters. DON'T BUY, NOT EVEN ON SALE! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED! "

If you have played it on a console or on the 3DS then you should pass on this oneDon't get me wrong it's a good game, and controls better with a keyboard and mouse than in its original 3DS form, but it lacks many control features of other resident evil games. Like sprinting, dodging and robust melee combos. If you're here for a good story experience and haven't played the game yet it's worth picking up. If your fan of the action gameplay and want a great online Resident Evil experience you won't find it here and would be much better off getting Resident Evil 6			"

 An overall huge improvement over Resident Evil 5. Revelations goes back to Resident Evil's roots, playing as series veteran Jill Valentine investigating an abandoned cruise ship in the middle of the ocean, while trying to survive the horrors lurking all over the ship. Revelations also adds a new mode called Raid mode, and it's very addicting. Raid mode lets you run through multiple sections for the main story facing leveled enemies in an arcade like mode. As you keep playing Raid mode, you will level up and unlock more weapons. The weapons also have a Borderlands like flair to them, with some of them having special effects and some being rarer than others. In short, Raid mode is a very fun, very addicting new addition to the Resi series.However, the main downsides of the game is every section that doesn't take place on the ship. The sections outside the ship feel more like Resi 6, where you fight wave of enemies with plenty of ammo to go around. The survival horror aspect is thrown out the window during these segments. The game would've been much better without these segments.Other than that, I'd give Resident Evil: Revelations a 6/10. Would've been a 7, but again the aforementioned action segments of the game aren't great, and there's a lot of them. If you like horror games but don't mind a bit of action on the side, then you'll enjoy this game.			"

												This may be a decent game on it's own, but I'm reviewing this game from a Resident Evil fan's perspective. This game was a nightmare for me, literally. I could not force myself to play more than 15 minutes each time I try. It just doesn't have the same Resident Evil feeling that I get from previous RE 1-5. The style of the game is much different, the gameplay is weird, the monsters are weird, the story is weak, and they resort to a lot of 'jump scares' instead of the normal tension building or suspense scares. The only thing I like about this game is the graphics. This will be the first RE game I will not complete and I will go back to play RE 1-5 again. They're straying a bit too far away from the normal formula that makes the game what it is. Now it's becoming something else that we don't need, a first person shooter. This is what happens when RE meets Call of Duty or Battlefield. What next? Zombies/Monsters will know Kung Fu and have weapons as well so it'll become Tekken or Halo?Pros:- Good graphics.Cons:- Mainly jump scares. No tension building or suspense from previous titles.- Weak story.- Too much weapon and ammo. It's like Call of Duty meets Resident Evil.- No zombies. At least add some. Monsters are weird and some invisible... really.			"

Posted: July 15, 2016
												This is a very interesting video game, there are plenty of points to address, and I have not come to the conclusion, as of this review.  The points  First and foremost, the writing is simply atrocious, the relationships between the characters were composed by someone who had only heard about the concept of 'partnership' from an acquaintance telling them about an episode of 'Desperate Housewives' The combat, thus far, is extremely simplistic and one could master the controls with little contrivence, I am quite fond of the aspect of left clicking to attack with a melee weapon and holding right to aim your firearm and left clicking to fire, it allows for as-smooth-as-this-game-can-be combat. Unfortunately from what I have played thus far, the map is linear, which I have come to expect from 'Resident Evil' games, but the area in which you are allowed to frolic free, is less than a corridor, which in turn reveals how un-coordinated the 'Artificial Intelligence' (AI) is.  'Un-coordinated'  is an understatement, this AI wouldn't so much as  fail  the 'Turing Test' it would be banised from the facility where the test is held.  Conclusion But aside from the abhorrent writing and (Lack thereof) AI I will recommend  Resident Evil: (Most Generic Subtitle Award Nominee) Revelations  for the time being, for it is mindless entertainment, and if, for whatever reason you have several hours to spare, this is a brilliant 'Time-Waster' so to speak.

												One of the latest Resident Evil titles to come out at the time of this review, June 2014, Revelations is a new entry in the franchise that originally came out for the Nintendo 3DS in 2012. The title was generally very well-received and, not a full year later, Capcom annouced that the title would be released to household consoles and PC. The story behind this title presents a difficult reality that I feel must be tackled right off the bat: this is a handheld game being ported to a household console, so it features a limited budget. The implications behind this statement are huge. Every single aspect of this game will (most likely) not be on par with every other game being released alongside this title. However, that doesn't mean this game is bad. A game is a system that's worth far more than the sum of its individual parts. Resident Evil 6, the other recent release at the time of writing, was a competent triple-A game with impressive visuals and full-fledged controls that allowed you to roll out of the way, lay on the floor, place explosives, take cover behind objects and other actions necessary for that game's core loop. However, it is very easy to see how one might not consider that a standard Resident Evil experience. Luckily, Revelations is the most classic-like Resident Evil game to be released since the mid 2000's, when the final remakes of the original Resident Evil and the last Outbreak entry were released.Do keep in mind, though, that this game strikes a balance: it is not the return of old-school survival horror that every hardcore fan of the series seems to be crying out for. The controls closely resembles an updated version of what was initially set established by Resident Evil 4 and barely modified in Resident Evil 5. Your camera is placed above your shoulder and always face what your avatar is looking at, you can strafe, aim and shoot. Perhaps the biggest addition to the controls is the fact that you can, finally, shoot and move at the same time. Overall, the gameplay works well and feels really tight. With a core set of mechanics being matched by well designed enemies.In most chapters you'll play as Jill Valentine aboard a derelict cruise ship, those are the chapters that feature the classic horror atmosphere and feeling. But in other chapters, that can be quite numerous, you'll play as different characters like Chris Redfield, Keith ""Grinder"" Lumley and Parker Luciani. It is during these chapters that the gameplay is changed to something that closely resembles the more modern Resident Evil gameplay experience: you get plenty of ammunition and level challenges usually boil down to surviving enemy waves or fighting through enemies to get to safety. Though, as in most games of the franchise, the general gameplay will naturally shift its focus towards something very similar to what is presented in these secondary chapters as the narrative reaches its climax and approaches the ending.The game's narrative is an interesting beast. While I personally loved the narrative and the plot twist in it, it is undeniable that Revelations makes use of some really exaggerated characters that draw a lot from the, sometimes ridiculous, world of Japanese animation. They're not many, but they are key personalities in the narrative that end up getting their fair share of screen time. The story segments featured in the secondary chapters are used to explain or advance the plot without having to rely on the magical convenience that every single answer to the game's mystery is aboard the Queen Zenobia.The narrative always pairs you up with a partner, but the game features no cooperative play in the campaign, being only available in RAID mode. The partner is controlled by an AI that does its best to stay out of your way: it deals almost no damage to enemies and, in turn, is mostly ignored by them. This results in a gameplay that feels more like the original games, when there were no partners around, even though there is someone there with you to be used by the narrative to advance the plot.In terms of additional information, I could list that the game's campaign features three difficulty modes (Casual, Normal and Inferno) and the highest difficulty features scrambled puzzles and new enemy placement that is supposed to breath some life into the game even after you've beaten it once and feel like the story mode has nothing else for you. Item boxes are back, but with a twist. Puzzle items like keys, cards and other miscellaneous items are stored in their own separate inventory that never runs out of space. Ammunition is stored separately as well, with each type having a maximum amount the character may carry. These quantities can be expanded by finding particular items, but the extra ammo you find must be left in place since you cannot store it in the box. You can carry up to three weapons at any time and that's where the item boxes come in play: you use them to swap weapons and parts. Parts are upgrades that you may find for your weapons throughout the journey, they exist in the campaign but have no significant impact in your performance. They are, however, a big deal in RAID mode.RAID mode is an alternate game mode that is unlocked as you beat the game for the first time. In it you get to choose an environment from the single-player campaign and play it with any character and weapons you choose. Enemies feature a life bar in this mode that help you make tactical decisions and there are special enemy types. These special enemies, sadly, are only enlarged or shrinked versions of the standard enemies with a distinguishable symbol that indicates how their behavior has been modified. You have strong enemies that deal extra damage, agile enemies that are smaller and move faster and many others. This mode's objective is to navigate the environment, dealing with any enemies along the way, and destroy the symbol that is at the end of the level. You usually don't have to kill every enemy to proceed, but some levels make use of chained doors and segments to force you to face a large enemy force, when you finish off the last enemy in the wave you'll get a padlock key that unlocks the way forward. The levels implement this mechanic in a wide range of success: some are really memorable, some are really annoying. There are no NPC's in this mode, it is a straight-up fight up until the very end.However, as has been mentioned before, enemies have health bars and they help you make tactical decisions. But that's not all they do, they also help you gauge your character's efficiency. Unlike the single-player campaign, RAID mode features a heavy RPG influence, something akin to what's seen in Monster Hunter and other action RPG's. Players have a RAID level, any characters they use deal and take damage based that level and the level of the monster they're interacting with. As you face more advanced environments, the enemy level increases. As a result, you'll deal less damage while taking more damage. The RPG influence on RAID mode goes even further: weapons have levels too and you'll need to grind for more levels and better weapons (you can't level up your weapons) as you progress through the different environments. You'll also have to buy items and ammo to supply your runs on each map. The whole mode provides an action RPG experience that, in my opinion, is overall superior to the usual Mercenaries mode. But I'm not a fan of being bound to stats, since the rest of the game is really about resource management and reaction time.If you like Resident Evil, then you probably won't mind paying full price for this game. Othewise, you might want to get it at a discount. Finally, I'd say that Resident Evil Revelations is not the game fans claim they want, not yet. But if future installments take inspiration from Revelations and continue to place horror first, then at least we're headed in the right direction.			"

												I remember reading somewhere that this game is supposed to be a remake of the older Resident Evil games like 4 and 5, showing what happened ""before"" and such. After playing the game myself, I can say with confidence that they went over the top with the remake, it feels like a game from 2000s, outdated graphics, clunky controls, messy video settings and a cheesy arcade storyline with almost nothing interesting happening {at least in the first couple of chapters}You get to play as Jill and Chris, you can walk/jog around with WASD, turn 180 degrees, aim/fire with mouse, that's about all you get to do. No jumping, dodging, sprinting, combos or any depth to the melee system, no QTEs either. There's absolutely nothing special about the game mechanics, it's the bare basics.The thing that bugged me most was the letterbox {if you don't own a widescreen monitor}, meaning you'll be seeing black blocks on top and bottom of the screen which you can't disable.This game is inferior to Resident Evil 5, Resident Evil Op Raccoon City and Resident Evil 6 in every possible way. It's like they've made this game in 2005, shelved it, started working on other games, and now just releasing it as a new game. It feels that ""cheap"" in quality. I'm sure you can still have fun but not after having played the other newer titles in the series.You have been warned. Buy Resident Evil 6 instead, you won't regret it.			"

												The Resident Evil series has had its ups and its downs from the greats of  the franchise like 2,3 Code Veronica and 4 to the worst entries (survivor,0,5 Raccoon city and 6) but this game is definately a decent entry and probably the only entry since darkside chronicles that is actually fun to play.The story of the game is basically that Jill Valentine is trying to find her partner Chris ""steroid junkie"" Redfield who has mysteriously gone missing. This game also takes place before 5 although some things like Jills older look (though I guess that you could put that down to the fact that the game was originally done on a Nintendo console) and some of the technology available like the fact of a city built on the water are hard to believe because of the timeline.The gameplay is a lot like that of 6 in the fact that you can move whie aiming but with the restraints of 4 in terms of melee combat. There is also a dodge feature that Jill originally had in 3 but it isn't as reliable as that one as you can never be too sure if it is going to register properly and this can be a problem as some of the enemies and bosses play out that you can damage them by dodging them when they go to charge at you whic will leave them open to attack.You can only carry a total of three guns at one time and ammo is actually scarce if you play on normal and if you feel up to the challenge, infernal. The upgrade system for guns is also back but you can never really upgrade them enough to think that you can kill everything and still complete the game with loads of ammo for every gun. The upgrades are also interchangeable so you can change what your guns atributes are if you want to tr using it to stun enemies more of veen give one of them a burst ability.The order in which you get weapon types is a bit weird in the whole fact that you can end up getting the stronger version of a weapon type before you get the weaker versions and some of the weaker versions can only be gotten by doing things like playing he game on infernal as that is the only mode that they appear on.Overall if you are a fan of the series of old, mainly 4, and want to play a decent modern Resi game then you should definately give this game a tryscore 86/100 "

												This game is amazing. And it's super easy. It's feel like you play a survivor horror classic residen evil. You have to run around, do some puzzles, collect items, some jumpscare. Make like a small several chapter it a good thing because sometime you have to rest and get your sanity back. So you will be more comfortable. The story is find. Cut scene is cinematic. Characters is look good except jill, she's look weird. The combat is ok. It's move like Re6 and they add a dodge mechanic that you can dodge almost every enemy attack. I guess. Over all if you are a residente evil and you want to buy this game. You should try this one. You will like it. Sure there has something that not good in this game but it ok.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations is an amazing game. It goes back to what made the original games survival horror icons. It is much more for the fans of those types of games rather than something like Resident Evil 5 or 6. I highly recommend this game. If you love Resident Evil in all its forms, maybe excluding The Umbrella Chronicles, you will love this game. I myself haven't played that one but I don't hear great things. I love how it has some modern elements while also sticking more closely to its roots. No wonder the sequel is also doing so well. I highly recomment this to any Resident Evil fan especially fans of the old survival horror elements mixed with RE 4 over the shoulder and controls.			"

The Voice work and Dialouge was not up to par, the graphics very mediocre, the gameplay not that engaging, and the story felt completely irrelevant/ forgettable to the main cannon with new characters I care not to see again in any future titles. I'm glad I got this on sale or else I would have been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥10x if I had paid full price for this. First title I really regretted buying.

												Let me start by saying that I did not play much of this game (about 15 min.) and I will most likely revist it in the future.That being said this is the 1st resident Evil game I would not Recomend.  While I enjoyed Revelations 2 gave this game 15 min. to do something that I liked, anything.  -The movement of the characters when moving the left analog stick were weirdly responsive like I could dodge any infected I would run accross.  -  The sound was insainly weak.  I thought it was my volume level at 1st and then I fired several roundsat my 1st infected and I just turned it off.  Sound can make or brake a horror game and it does not fail to disapoint with this title.-  I'll levae it at that.  maybe it'll get better in chapter 1 (thats right I havnt even started chapter 1).

												I'm not sure what precisely other people see in this game. Is it just nostalgia for old Resident Evil because RE5 and RE6 were so awful? You can try to put lipstick on a pig all you want, this game is decidedly medicore. The old tank like controls for RE aren't the least bit compelling without a decent atmosphere to help it along. The optimization attempt during the conversion from a portable platform (Nintendo 3DS) to PC is laughably substandard. It looks like middle-gen PS2 game at best. I realize that plot and dialogue (Yay for Jessica's ""sweet♥♥♥♥♥"") have never been the priority for any RE games, but in Revelations, it's comically absurd and don't get me started and the laughably bad character designs. The gameplay and level design are just so bland. Again, this was ported from a portable platform and Capcom did little to hide it. The limitations show at all times.I get where Capcom was trying to go with this in trying to satisfy RE fans, but this feels more like a mockery than fan service. This game probably should have remained on portables unless Capcom was willing to port this to the PC correctly.			"

												Worst Resident Evil ever. I saw there were screenshots which feature two protagonists most of time, so I brought two copies of it and was planning to play co-op just like what I did for RE5/RE6. Nonetheless I later found out the coop only work for Raid mode but not for campaign. Seriously? You have two protagonists but no option for coop?Beside that, the mechanic of using Genesis to find hiden stuffs is a disaster. The rewards of doing such scanning are often unjustifiable small, but you will get a feeling of being punished if you do not do it at all. This scanning only add extra workload to player without adding any fun, completely a bad idea.Won't recommend it. 5/10.			"

												While RE:Revelations wasn't horrible, it... wasn't a very good game either.Revelations suffered from many gameplay idiocies that more modern games have been plagued with. Here are just a few:This door is blocked/locked from the other side, jump through the huge window to get inside.-Why make me go through that trouble? Just have the door unlocked.My partner has the key to unlock the door, but insted of unlocking it himself, he gives me the key so I can unlock it.-Again, WHY!? Just have the NPC unlock the door. I had to walk past a locked door (with a fingerprint scanner), walk down a hall with no other doors, go into a room and wait for my character to register her fingerprint into a system, so that I can walk back down the hall to unlock the door I had to pass. -WHYYYYYYY!? Just don't put a lock on the ♥♥♥♥ing door! The game has so many dumb design descisions that make little to no sense all for the sake of making the game feel longer. The old Resident Evil titles had some of this, but the backtracking and running around and performing seemingly pointless tasks always had a meaningful reason. The character movement also feels really sluggish, and sometimes the character would not perform tasks when I was mashing on the buttons (throwing grenades) which led to a lot of other-wise avoidable deaths. This may be a side-effect of the port from the Nintendo DS, but is something that should have been given a little more considderation when making the move to PC. As critical as my review sounds... in general this is not a horrible installment in the Resident Evil franchise. It's leaps and bounds better then Resident Evil 6, but I can't really see a reason to play this game unless you get it in a bundle (as I did), or its on sale. The fun moments in this game are few and far between, letting the light spend more time shining on the shortcomings of the game's overall design. Hopefully Revelations 2 has learned from these mistakes. 2/5			"

												One of the latest Resident Evil titles to come out at the time of this review, June 2014, Revelations is a new entry in the franchise that originally came out for the Nintendo 3DS in 2012. The title was generally very well-received and, not a full year later, Capcom annouced that the title would be released to household consoles and PC. The story behind this title presents a difficult reality that I feel must be tackled right off the bat: this is a handheld game being ported to a household console, so it features a limited budget. The implications behind this statement are huge. Every single aspect of this game will (most likely) not be on par with every other game being released alongside this title. However, that doesn't mean this game is bad. A game is a system that's worth far more than the sum of its individual parts. Resident Evil 6, the other recent release at the time of writing, was a competent triple-A game with impressive visuals and full-fledged controls that allowed you to roll out of the way, lay on the floor, place explosives, take cover behind objects and other actions necessary for that game's core loop. However, it is very easy to see how one might not consider that a standard Resident Evil experience. Luckily, Revelations is the most classic-like Resident Evil game to be released since the mid 2000's, when the final remakes of the original Resident Evil and the last Outbreak entry were released.Do keep in mind, though, that this game strikes a balance: it is not the return of old-school survival horror that every hardcore fan of the series seems to be crying out for. The controls closely resembles an updated version of what was initially set established by Resident Evil 4 and barely modified in Resident Evil 5. Your camera is placed above your shoulder and always face what your avatar is looking at, you can strafe, aim and shoot. Perhaps the biggest addition to the controls is the fact that you can, finally, shoot and move at the same time. Overall, the gameplay works well and feels really tight. With a core set of mechanics being matched by well designed enemies.In most chapters you'll play as Jill Valentine aboard a derelict cruise ship, those are the chapters that feature the classic horror atmosphere and feeling. But in other chapters, that can be quite numerous, you'll play as different characters like Chris Redfield, Keith ""Grinder"" Lumley and Parker Luciani. It is during these chapters that the gameplay is changed to something that closely resembles the more modern Resident Evil gameplay experience: you get plenty of ammunition and level challenges usually boil down to surviving enemy waves or fighting through enemies to get to safety. Though, as in most games of the franchise, the general gameplay will naturally shift its focus towards something very similar to what is presented in these secondary chapters as the narrative reaches its climax and approaches the ending.The game's narrative is an interesting beast. While I personally loved the narrative and the plot twist in it, it is undeniable that Revelations makes use of some really exaggerated characters that draw a lot from the, sometimes ridiculous, world of Japanese animation. They're not many, but they are key personalities in the narrative that end up getting their fair share of screen time. The story segments featured in the secondary chapters are used to explain or advance the plot without having to rely on the magical convenience that every single answer to the game's mystery is aboard the Queen Zenobia.The narrative always pairs you up with a partner, but the game features no cooperative play in the campaign, being only available in RAID mode. The partner is controlled by an AI that does its best to stay out of your way: it deals almost no damage to enemies and, in turn, is mostly ignored by them. This results in a gameplay that feels more like the original games, when there were no partners around, even though there is someone there with you to be used by the narrative to advance the plot.In terms of additional information, I could list that the game's campaign features three difficulty modes (Casual, Normal and Inferno) and the highest difficulty features scrambled puzzles and new enemy placement that is supposed to breath some life into the game even after you've beaten it once and feel like the story mode has nothing else for you. Item boxes are back, but with a twist. Puzzle items like keys, cards and other miscellaneous items are stored in their own separate inventory that never runs out of space. Ammunition is stored separately as well, with each type having a maximum amount the character may carry. These quantities can be expanded by finding particular items, but the extra ammo you find must be left in place since you cannot store it in the box. You can carry up to three weapons at any time and that's where the item boxes come in play: you use them to swap weapons and parts. Parts are upgrades that you may find for your weapons throughout the journey, they exist in the campaign but have no significant impact in your performance. They are, however, a big deal in RAID mode.RAID mode is an alternate game mode that is unlocked as you beat the game for the first time. In it you get to choose an environment from the single-player campaign and play it with any character and weapons you choose. Enemies feature a life bar in this mode that help you make tactical decisions and there are special enemy types. These special enemies, sadly, are only enlarged or shrinked versions of the standard enemies with a distinguishable symbol that indicates how their behavior has been modified. You have strong enemies that deal extra damage, agile enemies that are smaller and move faster and many others. This mode's objective is to navigate the environment, dealing with any enemies along the way, and destroy the symbol that is at the end of the level. You usually don't have to kill every enemy to proceed, but some levels make use of chained doors and segments to force you to face a large enemy force, when you finish off the last enemy in the wave you'll get a padlock key that unlocks the way forward. The levels implement this mechanic in a wide range of success: some are really memorable, some are really annoying. There are no NPC's in this mode, it is a straight-up fight up until the very end.However, as has been mentioned before, enemies have health bars and they help you make tactical decisions. But that's not all they do, they also help you gauge your character's efficiency. Unlike the single-player campaign, RAID mode features a heavy RPG influence, something akin to what's seen in Monster Hunter and other action RPG's. Players have a RAID level, any characters they use deal and take damage based that level and the level of the monster they're interacting with. As you face more advanced environments, the enemy level increases. As a result, you'll deal less damage while taking more damage. The RPG influence on RAID mode goes even further: weapons have levels too and you'll need to grind for more levels and better weapons (you can't level up your weapons) as you progress through the different environments. You'll also have to buy items and ammo to supply your runs on each map. The whole mode provides an action RPG experience that, in my opinion, is overall superior to the usual Mercenaries mode. But I'm not a fan of being bound to stats, since the rest of the game is really about resource management and reaction time.If you like Resident Evil, then you probably won't mind paying full price for this game. Othewise, you might want to get it at a discount. Finally, I'd say that Resident Evil Revelations is not the game fans claim they want, not yet. But if future installments take inspiration from Revelations and continue to place horror first, then at least we're headed in the right direction.			"

												The Resident Evil series has had its ups and its downs from the greats of  the franchise like 2,3 Code Veronica and 4 to the worst entries (survivor,0,5 Raccoon city and 6) but this game is definately a decent entry and probably the only entry since darkside chronicles that is actually fun to play.The story of the game is basically that Jill Valentine is trying to find her partner Chris ""steroid junkie"" Redfield who has mysteriously gone missing. This game also takes place before 5 although some things like Jills older look (though I guess that you could put that down to the fact that the game was originally done on a Nintendo console) and some of the technology available like the fact of a city built on the water are hard to believe because of the timeline.The gameplay is a lot like that of 6 in the fact that you can move whie aiming but with the restraints of 4 in terms of melee combat. There is also a dodge feature that Jill originally had in 3 but it isn't as reliable as that one as you can never be too sure if it is going to register properly and this can be a problem as some of the enemies and bosses play out that you can damage them by dodging them when they go to charge at you whic will leave them open to attack.You can only carry a total of three guns at one time and ammo is actually scarce if you play on normal and if you feel up to the challenge, infernal. The upgrade system for guns is also back but you can never really upgrade them enough to think that you can kill everything and still complete the game with loads of ammo for every gun. The upgrades are also interchangeable so you can change what your guns atributes are if you want to tr using it to stun enemies more of veen give one of them a burst ability.The order in which you get weapon types is a bit weird in the whole fact that you can end up getting the stronger version of a weapon type before you get the weaker versions and some of the weaker versions can only be gotten by doing things like playing he game on infernal as that is the only mode that they appear on.Overall if you are a fan of the series of old, mainly 4, and want to play a decent modern Resi game then you should definately give this game a tryscore 86/100 "

												So straight up - my resident evil experience isn't huge.  I've played most of RE3, played a bit of 5 on the PS3 and completed 6 also on the PS3 in a co-op run.  This one feels the most like the Resident Evil games I was expecting.  Backtracking, scavenging for loot and some good atmosphere.  The writing is very RE which is to say over the top and great fun but not to be taken too seriosuly.  I enjoyed Revelations and will be trying RE2 in a co-op run as it has that available. Downsides?  The graphics show both its age and the fact we are looking at a HD port of what was a 3DS game origninally I believe but aren't so ugly you can't enjoy the game.  I'd recommend this one but don't buy the weapons DLC.  They're nice but for the campaign which was all I was interested of no use or bonus.			"

												I'm not sure why this game was made, I would have rather they put their resources into making a PC/console Mercenaries game. The limitations of the 3DS hardware were more apparent when playing this PC port and overall I didn't like any of the new characters or the story. Mechanically it felt more rigid than RE5 as well due to hardware limitations. People claim it's better than RE6, but I find that hilarious when the whole game takes place on a ship or a snowy mountain and RE6 had BOTH those environments plus A COUPLE DOZEN MORE, and it was overall a way more ambitious and complex game than this. Mercenaries is also way cooler than Raid mode. I mean there's been worse RE games than Revelations, but I was really not impressed by it.			"

												What's cool about this game is that the gun controls are really smooth, even if the movement controls arent. It's the Resi 4 System, you aim before you can shoot. The movement is slightly better than Resi 4, but moving while shooting is now a possibilty.The environments on the cruise ship are also really detailed, at the expense of some shoddily-hidden load times. This game goes back to the days of the incredibly-long-to-unlock-door variety of load screens.I know that I've barely touched on anything in the game, but this is all you really need to know about this game. It plays like Resi 4, and the environments look great.9/10			"

												ONLY BUY THIS GAME ON SALEPros+Game is graphically appealing despite being a 3ds port+The difficulty Infernal truly makes this the HARDEST RE I have EVER played and I have beaten every RE game including Dead Aim and RE: Outbreak Series. The ordinary oozes will kill you in 3-5 depending how they attack you, two enemies kill you instantly if you get caught(The Wall Blitzers and Scagdeads), and your toughest bunch are the hunters and scarmiglones.+Their are NUMEROUS amounts of enemies in the game to keep this game fresh. Their are roughly 14 different unique enemies in the game  with 4 big bosses included in that 14. I don't think any RE has came close to this amount of enemy variey. +Weapon Variety is also consistent with past RE like RE3 and RE Code veronica from, handguns to rifles to the good ole rocket launcher+A new perk called Parts are added to the game to make it a little more easier. When you find these parts, you use them to attach to your weapons to do things such as additional damage, faster fire rate, increase reload space, faster fire rate, and more.+The games new game mode is called RAID MODE. It is a game mode that focuses on completing the levels objectives by killing all the enemies, transporting an object to the objective or simply reach the objective. The game uses the EXACT same levels in the campaign in RAID MODE but just in incriments. ALL the characters in the story are playable in RAID MODE by completing bonuses or reaching a level. 3 of the characters-racheal ooze and Lady hunk. Including your old time favorite,(which btw has not been in an RE canonical story since RE2) HUNK. The mode comes in 3 tiers, Chasm(Easy), Trench(Normal) , and Abyss(Hard). However, ghost ship is unlocked from the start a lvl 50 recommended stage as a way to boost to 50 quick. If you die whether it be you playing solo or you or your coop partner dies in the raid mode stage, you have to start ALL over. Their are no lives and their are not checkpoints. Just to let NEW RE fans know, these additional game modes are NOT new. Additional Game Modes have been here since the Original RE. Battle Mode(RE1, RE2, RE Code Veronica), Mercenaries(RE3, RE4, RE5, RE6), and RAID Mode(REV1 and REV2).+You have to beat story mode in order to unlock additional content in the game. Forcing the player to work for it. Which is good, because A) It feels like you earned it and B) too many games unlocks everything from the start(Tekken Tag Tournament 1 and 2 for instance)+The Dodge mechanic from RE3 is back! You are able to dodge ALL enemies except one in this game including bosses. This is great way to practice your dodging.  Not only can you dodge enemy physical attacks but also projectiles. Each enemy has a different unique way to dodge their movements so you have to watch carefully. Cons-This is an RE game. ALL RE games are supposed to be heavy on the STORY primarily. Everything else is secondary. The game takes place between RE4 and RE5. The story in this game is ATROCIOUS. This game has the worst story of any RE game I have ever played and every RE including spin offs have been decent. It utilizes a technique that derives from cinematography called ""In media Res"" This technique, tells you what happens in the middle of the game or the ending and reverts back to the past from player's perspective. In Revelations, the story goes back in forth like you boat(no pun intended) It starts you off in the present, then after that it goes to the past, then back to the present, then back to the past 1 year earlier due to a terrorist incident, then back to the present; its ANNOYING!!!! This disrupts the flow of the story. Hell, their is an episode that takes you back 30 mins ago!!! WTH??? -The characters in the game are easily forgettable except for Jill and Chris. Everyone else is expendable. Nothing about the characters are interesting except typical stereotype. You got your typical white spoiled girl who uses sexual appeal to be likeable(which she all has), you got your typical imported foreigner from another country, you got your 2 stooges, and you got an insane old guy who likes to use poetry as their slogan for their terrorist group. Its so cliche and not even funny. -The game's movement pacing is PATHETIC. In the original demo for revelations on RE mercenaries 3D, you COULD run in the game. When the final product dropped, the game got rid of running. This is unacceptable as running was essential in every RE game. In the Past RE games, you could outrun almost every enemy except the hunters. In Revelations, if this was a race, You cannot outrun 75% of the enemies in this game, FORCING you to wait for them to attack you and dodge them or Kill them. This makes Revelations the ONLY game in the RE series to make speedrunning useless and borning unless you are DODGE GOD like myself. -Using the Genesis is the most tedious gimmick I have ever encountered in a RE. In your traditional RE game, you use first AID sprays and herbs simply by finding rooms or gardens filled with them. In Revelations their are very few herbs simply lying around. Instead you have to use a device called the Genesis to scan enemies that stores a percentage of their data until it reaches 100%. Once it reaches 100% a herb is deposited into your inventory. Mixing herbs are not in this game as well as first aid sprays. HOWEVER, each green herb instantly restore all your health to make up for the lack of mixing/first aid spray. On top of the genesis being a gimmick, the game forces you to use it too much in order to gain herbs. So many emeies don't  give you the chance to scan them more than once, because they are too fast such as Rachel Ooze, wall blitzers, or T-abyss fish(They jump a lot). If you are playing infernal mode and you HAVE no herbs where you fighting a battlion of BOWs you may have to restart the game or make sure you create an earlier save.-Their are no typerwrites and no chapter selects. You are forced to rely on checkpoints. If you want to play a certain chapter of the game because it interests you, TOO BAD, you can't. You have to restart the game all over again. -RAID mode leveling system is out of control. The max level in RAID MODE is level 50 and it will take you FORVER to reach it unless you have a coop partner. The only way to maximize your EXP bar is to establish a trinity bonus(Don't get hit, beat a level with the recommended level or below, AND kill all enemies in the game. Earning a trinity bonuses gives you good items on the level. It will take you WEEKS of constant play to get to levle 50. The quickest trick people have done to level up to 50 is have a COOP partner do ghost ship entirely by themselves while themselves sitting their for 20 mins-1 hr. -Some RAID MODE chapters on harder difficulties are TOO long to the point it almost makes it impossible to beat on your inventory. Their has been TOO MANY instances where I have ran out of ammo and I had to rely on knifing or finishing the level up and its stupid(perfect examplle-GHOST SHIP) You have to make all your shots count or your in DEEP trouble. -In order to finish some of the toughest levels on RAID mode, you need to get get parts that are ONLY obtainable either on THE LONGEST LEVELS or INTERMEDIATE ONES. I said before that some RAID MDOE levels are so long that you run out of ammo. In order to increase my ammo capacity I need to get certain parts by trinity bonuses or luck. Problem is, the best parts are on the LONGEST levels. That is LUDICROUS. This FORCES you to get a coop partner who has beaten ghost ship countless times. It is nearly impossible to finish RAID MODE completely by yourself WITHOUT constant farming or without a coop partner. -A lot of parts are ONLY exclusive to RAID mode and not story mode, but not vice versa- Running is ONLY available in RAID MODE but ONLY through parts. I play REV1 ONLY for RAID Mode as REV2 raid mode SUCKS!			"

												Resident Evil Revelations is a PC port of a 3DS game that was released on 2012. It's a disappointingly short game but still enjoyable enough at the discounted price I paid. It's core gameplay borrows heavily on Resident Evil 4 (RE4), some might say even better but that's up to the person playing. While it does have some horror elements in it, I honestly think it's not as scary as the previous entries. It rather focuses on action a lot more than survival horror and puzzle solving. Thankfully, thanks to the borrowed gameplay mechanics from RE4, shooting zombies (or B.O.Ws) has never been so fun.Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for it's story and characters. I think they're pretty weak, filled with obvious plot twists and lifeless dialogues.However, despite it's flaws, I still found it fun to play (though it has a very little replay value). Definitely recomended for RE fans.RECOMENDED: For RE4 fans and players who doesn't mind some of the ported 3DS game shortcomings.NOT RECOMENDED: For PC elitist who insisted in 1080p and 60fps.			"

												I really don't understand why people like this kind of games,it is EXTREMELY LINEAR, this is what the game feels like:1. you walk corridors.2. Enemies (zombies/monsters/mutants) appear.3. You shoot them.4. REPEAT.From time to time you encounter a big boss, which you have to shoot up some more aaaand... return to step 1.Maybe there was a time for this kind of games, but not anymore.The scenarios are full of ""invisible walls"" formed by 1m high crate boxes, which block all the paths except for the one you are supposed to take in a weak attempt of conceiling the fact that you are actually walking a single corridor with no alternate routes.Maybe you are supposed to be a RE hardcore fan to enjoy this, I know I've really tried to, but I won't be wasting my time any more.

												[[Cons]] - Wacky storyline - Voice acting isn't great - No zombies - Low graphics - Chris isn't as buff as he usually is - Bunch of new characters to ""kill off"" (but not really) - Constant jump between different campaigns all to piece the game together[[Pros]] -No Wesker - Raid mode is enjoyable - No Wesker - The game is decently hard (if you're into that) - No Wesker - A few nods to the original Resident Evil (kinda make you smile)All in all it wasn't a great game, but I did enjoy playing it. If you can get this cheap it may be worth your time. Definitely wouldn't recommend paying more than $20 for it.			"

												The shooting mechanics feel very, very bad. That's killer in a game where the only two things you can do are shoot enemies and do boring fetch quests. It might be to encourage you to skip unnecessary fights, but ammo is never scarce enough for that to matter. It's not scary or interesting to play.			"

												This game is a a decent port of the 3ds version. other than that there's not much that can be said about it. The game bounces around alot, so if you're not paying attention then you might miss something, but luckily at the end of each episode it recaps the important stuff. Controls aren't to bad. That being said. I didn't see any game breaking bugs. UNLESS, you are like me and enjoy watching cutscenes in a game as the story develops. If you can stomach the video in pre-rendered cutscenes moving about 5 seconds faster than the actual audio then by all means get this game. But i do not recomend this game if you are a stickler for spot on audio, to give you an example. At multiple points there is alot of talking between characters. The audio lag is so bad that it is about 4 characters behind in dialogue, and because of this issue the actual audio gets cut off by the cut scene actually ending. I only stomached through it because my viewers on twitch were ok with it. But after i finished this i uninstalled it. because i will not play this garbage again until capcom decides to get off their butts and stop putting out half baked content. Be advised, before you get angry because you think it was my system. its not. I've tried this on 3 of the computers we have in my house. I've scoured the internet and found other people having this issue, The fixs some people have posted don't work for everyone, and no it wasn't my streaming software as it happened to the other computers who were streaming anything when i booted it up.

												Revelations is a welcome addition to the Resident Evil franchise. It attempts to go back to its survival horror roots with a tense atmosphere and semi-tank controls. Revelations does not disappoint in that aspect as there are several moments where you do not expect what will be around the corner waiting for you. It really is no secret that Capcom wants to take the franchise into the action/third-person style; and Revelations still has aspects of this as well. It may not be as bad as other Resident Evil games but the game is still quite enjoyable. With the introduction of Revelations comes the Genesis, a device used to show hidden items through-out the environment. The Genesis adds an interesting layer to the gameplay. The main purpose of the Genesis is to gain additional ammo and herbs. Of course you can also use the Genesis to scan B.O.W.s., whether alive or dead, to gain more herbs with every 100% completion. There are very few healing items in the open world so it is highly advised you use the Genesis as much as possible. Overall the Genesis is an interesting addition to a Resident Evil game but in the end it shows that the game really was made with a handheld in mind.A few gripes with the game is that the story telling isn’t the best. You are constantly switching back and forth between several people and this tends to mud up the flow of the timeline within the game. Another annoyance is the lack of healing items. There will be quite a few times you run out of them, as you can only carry five, and you only gain a small percentage from scanning monsters. The game also tends to hold your hand when you die, basically telling you what you did wrong and how to overcome it. I wish Capcom didn’t do and let the player figure it out like the past games. In conclusion Revelations is a must have for any fans of the classic Resident Evil series. It takes a step back to recreate the tense setting and tries to instill fear into the player like the games of old with a few new twists on the gameplay.Overall I give the game a 7 out of 10.			"

												Amazing game. The singleplayer has a suprising story. Its much like an the old Resident Evil 0,1,2,3 and has  the same problem with the short playtime. The hell mode is a hard challenge and the multiplayer is funny but the last level very hard too. The graphics could be tuned with more details (objects, more polygons for the characters) but its like the sound good enough. So the game is worth to be tested. Hopefully you enjoy it like me :)			"

												I'm just going to say this early on, as I'm confident I know what I'm in for. I got the game for pennies so it's no big deal, but HOLY HELL can you tell this came from the handheld 3DS system. Right off the bat, it was unplayable on a TV with it's super low FOV. Thankfully this could be fixed by the ""Widescreen Fixer"" application.Beyond that what you have here is a very stripped down Resident Evil experience. While it has some control refinements over, say, RE4, its been vastly improved upon by it's sequel, Revelations 2. I say jump to that game and just watch summary videos of this one, if you must. There's absolutely no one online here anyway, so the raid mode is a bust. Its my opinion that the franchise hasn't had a plot worth following past RE3, but even if you disagree, I think anyone can tell this is shaped up to be an afterthought from the core series. I wouldn't pay more than a few bucks for this.They did their best with the PC port, in that the videos are HD quality, and the textures, frame rate, models, etc are all as good as one could hope coming from the 3DS. There's definite enhancements.			"

												Please do not listen to the positive reviews. This is coming from a big resident evil fan. Not only is this the worst resident evil game I have played, it is actually the worst game I have played. Ever. I keep trying to like it because I am a fan, but I can't. Are you walking by a dryer? A regenerator will come out of it. Are you walking by a closet? Don't worry a regenerator is actually waiting in it and will come out. They put monsters in the absolute dumbest spots I have ever seen in any video game. Do you need to unscrew something to get out of a room? Don't worry. A screwdriver is actually taped (yes I said taped) underneath a toilet seat. This is the dumbest game ever. Save your money.			"

NOPE!No, the guns are not new. Dumb upgrade system and 3 guns to use though the entire game (pistol, assault rifle, shotgun) everything else is useless.No, the plot does not make sense. I mean come on, a giant monster roams the sea and they're trying to save some red water from spilling over. The sea is freakin infected already, ok?! You can go home now, mission failed!No, the new features do not make this better. In fact the pull-out-the-scanner game every five minutes just blows.A true disgrace to the franchise.			"

												I don't usually write reviews, but this game... Jesus Christ!!This could be a good game, it's fun at starts, but then, the cheesy and awkward dialogue and stupid things that happen start to get to you! The creature design is just awful, you're either fighting giant plastic lizards that look like they just came out of a Power Rangers episode, or you're fighting 6 days old pieces of lasagna with legs, not to mention a giant meatball with tentacles!The gameplay mechanics are standard Resident Evil style, but with some really annoying differences that are just enough to make you wanna throw your keyboard through the window!And the story, oh my god the story! You can spot the plot twists from a mile away, and there's two guys, Jackass(that's his name!!) and the other what's is face,that remind me of an idiot Snoop Dog and a Sex Offender on parole.I wanted to like this game, i really did,and i was enjoying at first but then... Oh, and the game drags and drags and drags until you think it should have ended a boss ago, then it drags a little bit more!Do yourself a favour, go have a beer and stay away from this one!			"

												You want Resident Evil Revelations? I will give you revelation -> this game sux. I could not stand playing for more than 3 hours. Just... impossible.TL-DR : I got this game for free. And I did not even get my money's worth. I do not recommend it at all.This was the first Resident Evil game I played and I believe it will be the last.What is this game about? Protagonist is a crippled person, uncappable of anything but slow walk. So you charge at your enemies with agility of 95 yo grandpa with clutches. You can not even move a chair if it blocks your path. You shoot zombies that hardly notice it. You scan desks with scanner to find hidden ammo. You look for keys to find doors to get you to doors that you need to find key to open, to get to door that you have no card to open and need to slowly walk to another door that magically opened at your convenience to get it...Gameplay is terrible. Terrible. You can not dodge or block in normal way, nor jump or crouch. Not even run. You just walk with zombies behind you. And if you shoot them, even in the head, they do not even react, they do not flinch. They are not thrown back even if you shoot them with shotgun to the chest at arms length. And you must be almost stationary to shoot. No Run and Gun. Nope. If you try that, you swing knife at enemies... You want to spray them down while backing like hell? Nope, not here. Ah, there is a door! (the corridors are a few metres long, then there is a door. Always a door... every few steps. And the monsters disappear or appear when you go through that door. And you always close the door behind you. Smart). There is some debris blocking your path, that you coul walk over (not even need to jump) ? Too bad, you need to take a de-tour. There is NO place for cyber-athletics, no agility.  No using corners, ducking, running back and charging at enemy when you see fit. Nope, not here.You just walk at enemies at the speed of dying turtle, shoot them (shooting makes no difference until enemy suddenly drops dead) and open doors. Ah, and eat a plant that grows everywhere to magicaly restore your health. And use super-advanced scanner to find ammo you can not see otherwise. Tasks are extremely dull and boring Every zombie runs at you. Every one tries to kill you. Unless the zombie carries a key that you need. Then, for some reason, it runs away from you... and you need to chase it to the start of the level, so the game  seems longer and not so linear. So you end up walking here and there like a confused freshman looking for his class. Go get the key to get through this door. Ah god, why not learn how to pick that locks, they seem to be everywhere...Shooting does not feel natural. It has no real effect on the enemy, apart from lowering their health bar. So you are stationary, can not run, and can not use guns to clear some space. You just stand, walk back slowly and shoot. It is extremely boring. No satisfaction in killing enemies, no thrill in battless. None at all. The atmosphere is not like in a horror movie. It feels like in a parody of a horror movie. There is actually no atmosphere at all. The game controls feel so unnatural that it just will not let you fall into the story. The battles are so dull you will get no rush of adrenaline. They try to make it scary, and they fail miserably. A zombie attacked me from a washing machine... seriously? A lot of jumps scenes that try to scare you, but they simply do not work at all... The only ""scary"" moment is when the game crashes and you are afraid of losing your save file. You want a good horror-shooter game? Go and buy Metro 2033 redux and thank me later. Leave this be. It is not worth your time.			"

rating: Not worth playingscore: 5/10 - hard to recommendsimilar games: Resident Evil 4,5 and 6target audience: Resident Evil fans who played every Resident Evil game and hunger for moreResident Evil fans were dissapointed by Capcom because of their change of focus to more action-packed games instead of survival horror. For those fans Capcom made Resident Evil Revelations which originally came out for Nintendo DS and was later ported to all the main platforms. Does this version of Resident Evil really go back to its roots? And is this a good port from the Nintendo DS?Disclaimer: I love Resident Evil 1 HD Remaster (the first time I played RE1), I really like Resident Evil 5, I like Resident Evil 4 and the Leon Campaign of RE6 wasnt that bad.GameplayWell. Not only are there only very few ""horror""-sections in this game (which were supposed to be the main part), but also these horror-sections arent horror at all. There isnt a single scary moment in this game, not even a creepy atmossphere like in Resident Evil 4 or the Leon Campaign in Resident Evil 6. The biggest design flaw of this game is that you have a coop partner with you (AI driven). This not only makes the game less scary than it already is, but also the AI is HORRIBLE and the game isnt even properly designed with coop in mind. The only thing your partner does is sometimes distract enemies and other times give you some additional fire power.Let me makes this clear: This game is VERY far away from survival horror, but the problem is even as an action game it fails in many parts. The guns feel weak, have ugly sounds, ugly animations, clonky movement system, boring level design, boring weapons and also many unnessesary weapons. This game felt like a japanese MMO with tons of grinding most of the time, especially because it was so damn easy, probably because its a port from the nintendo DS where you have worse controls so it gets easier on PC just because of Mouse+KB.The ""puzzles"", if you can even call them puzzles, were uninspired and boring. The worst parts of this game is when you are trapped in an area and you have to fight waves of enemies which is extremely dull.But there is one thing which I want to give this game huge credits for and thats the creature design which is actually one of the best creature designs of all Resident Evil games, however for every cool enemy there is also a boring, uninspired enemy.But especially the very first enemy you meet in the game is really cool, because their ugly look not only makes them look scary, but also because of their weird movement it makes headshots more challenging. If Capcom would capture the survival-horror atmossphere of the previous games in this game, these enemies would make you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants.The thing is, if you consider that this game was originally made for the nintendo DS you can understand why it cant be good. Not because the DS is a bad handheld, but survival horror simply doesnt work on DS and if you make an action game you have to make it very simple for the DS, which is way too simple if you port it to PC.Thats why I am excited for Revelations 2, because that game is made primarily for PC and current-gen consoles, but there you also have Coop and multiple playable characters so we will see...NarrativeThe narrative of this game is absolute garabage and functional at best. Not only is it full of annoying and cliche characters, it also is told in a very boring way, because it keeps jump from location to location. When you play some time with Jill and get used to the Queen Zenobia, suddenly the chapter ends and the next chapter starts at a completely different location with diferrent characters. I guess they wanted to introduce many characters (some from previous RE games) and make their storys connect later, but the ONLY reason they did this is because they needed filler and they wanted to have some action between the ""horror"" parts of the game (which arent horror as I explained).Every character in this game is SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cliche, terribly written and annoying, even known characters like Jill and Chris are so bad in this game (what the ♥♥♥♥ happenend to Jill´s face and voice?). Chris is the only character which isnt annoying.Also the game does take itself serious but at other times makes some stupid jokes and both of these dont fit at all, especially if you want to make survival horror (which this game isnt anyway).AestheticsUgly. Only word I can describe this game is ugly. Character models, weapons models and the location, everything is ugly. Of course this is because of the technical limitations of the Nintendo DS, but they could still put some effort into the design of the places. Only thing which is designed really good are the enemies (but there are also many ugly enemies, and with ugly I mean bad).SoundtrackDidnt even notice any kind of soundtrack, its just some random music in the background.GraphicsOh my, the graphics of this game are worse than playstation 2 games even if it runs at 1080p60fps. I know its a DS port, but they could at least put SOME effort into and increase the quality of the textures and make better character models.This game is just a pain to look at.			"

												Bought this in the humble bundle deal.Very odd title. It plays like an older Resident Evil game. It's heavy on the wandering around looking for where to go next, solve the next puzzle. It seems like a step back from the other titles such as Resident Evil 4 and 5. The graphics are certainly inferior. The sound is ok.I believe it was originally developed as a 3DS title, which frankly explains a lot.For die hard fans of the series only, it's a bit of a struggle to play and not very enjoyable. The action/shooter elements of the game feel like something from 15 years ago. The plot is hilariously bad. The maps are confusing.My advice: Go straight to Revelations 2. Much better game.			"

												Please God, let me meet her. All I want to is to find that perfect girl I know exists. She’s sweet and shy and my age and likes all the things I do, perhaps even is on this site itself. The girl who won’t secretly think I’m a loser, the girl I can cuddle with (even if only possible online) and spent nights talking to and laughing and sharing happiness. Someone who can reciprocate the love I put in, the girl who I can make feel safe and secure unconditionally and can fill this gaping, empty void in my heart. Please, just let me find this person. I’ll change everything about me if that’s what it takes Please, I just can’t take the loneliness anymore.			"

												Beware the false advertisement, there is absolutely no coop for the campagin, only in the raid mod. Seriously, there was REAL coop in the previous games, I was expecting it to be the same here, but no. The only fun thing about the recent Resident Evils was to play along with friends, but not in this one anymore. So beware, if you want a coop game, don't buy this one, it's really a trap, and I clearly wasted my money here.			"

												I wish I'd researched the game before buying it.Honestly, I didn't expect to be as disappointed as I was, but here we are. I had heard fantastic things about the Resident Evil /Biohazard franchise, and seeing how this game was on sale, I decided to give it a shot (mostly because a friend of mine praised it so much).The gameplay is tedious. I don't mean that as in ""It's difficult :/"" I mean it as in it gets repetitive and tiring. The story presents itself as some kind of TV drama with plenty of cliches, along with boring characters, mediocre dialogue, etc.Maybe my negativity towards it is mainly a ""it just isn't my type of game"" thing, but I honestly got tired of it fairly quick. I tried to finish it, but I ultimately got to a point I couldn't handle playing it anymore.This is just me. I personally hated it. Someone else might like it, but not me.			"

												This is a step in both the right and wrong direction for the Resident Evil series at large- the atmosphere is closer to what the older iterations of the series felt like, with dingy corridorsand a sense of threat absent from other recent versions of the game. It offers a nautical residentevil 'experience', for better or for worse depending on the taste of the player. There is a horror of a sort here, but it is underused considering the setting and isolation of the sea.The controls handle well, but the fact you have to use the mouse to shoot, without being given the option to map it to the keyboard, is a massive drawback- Resident Evil 5 allowed you to do so in its own PC port, so it seems inexcusible to have it absent here. Otherwise, most of the other controls are no different from previous iterations. Being able to charge one's physical attacks is satisfying but it breaks up the frenetic flow of combat a little too much.The further lack of an inventory system again moves away from the crux of what has come to have been expected from the series; it feels too deliberate an attempt at distancing itself other games. In addition, the lack of variety in enemy types is also rather disappointing, although the designs of those included are suitably grotesque. The scanner, however, is one addition which I think works well, though it has teething troubles here from being typecast in a similar vein to the 'vision' mechanic present in recent Batman, Lara Croft and Hitman games. Altogether, this is a back-to-basics Resident Evil game, which it strengthened and weakened by this move, but its glaring flaws for me cannot be balanced by its positive ones. Go for the first Dead Space game instead- it is a more effective and streamlined horror shooter game.			"

												It is a 'good' (resident evil) game. It's very atmospheric which keeps the Horror. I don't want to recommend this game because the story and the gameplay were pretty bad (for me!). Jill is my most favourite RE character but that didn't make the game good for me (it usually does). If you're looking for a RE that has some horror in it, you can get this one.5/10			"

[This is a tryhard review because of my extreme boredom and dislike for this game. I have nothing to do and I want to waste a half hour. Enjoy.]Revelations is a disappointment in the Resident Evil genre especially after masterpieces such as 4. It lacks the atmosphere, scares, and, especially, gameplay that the previous titles have presented.PROS:- Controls are fine.- Good graphics for it's time.CONS:- Only atmospheric for the first 20 minutes, then it's a matter of walking around the map with no fears.- Enemies, sounds, and music just isn't scary.- 1st boss of the game is literally impossible to new players and will turn many off from the game.- The gameplay is boring and consists of running back and forth with occassional enemies.- The map (that you run around) is impossible to navigate causing players to get lost.- The map (like the radar in the menu) is 3D and impossible to navigate causing players to go the wrong ways.- The story is BAD.- No secret treasures.- There is no shopkeep :(.- The game is overpriced. (currently $29.99)- Originally was supposed to be a 3DS exclusive game. Now I see that it's not meant for PC.My selling point would probably have to be the gameplay. It's so bland and boring that you realize you could be spending your time better doing something else.EXAMPLE:Objective: go to the bridge on the ship*goes to bridge on ship* *kills like 2 guys*Objective: go get a key for the door*walks across map* *gets key for door* *walks all the way back to door*Objective: go to the communication room and call for help*goes to room* *communication system is broken*Objective: walk to [room name] and fix the communication system*walks all the way there* *fixes system* *walks all the way back*I like the RE franchise but this game is just so bad especially for being newer. I can't completely judge it, (although I kinda just did), since I have not fully completed it. HOWEVER, I have played enough to the point where I can write an honest review about it. It is bad and I don't plan on finishing it soon. If you're still looking for a great game in the franchise, Resident Evil 4 is the way to go.			"

												Yay! More Resident Evil! I was very hesitant to buy this when it first came out knowing that it is a PC port of a Nintendo 3DS game, but I wanted it anyway because I love Resident Evil and it got mostly favorable reviews. The only thing stopping me was that it was $50 new for a Nintendo 3DS port, which sounded insane. That was May 2013 when it came out. 16 months later and the price is still $50 and that is one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen. First off, it never should have been $50 new and a ton of people voiced that concern in the forums. I have no idea how well the game sold during its initial release days, but I can only imagine that quite a lot of people withheld their money, and rightfully so. The game should only be $25 max because of the quality of the game. It is more generic than other RE games (4, 5, and 6) and the graphics are all horrible save for the character graphics are actually really good. But considering that it is more of a survival game than 4-6 are, especially considering that 5 and 6 are almost pure action games, is what makes it push its max worth in my mind to around $30. If it had the polish and AAA engine of 5 or 6, it could easily have been quite possibly the best RE ever. But that would take an entirely different game since this was ported from a 3DS game. For what it's worth, they actually did a very good port job. Capcom used to be the kings of horrible PC ports (that title belongs unanimously to Ubisoft now), but over the years they have actually been putting out very good ports. RE4 and 5 were ported horribly, but 6 is very well done and so are other Capcom games since that time including this one. The only problem is that when you port a 3DS game you are inevitably going to have poor graphics, and 3DS quality gameplay. The movement and controls are great, but when you fire into any enemy, it is noticeably generic and seems like you are playing a big screen 3DS game for sure. But the game is still a lot of fun and also goes back to the old find this key for this door, card reader, solve a puzzle, etc. So it feels more like a old RE game like 1-3. The weapons are all great and fun to use, and the Raid mode is a very nice additional game mode that has you re-running levels but in more of a arcade style and you can customize your weapon loadout and choose different characters. There is no combine herbs BS here, you just pick up herbs and use them as you go. That is one thing I never liked or hated, but could have done without, was the herb system of the games. This is a good change, but still RE6 has the best herb system imo. The cutscenes are almost all pretty good, but the ones with the guy with the nickname “Jackass” are just painful to watch because the character tries to be funny but it's like a white version of Urkel with a gun. I just want to punch him in the head every time I hear his voice. And like every other Capcom game in existence, they somehow manage to strike a perfect blend of cool cutscenes with good writing but horrible, laughable voice acting. Not one Capcom game exists with even decent voice acting. Capcom are the kings of serious cutscenes with voice acting that sounds like it was delivered by the characters from Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. The biggest flaw with the game imo are the underwater parts, which take up about 2 whole chapters, maybe more. Swimming under water should not be in a RE game. The swimming underwater parts are way too long. The pressure of finding where to swim before you drown while stopping at points in between where you can swim up and catch a quick breath, does not introduce any new strategy in the game and requires no skill. It is just irritating and stressful. You can't attack underwater but you can push enemies off and not take any dmg, and you swim, and swim, and swim and it is pure ♥♥♥♥ing boredom at its finest. I would like to play RE please, not a crappy diving and swimming simulator.Although I'm a big RE fan, RE6 and all the other games I own kept me busy until just recently I got this game for $13. Well worth that price too. $50 like it still is normally? Lol. Catch it on sale for $20 or less. And please. no more underwater parts in RE games, thanks.7/10			"

And this mode like the campaign, just with random-enemy-spawn - and everything cool is removed like cutscenes, special stuff, story and all the cool splatter-effect-stuff...

												If you have played the 3DS version of the game you know what to expect story and locations wise. However Capcom has added some extra's to the PC version like new enemies, weapons, kits and ofcourse the graphics.Raid mode is also alot harder now and requires teamwork especially on the harder difficulties once you unlocked them. This makes RAID mode more rewarding and no longer a walk in the park like on the 3DS.The single player is still exactly the same and during the campaign you play as different characters uncovering the secret behind the Queen Zenobila and Veltro. If you are and old school RE fan I higly reccomend this game 8/10.			"

You will play mostly on a ship infested by the new T-Abyss virus.  The ship is rather well crafted and interesting to navigate.  Jill and Chris are BACK!!  Just that is worth a purchase if you are a fan of old resident evil.  Story is interesting, although I didn't find any of the new characters memorable. As for the multi-player, raid mode is very fun.  Go through stages of the single player map and take down mobs after mobs. Upgrade guns and mod them and repeat.  Gets addictive.

												This game was in my backlog for a couple months because I was upset about resident evil 6. But to my great surprise, Revelations is actually a really good resident evil game. The monsters have been designed creatively, the queen zenobia is a very good place tohave a resident evil game take place and the characters are pretty interesting. There's also raid mode which is really fun in co-op.And also, DEM BOOTIES!!!Overall this is a great game and I recommend it to any resident evil or action horror fan.			"

												TLDR: Didn't play single player (not what I bought it for). From a technical perspective co-op is so broken it's not worth trying to play. Just search for ReR co-op issues (lag/desync), they're widespread.Bought it specifically for the co-op. First off, IT'S NOT campaign co-op. If that's what you want, look elsewhere. Co-op in ReR exists entirely in a new Raid Mode, and if you're thinking it's anything like mercernaries, it's not. It's almost like playing campaign co-op but without any story whatsoever. It simply drops you in an area and you start moving through  killing stuff. It has persistent leveling and tons of guns/gun mods that can be unlocked with the points you get from the levels. It actually seemed really neat (particularly some of the gun mods, huge variety, some really neat stuff) HOWEVER... crippling performance ruins the entire experience.There seem to be massive network problems with the game, it almost feels like you're constantly having massive lag spikes. Your partner can run halfway through a level, but on your screen they will still be standing at the beginning. Every once in a while the game will update your partner's position and you can get a general idea of where they actually are. Oddly enough it seems to register all actions pretty well, so even though I can't see my partner move, he can still shoot at enemies and I can still see the damage that he's doing to them... It's just that from my point of view my partner is hitting the enemy through walls and whatnot. The whole experience was really bizarre. Searching online for ReR co-op issues shows we're not the only ones having problems either. There seem to be technical issues going back to the game's release that have been completely ignored by Capcom. Saw mostly positive reviews on Steam but very little feedback on the multiplayer, so I thought I'd get this in.			"

												For having a short campaign, actualy, the game has everything what you need (except the wished for horror effect). Besides that the game acts likes an action game it has his own story which I actualy enjoyed like I did in Resident Evil 6.As said, the story is actualy short so you shouldn't rush the game or else you might be disapointed. It's a good game so and I enjoyed it.			"

												I liked Resident Evil 5, or at least the first half of it. It was challenging, and although the enemies weren't really zombies, the difficulty made them scary. This, however, is nothing like RE5. Easy enemies, linear corridors, terrible voice acting, and it looks like they're using the same textures and models as in the handheld release. Steer away, nothing to see here.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations was originally made for 3DS so its not a big surprise that this supposed to be HD port of handheld Resident Evil game. and dont get me wrong - the game is actually as good as Resident Evil 6 with few interesting (and few stupid) mechanics so anyone who just want to play a third person shooter game gonna enjoy it for sure.But unfortunately as a fan of old Resident Evil games, Iam very disappointed by how repetetive this game is with a lot of backtracking (yes, old RE games also have backtracking but at least it wasnt as bad as here) and this latest Capcom's obsession with doing cutscene or waiting for loading map (like using elevators or specific doors) every ♥♥♥♥ing minute. Half of the game you dont even shoot the monsters cos you are too busy watching said literally filler cutscenes or swimming.-----------------------------------------The story is all over the place and as confusing as modern Resident Evil games trying to be - the plot will constantly switching betwen 5 different places, characters and times (and at the end its not even that interesting.) Characters are really shallow and they dont have much interesting to say in the whole game and the whole ""episodic story"" is really annoying, constantly doing the same thing:>do a crappy cliffhanger>show the stats and save options>show ""previously at Resident Evil Revelations"">now the story takes place in different place, with different characters and different timeOn beginning of the game its not a big issue but later on you will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off with that so much when you realise how much this game is trying to deny you from any kind of gameplay.-----------------------------------------Does game have puzzles? Wait, what puzzles? Oh, you mean this ""minigame"" with moving wires that you gonna do like 6 times? Hard to call that even a puzzle cos it gonna take you 30 seconds everytime to solve it.-----------------------------------------There arent't many guns and even those are lacking anything special unlike other Resident Evil games where you could find grenade launchers or laser cannons. We have pistols, magnums, shotguns, smgs, sniping rifles and one shoot use, rocket launcher.There is few weapons per each type but those arent much different from each other, beside number of upgrade slots and very minor stats.Inventory is really dumped down when comparing to Resident Evil 4.You can have only 3 weapons at once and you can change them only at ""weapon box"". There is also very limited max ammo (you can increase it by finding special items), only healing item in whole game are green herbs (max 5 at once), 3 different grenades and no herb mixing. Also 3D map is really, really bad. You dont have full rotation control and it doesn't even tell you precisely your location in the corridor/room. You gonna end up keep looking at it just to make sure you are going in the right direction a lot of times.-----------------------------------------The main feature of this game are two things:>Unique scanning mechanicYou can scan enemies (both dead and alive) to get free herbs or scan environment around you to solve a puzzle (not really a puzzle to be fair) or get free items. Unfortunately its more like a bad distraction from gameplay, slowing it down even more most of time.>Weapon part system. Well this one is a bit more interesting. Almost every gun have more than one weapon upgrade slot, where you can insert different upgrades that you collected around the game (you can do that while using ""weapon box""). You can add and remove them for no cost so its encourage you to try out different things everytime. Upgrades arent really that special tho: most of them are very generic, like increase of clip, increase of damage, burst of more bullets per shot or bigger chance for stunning enemy. Too bad that 25% of the game you can't even use neither of those things.-----------------------------------------Another problem that I have with this game is how slow characters are moving making it really hard to strafe or avoid incoming attacks. Well, probably thats why there is dodge system. I see that many people are complaining about it - that its confusing, hard to use or just unresponsive.Let me tell you ..... thats a lie. The dodge system works very well and its easy to do - just stand still and move forward or do quickturn right before enemy supposed to hit you. Its very easy to use and to abuse, making the game very trivial. Dodge is very generous too - you dont have to even do it with perfect timing and many times you gonna dodge by mistake, cos you just wanted to actually move away and the game registered it as dodge.-----------------------------------------Enemy variety is really small. Lets see: common enemy that can only grab you, same enemy but with claws, same enemy but now he can shoot, suicide bomber, big one with instant kill hit, half-shark thing that hides in the water, typical RE dog, mutated fish, enemy using shield and good, old re-used for the n-th time Hunter (that is hands down, the most annoying enemy in whole game. Why? Cos he spend 90% of time jumping left and right so you can waste even more ammo everytime you try to shoot him. Like really, he sometimes do five jumps in row before you can actually even hit him - and they dont even have that much health, they are just annoying cos of those jumps).Heck, even bosses are weak. One is just upgraded common enemy that you can avoid (you can kill him for extra weapon part - you gonna meet him few times - whole concept of it is very similiar to Nemesis), second is also upgraded common enemy that you just outrun and shoot until it die,third is a generic ""I will charge into wall and you shoot me in my weak spot"" type enemy, fourth is half horde mode, half turret section and fifth is just typical Resident Evil boss (tyrant). I admit, its a cool looking fight that will test your dodge skills but nothing special about it really.-----------------------------------------Beside singleplayer mode there is Raid Mode. Nothing much to say about, its just cut out parts of the single player mode where you can play solo or with your friend. Its actually more fun than singleplayer mode but its not very long.-----------------------------------------Gameplay is really short (it would be even shorter if not all backtracking and cutscenes). The story is really meh with lame plot twist (""ups, this is the wrong ship"") , not even much of whole ""revelations"" going on in it if you ask me. Actually story gives you more plot holes and questions than answers.Its just generic, typical Resident Evil plot where you go to X place, do Y thing, kill Z enemy so I dont understand why Capcom is trying so hard to make it some sort of emotional movie/serial.I finished this game as fast I could, didnt enjoyed very much - especially with how cheap enemy placement is (enemies spawning behind you or behind corner giving them free hits) , terrible gunplay (most weapons, including shotguns, feels very weak, enemies wont get stunned that easy and like srsl - where's fun in using just 3 guns?) and boring in-game fillers. After playing it once, I dont have any reasons to play it again to be fair. I preffer to just replay for 10th time Resident Evil 4 with good, old ""inventory Tetris"" instead.At least I will have more freedom with choice of weapons there (same with upgrades)and the game wont stop me every few minutes to pull a lever and watch unskippable cutscene.I expected something better than Resident ""Less gameplay, more cutscenes and QTE's"" Evil 6.I got even more dull game with less, both enemy and gun varity, and probably the weakest monster design in entire franchise.I recommend it only to hardcore fans that just want more RE and people who love third person shooters. Anyone other - better skip it.			"

												levando em conta o quão ruim os ultimos jogos da serie resident evil foram, é facil de ver pq o revelations é considerado bom... mas veja bem... é bom NIVELANDO POR BAIXO.a divisão em episódios é nojenta, quebra o clima total qdo a coisa começa a ficar legal, e fica fzndo pulos de uma dupla de personagens pra outra, só pra quebrar ainda mais a fluidez. esses episódios são curtos. alguns duram 5 min, outros mais longos duram 20.a parte de exploração e puzzle solving é basica e primaria demais.a jogabilidade com gamepad é ridicula, pq os sticks tem um deadzone absurdo. é impossivel dar tiros precisos - e não tem auto aim. deixei o gamepad de lado e joguei com teclado e mouse. o fov baixo tmb é ♥♥♥♥, pra alterar precisa de um programa externo chamado widescreen fixer.a história... couldn't care less :P uma intriga e conspiração e um virus igual mas diferente do T-Virus e Umbrella Corp... meh... o q leva a outro ponto: os inimigos são bem ridiculos em questão de design. uma tentativa de fugir de zumbis mas q pra mim não colou.jogo mediocre pra qm curte a serie. até o resident evil 5 é melhor, sinceramente :P não recomendo.

												Resident Evil Revelations is another step in the downward trend of the Resident Evil franchise. The fact that the HD version came out after the sixth installment is what makes it seem better than it actually is, because frankly anything is better than Resident Evil 6,The setting is appropriate for a horror game, having been explored previously in the series with Resident Evil Gaiden and Resident Evil Dead Aim. One cannot criticize this story without doing so for the other games in the series because it's just as silly as the previous games, albeit without any of the charming character of Resident Evil 1 or 4 (both directed by Shinji Mikami, coincidentally).It's a shame that they had to complicate such a simple story by going back and forth in time making the player control a variety of characters, most of them unecessary, a consequence of Capcom's decision to incorporate co-op or AI partner all the time. What ends up happening is that you have lots of names, throwaway characters and  a breaking of pace as a result of playing out irrelevant events in the story (playing as Chris in a boat to show him boarding the cruise ship for instance).The gameplay is a step forward from Resident Evil 5, and a more sober affair than the mess that is Resident Evil 6's combat system. You move and shoot/stab and can occasionally stun an enemy to perform a high powered physical attack, which is satisfying. Less so are some of the enemies with instant death kills, which are a little cheap, but it's nothing new for the series. The gameplay does become tiring though, because the enemies are designed as bullet sponges and are very repetitive. That's not to say the zombies in the previous games are not, but they were shorter experiences as well.Thankfully, the quick time events from RE4 and RE5 take a break in the game, being relegated to escaping an enemy's grasp and turning valves.Being originally a 3DS game, some of the geometry and facial expressions do look a bit basic, and some of the textures are not up to PS3/360/PC standards, but it's not a bad looking game, it looks on par with early generation graphics. It's certainly well optimized and runs better than Resident Evil 4 Ultimate, which is mind boggling.The difficulty of the game is balanced, but with some spikes that detract from the TV series approach and pace of it, namely in the boss battles that can be quite infuriating in the first tries. The Infernal difficulty mode is different from RE5's Professional mode but just as silly. Instead of overpowered attackers, the enemies become even bigger bullet sponges, turning the game into a brick wall, though it softens as one progresses and gets better gear. It's  a far cry from the challenging but fair Real Survival Mode of the 2002 remake, it's just pulling the bars to make it as unbalanced as it can be.To add to the longevity is the Raid Mode, which is a worse time waster than Mercenaries because it features levelling and each level takes way longer to complete, and the difficulty ramps up to where you need to grind quite a bit through the ship you're already sick of traversing and the enemies you're already sick of fighting from the campaign.It's a better game than what came after, and does many things better than Resident Evil 5, but it lacks character and importance in the overall series. For a game that's called Revelations, removing it from the story arch does no difference at all and makes it an entry that can fade to obscurity.			"

												I figured I'd give this game a shot because of all the postive reviews and I was in a RE mood since I just bought the remake, which is a classic and one of the best survival/horror games ever made. This game is not at all like that and it literally made me seasick within two hours. I've pretty much avoided RE since Outbreak because of how bad I heard that this series has become and now I've finally been able to experience the pain that everyone has expressed. This isn't a step in the right direction, but rather a step in the mud only to trip and fall face first in cow♥♥♥♥♥♥  If only Capcom spent as much time as they did on t!ts and @ss towards making a decent game, we would be in a much different situation. These panty sniffers should just stick to hentai because they're clearly not meant to be in the gaming industry. They've destroyed DMC, RE, Street Fighter, Dead Rising and anyone's pocket book that still supports them. Hopefully, these d-bags will put what money we've given them towards HD remakes of the old games instead of wasting time on creating more junk. -Boring-Repetitive-Ugly-Waste of time and money			"

												They took all the good stuff out that was in the earlier games, like jump scares and etc. The zombies are just annoying snstead of real zombies, they are like super mutants. Clunky gunplay and stupid controls combine to make a real stinker. It seems like it's only made to make you buy DLC.			"

												so i got this game on sales .. the gameplay is not that good, but acceptable, the evade system is horrible .. the way how story goes is meh, some doors won't open until you reach the objective for them in campaign, they just make you go back and forth back and forth until you just want to frag yourself to death .. multiplayer is raid mode and not included in campaign as your partner like the RE6 .. your partner in campaign is just useless, he shoots all the time but he doesn't kill or do any damage (maybe he's there so you don't feel alone and get scared hmm) ... don't get this game unless you are a hardcore RE fan and you just wanna play them all no matter how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they are .. just for the love of god bring back the RE with Zombies and puzzles and quit making crappy BOW creatures cause they suuuuckkkk			"

												This game is so so horrible, the only way i see this being a good game is by seeing it as the wii game that it is, it must of been amazing on that system, the same way deus ex the fall wouldve been good on the iphone and probably no where else. This game is really really bad, the grammar is laughable, which is made worse by the idioticly annoying charecters and the graphics which look like complete ''excrement''. The missions are boring and the game is not scary at all. This is the worst game ive played in a long long time and you should only get it for someone you hate or want to torture. (Steam didnt register the 4 or 5 hours i had playing with this game while on offline mode, at least i wont have it on my profile thankfully)			"

												Really this game is a mess, its fine for the beginning but then it pulls alot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Your ""partner"" doesnt do anything and just pretends to shoot at the enemies when they dont actully do anything to them. Some enemies have a stupid amount of health and you are forced to use the scanner thingy to find ammo/herb (there is only one herb type) because if you dont then you get to a ponit where the game forces you to use melee and melee suck big-time because it does nothing except get you hit. The story is full of holes too and I think I read better stories off public toilet walls that make more sense than this. I had to go into game files to get the game to start up first time because it started up in the incorrect format for me and left me with a blank screen. Also the last boss is just the stupidest thing ever, I wont mention any spoilers but You enter a room, thsi guy who thinks you are the enemy starts mumbling abotu how he hates his enemy(who he thinks you work for) and gives you what you want...by accident? Then you walk off with the item and he tells you to wait so naturally you watch him mutate himself (even though he already did it before but whatever because ♥♥♥♥ logic) Then insted of just walking away, The charcters then decide to explain they are not the enemies even though the guy has already mutated himself.  Jill's quote"" Its useless, hes gone mad"" No♥♥♥♥♥♥sherlock, maybe you should of told him before he injected himself with aids virus. So then you wait for the boss to teleport to you so you can wait then shoot its heart with only a 0.5 second reaction time to look around, aim and shoot enough bullets. Dont bother trying to dodge it, dodging in this game is dumb and the game thinks you are trying to do a 180 turn most of the time. But nayway you cant dodge it and it doesnt matter if you are anywhere near him because its scripted that you get hurt.....yeah thats also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Oh yeah, then it get to the ponit where you have to look at 2 of them and decide which one is the real one but even then you have to wit until jsut before his swing hits the ground because only then it shows who to shoot.....trust me its a massive facepalm of a game at this point. YOu jsut keep shooting at him for hours. The door isnt even locked but you cant get out just because this guy told you to ""wait"" so naturally you have to wait and get stab to dead by him while Chris stands in the corner of the room shooting him with a Nerf gun like he always does (he doesnt do anything and has no purpose, just like all the co-op AI in this game). But like I said, some parts of this game are fun but when you run into the many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments then you get a really bad taste in your mouth because of this game.			"

												I went through the trouble of trying everything this game had to offer: The BAD- Story mode is relatively short.- Story mode has some of the most obnoxious characters I've seen in a video game.- Story mode never went down the whole 'survival horror' route, which I was really hoping for.- Honestly - it's quite boring and not worth playing through.- 'Infernal' difficutly (hardest mode) is a joke. Expect bullet spongey enemies and not much else.The GOOD- The 'raid' mode is somewhat fun. Looks like they put some thought into it to offset the short storyline.- The setting is very cool. Which makes me sad that it wasn't done better.In summary:I know the game was a port from DS, but that doesn't excuse it for being a poorly made game. The potential was here to be a great survival horror, trapped alone on a ship full of new mutations. You get hints at how good it could have been throughout the story, but nothing lasts...  "

												I already finished the whole game but not on Steam. I got it on humble bundle, otherwise I would never bough it.What can I say about this game?Poor graphics, poor game design, uninteresting story, enemy AI is so borring, all weapons feel the same and doesnt matter where you shoot enemies. Its some kind of mixure of old school resident evil like remakes and new more action paced but this game fails at booth trying to be survival horror or action game.  Revelations 2 is not great but still much better game then this one if you are interested in revelations series. They are not that much connected so you can easily skip this one.			"

												Seriously, this is got to be the cheapest game i've ever played in my entire life. Nothing, literally nothing in this game stands out as redeemable as a video game.This game tries so hard to grind gamplay hour out of so little content it is absolutely ridiculous:1. Very little savepoints. I'm fine with not having manual savepoints, but autosave every other half an hour in the story, really?2. Instant kill boss fights, and even that, each death sends you another half an hour back BEFORE the boss fight, which is completely unnecessary3. Instant kill grunts. Yep, even some grunts can instant kill you, and guess what, back another half an hour you go.4. Absolutely no indication of sequence of events. Some random guy handing me a key is a perfect indication of the pool finished draining, Really? Are the developers even trying at this point?5. Backtracking. For the little amount of content it has, it makes you backtrack the same area, FIVE TIMES. Each time you get a new key, you go back to the same area to unlock new doors, so you can get more keys to come back to the same area to unlock even more doors, absolutely ridiculously lazy.For a game released in 2013, this game has absolutely nothing to offer that stands out from the rest, I can name tons of survival horror games that beats this crap out of the water (BioShock, Dead Space, etc) in terms of gameplay, story telling and graphics. Words cannot express how much I despise this game, for the cheap lazy piece of crap it is.  "

												I cannot hate against this game enough. While Revelations 2 was pretty kick♥♥♥♥♥ this game is hours and hours of abuse on the player. It's the first horror game I've played where YOU CAN'T RUN. The dodging sucks dog butt too. You move so f-ing slow in this game while everything against you is super charged. Half the time you can't even get a quarter of a rotation before the thing you were turning to shoot at is on you and killing you. You're set up to fail in this game and have to fight programmers, not monsters, to beat it. And just to make it even more fun, while you sometimes have an ally to fight, not only doesn't the AI recognise them in the slightest, they don't help you in battle. They shoot, but it doesn't damage them. So you have NO advantage, while everything else has cheat codes against you. So to speak.After 12 grueling chapters of the same scenery, sloppy, chopped up storyline that's almost impossible to follow and the promise of the end of the game given and taken away so much you wish it were on a CD so you could yank it out and break it, they give you the final boss...The final boss is 100% invulnerable until he disappears and reappears next to you and just off to the side of you. remember what I said about extremely slow movement of the character? You have to move QUICKLY to hit the heart that suddenly opens after he reappears and attacks you. If you are 100% perfect, it doesn't hurt him in the slightest. If you do, he doesn't strike you and staggers back a bit, but good luck at being able to do that more than a handful of times before the change happens. With the change, not only does the boss disappear and then reappear where you are almost guarenteed not to be able to shoot him, but he can now suddenly clone himself. You have a split second to choose which one is going to open up their vulnerable spot, which is only open for a second or two tops, before they strike you with hits that, even on the easiest more, wipe out most of your health in just one attack. Did I mention you are limited to a very small number of healing items?Also, don't tryin putting distance between yourself and the Dynamic Twins of Extreme OP. They don't even need to touch you to kill you. you can be on the other side of the room and they just need to slap one of their baseball mit looking hands into the ground and you drop, take a good chunk of damage and have to mash A, (if on a controller) for about 20 seconds before they will let you stand. Which gives the split body super-boss plenty of time to come over and beat you to death. I don't mind games that offer challenges. I actually like games that offer challenges. But when I need a freaking PhD in game mechanics just to get past a boss, I have to say F*** this game.They made this game to punish the players, and made them go through 12 boring, unchanging chapters of frustration before the biggest turd was dropped.

												I usually don't write anti-recommendations but in case of this game I felt compelled. I've played and loved many Resident Evil games since the original release and my favourites are Code Veronica, Resident Evil HD remake, Resident Evil 4 (with Wii controls) and Resident Evil 5 when played as co-op. While I used to enjoy Resident Evil games I am afraid their design has become archaid and stale. Game is neither survival horror nor action game, but tries to incorporate horror elements into action by having a horrible control scheme. Most of the game play consists of wandering same stale environments looking for a lever or key while getting streams of same type of monsters thrown at you to try and take a shot at them while game's control scheme does everything in it's power to make second to second game play frustrating. You do manage to kill off the beasts time after time, but it's not fun and hardly feels like an achievement. But worse than the combat is game's lack of focus and uninspired story telling. First of all pacing is off the wall, there's a flash back after a flash back that leads to constant change of scenery and chararacters, you don't get hooked by the story and just when you have forgotten what were you doing, you'll get pulled back to the original scenery where you started at. Then the ""episode"" ends and there's a video explaining what happened last time in Resident Evil Revelations. Okay uh, I guess this game was originally released in episodic form or something? Still it feels weird to watch a video about what happened when it literally just happened 3 seconds ago. Characters aren't interesting, especially female characters are just for showing skin,  environments are boring mazes full of key & lever hunting. There's a lot of time sink type of content, I suspect they got away with it due (assumed) episodic structure? Game builds no kind of tension with it's ""horror parts"". Game's full of Hollywood-envy, it wants to be a movie an action game and horror product. Unfortunately it just feels unfocused and repeating.			"

												Definitely scariest game I've ever played. It crashes every few minutes, sometimes fail to completely open at all. 10/10 spooky haunted computerJokes aside though, once you actually get the game to start, it's pretty amazing. Sure, controls feel incredibly clunky at the start, and it almost feels like you're navigating a tank. But I suppose that 3rd person degree inflexiblity retains some hint of its origins as an arcade game. After getting adjusted to the controls and the mechanics, the game actually becomes enjoyable, and forces one to manage resources efficiently. It is definitely a survival horror. Beyond the story mode, raid mdoe offers a whole new dynamic to the game. Instead of struggling to scrape together bits of metal for a bullet, one can purchase equipment at the ingame shop using BP earned from story mode missions and raid mode. Raid missions offer a more intense, ""arcade"" style of a zombie shooter - players rush to complete the map in shortest times possible and without taking damage for achievements, etc, and a whole host of characters are available to choose from, with each character boasting their individual skills to augment your zombie slaying abilities. Pretty good, but not a recommended purchase at all unless during a sale, and definitely do not recommend any add-ons at all. They are all available throughout the game, and the ones you buy are going to be weaker than the ones you can obtain in game by degrees. It falls short in areas of player control, and since that is going to pretty much be a persistent issue throughout the game, it is not entirely recommended. It is, however, much better than the non RE Rev games. So comparatively would choose Rev over the non Rev ones if you're going to buy a RE game anyway			"

												I'm a big fan of horror in games. I loved Resident Evil 4, even though it shed its horror mid way in, and I tolerated Resident Evil 5 because the coop gameplay was fun. Revelations, unfortunately, is not the return to horror it's been marketed as. Instead, this game feels incredibly like an android/iOS game. There is very little complexity; no inventory, no management of herbs or ammo. Environments are restricted making it feel more like a rail shooter than anything else where your only choice is forward or back (akin to Killer7, a much better game). Characters and plot are boring. Skip this one.			"

												I played this game all the way through a few weeks after beating Resident Evil 4 for the first time.Pros:- scarce ammo and limited weapons added to the horror atmosphere- genuinely scary at times- challenging!Cons:- scanning mechanic is just god awful in my opinion- weapon upgrade system blows... HARD- confusing map system- most of the game is backtracking through places you've already been- some portions of the game drag onIf you're looking for a game that fills the void in your heart that Resident Evil 4 left, don't bother with this game.  Honestly, I would rather replay Resident Evil 4 than play this again.  I would also recommend playing through the Dead Space series for the horror elements you crave with much better game design than this.			"

												This Resident Evil is the simpliest amongst all I've played. It's as if developers were in a hurry making it: one physical attack for each character which can be charged, only one healing item - green herb which restores 100% hp. I also disliked new terrible appearance of Jill and Chris. I still recommend it because of the good story, and Raid Mode which brings many hours of gameplay, but even there you get crappy netcode+ dead online where people play only GS.			"

												Campaign mode:Plot's overly convoluted. Gameplay is awkward, but still fun. Episodic nature and multiple perspectives make the narrative less cohesive*.*every RE game has multiple perspectives, but they're less intrusive and usually much shorter.Raid mode:Waaay too long. It is both everything I wanted in the game and the worst part of it. Lots of RNG in the loot and the loot most useful for beating the bonus level only drops at the end of the bonus level. I played most of it solo, so maybe more social people would have a better experience with it.			"

												God was this awful.I mean, i LOVE Resident Evil. I played only 5 games from the series and the most were disappointing. But i do love Resident Evil 4. Revelations is supposed to be ""back to the roots"". Its not. When you mean by roots, the original 3, no its not. If back to the roots mean Resident Evil 4 as root, no it's not. It is a mix of Resi 5 and 6, with less good graphics (Yup, because of 3DS Port, and for that it looks impressive, but the point is a point). And a lame♥♥♥♥♥story, some bad characters and bad jokes and self-referencing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It is not good if you use bad level design and let the characters ♥♥♥♥♥ about it. Srsly.The game starts quite good. A little bit spooky, some lame jumpscares but also kind of nice. You have constantly Jills beautiful backside in view. I am not complaining ;) But then it starts to annoy. A bossfight early on which consumes all your ammo even WITH flammables everywhere. Annoying backtracking starts to come in. But the game still is a little fun. But then the other characters come in. First you play as parker, in a boring level, nothing to do, a ♥♥♥♥ing BOX is blocking your way, a BOX another character steps over it without problem! The next characters are introduced, a nerd and a whatever guy, talking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and very bad jokes -.- Lame and boring sections and so on. Then you have Boss battles. Annoying Boss battles. Especially the last one. Oh and dont remind me of the awful swimming sections!I played the game with growing agony and anger. I nearly dropped it at least 2 times. The last custscenes i only skipped because it got more ridiculous every time. Then I defeated the Ultimate Boss somehow and was glad that this♥♥♥♥♥♥was over. I can not and i won't recommend that game. Ever.			"

												I'm sorry, but this Resident Evil doesn't feels like Resident Evil. 1) Bad controlI mean, come on, aimming something has some problem, can't move it around, can't aim for headshot easily? Game engine fault? Maybe, I'm not sure since this game came out long few years back.2) Bad storylineReally? If they really wanna corrupt the sea, why not just do it and stop yelling like you need to let the world know your evil plan before doing it. A small dose of it could have infected most creatures.3) Doesn't really matchup with RE storylineI like the idea of the new T-virus, but the virus now is like inactive? Not this game fault for it but, if they didn't intend to really put it in the future storyline, why bother making it?4) Gun sound is really..This is the one that I literally got nothing to comment about. I mean, why does the all the gunfire sound just sound so like SMALL AND EFFORTLESS?? I JUST DON'T GET IT. Capcom could have at least put it normal gun fire sound, instead of making it sound like you're using a cardboard to make a sound. Come on Capcom, get the budget and make a decent game. Overall, it's quite boring to be honest. I thought it would be more of like Rev2 but sadly, it's not. It's the worst RE game i have ever play. But hope this is a lesson to Capcom, please, plan some budget to make a decent RE game. Rev2 was good, but also, the sound isn't that good. If you like slow storytelling, action RE game, this is for you. Otherwise, I would not recommend it.			"

												Do you like busy work? How about cumbersome controls? Wait, you enjoy games that require you to revisit the same places over and over and over and over? Then this crap game might be for you.I've only spent 13 hours on this crap game, and about half of that was on this stupid final boss. The other half was spent going back to rooms I'd already been through. So I'm unistalling it. Ugh I wanted to like it, too. But the combination of: unecessary actions (it's one of those games where you have to ""press f"" to go down an effing ledge instead of the character just automatically going down, i.e.), unfathomable gameplay glitches (if the boss got close to me my gun would vanish so he couldn't be shot), pathetic map systems (they want to seem high-tech by being moveable, but you can't turn the ship (i.e.) all the way around to plan a route, so you're left guessing how to get certain places), and laughably trite storyline/dialogue (a SyFy channel movie would look Oscar-Worthy compared to this garbage), makes it maddening.I should say that this is my first experience with Resident Evil franchise, so I realize I'm complaining about characteristics of all the REs. most likely, but this is just unplayable. Not enjoyable. Waste of time. Boo.			"

												A 7h long (max) and cheap game that can only be worthy on sales. 6.0/10Pros:It's kind of entertaining to explore it for the first time, but do not last longDecent Story, but undeveloped. New characters are interesting, but ruinedI love the idea of exploring a giant ghostly ship, pity it wasn't inmersed in an ocean (only darkness). Even in outdoor areas you feel trapped in a box.It led to creating RER2, which is a more satisfactory experienceCons:Poor Graphics (lazy devs did not bother much with anything other than dirty ship rooms). Claustrophobic does not mean Chapters are riddiculously short (5 minutes wandering plus cutscenes wtf??)Revelations 2 is better in every aspect of the gameAfter credits scenes leave you with the feeling that the story is unfinished, but actually there is no follow upVeredict: this game with 4 more Chapters (13-16) and some more work on the scenography,  characters and epilogue would have been fine, but it falls short			"

												My review of Revelations 2 can be seen here.http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/287290(YES Revelations is still active online for those only getting this for Raid mode)Back on the 3DS I came for the graphics and stayed for the gameplay. I was surprised to find that while Revelations was a handheld title it the best Resident Evil game of 2013 which saw the release of the terrible Operation Racoon City and the linear QTE riddled mess that was Resident Evil 6. Having beaten the 3DS game 100% I couldn't wait to be able to play it on my PC with more content, some slightly nicer visuals, a higher framerate and of course mouse aim. It delivered on everything I expected and a little more. First off, Revelations is insanley well optimized although considering it was first made for and released on the 3DS first it damn well should be. While my current PC was no slouch when I first picked this up (These are my current specs: A GTX 980 SC ACX 2.0, an i7 4790k Devils Canyon and 16 Gigs of RAM.) I've seen it perform very smoothly on a laptop with an AMD A4-5000 1.5ghz, ATI RADEON 8330m 512MB VRAM﻿ and 8GB DDR3-RAM with High textures and everything else on low. While the absence of the laser and third and firstperson aiming that was present in the 3DS release is a bummer the PC version still trumps it in every other aspect: The characters mouths now move ingame, the common ooze are now more varied in appearence sometimes having malformed arms, an extra enemy has been added, you can pick, choose and swap between different costumes for the main characters the story mode, the Ghost Ship stages in raid mode has been slightly overhauled with more enemies and different enemy placements, there are more characters and costumes for the said characters in raid mode, more variation in the stats for characters and their costumes and more weapon attachments. The game caps at 120 fps when you choose Variable and rarely if ever dips unless you are in an elevator (Which it disguises as the elevator rumbling) or a water lock, but in the context that this happens it's completley understandable seeing as you are still free to move around while it's happening and it's more of a loading issue than a general performance problem as the frame counter remains the same. One thing that I don't understand and that isn't really excusable is why the game doesn't allow 4k or provide non FXAA related anti aliasing.The audio quality and sound design in Revelations were already superb but what few sounds were compressed are now crystal clear. It's not quite on par with RE5 but asthetically Revelations it trumps it. It does noticeably increase the texture,shader and polygon count though in addition to removing a really ugly bit of water that could be seen out of a window in the 3DS version. It makes it look like what you think it looked like on the 3DS unless you really really squinted. It's also one of the few games where it feels rewarding to get aheivements as you are rewarded with awesome ingame unlockables like an infinite RPG for clearing the hardest mode without being hit. Give it a shot this game is great! I really didn't expect greatness when I first picked this up so that was a REVELATION in its own right, I can't say it's the best Resident Evil game without being super biased but I can say it's a great game in it's own right and one of the better recent entries.Oh yeah and then there's Raid mode which is basically it's very own games bundled in this one but there's too much in Raid mode for me to cover.My review of Resident Evil 5 (The product as a whole) can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/21690Here's my review of Resident Evil 4.http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/21690My review for Resident Evil 6 can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/221040 "

												After investing in completing all achievements for the Resident Evil Remake HD, Resident Evil Zero HD, and Resident Evil 4 HD..I figured not much would phase me. Resident Evil Revelations is too clunky. I'm just not into the engine, the controls, and the endless hordes. I'm bored, and when you invest 3 hours only to unlock 3 of 50 achievements..it seems silly. Disappointing purchase, sadly. Up until the boss fight in the Promenade area, at least the survival horror element was salvagable..but then comes the infinite enemy spawn. So disappointed, as someone who has been invested in this series since 1996.			"

Разработчикам удалось превратить шедевр в котором были загадки, мистика, и атмосфера ужастика в полное ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥о... Капкому советую уволить всех своих сотрудников, они никчёмны.

												Bought 2 copies on humblebundle to play with a friend after seeing it has co-op. Found out co-op was just some side thing that you have to do the solo main story to unlock chapters of. Figured maybe it'll be fun so we just decided to play at the same time anyway so we could talk about it while we play. I was okay we played together had some laughs while he laughed at my constant little screams cause I'm a scaredy cat. I had fun for a while though still♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that says co-op but has no main story co-op even though you always have an ai partner with you (unless you split up scooby style on a boat of monsters that are trying to kill you cause that is smart) that is an idiot, such as me getting grabbed and Chris deciding to shoot it once every few seconds with a pistol while it had me pinned to the ground before breaking me in half. I liked Rachel even though she only showed up for like a second but I felt genuinely sorry she got dragged into this cause hearing her voice in the co-op she seemed like such a happy person and in the journal she didn't want to be there and she knew her chances of surviving were slim. Hated Jessica from the second she showed up with her impractical clothing choices like  her shorts and purple legging things in the middle of investigating on a snowy mountain and a wet suit missing a leg like wtf is that. Chris is Chris and Jill is Jill. Other characters I couldn't care less about but the pair of science guys were kind of funny to listen to. Gave up on the last chapter when we would shoot the boss and he wouldn't stop his move or get stunned, after trying the fight like 5 times we gave up cause by that point we were over it and getting more bored by the second and didn't want it to ruin our day.

												I'm going to give this game a pre-finish review...  I will add and change it later as needed.So... I'm just going to come out and say it...  This game SUCKS.  That's the short answer.  To be fair, I knew it was going to suck from the demo I played before it came out but that's besides the point.The long version.Cons:Scanning for items.  What.  The.  Hell!   What kind of lame BS mechanic is that!  These supposed people who have dealt with all manner of monsters ranging from rabid acid spitting spiders all the way up to Nemesis and more suddenly cant see the herb that's nestled between a storage rack and sink?  I call BS!Episodic. This.  On its own is a horrible idea for a Resident Evil game.  It kills the immersion in the story at every story and episode break.  I do not even mind the character swapping to see different sides of the story as much when compared to this flaw!Jessica.  I would be making blond jokes for DAYS if in-fact she was blond.  The sad part is, shes not.  How she managed to get into the same category as Chris and Jill is beyond me!  WHO THE HELL WEARS HIGH HEELS TO A BLOODY FROZEN MOUNTION!!!  And then whines when her feet hurt!  She acts like the standard clingy girlfriend who wants to know everything about you and your past when there is no reason to be asking about it!  Honestly, Id have fed her to the zombies the first chance i got >.>The story.  So far the story is...kinda Blah.  Its not the worst I have seen. ((Cough cough RE5 and 6 Cough Cough)) but its still up there.The inventory.  Where the hell did it go?  Whats with the F buttons half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥inventory???  Give us back what we had in RE4 or before cause this sucks.  I'm ignoring the whole “Presss TAB to insta heal” thing.The map.  Why is there a mini map?Netural: (This is here because its both good and bad... take it as you will)Jill.  More to the point, her outfit.  Sexy...but no!  Just no!  Skin tight leathers(I think)?  Why would you do that?  It was not necessary...   BUT....  Appreciated none the less.Mouse movement.  Its ok, not great though.  It has a slight tendency to jump around or the sensitivity alters randomly.  Still playable however.Good:Movement.  The game plays smooth for movement.Graphics. Also OK.  The models are decent, the areas are good and detailed.  Some weird effects with water and goo but that is OKSub-weapon use.  Able to just press G to chuck grenades while aiming?  Yes please.  One of those things that you just do not thing about until its given to you.Its kinda hard to find anything good about this game currently to be honest...I will add more as needed.EDIT:I dont know how, but this game got worse...  Now, we have Jill, Chris, The chick from Legaly Blond, 2 of the 3 stooges(Slapstick and all), the emo redhead guy and that other guy whos name escapes me...  This is some horable writing coupled with terrable acting.  Also...Who the hell flys to a ship on a chopper and doesnt check the name on the boat before landing!!!  Its right there!  You have the technology!  Im done with this game.  I cant bring myself to finish it just because of the afore mentioned.  To say nothing about the god aweful story.  The best this game deserves is 4/10, thats it.			"

												If you enjoy walking slow and looking through a green filter scanning things then this is the scanning simulation you would want. You can literally scan the entire game. I would of thought this was Scanning♥♥♥♥♥♥simulator 2014 if Resident Evil wasn't slapped on. I heard it was like the original Resident Evil's like 1 and 2 but even they don't have green filter scanning. I recommend shooting yourself in the head after you scan it in a mirror.

												This game is absolutely disgusting, there is nothing to do, nothing happens, it's boring, it's an interactive story.No horror, only bad drama. Everything is a repetitive maze with no content.If this game was a child, it should have been aborted.			"

												This has to be the second worst Resident Evil game I've ever played. Out of the new set, you have 4, 5, 6, Raccoon City, then this. This only succeeds at being better than Raccoon City, but that's up for debate since that title wasn't actually made by Capcom. It was a game made by someone else, being skinned to look like a Resident Evil game to sell it. It's definitely the worst, no question, but if you ignore it and only count official Capcom made titles, then this is actually the bottom of the barrel. And that's still quite an accomplishment because RE 6 is just terrible. This game can't even rise to the low bar that RE 6 set. It's sad to see a series get worse with each title rather than better. But let's not get off topic, this is a review for Revelations, specifically, the PC port. I don't own a DS. I own PC, this on PC, and am reviewing this version of it only.So what do we got? What we got here is basically a cheap port from the DS. Despite touting how improved the graphics are for PC, it is not up to par with the other titles. There's still tons of low res textures everywhere in the game that they couldn't bother to update. One positive note is that there aren't many cutscenes. RE 6 was infested with more of them than zombies. But the graphics aren't really what kills this game for me... it's the cockteasing. They tease us with a ship that's suppose to have open exploration, much like the older games. A lot of its interior is actually modelled to feel similar to the classic mansion. A haunted/infested cruise ship is the perfect setting for a Resident Evil game, and offers a lot of possible stages. Sounds great, right? Well, it has some of your open exploration... then the other 90% of the game is a linear corridor shooter like the other games. You're also teased with Jill making a return, but again, barely get much time to actually play her. Too much of the game(hint: any is too much) is spent being forced to play these other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you'll only inevitably hate as much as possible and never want to actually play. You're forced to play them, entirely against your will, and will rush their sections as fast as you can because you just want to get back to Jill. They're literally wasting your time. My point is that Capcom found a great potential to make another game, then proceeds to waste that potential, pouring it all right down the tube, in every possible way they can. This is another ""shoulda woulda coulda"" title, and everything good about the game just makes you wish it was in a better game rather than being wasted in this one.Speaking of the characters, they manage to be more annoying and stupid than the ones from RE 6. That says a lot. You are also forced to switch between them constantly whether you like it or not. In RE 6, you were at least able to PICK the one you wanted to play, start to finish. Here they are like ""no no no, now you're going to get jerked around every 10 minutes between them all. Have fun fanboy."" For example, in RE 6, you could PICK Leon, start to finish, and NOT have to play Chris' Gears of War ripoff at all. Here, no such luck. RE 6 was a disaster partly thanks to having a bunch of differing campaigns that are all junk instead of just having 1 good one(RE 5). Imagine that, but now switching between all of them with no say as to when or which one you play at any given time. Sound fun? IT'S NOT. You'll run down a hallway or open a door then suddenly find yourself dropped into a diferent time and place, and character, for the next 20 minutes, then be dropped back. It doesn't even really add anything to the story and could have just been in an exposition. It just wastes your time with annoying characters you don't want anything to do with, and you're forced to suffer through it until the game ""decides"" you can go back to where you were on the character you came for and actually wanted to play(Jill). One big bait and switch, this game was.The story as a whole does manage to be a lot less ret@rded than RE 6, but it is a spin off story you don't really need to know. It has no real connection to any other game and I doubt any game from now on is going to reference this or the characters here. The story is a convoluted mess, but RE games were never known for stories that made coherent sense. It's not a good story, but it's a servicable story that could have been acceptable in a better game. But that's not what we got, so it's basically all for naught. At this point I wish they'd give us 1 decent game instead of a bunch of crap ones. I'd happily sacrifice 6, Raccoon City, and Revelations, all for ""1"" decent RE game. CoD fans will hate me for saying this, but quantity is simply not a replacement for quality.Another big death nail for this game is the lack of Co Op. Once again we're forced to buddy up through an entire game that should be a solo survival/horror experience, but where as before you could Co Op it, now you can't. Yes, they did the stupidest thing they could with Resident Evil. It finally happened. No, it wasn't adding in Co Op. It was adding in Co Op that you can't Co Op. You're stuck with the stupid A.I. partner, start to finish, and cannot possibly Co Op it. Why is it even there then? Is the partner at least done right, like in RE 5? Hell no. It's RE 6 again, the one that borked it. They copied the one that ruined it instead of the one that was good. To clarify, the partner is invulnerable, has infinite ammo, and shoots water pellets. This is unlike RE 5 where the partner actually felt like a person you had to care about. Sheva needed bullets, she could get hurt, she could die, thus you really felt important to each other to survive. It was the proper way to do a partner, even as A.I. Here however they copied the RE 6 partner system, which was sh!t. They're a complete waste of space. They can't die, and won't kill anything. And since you can't Co Op them, why are they even there?! They ported this to PC, and couldn't be bothered to give us Co Op for the partner, when others on PC and Steam have that Co Op. Talk about not giving a sh!t about their franchise anymore. The partner does nothing but tag along, get in the way of bullets or pathing in the tight hallways, and make stupid remarks that'll make anyone over the age maturity of 13 cringe. They're just wasted space and you'll keep wishing you were alone, in peace and quiet, without them tagging along like an unwanted parasite leeching on your campaign. It's like having an annoying brat watch you play but you can't tell them to go away because you're supposed to be babysitting. Ashley from RE 4 wasn't this worthless or annoying. Not even close. At least she could get hurt, and die.In summary, this game is a plate of @ss. I played it start to finish, and I hated almost all of it. I tried to squeeze any bit of value I could out of this to justify my purchase and it just wasn't there. It's a sad pathetic corpse of what used to be a decent franchise, even up to 2009 with RE 5, a game I loved. I leave with nothing but regret, and am saddened that Capcom couldn't care less about what they've done to this franchise since then. It's an abysmal singleplayer experience with no ability to Co Op except for this totally pointless endless repetitive ""Raid Mode"". If you want a better singleplayer game, it won't be hard to find. If you want a better multiplayer one, it'll be VERY easy to find(Borderlands?). This game is a port that never should have been made, but Capcom knows when they can make an easy buck, and did exactly that. For long time fans like myself, this is probably the last straw. I seriously doubt I'll even consider paying money for a Resident Evil 7, or whatever PoS title leeches off this franchise's hollowed out corpse next.			"

												Its not coop. This game is presented and upon first looks seems like RE5, full coop from the start, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t single player tutorial your forced to play first. This game has a raid feature that lets you coop sortof the first four levels, then you must play single player campaign to unlock more levels of the raid system. The raid system seems to have a different story (if any) and the zombies have different spawns. It feels like a skirmish mode type thing.Single player is set up much the same as RE5 with an ai following you and being annoying, BUT! you cannot make that ai a human player. Its crazy.If you have no friends and are a die hard RE fan, just buy re1 remake or any others. leave this game alone its a sad attempt at RE and it just makes me a sad panda. :(If you have friends... a friend, just one. then get RE5, its a blast to coop through.

												Resident Evil® Revelations returns redefined for PC complete with high quality HD visuals, enhanced lighting effects and an immersive sound experience. This latest version of Resident Evil Revelations will also deliver additional content including a terrifying new enemy, extra difficulty mode, integration with ResidentEvil.net and improvements to Raid Mode. Raid Mode, which was first introduced to the series in the original version of Resident Evil Revelations, sees gamers play online in co-op mode or alone in single player taking on the hordes of enemies across a variety of missions whilst leveling up characters and earning weapon upgrades. New weapons, skill sets, and playable characters including Hunk, take the Raid Mode experience to new depths. The critically acclaimed survival horror title takes players back to the events that took place between Resident Evil® 4 and Resident Evil® 5, revealing the truth about the T-Abyss virus. Resident Evil Revelations features series favorites Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, plus their respective BSAA partners - Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat. The action begins on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship, the ‘Queen Zenobia’, where horrors lurk around every corner, before players head for the mainland and the devastated city of Terragrigia. With limited ammo and weapons available, the race is on to survive the horror of Resident Evil Revelations.			"

												At it's core, Revelations is basically an experiment for Capcom. They tried to do something different than what they've been doing since RE4, and it paid off. While there may not be zombies or traditional B.O.W.s in this game (other than so many dozens of hunters) it is the closest thing to a classic Resident Evil title in years.Revelations covers the initial days of the BSAA and shows some of the events preceding Resident Evil 5. Evidently the world is in a state where they can build solar powered cities that float on the sea, but not stop making bioweapons. The story revolves around solving the mystery of how BOWs keep showing up in the area with ties to the terrorist organization that got the city destroyed. Obviously, this leads in classic RE fashion to an overly complicated environment - a cruise ship which frankly looks too Spencerian and not remotely like a vacation cruise ship - that, of course, houses a secret bio-weapons research lab. In addition to the lab, almost all of the new ancillary characters are revealed to be double agents or traitors, continuing with the trends of RE, and are working for a mysterious organization or for themselves. Thematically, Revelations really is about as close as possible to the older games. It also has plenty of horrible characters and character dialog - between Jessica's forced attempts at appearing sexy to players, Quint and Keiths ridiculous ""Internet nerd/black guy with a life"" cliches, and Raymond and Rachels haircuts - What the actual f? - the cheese level is easily higher than RE1.There is no co op in this game's campaign, either. You are on your own. Rarely ever will your AI teammate be anywhere near you and when they are they truly will not be helpful. As for environment, Capcom did a pretty decent job. Again the cruise ship looks nothing like a cruise ship and it's ridiculous, but what it does is emulate the claustrophobia and grandeur of the Spencer Mansion. In addition to the only true Resident Evil plot in years, Revelations also of course contains raid mode.  Essentially, raid mode is Diablo 3 with guns and third person camera. You just play through the campaign levels on varying difficulties, and kill enemies to get new gear and points, but its still quite fun. Although stunted by having been originally developed for 3DS, Revelations is the closest thing to a Resident Evil game since Code Veronica, and does an admirable job of blending both the new and old styles of gameplay.

												Alright where to begin with this mess. It's a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor port of the 3DS version of the game (which is even worse than this, so thank Capcom for porting it... I guess?). There's higher resolutions and gameplay changes to Raid Mode so players can't expoit the lewt drop system... but it doesn't stop save editors and trainers... so the point of that was? What exactly? Waste time? Yeah... sounds like it.The plot is contrived and stupid... the twists to the plot were obvious so there's really no *gasp, SURPRISE!* moments. If you've been following Resident Evil up until now then you'll be pleasently surprised that you and non-fans are on the same page... I dunno where all these extra characters came from but they suck balls and lack personality. I was lost right from the get go and I'm a huge RE fan... back when RE was RE any way... like the first 4 games.There's just too many new faces in this game and it makes me feel like I missed some game that was unreleased. (which I didn't because there is no such thing) These events are supposed to take place between Resident Evil 4 and 5 but they don't do a very good job of explaining how Jill and Chris wound up knowing these new characters or how they got in to the situation they're in... they kind of just banter back and forth between all the bullet spraying about a time they took a trip in Aspin together... or some trivial♥♥♥♥♥♥like that.It's a bit confusing and made me feel detached from the plot. I figured this game was going to stick closer to the roots of Resident Evil but it's just as bad as Resident Evil 4 for missing the point entirely. Instead of fighting Spanards or African's you fight Crab People and other mutated sea dwelling crustations... oh yeah, and wolves... because you know, they have to have some kind of canine enemy in the game to trick people in to thinking they're playing a Resident Evil game. Still hanging on to the original dog jump scare from  RE1, I see, Capcom?The game is stale and drab the entire way through, enemies are more annoying than ever to kill and require you to learn the dodge system or get locked in to a one hit kill death... pretty obnoxious. Also I've never seen more annoying enemies that have weak spots on their back side and require you to learn a ridiculously long move set in order to get a 3 second opening.Hunters are back... yay? Not nearly as intimidating as before... in RE1 a single hunter meant about a 70% chance of death if you didn't have a magnum handy... In this game you fight groups of 3 or 4, no issues... it's the action portion of these newer RE's that make my♥♥♥♥♥♥soft. If I wanted to play Gears of War, I would do so.Alright on to the multiplayer, it's non-existant for the campaign (I guess that's what Capcom meant by going back to the ""roots""... because I see no other resemblance to previous RE games) so grab a friend and head in to ""Raid Mode""... A mode designed to bore the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. You run small gauntlets through fragmented sections of the game with a static set of enemies, always positioned the same way until you memorize not to get hit and make sure you kill everything... sounds like fun? It's not. If you're not communicating then expect drop outs during a 20 minute long mission with randoms. (good luck finding anyone who plays this mess now) There's 20 Levels with 3 difficulties all of which must be completed to unlock the bonus stage. The bonus stage is about a 40 minute romp through the entire ship where you have to fight the end boss, twice, once in normal form and once in uber form if you're on level 50... so you can, you know, get the ""best drops"" talk about redundant and unnecessary... If you hit level 50 and beat this final level... why would you need better drops? Fail design on Capcom's part... It's already ridiculously excessive and grindy just to get to this point, then tack on more grinding without the leveling and what do you get? Heart disease... that's what.			"

												I'm gonna cut this game some slack for being a port from a mobile console - the graphics actually don't look that bad for a PSP game, they did a solid job porting it. The atmosphere and the new character Parker also give a nice, eerie introduction to the ship that the majority of the game takes place on.And that's about all I can say that's good about this game.I cannot fathom why people said this game was better than Resident Evil 6 - the gameplay is watered down (PSP port, okay), the voice acting is dull, the story is uninteresting and lacks focus much more than Resident Evil 6 did. And the worst part is the character design. If you thought Jill's catsuit from Resident Evil 5 was bad, wait till you see Rachel and Jessica in this game. Just google those names under Resident Evil and you will see what I mean.Point is, don't get this game. Even if you don't mind sexualised character design, there is just nothing good on offer here.

												Resident evil: Jill's fine butt returns.First of all pre-warnings:Just fair reminder that there is NO SINGLEPLAYER CO-OP, it only has ""raid mode"" co-op which is your standard mercaneries but with set levels and enemies. No waves. Just ""go from A to B while killing 15 enemies"".  Which is surprising because you effectively have partner with you all the game.Co-op mod is being devoloped by fans but it has lot of problems to hurdle first.Dialogue, story and voice acting is pretty horrible and you should NOT buy this ""for the story"".Not even ""capcom horrible"", they are just plain bad facepalm level. Its super awkward B-movie quality.At first you dont notice it because its your typical Resident Evil one liners of ""we need to help CHRIIIS"" ""OKAY lets GO"".Later on it you will just think ""who intern made this up"" and towards end I just couldnt bare the horrid non-surprising story and writing. The low budget and dismissive attidute towards story ""because its portable game"" shows on this side.Gameplay:Kinda fun at start if you liked RE5 with mix of RE6 (you can move while aimin but its RE5 styled over the shoulder).However, it gets REALLY repetive and enemies can get bullet spongy later on. The gameplay is effectively POINT GUN AT ZOMBIE, SHOOT TILL DEAD with very rare QTE ""get out when being grabbed"". The scanning element is cool addition but you either end up waving that device around most of the game which is distracting or just forget it unless you are out of ammo.Around middle you will get the classical ""we have to go back to the start of the game because reasons"" level re-use, gladly thats fast because you dont have to unlock all doors.. but kinda waste of time.Graphically:Shows sings of 3DS port and the animations really show it - your character slides side to side with minimal animations when running around, shadows are blocky and some textures are blurry and not really worthy of ""HD"".Would not recommend for full price unless you are diehard RE-fan. Get it cheap.If you are looking for good 3rd person shooter / horror this aint it. Get RE5 or new RE4 HD instead.If you are lookin for cheesy b-movie resident evil  which makes you facepalm and trigger finger numb, this is it. Its moddable so thats plus. I guess.Big plus for the Jill's butt. Because butts.			"

												I've never been the biggest Resident Evil fan. Regardless of whether it was the survival or action focused games. Resident Evil 4 is still the best in the series and this one comes nowhere near it. Awful writing and dialogue, and some questionable design decisions in terms of combat and weaponry. I know this was a 3DS game, but dear lord was it mediocre.			"

												I don't recommend. This game is bad port from Nintendo 3DS (handheld console). Controls are bad and also graphics are worse than in Resident Evil 5 (graphics in RE5 was nice but Resident Evil Revelations was released later than RE5). Gameplay is also bad, mouse is oversensitive while looking around and other controls like throwing grenades are delayed. Story and levels also are not very sophisticated, they are boring and we have to fight with the same enemies all the time. This product is highly overpriced, I bought it in Haloween discount and even then I think that I overpaid. I tried to refund this game but unfortunately gameplay time must not be longer than two hours (it is sick IHMO because two hours is too little to experience game enough good, at least for experienced players like me). It is example that fact that game has very positive reviews does not mean it is good and vice versa (I enjoyed some games with most negative reviews).By the way why at loading screen it is written ""Don't turn off your console""? Is it hard to change the inscription in loading screen? It would better sound ""Saving. Don't turn off your ♥♥♥♥ing box"".			"

												I thought it was sh*t, but this game has a lot of positive reviews so I might be wrong :/What I didn't like was the shooting. I mean, if you shoot and then you try to shoot immediately after, it doesn't shoot. You have to wait a really small amount of time, but it is annoying compared to other shooter games. I guess this one is not a big problem.Then there are the enemies. They are LAZY, SLOW, BORING. I compare them to those in dead space 3(I know DS3 came afterwards), and why not? DS3 is great example how the enemies should be done. Dynamic, quick, scary, hard to kill, and fun to eliminate. In this game you just make sure to keep distance away from them(which is easy) and shoot and you are OK. It is really boring.That's it, I didn't play the whole game, because I lost interest.			"

												Most boring resident evil ever, period. theres no thrill of being chased down , ammo is plentifull and enemies are like small delicate kids with down syndrome, easy to beat.if you want to play this game buy it on the 3ds , its much more enjoyable , theres more things to interact with and the graphics suit it. in conclusion dont buy this game, go buy resident evil 4 which has amazing gameplay and a truckload of content to keep you playing unlike this one where all you do is run around hallways for hours thinking about loading your parents gun and blowing your brains all over the monitor.

												Well, The most boring resident evil in history. It´s not horror, It´s not Hard, it's just a boring game with corridor gameplay and no sense and buggy enemies..... No more commenting, I´m disappointed. This game was for 3DS console. Price of this game 40 euros(Good joke). Seriously i can´t understand that metalcritic 77/100. Better than resident evil 6 ..??! Resident evil 6 - 4 campaigns, much fun, lots of hours of gameplay, Great Coop, much better graphic, much better story, much much harder much more horror. and 30 euros price. Are you kidding me? FFS Revelations 40 E ( 8 hours of boring) or resident evil 6 30 hrs of Fun 30 E.BTW: Coop in Revelations the worst thing what i could to see. When you want to play Coop, you must finish first singleplayer campaign and after you can play Coop missions.Well Summary:The worst part of the serie 3/10           Thumb down for me!			"

												Revelations being my first Resident Evil game, didnt find this one too enjoyable. The graphics being good considering it being a port of the 3DS version, some locations in game were nice but I found them most to be too similar looking.What annoyed me about this game were the constant game mechanics and design choices that are just there to waste your time in order to lengthen the game such as no running, segments when talking on the radio having to put your hand on the ear and walking slow while doing it, ALOT of backtracking and turret sections.Everything else too me just seemed meh, the feeling and choice of the weapons, and action and horror of the game which didnt do either well.

												a terribly ported catastrophe.i didnt expect much after playing raccoon city, which was already not the greatest resident evil, to say it polite...but relevations is still able to disappoint me.the graphics are ugly, the textures, still the game uses a lot of ressources to run.the sounds,... well most handguns just make the same sound, capcom didnt even try, i guess.the gameplay, you literally scan the environment every 4 seconds to find hidden objects or ammo / herbs.the enemies are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, often get stuck in objects while walking, then look at you as if they want to say ""please kill me, i dont wanna be part of this♥♥♥♥♥♥anymore"".the controls are annoying, even with a gamepad.you cant really move fast, when you push the usual run button, all that happens is that you walk EVEN SLOWER. the levels are short and boring, on top of that you have to see cutsequences every few minutes, AND after every few levels a video resume of what you just did, alan wake style. (which makes no sense cause the levels dont even last longer than a few minutes...)the game has bugs like the mentioned stuck enemies, floating blood, video and sound bugs.i grew up with resident evil and always loved the games, but im not sure how capcom could come up with the funny idea to publish this, its for sure my last purchase from this franchise. dont waste your money for this, honestly! if you still feel the urge, torrent it first and see that i just saved you a few bucks.

Really great Resident Evil game, I would recommend it for everyone.PROS:-Great story-It's actually survival not a shooter-Game is not easy-Reminds you of the police station from RE2-It's not 4 hours long.CONS:-Replay value is not that great-Little weapon arsenal choice from first walktrough-Could have better voice acting for the new characters			"

												Personally, I wish this game stay on 3DS because its meant to be played in 3D and the best part was Jill's♥♥♥♥♥in 3D. With that said I love the movement/shooting in this game. It is how RE5, 4 ,3 ,2, and 1 should been if 5 4 3 2 and RE 1 were to be remade for current GEN. Storyline, I don't care much for storyline because I hated this stroyline honesty. Revelation is what happened before Chris and Jill went to the masion and got their♥♥♥♥♥handed to them by Wesker, thus RE 5 happens. I miss the shooting zombies.... well wait... Capcom had never made a true zombie survior horror games that were 3rd person. Sure there were the old camera view but we need a true 3rd person view and I""M NOT TALKING ABOUT RE RACCON CITY. Raid is second best to RE5 mercenaries with the add on gun parts and such... worth the money alone. Buy it for RAID co op but there are no storyline coop.			"

												**I AM HARD PRESSED TO RECOMMEND THIS FOR 50$. IF I BOUGHT IT AT FULL, THIS WOULD BE A NEGATIVE REVIEW BECAUSE THE GAME CAN BE COMPLETED WITHIN 6 HOURS WITHOUT MUCH INCENTIVE FOR REPLAY**For 12.50$, this game is golden. Remember those B-script action-drama shows that would pop up on TV now and then? This game is exactly that. For those who are just getting into it, the story will♥♥♥♥♥♥its-self after the first 'episode'. Then it just gets whackier from there.Yeah, towards the end, the story wraps its self up (and even has a short-clip+text-card sequence explaining what happened to all the characters), but I still can't get over how rediculous it all was.Remember back in the 90s when we had the technology to make a solar powered floating utopia city? Or when the RE universe made use of the orbital sunlight cannon? I can't help but feel that this game was going to be written as a sort of ""Own-universe"" type of game, but since it ties into RE5, that's not the case. So now we just have to accept that while RE1 was just happening, some philanthropists were making a giant floating city.Anyway, the game is fun, not much in the way of puzzles, but the ship has a strong RE1 vibe to it that I enjoyed. Also there are quite a few hidden things for those who want to explore. Overall, it's probably the most fun I had in a RE for a while.However, your AI partner is even more of a turd this time around. All he/she will do is just stand still and shoot at enemies on occasion. Also all enemies will aggro you, your partner just stands and looks pretty.Enemy designs are brilliant when it comes to the sea-creatures, quite a few looking like they could fit at home in Dark Souls (especially some of the later ones). While for the enemies found in the mountain/flashback segments, you just get your standard Hunter-α (plus a new variant), as well as the return of the zombie dog.Voice acting is on-par with the standard RE-terrible, with some lines like ""Jill, where are you?"" ""I don't know, a room I think. On the boat.""For a 3DS port, the game doesn't look that bad. As a PC game; it's passable, but is on par with late-PS2 graphics. Won't find a RE5 level of detail here. Or even RE6.This game also has a comedy duo who have hip-hop in the background whenever they have a scene. I don't really have much else to say.			"

												Highly recommended. It plays more like traditional Resident evil games even with a 3rd person perspective like RE4. This game is far better than Resident Evil 5 and 6 which are like action games. This game takes the series back to its survival horror roots. The raid mode of this game gives you more than 50 hours of play time easily. Don't hesitate because I did until I played it and found out how good it was. I was put off because it was a 3DS port. But it is a full-fledged Resident Evil game. The graphics are quite nice. The textures and material reflects realistically enough to make it look good.			"

												For a casuall play here and there its worth a look, but consider that the HD visual clean up is just that, its polished but the very old textures are still there so dont buy this game for looks.Gameplay is pritty smoth however the aim camera can be wonky when playing with mouse and keyboard its fully doible however so dont worry.Also Revelations is kinda trying to take on a TV serie aproach and it kinda feals off somehow and prolly just make u laugh at it.All in all its a 6/10 could have been a so much more unless the Price of the game is a robbery and the so called HD edition without better textures kinda blows in my opinion.but happy hunting people.

												I don't know why this game is still $50.  But if it ever gets to $30 and below, it is definitly worth every cent.Campaign is good, I enjoyed it to go through twice.  The hard mode switches up enemies so it can still surprise you.  There is NG+ as well.Raid mode is different from the usual mercenaries.  Instead of going for a high score, you go through levels from the campaign with your own loadout and level.  Enemy placement,  types, and numbers are different for each level over three difficulties.  Throughout you either buy (with points earned from playing the game) or pickup guns to upgrade and use.  The pickups are usually the better ones due to the possibility of having more customization slots (which are more +% better upgrades, but you can get some crazy things in the endgame, a common thing I see are burst fire magnums that don't need reloading and have hundreds of bullets).  The mechanics of the game get a bit deeper as well.  Enemies become weak to certain weapon types, melee becomes useful cause it doesn't take ages to pull off, weak points become important.  The only problem with raid mode is that not a lot of people play the game.  But hey, I'm always happy to play with someone that can speak english.The campaign is single player, but raid mode is co-op.  Co-op is pretty much expected to get the endgame stuff as well.			"

												Instead of RE 6 fast paced action packed third person shooter, with less horror moments; RE: Revelations brings back transitional designs for the franchise, cluster-phobic and creepy moments with an immerse atmosphere.The game uses the same third person angle from RE 4, but much polished; smooth animations and model design brings the game to life, as being a ""HD"" remake, Capcom didn't let you down on this one.If you like old-school-ish RE design, you may want to grab it when there is a price drop; not forget to mention the RAID mode, where maps are unlocked in Campaign, can be played co-operatively with a friend or another player!

												Highly recommended. It plays more like traditional Resident evil games even with a 3rd person perspective like RE4. This game is far better than Resident Evil 5 and 6 which are like action games. This game takes the series back to its survival horror roots. The raid mode of this game gives you more than 50 hours of play time easily. Don't hesitate because I did until I played it and found out how good it was. I was put off because it was a 3DS port. But it is a full-fledged Resident Evil game. The graphics are quite nice. The textures and material reflects realistically enough to make it look good.			"

												I'd give this game a 7/10. While it's fun to play, it's pretty short for the main game, and raid mode doesn't add much to it since few people even play online at this point. If you are a fan of the series, go ahead and get it, though I'd recommend waiting for a sale.			"

												Fans who disliked Resident Evil 5 and 6 will find much more to like in Revelations, though it's still not the return to survival horror that many have been hoping for.   The game plays like a hybrid between Resident Evil 5 and the original Resident Evil, pairing the modern combat system with the cramped, atmospheric indoor settings of the older games; think of what the GameCube remake of RE1 would feel like with an over-the-shoulder camera and you're halfway there. The combination works so well that it makes one wonder why Resident Evil 4 abandoned so much of the classic gameplay in the first place.   The Queen Zenobia and its enemies are actually frightening (even if there aren't many of them) and the game often manages to build up genuine dread about the scenarios the player is in, something newer titles sorely lacked.  Ammo and health are also more limited, but not to the point of making Revelations a true survival horror game.   Unfortunately, the exploration still feels watered down compared to the older games with less backtracking and fewer puzzles to solve, but it's still far less linear than 4, 5, or 6.  Capcom can't seem to let go of action and Revelations is packed with a few over the top sequences, most of them occuring in chapters that jump to other characters outside of the Queen Zenobia.    These chapters break the immersion in the ship setting and feel like obligatory diversions from Jill's more interesting campaign, but they're brief enough to be excusable.   In general, the game feels like a broken up collection of moments from all across the series history, in both a good way and bad way- the dumbed down action rears its head once again, but the horror of the older games resurfaces to counter it, sometimes within the same chapter.   The campaign can be beaten in about 5-8 hours, a far cry from RE6's 40 hour duration.  Unlike most entries, Revelations does not include the Mercenaries mode to fill out the package, instead offering a new take called Raid mode.  Raid mode has much more in common with the original RE3 incarnation of Mercenaries in which the player would travel across a large, linear stretch of the single player game rather than fighting enemies in a closed arena.  It's generally fun and serves as a welcome break from tradition, but there are many odd choices that hinder the experience.For one, each weapon has its own level.  As the player collects xp from matches, they will be able to purchase higher and higher level weapons, which forces one to keep purchasing the same guns over and over each time they level up while simply discarding their old weapons (they can't be sold back).  This is already tedious, but the fact that the store randomly displays only a few guns at a time makes the process that much worse.  Trying to do something as simple as upgrade your pistol from a level 41 to 42 may require opening the shop 4 or 5 times until your handgun is displayed, and even then it may actually be a lower level than your current gun or it may inexplicably lack any item slots to equip perks to, forcing you to repeat the process until you find one that does.  Why in god's name they didn't use the system from RE4 and 5, letting the player keep and upgrade the same gun over time, is beyond me.  Online play is also tedious in that a level 50 player will have guns capable of killing enemies in single shot while a level 5 player will have to empty several clips to get the same effect.  To avoid a wild mismatch of power, high level players have to lower their level manually.   Considering that this must be done every time you play with a lower level player, it's hard to miss the straightforward simplicity of dropping into a Mercenaries match.  In terms of what's different from the 3DS release, there's not much worth mentioning- it's 95% the same and the few alterations are meaningless.  Even when maxed out, the game doesn't look good enough to make the 3DS version any less impressive, and the loss of 3D may even give the original  the advantage.  To put it bluntly, it's absolutely not worth upgrading if one already has the 3DS version. Revelations isn't perfect, but it's hard to complain when the game gets so much closer to the classic RE gameplay than the newer installments.  It's certainly worth picking up, but don't expect it to solve all of the series' problems and don't forget it's origins as a more limited handheld game.			"

												After some weaker entries like Resident Evil 5 and 6 which are enjoyable as action games but drop the Horror aspect all togheter Capcom is doing a good job of catching a better setting in this game. With impressive design and Horror enviorments the game is looking a lot more grim then the other recent entries in the Series.If you loved Resident evil 1-4 this game is a good addition to your collecting IF you have a controller. With the keyboard this game is clearly a Horror story in a different matter.Altough not scary the setting etc are perfect but also a lot of fun is Raid mode and the upgrading of weapons. The A.I. that helps you is also hilarious by doing absolutely nothing, sadly no co-up campaign but u can do raid mode with friends.All in All id say 8/10 but still comes highly recommended.			"

												Given that I bought it with a 75% discount, I feel like the money was worth, otherwise, I wouldn't buy.The game has a nice atmosphere, a bit too much cheerful in my point of view. I think the songs could have been used in a more chilling way. There were situations in which the music felt like 'everything was ok', and I didn't feel any uneaseness in advancing in the game.Also, dealing ONLY with monsters is less frightening than dealing with them and the undead, which we don't know when they're dead or not and their moanings, their slow moving, and their deadly bitting. So I didn't feel much like playing a RE game.I thought, playing in Normal, that the game was much easier than I anticipated. It's somehow easy to avoid getting killed and the enemies are not hard to kill, although the ones that are tougher, are indeed harder to kill.I missed scenes of being scared to death, or sudden fright appearances, which simply don't occur or you're simply expecting them to happen, because the layout of the places you're going through already suggests you're going to have an enemy springing on your neck soon enough, either when you're going or returning.The story is ok. I was just feeling that kind of deja vú when Chris and Jill started looking for each other (I mean, Chris, Claire, Jill, etc are always looking for each in the games, it's a bit repetitive).Graphics look nice enough, at least you can feel like you're in those places.All in all, I think the game is good, but too much expensive for the experience it provides.

												Despite being a die-hard Resident Evil fan since the PS1/Raccoon City days, RE6 left a bit of an unpleasant taste in my mouth in certain aspects. Revelations easily makes up for that misfire by taking a step back and putting once more on display what made the original series so great: a memorable soundtrack, an eerie atmosphere, and a story that kept my attention at all times. The real downside is the short length of the story, but it's understandable since the game was originally meant for the Nintendo 3DS a year and a half ago.			"

It is scary in the begining but then starts switching you to diffrent characters in diffrent locations, this is bad for two reasons it doesn't make you feel traped in the other enviroment like the mansion in the first game, and these parts are more action based. Even the scary enviroment starts not being scary when you get more weapons and they start having less slow bulky enemies and more fast ones and ones that shoot projectiles.			"

												The game itself if really entertaining. What I like about it is the re-involvment of Jill; and the story line. The weapon system on the other hand isn't all that great. I'm a big fan of resident evil 4's weapon upgrades and while the game did try in the minigame aspect it really didn't try at all in the main game. To be completly honest the only real thing that makes this game so good is in fact the story line and the fact that they brought back Jill. If your looking for a horror game this would not be the one. If you are looking for a good Shooter then I would suggest it. Maybe its just because i'm stuck in the past but I miss the actuall horror aspect of the RE franchise.			"

												my favorite and the best RE title to date. my view at least.played it alread 4 times and still enjoy it. sure its not scary horror but good enough to make you feel a tiny bit uncomfortable. especially when you have no gun at one stage. also, some rooms and hallways are creepy.at least you dont face huge hords of enemies as in part 4, 5 and 6. plus you have to conceive ammo. the story is nothing fancy either but which RE title now had it really. as the title indicates, something gets revealed with a little twist of the characters you encounter.  you play mainly as jill, so as chris, new comer parker and some other new guy i forgot his name now. as always you have some boss battles, each of them being different to fight. you can see on the graphics that it has been ported, that some textures are blurry and has some ruff edges. never the less, it looks good and the PC port as such, is well done. the controls feel smooth, it displayes the PC buttons and the mouse works flawlessly. you can sidewalk which is all fine, but when you run and sidewalk, your character slows down. its not like its a huge problem in the game but it does feel awkward when you run and fighting off some faster moving enemies.certainly worth the money. especially if you want to play as jill again which i always wanted to.

												I first played this game on 3DS and preordered the PC version on Steam as soon as it became available, so hopefully that shows how much I enjoyed it! The Steam version is a great port! The Genesis scanner was my main concern, but I should have had faith! It isn't clunky or weird to use at all. The graphics and sound are a pleasant upgrade. No 3D, of course, but the trade for keyboard/mouse controls is well worth it.If you wanted more Jill from RE5 and RE6, this is the game for you! She's kickin' butt and taking names the whole game through. The combat is more like RE6 and you can move and shoot at the same time, which is lovely. I don't enjoy how often the game makes your partner stay behind to do plot related actions while you go off and find X alone, but I don't like it because it's scary and that's kind of the point of a survival horror game. The atmosphere is pleasantly spooky and combat is mostly fun, although your AI partner tends to hide behind you! Sadly, there is no co-op in campaign mode, only Raid mode, and no local co-op at all, only online. The PC version (unlike the 3DS version) does integrate with ResidentEvil.net, just like RE6. They give lots of free items for use in Raid mode that more than make up for the lack of StreetPass items the 3DS version treated you with. If you're a fan of the series (especially if you enjoyed RE6), I'd highly recommend picking this up on 3DS or PC. (If you do get it on 3DS, please make sure you have a Circle Pad Pro as well! It's almost unplayable without one. You CAN do it, it's just nowhere near as fun.) It's in twelve short episodes and there are recaps before you start a new one, so it's easy to play a half hour here and there or, if you feel like it, blow through the whole game in an afternoon and then start it again on a higher difficulty with all your painstakingly upgraded weaponry in New Game Plus. Have fun!			"

												The PC version is the best way to play this game. Keyboard & mouse controlls work flawlessly and remove the famous ""tank controls"" factor because it's much easier to control. The game runs at a smooth 60fps. Revelations is the best Resident evil since 4; It scary in some parts, but campy most of the time (which is still enjoyable and funny). The game is true survival horror; you are put in many unique situations which require you to struggle to stay alive and it feels good when you DO manage to survive. The art direction is great; color, lighting and motion are used very well to set a particular mood.			"

												The short of it: Not as good as RE4The main gripe I have with this game compared to RE4 is that RE4 had a great combat system, everything was very deliberate and it was very clear what the enemies attacks were, as well as what your capabilities were, and RE4 also had an amazing locational damage system, enemies reacted in heaps of different ways depending on where you shot. In this one, however, all these slimy-looking piranha people all react pretty much the same way when shot; they don't (with the exception of looking like they're tired for a bit so you can go up and kick them in the face, but triggering that is unreliable). There are positives though, the movement system is much more fluid and the weapon upgrade system (in my opinion) is better, in RE4 you had to spend money to upgrade your weapons but in this you find weapon parts and can swap them out. Raid mode is pretty fun, however having to play through the story by yourself to unlock the stages for raid mode so you can play them with a partner is a bit stupid. Overall, it's worth playing, but not worth paying $50 for.			"

												So I am a huge fan of all things RE, but I am sad to say this is starting to be a dying plot and style of game. If you have played all or any of the RE titles you will, if you are like me, want to play this just to satisfy that OCD ""I need to play all the RE titles"" itch. If you are new to RE, I have to say this one certainly seems to harken back to RE1 in many ways, so you can get that first time ""like a virgin"" RE experience.  Unfortuantely, the graphics also harken back to RE1.The Cons: They took out typewriters and went to autosave with this title, and I believe 4-5 (but I don't remeber). I miss being able to run back and save whenever I had the typewriter ribbons to do so. The developers are still relying on graphics from ten years ago, complete with hair that doesn't move and looks like it is being held frozen in space and time with a whole vat of hair gel. Fans of shooters of any sort are going to be extremely frustrated with this game because the hit boxes are just flat out off in some sequences. More than a few times I have been shooting point black at something and not hitting, or the real annoyance is when you go through a door fully prepraed to fire at the creature behind it and it lags for no apparent reason. This game was clearly designed for cotnrollers and the lack of kb commands is a little annoying. I swear these are the slowest running characters in any RE game to date. There is no sprint, and dodge is about as clunky as it has always been in RE games. I don't like the TV show aspect of this game and especially the ""Previously on RE Revelations"" cut scenes. I also don't like the fact that it takes you out of the atmospheric settings to do flashback sequences to ""previous episodes.""The Pros:Very cool atmosphere when you are on the ship. Kind of hard to believe they haven't done a ghost ship setting for RE till this one. Despite what some other reviewers have commented on, this game hasn't been about zombies since RE4 and frankly I like that. Zombies were great back in Raccoon City, but the story has well evolved past the zombie genre over the last several years and this game carries on with the whole mutant flesh creature scenarios. Once again we are dealign with two of the classic characters near and dear to all RE fans, Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine. I kind of feel like they are old friends, and it is nice to see some consistency in their return. This game actually does fill in some of the evolving storyline, and so far has not gone off the rails like RE3 and 4 did. So many RE titles seem to lose something in translation from Asian culture to English, but this one is relatively clear in plot and story. Even the voice acting is superior to some other RE tiltles ""looking at you RE 1-3.""Conclusion:If you are an RE fan get this game for the simple fact that it is a different setting. I liked RE 4 and 5 for the same reasons, and this one is supposed to take place between those two titles. This game is not, however, worth the list price of $50. That is way too much to spend on something that will more than likely be a trivial moment in passing in your gaming career. I caught it on sale for $12.50 on Steam and I was certainly happy enough with it for that price. I might even go as high as $25 for this game, but no more than that. You'll have some fun with it, cuss at it a lot, and you will remember what it was like when this series first emerged on the PS1 back in the 1990s. Those who are looking for graphics and pinpoint accuracy in shooting should probably look elsewhere as this game is not really a shooter, despite what some of the game propaganda says. I bought it and enjoy it simply for the fact that it is one of those game series I have been playing for about 20 years now, and the fact that RE pretty much set the bar for survival horror. Now, if someone would just bring back Dino Crisis I would feel like a kid again.			"

												I didn't expect much from this game, but it was actually refreshing to play after Resident Evil 6 (which didn't feel much like a RE game to me). Obviously since it's not a main title in the RE series the story isn't as deep or as long, but the gameplay is solid and enjoyable. I bought it on a whim and I'm very glad I did.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations actually felt scary to me at some points and it definitely brings something to the table when it comes to RE games. The Raid Mode gamemode is really fun especially if you play with a friend. Although the Abyss difficulty seemed like it had bullet sponge enemies and the no damage bonus can be VERY difficult to get. I would recommend this and I give Resident Evil Revelations a 7.5 out of 10.			"

												Capcom has being doing a great job for Resident Evil Revelations. It bring back the feel of the old Resident Evil, where you have to solve some puzzles (although a few) and scavenge for ammunitions and herbs as they dont drop often like in Resident Evil 6. The horror feel of Resident Evil has got back in this series, its creepier than I thought and I really got scared of some moments in game. However the price USD49.99 for the game would be kinda high, I would suggest buying it during promotion period for a cheaper price as I dont think it would be valuable for a price like that. Resident Evil 6 that has 4 campaigns and more contents only costed USD39.99. (Of course it wasn't better than REE). I love this game though, I would definitely purchase the upcoming Resident Evil Revelations 2 featuring Claire Redfield!!			"

												I am a HUGE Resident Evil fan and I can't say enough good things about this game. I picked it up on 3DS, but the controls didn't lend well to the experience. Drop that game on the PC with good ol mouse n keys, and HD graphics...well you get a kick♥♥♥♥♥game!The game oozes atmosphere everywhere, and most importantly Resident Evil atmosphere. The game play is spot on, delivering a fun-filled ooze blasting fest from beginning to end. I wish there were actual zombies in the game, but oh well!The most entertaining part of the game for me is the raid mode, which sets you in certain stages filled with enemies for you to dispatch. You level up and earn cash to buy and upgrade weapons. It's EXTREMELY fun.If you are interested in RE games at all, or though RE4 was pretty great, you will pretty much love this game. It really takes a step in the right direction for Resident Evil games. I can only hope they make another Revelations-esque entry into the franchise.			"

												A surprisingly commendable port on the technical side, RER is a pretty enjoyable action horror game that is 75% surprisingly tense exploration survival horror in a cruise ship setting as RE1 darling Jill Valentine, and 25% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t shooty bits in the snowy mountains of northern Finland as some other people.The 3DS roots are obvious in the low-poly models and environments, and M+KB controls make this a tad too easy on Normal, but everything runs silky smooth and that is a big plus.

												First thing first. The only real reason i would recommend this, is because i love the Resident evil universe. If you're not a fan of the series, don't even go there.Starting off with the good parts. The story is rather decent. The characters are as lovely as ever and the not-completely-linier-except-it-is idea is a fun diversion from the regularity in most RE games.I also liked the weapon upgrade system, gives a more changey feel and all choices are not permanent.Now to the bad parts, the *WEAPON UPGRADE SYSTEM* is not permanent and feels weird for a RE game...The *GRAPHICS* are sad, not as in bad but it gives a kindof dead feeling. The lighting is lighting up whole cupboards like it's a semi-budgettey game from the late 2000s. All textures who are about to move are semi-obvious to completely obvious.The game suffers from *EXTREME CONSOLITIES*. The graphics is one of the clues, the other is the aiming. Even though we remove the aim-help, it's still jumpy, You can't aim properly when you're getting close to a monster couse even though it's turned off, the aim-help seems to kick and and prevents any fast or small movements of the aim.THERE ARE NO REAL ZOMBIES! Just lots of weird blobby humanoids who are no fun trying to aim at with their wobbly heads and ♥♥♥♥ed up aiming.There are *NO SCARY SCENES* where you know you're about to get ♥♥♥♥ed but still try to make it out with key-combinations, even though the rest of the game is console-oriented, this part which is usually the more fun, and mostly hated, part of the RE games IMHO, is left out.*IT'S PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DODGE* it makes no sence that you have to time a turnabout to dodge, and you almost always dodge straight into whatever's trying to run into you.But i still played through the whole campaign, and i actually enjoyed it. So the story is a pretty big plus, even though i am quite sure most people will not agree with me on that part. There are quite a few things that does not make sence, RE wise, but i suppose it's still legit. I want to believe.			"

												I originally played this on 3DS, but I recently decided to check out this version since it was on sale and I'm cheap as heck sometimes. Anyways...Resident Evil Revelations is known for taking the series back to its survival horror roots, which it actually does. Although, I still prefer Resident Evil 4 (which I'll also have to try checking out the PC version of), but this is probably my 2nd favorite in the franchise.There's a bunch of plot twists, the enemies are sometimes decently challenging. I say sometimes since the 3DS version made me so used to standing while shooting, so this version feels like a walk in a park to me, except in that part where you have no weapons. Speaking fo which, I don't remember that B.O.W. being able to get its head out of the TV in the original version. Unless it was always like that and I'm just really fast when it comes to getting out of the room usually, nice touch.The gameplay mainly has a system of primary weapons (guns), secondary weapons (explosives), and a dodge system which is easily abused when you know what you're doing. I'm still a bit rusty at the dodging since I haven't used it in so long, but you can generally just move forward real quick with the right timing and completely avoid all damage.Ammo is scarce and enemies refuse to die, reserve ammo for when you need it. Either that, or just head shot everything. You could also knife everything or use your bombs. Yeah, those bombs have saved my lives many times. Especially the B.O.W. Decoys. Also, some bosses are down-right frightening at first. They aren't as scary the 2nd time through, though.....Except for the Com's Officer, he stops being scary for a while and then he shows you why you were scared with a nice chainsaw to the pelvis while a horde of undead fish people are coming to get you. I hate Com's Officer, but I also love him.			"

												If your a fan of Resident Evil and your looking for their older types of horror then this is the game to play. While the game does make more nods towards their newer games ""ie. Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6"" It does hearken back to the older style of games that we know and love about the RE Franchise. Following Jill and Parker on an abandoned ghost ship to find out where the missing crew has gone and where her brother Chris has gone, only to find a much more sinister act has been unleashed upon this daunting vessel. I highly recommend playing if your a fan of RE or if RE5 and RE6 let you down.Check out the link for game play of Resident Evil Revelations.

												Capcom is slowly moving back to their roots however this game does have it's modern survival horror aspect, it still has a portion of action into it. The puzzles in this game werent hard but atleast it gave me my quick fix of resident evilish touch. What I hope to see in the next installment:- Make the game alot less linear- leave the action to the end parts of the game but still maintaining the horror- More and harder puzzles (keys, emblems, solving puzzles to open areas and doors, also having to read the memos found in the area to solve a puzzle)- No partner ai in the campaign and atleast a separate campaign with co-op- darker and scarier atmosphere also being able to endure the fear put into the areas- inventory box should make it's return (Good thing it made it's appearance in this game)- bring back the inventory system (Also another good thing that they brought it back to this game)- bring back the save rooms and some form of save manual save system (it doesnt have to be typewriter but I really miss that in the resident evil survival horror)- make ammo and health items scarce and being able to scavenge the area and exploring to find supplies (lowering the amount of item drops when you kill enemies)- being able to investigate the rooms and clicking on places in the room get a dialog of the character telling us of  the area (similar to in this game how you see a dead body and you can investigate it and a little dialog would be on the bottom of the screen)- Memos, journals, and reading goodies that were in most of the resident evil games (really brings up the atmosphere of survival/horror) "

												I had a blast with Revelations. It mixes really well vibe and pace from old REs with shooting moments from recent installments. Keep in mind this game was once a handheld.I won't spoil anything, but don't expect to find an amazing story here. It will keep you're attention, but it will make you roll your eyes in its cheesiness. Aside from Jill and Chris, the rest of the characters seem to come from another game and are very uninspired stereotypes. The controls are similar to RE4, 5 and 6. Dodging is the worse mechanic in this game, it's hard to understand when to use it since there is not in prompt. The scanning mechanic, similar to Metroid Prime, is a nice addition that incentivizes exploration and rewards players with scarce ammo and other items.Revelations mixes the methodical pacing from RE 1,2 and 3 using puzzles, backtracking, closed environments and the horror vibe while having the more precise controls from recent installments. You'll have the occasional shooting, but those are the minority. It's not as intense as the Remake, but it's better than 5 and 6. If nothing else, at least Relevations is a step in the right direction.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations is a ""horror"" game all right by horror I mean horrendous! The story is ridiculous, by itself that would be ok however the game tries to maintain a serious undertone throughout. It is plagued by lazy and stupid design choices and shows Capcom is truely an incompetent devolper. The asking price of $50 is ludicrous (however that may be very subjective to personal opinion). The logic to the game is like that of an that of the Expendables movie. Don't get me wrong howerver. I like the Expendables but this game tries to take itself to seriously by being ""survival horror"". The game had me scared at first but that quickly wore off as the story got more and more absurd . The gameplay is mediocre at best and is harmed by the fact that it was once a 3DS game. Environments and enimies are repeated way to often thoughout and the game and gameplay is slowed down with lazy and blunt progresson blocks.  That prevent the player from advancing and artificially lengthens the game. The real only positives I can give are the breaking up of gameplay into segments with diferent characters stories and other events. The other positive is Jill Valentine's great♥♥♥♥♥ =PClickbait/10			"

												If RE Revelations was released right after RE 4, then this game might have been heavily criticized for its lack of depth in the storytelling department. For a game that supposingly touches on the early days of the BSAA, I wished the game developers had put in more effort in telling the backstories of the main characters we get to play as. Parker comes off as someone who tries too hard to impress others, while Jessica's lines were simply.....unintelligent. I thought Quint and Keith were interesting characters  but their segment was too limited. The least Capcom could do was to give an explanation as to why or how Chris and Jill had joined to BSAA, since they were the most well known characters.Nevertheless, certain elements of your typical survivor horror game are delivered in this installment. The game may look tame on the casual and normal difficulties but start the game on the infernal mode and you may just start to hate this game.In conclusion, Revelations is a much better alternative if you are sick of RE 6's over-the-top plotline and gameplay.  The relatively simplistic game mechanic in Revelations brings out the horror that many gamers experienced from the earlier installments.  Still, don't expect too much of a reward once you finish the game.			"

												A straight-up upscaled port of a 3-year-old 3DS game, which retails for $20, sold for $50.The campaign is short, the levels are extremely cramped and linear, and load times (though hidden) are frequent, as befitting the original hardware for which they were designed.All that being said, if you can catch it for the price of the 3DS version or less, it's a far better Resident Evil game than Capcom's latest fiascos, keeping more in line with the gameplay style of RE5, and making an attempt to return to spookiness and atmosphere over explosions and bolo ties. There are even tense underwater sections, and the return of the master of unlocking!The cherry on top is raid mode, an online cooperative mode for two players, where you fight your way through snippets of the campaign, albeit with more aggressive enemy placement. You collect loot, unlock characters and costumes, and attempt to score well to earn points for purchasing and upgrading skills and equipment. It ties into Capcom's bizarre RE.net website, as well, so you can get a little more use out of the damn thing if you made one for RE6.Overall, a pretty great game, and something of a return to form for the Resident Evil series.

												This game started life off as a Nintendo DS game I believe, and the PC version is actually pretty awesome. They really tried to bring it up to PC standards, and for that I applaud it. Not a bad game at all, a must have for fans of the franchise.			"

												If you enjoyed the classic RE games I'd highly recommend this. It is an upscaled 3DS port so the graphics aren't the best but they've done a decent enough job and you can easilly tweak them with nVidia programs etc. The story is a bit flamboyant at times but the game itself combines the RE4-6 style moving and combat with the more conventional exploration of the classic RE1-3 style: there's puzzles, you hunt for keys, there's areas you can go back too to find guns and upgrades that are off the beaten path and can easilly be missed. Unfortunately the game is let down by it's flamboyancy in places and some of the newer characters (Jessica in particular) are just downright annoying and don't fit the vibe at all. However if you see this game on sale in any of the Steam Sales definitely pick it up - it's much better than the likes of RE6 and RE: Operation Raccoon City and pretty much feels quintessentially Resident Evil.

												This game is really amazing at its survival part of the game aswell as the horror and gore factor. The game play was top noch in my opinion. Game really kept me on my toes of the diffenet enemies I have faced dure each chapter/episode have progressed.  Though I do have to say it not really that scary and more or less but nerve wrecking to me. Even the dodge mechanic was a little iffy sometimes but you do get invincibility during the animation (but thats me during my playthrough).  Aside of the that; this is a solid game and make feel that I cant wait to play the sequel to come out. I would recommend anyone that is interested in the Resident Evil video game series to play this game before the sequel. "

												Positives+ New system to upgrade weapons is neat, albeit not exactly noticeable+ Different costumes offer stat changes in Raid Mode, not just cosmetic+ Same core gameplay as previous entries, will please existing fans (RE4-6)Negatives- No pop-up message to help you counter attacks (As it is in RE6)- I noticed some odd glitches, like my weapon not lowering after I had fired a shot and let go of the buttonI enjoyed this game because I tend to enjoy all Resident Evil games (except for Operation Raccoon City). I am biased in this regard, and I can overlook some flaws because this series continues to deliver a formula that I enjoy.I am sad there is no Mercenaries Mode, but rather Raid Mode. Raid Mode seems to be a way for people who enjoy speed runs to take the game into small-size bites. This isn't a bad thing, I just don't enjoy Raid Mode as much. It feels like I'm just playing the story over again without cutscenes.			"

												This hidden gem in the Resident evil series is the perfect mix between the old and new styles, I'm a Huge fan of this series, and after the abomination that is Resident evil 6, it seems that all hope was gone for this franchise and out of nowhere comes Resident evil revelations, it's a real shame that this entry in the series went under the radar for alot of people, probably due to the fact that the game originally came out on the nintendo 3ds and later was ported as a digital download version for consoles, in short, if you're a fan of the series like i am, do yourself a favour and grab this one, you won't be disappointed. Oh and a sequel to RE Revelations is coming out next year that looks to regain the same playing style as the original, Thumbs up to that.			"

												Closer to the original Resident Evil than RE5, nice character switches and levels, though a bit redundant. Nevertheless worth the time and cash for the sake of a typical RE-Chapter, if you like 3/4-Letter-Agencies, mutants and the solving of almost all problems with guns facing boss enemies. So far.. so good. I miss the Zombies from the first parts though.			"

												I was hesitant to pick up this game considering the flop that was Resident Evil 6. I would have to say overall I'm pleased with the story line and gameplay of this game. The graphics were way less demanding than RE6. You do play as more than on scenario of characters, however it is in one linear campaign so the gameplay is more pleasing. You unlock weapons by finding them and completing puzzles. No stupid currency system like there was in RE6. Graphics: 7/10Gameplay: 8/10Replayability: 6/10			"

												Let me make it very clear from the beginning why I'm recommending Resident Evil Revelations at all - Raid Mode. This minigame is what will sap up most of your time, and can take anywhere from 70 to over 100 hours for you to unlock characters and bonuses, find rare weapons and achieve S ranks.On to the campaign.Resident Evil Revelations plops RE mainstays Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine into a 'web of intrigue and conspiracy' (inverted commas because....) with new partners, Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat. After Chris and Jessica drop off the grid while investigating a possible terrorist group's revival, Jill and Parker and sent to check on them. Parker and Jill end up at an abandoned ship, the Queen Zenobia, which is where most of the Campaign happens. The plot of Revelations is the cheesiest, lamest, cheapest, worst pulp fiction plot I have ever come across. There is no criminal mastermind in this game, the game IS the criminal mastermind for coming across as utterly cheap and unconvincing.Through the campaign, certain parts and boss fights just drag on and on. Instead of creating tension, you start hoping for the game to just be over and done with. The unconvincing, cheap plot makes this worse because you often just feel like a fool wandering the corridors in search of keys and key items to unlock this and that - but for what? Everything feels like a wild goose chase - and players who have finished this game will know what I mean.The controls are a step up from the uncomfortable, inconvenient 3DS ones. The ability to map your subweapons to specific keys will allow you to toss subweapons (grenades, decoys) quickly, saving your skin in precarious Raid Mode situations. Where the triggers on the 3DS were cramped and caused hand fatigue, you'll of course find no such problem on the PC. The half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥dodging is still here, however. There is no laser sight in this game. Be sure to turn off Acceleration/Auto-Aim and other options in the game's menu, because your crosshairs are going to be 'sticky' otherwise, making it harder to aim.For Mercenaries veterans, Raid Mode is definitely a different flavour. Instead of building combos and adding time, the game offers 20 stages, all mini-maps taken from the main Campaign. In each, your objective is to get to the end point. To get there, you have to make your way through the map, kill enemies for keys, etc. To make Raid Mode challenging for trophy hunters, Trinity Bonuses (achieve No Damage, kill all enemies, play at lower level than recommended) have been added, and will often require a good co-op partner for you to get them all.You choose from a variety of characters, each with different weapon perks, pick 3 weapons from your inventory and then enter the stage. Generally, there are characters for different playing styles. E.g. Morgan Lansdale, with his Rifle and Magnum perk, will be popular with people who like the powerful but slow-reloading weapons.Co-Op has a number of known issues as well, such as horrible lag and failure to find matches. The lag affects gameplay badly, since enemies will regenerate health, enemies might continue walking around despite having 0 HP, enemies (and your partner) 'teleport' across the map, etc.Revelations is a rather weak game. It hasn't got an amazing combat system, it hasn't fully retained the flavour of older RE games, it gets utterly boring at points, the enemies are rehashed zombies, it's not an immersive or convincing game world, etc. But I still recommend it for the co-op experience of bonus-hunting with a partner. Raid Mode is a content-heavy section that stands well on its own and has high replayability. For players who lament that this game is a 'disappointment' and a 'disaster', my reply is to simply play through the game to get your money's worth, then uninstall it from your system and be done with it. This is the new direction the games are taking, and you of course, as a consumer, have the choice not to part with your money and time.Revelations gets a 7/10 from me.			"

												So I am a huge fan of all things RE, but I am sad to say this is starting to be a dying plot and style of game. If you have played all or any of the RE titles you will, if you are like me, want to play this just to satisfy that OCD ""I need to play all the RE titles"" itch. If you are new to RE, I have to say this one certainly seems to harken back to RE1 in many ways, so you can get that first time ""like a virgin"" RE experience.  Unfortuantely, the graphics also harken back to RE1.The Cons: They took out typewriters and went to autosave with this title, and I believe 4-5 (but I don't remeber). I miss being able to run back and save whenever I had the typewriter ribbons to do so. The developers are still relying on graphics from ten years ago, complete with hair that doesn't move and looks like it is being held frozen in space and time with a whole vat of hair gel. Fans of shooters of any sort are going to be extremely frustrated with this game because the hit boxes are just flat out off in some sequences. More than a few times I have been shooting point black at something and not hitting, or the real annoyance is when you go through a door fully prepraed to fire at the creature behind it and it lags for no apparent reason. This game was clearly designed for cotnrollers and the lack of kb commands is a little annoying. I swear these are the slowest running characters in any RE game to date. There is no sprint, and dodge is about as clunky as it has always been in RE games. I don't like the TV show aspect of this game and especially the ""Previously on RE Revelations"" cut scenes. I also don't like the fact that it takes you out of the atmospheric settings to do flashback sequences to ""previous episodes.""The Pros:Very cool atmosphere when you are on the ship. Kind of hard to believe they haven't done a ghost ship setting for RE till this one. Despite what some other reviewers have commented on, this game hasn't been about zombies since RE4 and frankly I like that. Zombies were great back in Raccoon City, but the story has well evolved past the zombie genre over the last several years and this game carries on with the whole mutant flesh creature scenarios. Once again we are dealign with two of the classic characters near and dear to all RE fans, Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine. I kind of feel like they are old friends, and it is nice to see some consistency in their return. This game actually does fill in some of the evolving storyline, and so far has not gone off the rails like RE3 and 4 did. So many RE titles seem to lose something in translation from Asian culture to English, but this one is relatively clear in plot and story. Even the voice acting is superior to some other RE tiltles ""looking at you RE 1-3.""Conclusion:If you are an RE fan get this game for the simple fact that it is a different setting. I liked RE 4 and 5 for the same reasons, and this one is supposed to take place between those two titles. This game is not, however, worth the list price of $50. That is way too much to spend on something that will more than likely be a trivial moment in passing in your gaming career. I caught it on sale for $12.50 on Steam and I was certainly happy enough with it for that price. I might even go as high as $25 for this game, but no more than that. You'll have some fun with it, cuss at it a lot, and you will remember what it was like when this series first emerged on the PS1 back in the 1990s. Those who are looking for graphics and pinpoint accuracy in shooting should probably look elsewhere as this game is not really a shooter, despite what some of the game propaganda says. I bought it and enjoy it simply for the fact that it is one of those game series I have been playing for about 20 years now, and the fact that RE pretty much set the bar for survival horror. Now, if someone would just bring back Dino Crisis I would feel like a kid again.			"

												As a fan of the resident evil games I really enjoyed this game. The story of RE:Revelations fits right in between RE4 and RE5.Throughout the main campain it switches characters and environments for each chapter, and that variance makes it fun, even tho there aren't many enemy types. There are some cool enemies but that's it. Even in the hardest difficulty, the story campain can be pretty easy, apart from some boss fights.The raid mode gives the game some replayability, even tho I found raid mode really boring.The graphics are ok, nothing too impressive. (We can finally watch Jill fat♥♥♥♥♥in FULL HD!)I recommend this game if you like resident evil / zombies / TPS / sexy ladies in revealing wet suits.			"

												Resident Evil 6 was unfortunately a big let-down in the Survival Horror department, but Revelations is here to change that. It may be noticeable that it was once a game originally for the Nintendo 3DS, it's tense, sometimes scary, and the Queen Zenobia is an incredible place to explore. It may have a dumb story and half of the game consists of playing as other characters, but the sections that let you play as Jill Valentine exploring the ship alone is worth the price of entry. Also, should I mention RAID mode is a great new addition?			"

												While RE6 was a guilty pleasure, I can safely say this is a genuinely good Resident Evil game. There are a number of artifacts that remind you of this being a handheld port -- the episodic format mainly, but poor textures as well -- but this a step back towards RE4; less action, more survival horror.  Well, maybe not horror.  Nothing in this is scary, per se.  The weapon customization is excellent, and this game's arcade/mercenaries mode (called raid mode) is suprisingly good, being what I can only describe as a mini-campaign.  Raid mode is multiplayer if you want, the campaign is single player with an AI partner you'll barely notice because he does nothing and I'm pretty sure can't die at all.  The story is awful, but that's Resident Evil for you.  If you can get it on sale and liked RE4, you literally can't go wrong with this.			"

												A surprisingly creepy iteration of Resident Evil; this game tries to return to the horror roots. The story is in episodic format, and gets a bit convoluted with constant switching between characters/time periods. It's also slightly uninspired but the atmosphere and small degree of exploration allowed makes up for it. Enemies are horrifying and resource management is more important than it was in RE4 or RE5 (I actually ran out of ammo a few times). Despite originally being for the Nintendo DS, the HD version really improves the graphics, being as good as RE5 on medium settings.Raid mode is a fun time-waster but gets repetitive after a few hours. Recommended but I'd wait for a sale.			"

												I'll be honest, the story and dialogue of this game are both cringeworthy. The gameplay however feels very nice. It's like RE4 shooting, only you can move while aiming now. The fact that ammo is, at times very scarce adds to the difficulty of this game and that's a +1 in my book.  It was nice to see that they used the scanner thingy to make you look scan all corners looking for hidden items.Raid mode basically lets you replay the story levels, except you just have to rush through killing everything in your path and scoring points to level up. Nevertheless an enjoyable mode.So all in all this is a pretty enjoyable game, just don't expect an amazing story and  get ready for some awful dialogue.But the best part about this game is probably Jill's butt, so buy it for the booty.

												With no pulled punches for the fact this game was made for 3DS because it's the story that's at fault here.  It's a good game otherwise.I played on PC with and Xbox360 controller and the game worked just fine.  it seems well made: there are no bugs that I can think of and no real problems with the controls beyond my own failings; however, the game betrayed me as a lover of the Resident Evil series.  The game goesn't respect its enemies and it doesn't respect its own story.On multiple occasions this game goes out of its way to trivialze the enemies presented by either not acknowledging them  various trash, shield boss, giant tentacle B.O.W.  or by resuing bosses as common fodder.  The combat is in no way difficult and the hardest difficulty makes up for it by being extremely bullet spongey.Story wise, it's a complete drama bomb.  I'm surprise that Jill didn't reveal that she was having Parker's alien baby via virgin birth, but there's always next time.  Half of it makes sense, half of it if I""m being generous.  It just dropped conspiracy on top of me and expected me to roll with it, well good try but no.Characters know things that they shouldn't.  Example:  Chris/Jessica RUSH to Jill's location (that you the player know but not them) during a time of great urgency (that you the player know about but not them).  It's an attempt to build suspense without a real effort.  It's lazy writing and the game does it repeatedly.Characters are overly obvious about their intentions.  Example:  Jessica asks out of nowhere if you trust her.  Raymond reveals himself to Jill/Parker on the ship.   Serious, lazy writing like this makes me feel like I'm watching Dora the Explorer.Character actions do not match their intended results.  I cannot stress this one enough.  The absolute laziness of this one is close to hurting my brain.  It's a cheap attempt at a dramatic plot twist.  Examples:  Raymond reveals Jessica as the mole, but he's actually on her side.  Raymond starts to give a very vague speech and Jessica shoots him in the bulletproof vest to stop him revealing information... it's obviously planed but WHY?!  O'brain puts BSAA on infected ship for evidence on Lansdale but Raymond is already there.  Lansdale wants to eliminate ALL evidence but does so by sinking one of three ships.   There's so much more, it's everywhere seriously.The point: a game can drama bomb all it wants to but if it doesn't make an effort to make those bombs meaningful then I might as well have been shooting Spongebob zombies while riding a My little Pony only to be surprise to find out the Spongebob zombies were made by Dr. Gero all in an effort to make Vegeta's heart grow three sizes that day.  The My little Pony? It's obviously because of the new T-C-A-Veronica-Abyss-Dante's-Naruto virus.			"

												This was the first RE game I've played (and finished), having watched a number of RE gameplay vids. However, going in blind to this game, I've found this game rather fun. The jumpscares aren't too strong, the aiming is a lot smoother than I remember, and you're not left feeling completely alone and unassisted, as you occasionally continue getting chatter over radio and a buddy you don't have to babysit usually by your side.Not only that, you can somewhat run this game just fine on a toaster with a few settings nicked down.

												Play for the RAID mode.  That is where its strengths are.  The campaign  episodes are short and sweet so you get time to rest and think about taking a break after  10 mins of poor controls(dodging is so hard to do), graphics, and monsters(some are incredibly easy, others take every bullet you have) .  Play with a controller.    RAID mode:  something I wish the other REs had.  Essentially a gauntlet that you try to complete without getting hit while killing all enemies you can find.  The leveling and persistent loot system for RAID is what will draw you in.  Recommended when its on sale for no more than $10			"

												An elegant game that fully embraces the idea that less is more. Despite being a 3DS port, Resident Evil: Revelations manages to surpass the big-budget Resident Evil 6. Though the story is the standard Resident Evil bio-terrorism/global conspiracy nonsense, Revelations introduces some new and likable characters and thanks to excellent pacing and a tighter scope, it never outstays its welcome. The game also features excellent gunplay, combined with the best upgrade system in the series. In addition to the single-player campaign, the game also features a score-attack mode called 'Raid', which is easily as compelling. It throws in some ARPG features, such as drops of various rarity and special enemies, and can be played alone or with a friend.			"

												Surprisingly entertaining and fairly fleshed out game, considering it was originally made for the 3ds. The story itself stands on its own, and could probably work even without any links to the other games. In fact, the only real big links to the other games are a couple of series name drops, and of course Chris and Jill, who return for this installment, but could easily be substituted with any new protagonists. On that note, while at first kind of cringing at some of the new characters introduced, many of them grow on you as the game continues. I think that this could be in part to do with the fact that they are so heavily involved in the plot of the game, which is how it should work. A good comparison for this is Sheva from Resident evil 5. Sheva, apart from existing to allow a coop option, is given no real reason to be there, yeah Chris is her partner, but that's all, and that's a big reson why she is very forgettable. Parker (Jill's partner in this game), on the other hand, begins this whay as we are introduced to him, but as we see in flashbacks and in encounters with Raymond, he has a reason to be there, which makes him, as a character, a lot more interesting. In terms of inventory, I myself prefer the organisational layout of the attaché case in RE4, but I consider this layout of limiting to 3 weapons on hand at any one time, not bad. The return of item chests is very welcome, and complements this otherwise, very restrictive inventory, by allowing items, such as rocket launchers and magnums to be put away until needed without having to wait until a chapter end.Gameplay itself is very much the same as previous installments, however you can now shoot/reload while walking, which I found hard to get used to, just out of habit, but once gotten used to, it's incredibly useful. One thing, I never really got the hang of was dodging which seems useful, but also seems to only work sometimes, I don't know, I may just be doing it wrong. I will say though, that ally AI is still broken as hell. They fire at enemies, but they seem to make very little actual difference in combat, which is sad to say, considering that it worked better in previous games.Enemywise, there weren't many types of enemies, but it didn't bother me because they each had a very different style. I was however, very disappointed in the boss battles within the game. They seemed very awkward and out of place, to the point that they didn't really need to exist.Overall, I found the game very entertaining and suspenseful, with a few minor quirks, which can easily be overlooked. The game felt more ""actiony"" than classic games in the series, but I think it needs a certain amount of that to not make people feel too uncomfortable while playing, while still remaining within the survival horror genre.

												Much like the recent Resident Evil Games, Resident Evil Revelations is a 3rd person shooter/horror game. I just couldn't get into this game. It is a port of the 3DS version and you can definitely tell. The textures are muddy and the movement/shooting feels sluggish. At least it runs fairly well. Like other Resident Evil games, the dialogue is -- probably intentionally -- cheesy, but that's about all this game has going for it.			"

												Pros: 1. Learn how the BSAA was created in a story featuring Chris & Jill.2. Raid mode with lots of unlockables as per RE tradition.3. Creepy (but dorky) effects, esp. the comms officer. Cringe!4. Keyboard & mouse works well in this game, I'd recommend for aiming alone.5. End boss is a really fun fight. The RE designers know their boss fights.Cons:1. Graphics are subpar by 2015 standards, but still plenty atmospheric.2. Offline campaign co-op was removed from this version, which is really stupid.3. FOV is bad, I highly recommend the widescreen fixer solution. See guides.4. Terragrigia levels seemed bad/rushed, looks like a ps2 game in those levels.5. There is nobody online playing raid mode :(Overall: 8/10, main thing holding it back is its graphics but this is a good new-ish direction for the RE franchise. The PC version is probably the best version, after trying the PS3 version I noticed the huge performance gap especially in rainy scenes where the PS3 drops frames bad.			"

												An HD Port of an early 3DS release, Resident Evil Revelations ended up being a much more faithful representation of the franchise as a whole than it's widely panned console brethren Resident Evil 6.While RE: Revelations was originally advertised as a sort of prequel to Resident Evil 5, about all is shares with the previous title is it's main protagonists, Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, and their current positions as field agents of the counter bioterrorism NGO BSAA.Revelations brings subtle improvements to RE5's controls, in particular the oft requested ability to strafe, and includes new functionality such as equipment tuning.  Weapons are now socketed equipment able to hold a number of custom components that augment their performance, these components effects range from higher magazine capacity to greater damage output and faster firing rates, among other more unique effects I'll let you discover.Revelations also features the Genesis system.  The Genesis is a handheld scanner not far off from Metroid Prime's scan visor, and quickly proves to be just as useful, allowing the player to locate easter eggs, hidden items, research dead enemies for healing items, and so forth.  The downside is you'll end up spending quite a bit of time behind the Genesis HUD, which can deflate the horror athmosphere for some.The story of Revelations brings the series back to it's zany horror roots, this time mixed with a bit of old school Ace Combat crazy.  Some time after the fictional island utopia of Terragrigia is laid waste by solar sattelite weapons, Jill and Chris find themselves on opposite sides of the globe following the trail of a bioterrorism organization named Veltro, with Jill's search bringing her to an abandoned cruise liner named the Queen Zenobia.  In Resident Evil tradition things quickly go off the rails for both, and the story becomes a globetrotting race against time to unearth the plans of whomever, or whatever, has taken residence on the doomed ship.The story also spends a significant amount of time fleshing out the BSAA and the people who work there,  and the game occasionally puts the player in control of a few of Jill and Chris' fellow agents following up on leads the former have discovered.  It provides an interesting look at an organization that has become the series sucessor to the ill fated S.T.A.R.S. unit of the first game.Graphically the HD upgrade makes the game somewhat above average in visual polish, and a few bland environment textures notwithstanding it looks pretty good for an uprezzed 3DS game.  The character models can be slightly off, Jill's being the most noticable, it would have been nice if the character models and full motion video cutscenes had an upgrade pass as well.Revelations has several other flaws, the transition to PC has led to some glaring omissions such as the lack of the laser sight present on it's handheld counterpart.  It would have also been nice if the PC upgrade could have had an increase in enemy variety, as most of the undead creatures you'll be facing on the Zeonbia share the same general design.  None of these issues are gamebreaking, however.  And while the game does feature on rails sequences, they're nowhere near the frequency and general unplayability found in those of Resident Evil 6.Bottom line, this is an incredibly successful if somewhat flawed transition from handheld to PC.  And even for those who can't agree on whether Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 4 are the pinnacle of the series, there's something for everyone to enjoy.  So if you're a fan of Resident Evil or Survival Horror, you can't go wrong with Resident Evil Revelations.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations / Biohazard Revelations seems like a new game but it was released in 2012 on the Portable gaming platform that is the 3DS and then, a year later, on the XB360, PS3, Wii U and naturally, PC. The game itself was surprisingly decent. I had a whole lot of fun with it and a little piece of advice, the game plays way better with the Keyboard + Mouse scheme (a word of advice though, disable the mouse acceleration though!). With the XB360 gamepad, the aiming was all jerky and you end up missing so many shots.As for the game itself, it was so much superior to the pathetic Resident Evil 6 which in my opinion was one of the worse RE game ever made. But this one, RE: Revelations, redeemed itself well enough in its atmosphere setting, the gameplay mechanics, voice acting and even the music department.To make it short, this is the game RE6 should have been but wasn't unfortunately!For a ported game, the only big noticeable CON would be the graphical and visual side of the game.PROS: +Ghost ship horror atmosphere.+Decent campaign length.+Neat characters models (well modelized, especialy Jill's Azz!).+""Auto-sufficient"" A.I. (partner manage itself so no need to run at him/her to heal).+Nice soundtrack.+Replay value with the Raid Mode or if you seek achievements completion.CONS:-Awful textures.-Weak controls with XB360 gamepad.-Messy story.-Weak A.I. but helpful at times as it brings the enemies to itself.-Limited enemy variety (same monsters that you see all game long).-No chapter replay option in the main campaign.-You cannot run... like, what the hell is that?-No puzzles.-This is no ""survival horror"" game like we used to play on the early RE games and keeps the game into the ""action horror shooter"" mode.RECOMMENDATION:Decent port to say the least! If you're a Resident Evil fan, you'll enjoy this game for sure! If you're a new comer, you may want to play earlier titles since you'll be really lost in this game, story speaking!PS. The extra DLC doesn't add much to the gameplay. If you can skip it, do so! It is not really worth it in my opinion!RATING:7.5 / 10			"

I love 4, enjoy 5 and pretty much hate 6 but game a chance to Revelations and I gotta say Im surprised this is an 8 hour long game considering it was for the 3DS and even more shocked at how the game actually made an effort going back to its core and it did. Really great Resident Evil game, I would recommend it for everyone.PROS:-Great story-It's actually survival not a shooter-Game is not easy-Reminds you of the police station from RE2-It's not 4 hours long.CONS:-Replay value is not that great-Little weapon arsenal choice from first walktrough-Could have better voice acting for the new characters			"

Visuals and story seemed quite passable but then I could'nt get pass the laughable script and embarrassingly awkward dialog between the cast. The small sections of action sequences again seemed enjoyable from what I could gather inbetween the flood of cut scenes. It's a shame this game doesn't known what its trying to be.If you're into the Resident Evil universe and can live with all the issues this game definitely has, sure go for it but other wise give this a miss. There's nothing new here, its just Capcom rehashing their same old Resident Evil 4 formula. Surely we've moved on, upgraded graphics can't keep patching the gaping holes forever.			"

												This game is actually a decent game, but it resembles perfectly what the Resident Evil franchise morphed into over the years, and what Capcom actually wanted it to be: a game that appeals to new comers, while keeping the fan base happy. They wanted to play it safe, rather than attempt to make the masterpiece 10/10 game they once used to do. It brought some elements from the original Resident Evil, such as using the tanker as an analogue to the Spencer mansion of the first game, and elements from Resident Evil 4, such as using few parts of the games as battle arenas to shoot waves of zombies and go through near death experiences, and they got some Call of Duty elements from the inferior Resident Evil 6 game, such as Chris and Jill fighting hordes of enemies while finding easily accessible ammos and health when needed.The tone of the game is not horror, like the Resident Evil Remake, nor is it camp, like the second half of Resident Evil 4, but rather it was mostly like watching a T.V. action series such as 24. And just like T.V action series, they replay highlights of the earlier chapters to stay updated on the overall plot when playing the next chapter or when returning to the game later. They really wanted to take the story seriously, when the canon of Resident Evil really wasn't great to begin with. They could've had a basic story to create a scenario, rather than attempt to make the story the central theme of the game. At least this games had a better story than all of the other Resident Evil games (I am serious), but it is still not great, though.The game is fun when playing the Jill segments in the tanker. It looks like the traditional survival horror Resident Evil game that Capcom could've made if they wanted to go back to the original Resident Evil formula. Unfortunately, there are many times when the game cuts away to another character in another location, turning into a pure action segment, breaking the immersion immediately for me.My other problem is that the game is too easy. I know there is a hard mode, but I started the game out with Normal, and thought that Normal would have a bit of challenge. I didn't die as much as I thought I would. I died 12 times, and of the 12 times, I think six or seven of them are either cheap deaths or because of dumb mistakes.I recommend playing this game, especially if you want to take the taste of Resident Evil 6 out of your mouth, and hope for a better Resident Evil. As for me hoping for a better Resident Evil, this game showed me what Capcom is going to do with the franchise: play it safe, and don't make something spectacular like the remake or RE 4.			"

												As a fan of the resident evil games I really enjoyed this game. The story of RE:Revelations fits right in between RE4 and RE5.Throughout the main campain it switches characters and environments for each chapter, and that variance makes it fun, even tho there aren't many enemy types. There are some cool enemies but that's it. Even in the hardest difficulty, the story campain can be pretty easy, apart from some boss fights.The raid mode gives the game some replayability, even tho I found raid mode really boring.The graphics are ok, nothing too impressive. (We can finally watch Jill fat♥♥♥♥♥in FULL HD!)I recommend this game if you like resident evil / zombies / TPS / sexy ladies in revealing wet suits.			"

												being a 3DS port I was reluctant to play it, but as a dedicated fan of the series I felt obligated to give it a shot - and I was pleasantly surprised.the upscaling from 3DS to PC is actually damn impressive.  it's good enough by last gen standards, and sure it has some glitches and bugs here and there, but nevertheless pretty solid.  the storyline is dumb, but this RE doesn't really take itself all that seriously: from the ""previously on..."" segments between episodes, to the ridiculous female wetsuit attire and banter between characters.  with that said, playing through the multiple character arcs is a fun way to stretch out the limited gameplay and keep it fresh.worth picking up during a sale.8 Jill sandwiches / 10			"

												Believe it or not, this game is the best survival resident evil game since the 4th change the series. I love 4, enjoy 5 and pretty much hate 6 but game a chance to Revelations and I gotta say Im surprised this is an 8 hour long game considering it was for the 3DS and even more shocked at how the game actually made an effort going back to its core and it did. Really great Resident Evil game, I would recommend it for everyone.PROS:-Great story-It's actually survival not a shooter-Game is not easy-Reminds you of the police station from RE2-It's not 4 hours long.CONS:-Replay value is not that great-Little weapon arsenal choice from first walktrough-Could have better voice acting for the new characters			"

												This was the first RE game I've played (and finished), having watched a number of RE gameplay vids. However, going in blind to this game, I've found this game rather fun. The jumpscares aren't too strong, the aiming is a lot smoother than I remember, and you're not left feeling completely alone and unassisted, as you occasionally continue getting chatter over radio and a buddy you don't have to babysit usually by your side.Not only that, you can somewhat run this game just fine on a toaster with a few settings nicked down. It's a pretty good sale, I feel. Story's a bit weakish, but I this is coming from someone who just decided to buy an RE game because it was on sale.			"

												First - There is no story coop mode like in RE5 and RE6. I was a bit disappointed in that. Raid mode is the only thing that is coop and it plays through the exact same levels as the single player  just with the story stripped out and more enemies tossed in. But in order to play Raid mode in the fullest, you have to complete the single player - both players.... Normally I would be fine with that, but not all my friends have the time to play the single player and just want to play coop. Besides that as my major complaint, the game is pretty good. I think RE6 is a better buy for coop though. This game has RPG elements that add a lot of replay value. Your character levels up as you progress in Raid mode. Even as you level up, the stages will level with you keeping the challenge all the way up to level 50. If you enjoy coop, zombies that really are not zombies, and RPG games, grab this. Just be aware if you want to play coop, you have to beat the campaign first.			"

												With no pulled punches for the fact this game was made for 3DS because it's the story that's at fault here.  It's a good game otherwise.I played on PC with and Xbox360 controller and the game worked just fine.  it seems well made: there are no bugs that I can think of and no real problems with the controls beyond my own failings; however, the game betrayed me as a lover of the Resident Evil series.  The game goesn't respect its enemies and it doesn't respect its own story.On multiple occasions this game goes out of its way to trivialze the enemies presented by either not acknowledging them  various trash, shield boss, giant tentacle B.O.W.  or by resuing bosses as common fodder.  The combat is in no way difficult and the hardest difficulty makes up for it by being extremely bullet spongey.Story wise, it's a complete drama bomb.  I'm surprise that Jill didn't reveal that she was having Parker's alien baby via virgin birth, but there's always next time.  Half of it makes sense, half of it if I""m being generous.  It just dropped conspiracy on top of me and expected me to roll with it, well good try but no.Characters know things that they shouldn't.  Example:  Chris/Jessica RUSH to Jill's location (that you the player know but not them) during a time of great urgency (that you the player know about but not them).  It's an attempt to build suspense without a real effort.  It's lazy writing and the game does it repeatedly.Characters are overly obvious about their intentions.  Example:  Jessica asks out of nowhere if you trust her.  Raymond reveals himself to Jill/Parker on the ship.   Serious, lazy writing like this makes me feel like I'm watching Dora the Explorer.Character actions do not match their intended results.  I cannot stress this one enough.  The absolute laziness of this one is close to hurting my brain.  It's a cheap attempt at a dramatic plot twist.  Examples:  Raymond reveals Jessica as the mole, but he's actually on her side.  Raymond starts to give a very vague speech and Jessica shoots him in the bulletproof vest to stop him revealing information... it's obviously planed but WHY?!  O'brain puts BSAA on infected ship for evidence on Lansdale but Raymond is already there.  Lansdale wants to eliminate ALL evidence but does so by sinking one of three ships.   There's so much more, it's everywhere seriously.The point: a game can drama bomb all it wants to but if it doesn't make an effort to make those bombs meaningful then I might as well have been shooting Spongebob zombies while riding a My little Pony only to be surprise to find out the Spongebob zombies were made by Dr. Gero all in an effort to make Vegeta's heart grow three sizes that day.  The My little Pony? It's obviously because of the new T-C-A-Veronica-Abyss-Dante's-Naruto virus.			"

												This game is actually a decent game, but it resembles perfectly what the Resident Evil franchise morphed into over the years, and what Capcom actually wanted it to be: a game that appeals to new comers, while keeping the fan base happy. They wanted to play it safe, rather than attempt to make the masterpiece 10/10 game they once used to do. It brought some elements from the original Resident Evil, such as using the tanker as an analogue to the Spencer mansion of the first game, and elements from Resident Evil 4, such as using few parts of the games as battle arenas to shoot waves of zombies and go through near death experiences, and they got some Call of Duty elements from the inferior Resident Evil 6 game, such as Chris and Jill fighting hordes of enemies while finding easily accessible ammos and health when needed.The tone of the game is not horror, like the Resident Evil Remake, nor is it camp, like the second half of Resident Evil 4, but rather it was mostly like watching a T.V. action series such as 24. And just like T.V action series, they replay highlights of the earlier chapters to stay updated on the overall plot when playing the next chapter or when returning to the game later. They really wanted to take the story seriously, when the canon of Resident Evil really wasn't great to begin with. They could've had a basic story to create a scenario, rather than attempt to make the story the central theme of the game. At least this games had a better story than all of the other Resident Evil games (I am serious), but it is still not great, though.The game is fun when playing the Jill segments in the tanker. It looks like the traditional survival horror Resident Evil game that Capcom could've made if they wanted to go back to the original Resident Evil formula. Unfortunately, there are many times when the game cuts away to another character in another location, turning into a pure action segment, breaking the immersion immediately for me.My other problem is that the game is too easy. I know there is a hard mode, but I started the game out with Normal, and thought that Normal would have a bit of challenge. I didn't die as much as I thought I would. I died 12 times, and of the 12 times, I think six or seven of them are either cheap deaths or because of dumb mistakes.I recommend playing this game, especially if you want to take the taste of Resident Evil 6 out of your mouth, and hope for a better Resident Evil. As for me hoping for a better Resident Evil, this game showed me what Capcom is going to do with the franchise: play it safe, and don't make something spectacular like the remake or RE 4.			"

												With this game I have to say that Capcom made some progress to return the series to it's former glory. I hope this was a wake up call for them, it's a small step in the right direction. It makes me exited to see what will happen to Resident evil in the future because it seems to look a little brighter. Anyhow the game is good and older RE fans will feel more at home with this one than the most recent installments. But there were some things that could have been better gameplay wise but it's understandable since it is a port of a 3ds game. Another thing I want to mention is that the game is pretty short for being a RE game, took me about 6-7 hours to finish while RE 4 took me like 14+ hours to finish. I think it's a good resident evil game and definetly shows that Resident Evil has potential to become perhaps the best survival horror series again even if it might take some time for it to happen.

												It's been a while since the last time I played the RE that could completely gratify me.Some day, after being disappointed by the RE6, I heard that the RE R excluded by the 3DS would be released on the PC platform, I felt excited but also confused, because I didn't know whether this new RE could express the true meaning of the RE. However, as a fan of the RE, I still pre-purchased it before the day it was released. Thank god, I felt really satisfied by the first time I played the game. The atmosphere it created in the story mode was similar to the one in the old RE , suddenly, it reminded me of the day I play RE 3 with my best friend in Primary school....Tears really burst out at that moment.....The story of this RER is also good and reasonable, it perfectly complements the blank between RE4 and RE5, so we can know about the origin of the anti-Bioterrorism organinzation BSAA. Although this game's story mode is awsome, it still has some shortages. It doesn't inherit the Gun-carrying system from the RE5 and I take that as a great pity. Because it will make the game more realistic when the characters carry the gun they don't use on their back. It feels weird when i see the characters grap their gun from the air. But this is just a small shortage, I still recommend this game to you guys.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations is a great port from the 3DS version. Each level is played in episodes, with 1-3 levels per episode. A customization engine is added in for each gun you acquire that is implemented in both the story and raid modes. Speaking of Raid Mode, it is a great feature in this game. With 1-2 to players, the heroes trek through levels and fight off against foes with set levels, and extra buffs (ie. stronger attacks, take less damage, etc.) You will level up, unlocking more weapons, mods, and upgrades for yourself. I highly reccomend this game as it really does well in bringing back that claustrophobic feel from Resident Evil 1 while maintaining the over the shoulder perspective. I also reccommend finding a friend for raid mode as you'll want someone who's got your back, as well as someone you can communicate with.			"

												my favorite and the best RE title to date. my view at least.played it alread 4 times and still enjoy it. sure its not scary horror but good enough to make you feel a tiny bit uncomfortable. especially when you have no gun at one stage. also, some rooms and hallways are creepy.at least you dont face huge hords of enemies as in part 4, 5 and 6. plus you have to conceive ammo. the story is nothing fancy either but which RE title now had it really. as the title indicates, something gets revealed with a little twist of the characters you encounter.  you play mainly as jill, so as chris, new comer parker and some other new guy i forgot his name now. as always you have some boss battles, each of them being different to fight. you can see on the graphics that it has been ported, that some textures are blurry and has some ruff edges. never the less, it looks good and the PC port as such, is well done. the controls feel smooth, it displayes the PC buttons and the mouse works flawlessly. you can sidewalk which is all fine, but when you run and sidewalk, your character slows down. its not like its a huge problem in the game but it does feel awkward when you run and fighting off some faster moving enemies.certainly worth the money. especially if you want to play as jill again which i always wanted to.

												If you are a fan of RE 4 and 5 then I would I highly recommend you pick up this game, when its on sale for $20 or less. Revelations mostly takes place on a ship,which makes the game feel claustrophobic with its small corridors. Since the ship has few space, a dodge mechanic is in place which lets you dodge an enemy by moving forward or back right before they attack. It takes some time getting used to, but it is incredibly useful once you mastered it. A scanner is introduced as well, and lets you scan your surroundings for herbs, ammo, custom parts, and fingerprints(collectible that unlock the PSG-1 sniper for Campaign use). As for the gun/upgrade/inventory/system you can find custom parts,which upgrade your guns like 10% increased damage,15% increased fire rate, and some more exotic ones like charged shot, or do more damage the lower your health is. You can carry up to 3 weapons and have up to 25-30 weapons in your inventory. However you can’t purchase any guns in campaign, you have to find them so this encourages the player to explore for better weapons. One change I noticed was in movement, in previous resident evil games you have to stay in one position to reload, while in revelations you can reload on the go. The movement also appears to be slower than in previous games, probably because the devs want you to dodge instead of running away. As for the story theres nothing really exceptional here, and the dialogue is mostly bearable to cheesy at times.It took me about 10 hours to beat the campaign, and when you do theres a new game plus mode which can also carry over your weapons to the next difficulty. Theres an additional mode called Raid mode, which makes the game way more fun. You play on stages, which are unlocked in the campaign, as JIll, Chris,Parker, and other characters you unlock. The objective is simple you get from point A to B,look for a key, or beat a Boss. Enemies characteristics are more varied here than in the campaign. You'll face the same type of enemies except some will be more faster,  stronger, bigger, do more damage, have a bigger hit radius, or just have more health. Combine that with rpg elements like gun drops, rare weapons, and a leveling up system and you have an addicting and incredibly fun mode. Characters you unlock also have specific focuses, like Jill reloads handguns and Machine guns faster and has a faster fire rate,While Rachel regenerates health, and reloads faster with shotguns and magnums. When you complete a stage you get BP which you can use to purchase weapons, ammo, herps, custom parts, and ammo capacity in the raid store . Selling weapons you no longer need for BP is also a nice option.You can get even more BP if you finish a level without taking damage, defeating all the enemies, and being under the recommended level. I've had so much fun with it I would recommend the game solely on Raid mode. I would also recommend a gamepad for this game 360 worked just fine for me. As for performance I have an i5 3230m,8 g of RAM, and an Intel HD 4000 card and it ran very smoothly (except when you’re on elevators the frame rate drops for some reason) besides that no crashes or problems whatsoever.

												Let me start with that raid is a fun addictive mode that feels like a mix between mercenaries and missions. The story feels more slow paced like older resident evils which is good since it has a more horror feel to it. Part of of the story and raid mode levels do make you struggle with ammo shortage what all helps making it a better experience. When the game is discounted it's certainly worth buying it.			"

												I've been a life long Resident Evil fan and I am among the few who have enjoyed the more action oriented games they've released. There are a lot of things about this game that brings you back to the classics but It still has that modern Resident Evil game play. Personally I preferred 6 but I would gauge this game higher than 5. It's no wonder they brought this game from the 3DS to console and then PC. Strongly Recommend.			"

												Really surprised how good this turned out to be. Exceeded my expectations by a mile and is definitley a breath of fresh air after the awfulness that is Resident Evil 5 and 6 (and numerous other installments in the series). Revelations has shades of the older style Resident Evil games and that is a very good thing. The single player campaign is fun and exciting and there is also an added on mode for multiplayer that definitley deserves to be checked out (if you find a friend to play with). The only downside I thought of was that there is no co-op mode for the campaign mode.			"

												I kept hearing hype around this game about how its so much like the old Resident Evil that I was really excited for this game. I was really quite disappointed in that reguard. Don't get me wrong, the game is fun. It just feels more like a cross-production of 3 and 4 both of which were definitely not my favorites. I don't like Raid mode all that much, the only reason I play it is for the alternate costumes and the fact that I get to use Keith. The bottom line is, it didn't feel like a survival game, let alone a horror game, Raid mode is...arlight. If you're a Resident Evil fan play it, if you're at this as a new fan trying to get into RE, try the remake of 1, or 6 because 6 has much better replay value.			"

												Fan might know before playing, that revelations told series of event before Resident Evil 5 took place in africa.Yet, Unlike RE5 that emphasize action, capcom's revelations clearly accentuate their ability to combine classic gameplay with modern 3rd person shooting.If you are a big fan of RE previous installments and you like to feel alone in confined space. This game will be your bread and butter.And for people who already complete the campaign, capcom provide additional challenges through raid mode.For me, raid mode probably the most valuable gem this game had to offer. You can play multiplayer, collect weapon a la borderlands, add mods to enhance them, and many more. I spent 8/10 of my gameplay time on raid and i must say it is REALLY satisfying.In the end, i recommend this game for anyone who never played RE before. You are not going to regret buying this game.And for you fan of RE ? I dont think this review matter for you guys. You probably already ""add to cart"" this game a minutes ago.			"

												Amazing RE4 style game with a lot of elements from the classics including some genuine terror and key collection to progress. The story is probably the the most entertaining (certainly most convoluted besides maybe 6) in the RE franchise and most of the new characters are a welcome addition to the cast. The episode style setup may please some and be an annoyance to others. I really didnt enjoy the ""next time on RE Revelations"" between episodes, Im playing the game, ""I'll find out in the next few minutes without you telling me what is next!"" If you enjoyed Resident Evil, RE4 especially, and action/horror games, this is a must play.			"

												You may of heard that the Resident Evil Series is dead. In some degree that is true but after playing this game I have a different opinion. Resident Evil Revalations was actually my first 3DS game and I was hooked. The Graphics were mind blowing, the action was fun and the game was actually pretty damn scary. There were times where I would close my 3DS so that I can catch my breath after a terrifying scare. When I had beaten the game I gave an applause to Capcom for making this astounding game. The problems I had with this game was the lack of character development and horrible controls. Because I didn't have the dual stick attachment for my 3DS, my rules of engagment was to stop and shoot. Even though all Resident Evil games before Resident Evil 6 had this sort of control scheme, the game was sometimes really hard because you were surrounded by fast moving enemies.However thanks to this port I can now play the game with modern controls with very little trouble. While the port is a bit buggy (much like every other Japenese ports) Capcom really gave it their best with more content, a well done reskin and of course new and improved controls.While game could still be better in a lot ways in terms of its horror mechanics, you can tell that Capcom has started to listen to their true fans and are on the right path to resurect the series to its undead roots.

												This game is fun, it's not as scary as everyone says it is though. It is scary in the begining but then starts switching you to diffrent characters in diffrent locations, this is bad for two reasons it doesn't make you feel traped in the other enviroment like the mansion in the first game, and these parts are more action based. Even the scary enviroment starts not being scary when you get more weapons and they start having less slow bulky enemies and more fast ones and ones that shoot projectiles.			"

However if you played it on the 3DS there is nothing really new here yet, but with dlc on the way we will see what new goodies are added. This game is just the right amount of balance between action and survival horror with it a lot more on the survival horror side of things. Visuals are much improved over the 3DS and it supports controller and mouse+keyboard inputs. Finally it has the best female protagonist EVER, Jill Valentine.			"

												Despite being a die-hard Resident Evil fan since the PS1/Raccoon City days, RE6 left a bit of an unpleasant taste in my mouth in certain aspects. Revelations easily makes up for that misfire by taking a step back and putting once more on display what made the original series so great: a memorable soundtrack, an eerie atmosphere, and a story that kept my attention at all times. The real downside is the short length of the story, but it's understandable since the game was originally meant for the Nintendo 3DS a year and a half ago.			"

												The PC version is the best way to play this game. Keyboard & mouse controlls work flawlessly and remove the famous ""tank controls"" factor because it's much easier to control. The game runs at a smooth 60fps. Revelations is the best Resident evil since 4; It scary in some parts, but campy most of the time (which is still enjoyable and funny). The game is true survival horror; you are put in many unique situations which require you to struggle to stay alive and it feels good when you DO manage to survive. The art direction is great; color, lighting and motion are used very well to set a particular mood.			"

												The short of it: Not as good as RE4The main gripe I have with this game compared to RE4 is that RE4 had a great combat system, everything was very deliberate and it was very clear what the enemies attacks were, as well as what your capabilities were, and RE4 also had an amazing locational damage system, enemies reacted in heaps of different ways depending on where you shot. In this one, however, all these slimy-looking piranha people all react pretty much the same way when shot; they don't (with the exception of looking like they're tired for a bit so you can go up and kick them in the face, but triggering that is unreliable). There are positives though, the movement system is much more fluid and the weapon upgrade system (in my opinion) is better, in RE4 you had to spend money to upgrade your weapons but in this you find weapon parts and can swap them out. Raid mode is pretty fun, however having to play through the story by yourself to unlock the stages for raid mode so you can play them with a partner is a bit stupid. Overall, it's worth playing, but not worth paying $50 for.			"

												So I am a huge fan of all things RE, but I am sad to say this is starting to be a dying plot and style of game. If you have played all or any of the RE titles you will, if you are like me, want to play this just to satisfy that OCD ""I need to play all the RE titles"" itch. If you are new to RE, I have to say this one certainly seems to harken back to RE1 in many ways, so you can get that first time ""like a virgin"" RE experience.  Unfortuantely, the graphics also harken back to RE1.The Cons: They took out typewriters and went to autosave with this title, and I believe 4-5 (but I don't remeber). I miss being able to run back and save whenever I had the typewriter ribbons to do so. The developers are still relying on graphics from ten years ago, complete with hair that doesn't move and looks like it is being held frozen in space and time with a whole vat of hair gel. Fans of shooters of any sort are going to be extremely frustrated with this game because the hit boxes are just flat out off in some sequences. More than a few times I have been shooting point black at something and not hitting, or the real annoyance is when you go through a door fully prepraed to fire at the creature behind it and it lags for no apparent reason. This game was clearly designed for cotnrollers and the lack of kb commands is a little annoying. I swear these are the slowest running characters in any RE game to date. There is no sprint, and dodge is about as clunky as it has always been in RE games. I don't like the TV show aspect of this game and especially the ""Previously on RE Revelations"" cut scenes. I also don't like the fact that it takes you out of the atmospheric settings to do flashback sequences to ""previous episodes.""The Pros:Very cool atmosphere when you are on the ship. Kind of hard to believe they haven't done a ghost ship setting for RE till this one. Despite what some other reviewers have commented on, this game hasn't been about zombies since RE4 and frankly I like that. Zombies were great back in Raccoon City, but the story has well evolved past the zombie genre over the last several years and this game carries on with the whole mutant flesh creature scenarios. Once again we are dealign with two of the classic characters near and dear to all RE fans, Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine. I kind of feel like they are old friends, and it is nice to see some consistency in their return. This game actually does fill in some of the evolving storyline, and so far has not gone off the rails like RE3 and 4 did. So many RE titles seem to lose something in translation from Asian culture to English, but this one is relatively clear in plot and story. Even the voice acting is superior to some other RE tiltles ""looking at you RE 1-3.""Conclusion:If you are an RE fan get this game for the simple fact that it is a different setting. I liked RE 4 and 5 for the same reasons, and this one is supposed to take place between those two titles. This game is not, however, worth the list price of $50. That is way too much to spend on something that will more than likely be a trivial moment in passing in your gaming career. I caught it on sale for $12.50 on Steam and I was certainly happy enough with it for that price. I might even go as high as $25 for this game, but no more than that. You'll have some fun with it, cuss at it a lot, and you will remember what it was like when this series first emerged on the PS1 back in the 1990s. Those who are looking for graphics and pinpoint accuracy in shooting should probably look elsewhere as this game is not really a shooter, despite what some of the game propaganda says. I bought it and enjoy it simply for the fact that it is one of those game series I have been playing for about 20 years now, and the fact that RE pretty much set the bar for survival horror. Now, if someone would just bring back Dino Crisis I would feel like a kid again.			"

												A solid entry in the series, Reveleations starts off great and evokes the survival horror aspects of earlier RE games. However, those looking for pure survival horror (as I was) be warned: the game ditches the atmospheric scares half way through in favor of modern RE's fast-paced, action focused gameplay.While RE's modern approach is not necessarily a bad thing, it would be better contained to the game's fun and arcade-y Raid Mode. Ultimately Revelations' campaign should have remained methodical and atmospheric. Still, you can't go wrong picking this up. Despite its shortcomings in the second half it is one of the better (modern) RE games. I just wish the whole game let me play as Jill alone on a big scary ship.			"

												Ahh Revelations. This game is especially perfect for the people like myself who have only played RE 4-6. This game is very much mostly old school survival horror from the days of RE1-3 and very little emphasis on action, just mostly on throwbacks or on the side characters. Now to those who loved RE5-6 only for the co-op, you will not get co-op in the story but only in its other part, Raid Mode, which is very different to The Mercenaries in the recent entries. This game has a lot more weapon customization than RE6. Also be wise with your ammo as much as you can since you won't be able to melee as easy in this game compared to RE4-6. However, the story is on par to RE4-6 if not better since there is more common sense in the situations and to reasoning compared to RE6 especially. Well Raid Mode, all I'm gona say is that its really fun. If the game was 40 I would give the immediate recommendation and 8.5. but since its not the case, it gets an 8 from me, Well hope RE7 can be on point with this game and the upcoming survival horror game, The Evil Within, :).

												The single player is really fun  and the game si good step to bring back re to it survial horror roots. the game play is closer to re 4 and 5  if like those gameplay styles you will be right home with revalations. If hove some issues  that would be that the raid mode is kinda borring and as fun the merceneries mode form past titles at least imo, the other thing would be the main campain leght  its kinda short but  you have to take it to account that this a hd port of  3ds game.to sum up Re: Revelation is worth you time if looking for a fun single player exprince and i recomend it how ever i would recomend it geting for the lover price  like on steam sale  since the add the contend to this version of the game dosent really justify the full price.

												This game is absolutely amazing.  It's what the next generation of Resident Evil games really should be.  It mixes a perfect blend of classic key searching and ""horror"" intensity, with newer high-action elements.  Multiple characters to play, good story, custom weapons, and the RAID mode is incredible (it's sort of like Mercenaries, only more in-depth).  See what happened right before Resident Evil 5!  HIGHLY recommended!			"

												People have told me that Resident Evil is finally back to it's survival horror roots with this game. No. Don't believe it. It's more of Chris Redfield punching boulders and infinite reserves of ammo. That being said, it is an interesting addition to the series. I would rate it as slightly better than okay.			"

												A surprisingly commendable port on the technical side, RER is a pretty enjoyable action horror game that is 75% surprisingly tense exploration survival horror in a cruise ship setting as RE1 darling Jill Valentine, and 25% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t shooty bits in the snowy mountains of northern Finland as some other people.The 3DS roots are obvious in the low-poly models and environments, and M+KB controls make this a tad too easy on Normal, but everything runs silky smooth and that is a big plus.

												First thing first. The only real reason i would recommend this, is because i love the Resident evil universe. If you're not a fan of the series, don't even go there.Starting off with the good parts. The story is rather decent. The characters are as lovely as ever and the not-completely-linier-except-it-is idea is a fun diversion from the regularity in most RE games.I also liked the weapon upgrade system, gives a more changey feel and all choices are not permanent.Now to the bad parts, the *WEAPON UPGRADE SYSTEM* is not permanent and feels weird for a RE game...The *GRAPHICS* are sad, not as in bad but it gives a kindof dead feeling. The lighting is lighting up whole cupboards like it's a semi-budgettey game from the late 2000s. All textures who are about to move are semi-obvious to completely obvious.The game suffers from *EXTREME CONSOLITIES*. The graphics is one of the clues, the other is the aiming. Even though we remove the aim-help, it's still jumpy, You can't aim properly when you're getting close to a monster couse even though it's turned off, the aim-help seems to kick and and prevents any fast or small movements of the aim.THERE ARE NO REAL ZOMBIES! Just lots of weird blobby humanoids who are no fun trying to aim at with their wobbly heads and ♥♥♥♥ed up aiming.There are *NO SCARY SCENES* where you know you're about to get ♥♥♥♥ed but still try to make it out with key-combinations, even though the rest of the game is console-oriented, this part which is usually the more fun, and mostly hated, part of the RE games IMHO, is left out.*IT'S PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DODGE* it makes no sence that you have to time a turnabout to dodge, and you almost always dodge straight into whatever's trying to run into you.But i still played through the whole campaign, and i actually enjoyed it. So the story is a pretty big plus, even though i am quite sure most people will not agree with me on that part. There are quite a few things that does not make sence, RE wise, but i suppose it's still legit. I want to believe.			"

												I originally played this on 3DS, but I recently decided to check out this version since it was on sale and I'm cheap as heck sometimes. Anyways...Resident Evil Revelations is known for taking the series back to its survival horror roots, which it actually does. Although, I still prefer Resident Evil 4 (which I'll also have to try checking out the PC version of), but this is probably my 2nd favorite in the franchise.There's a bunch of plot twists, the enemies are sometimes decently challenging. I say sometimes since the 3DS version made me so used to standing while shooting, so this version feels like a walk in a park to me, except in that part where you have no weapons. Speaking fo which, I don't remember that B.O.W. being able to get its head out of the TV in the original version. Unless it was always like that and I'm just really fast when it comes to getting out of the room usually, nice touch.The gameplay mainly has a system of primary weapons (guns), secondary weapons (explosives), and a dodge system which is easily abused when you know what you're doing. I'm still a bit rusty at the dodging since I haven't used it in so long, but you can generally just move forward real quick with the right timing and completely avoid all damage.Ammo is scarce and enemies refuse to die, reserve ammo for when you need it. Either that, or just head shot everything. You could also knife everything or use your bombs. Yeah, those bombs have saved my lives many times. Especially the B.O.W. Decoys. Also, some bosses are down-right frightening at first. They aren't as scary the 2nd time through, though.....Except for the Com's Officer, he stops being scary for a while and then he shows you why you were scared with a nice chainsaw to the pelvis while a horde of undead fish people are coming to get you. I hate Com's Officer, but I also love him.			"

												I highly recommend this to anyone who liked the old Resident Evil days before 5 and 6. This one goes more to its roots with cliche lines with characters, weapons, story, and also it feels a lot like the Aarklay Mountains Mansion... even though you're on a giant ship. Enemies walk very strangely and headshots aren't exactly the best option to shoot all the time either for regular ""zombies"".Raid Mode is a great addition to the life of this game and is extremely fun with a friend.Campaign was done fairly well I thought it was good throughout but the ending was a little strange.Feels like the game is worth $30.00-$35.00 as opposed to its steep regular $50.00.

												A pleasant little callback to the older school of resident evil games before 4 came along and fully actionized them. The fact that this is a port from a 3DS release is actually kind of surprising because aside from some oft-repeated lines and animations the game looks quite good and gameplay is generally quite enjoyable. In classic resident evil style the story and characters are stupid as hell with some of the new characters being some of the most annoying I've ever seen in a video game (Parker's a cool guy, though). The combat relies heavily upon a dodge mechanic that's poorly explained and very, VERY fickle and the final boss is damn near impossible if you don't enter the fight with enough ammo. The game's real high point, however is the bonus ""Raid"" mode which is a neat little mix of mercenaries from the other games and a kind of time attack mode in which you speed through various sections of the story blasting away at a far larger assortment of enemies. It's challenging and highly varied and actually a real blast to play through, even though you have to suffer through the main storyline to fully unlock it. It combines a nice bit of skill, money management and what I guess could be called RPG elements. I can honestly say that I've put 10-15x more time into raid mode than into the main story and enjoyed it far more. If it wasn't included in the game this review would probably be a great deal more negative. One thing to note is that raid mode has a multiplayer component that makes it a great deal more enjoyable and is pretty much essential on the highest difficulty setting but unfortunately it seems to be more or less devoid of random public players so you may need to find a buddy who owns the game or check at the community hub. Overall the game is fairly enjoyable and inoffensive. The story mode is a great way to kill a few afternoons and raid mode is a great way to kill a few WEEKS if you get as addicted to it as I have but I absolutely don't recommend paying full price, I honestly can't say it's worth that much. Wait for it to be on sale for at least 50% off, even if you are really itching to play it.			"

												I first played this on the 3ds and it was one of my favourite games on the system which does actually have a fair few games I consider to be some of the best games of recent years. This game is a better Resident Evil than Resi 6 and it shows because this game had enough sales on the 3ds (a system that many still say is doomed) to warrant Capcom releasing for every other console. The graphics are improved from the 3ds version which had very nice graphics for a handheld. This game is also getting a sequel that is for some reason not being released on 3ds or Wii u but w/e.This is a good game and I would give it 7.5/10 as unlike previous Resi Evil games I find it hard to come back replay this one.

												You shoot fish zombies on a boat full of cramped corridors in a RE that is, in part, a throwback to the older games in the series. All in all,  lots of fun, recommended.Pros: Awesome ambience, bad voice acting and localization, no QTE boss battles, ridiculous and improbable conspiracy storyline, fish zombies that can take some hits, extremely tight controls, some jumpscares.  Con: Ending is weak. A lot of the environment gets re-used and there's a fair amount of backtracking. Could be longer.			"

												I was thoroughly surprised by this title. I picked it up while it was on sale after trying the demo, wasn't sure how much mileage I would get out of my purchase. But RESIDENT EVIL REVELATIONS is a solid title in the franchise.Though the gameplay is a bit hindered somewhat by the clunky dodge mechanic, it plays quite well; it's not as complicated as Resident Evil 6's gameplay mechanics, but is just as smooth, allowing you to strafe and move while aiming, and completely eliminates the need to menu surf for items. However, as I previously mentioned, the new dodge mechanic is clunky at best; to dodge an attack you have to move forward or back at a precise time to duck under a swing. It wouldn't be such a problem if a couple major bosses didn't rely so heavily on dodging. Otherwise you might find yourself crushed into a Jill sandwich.Gameplay aside, the story is entertaining albeit predictable. Roughly half the characters are well written and performed, but several new characters are quite badly done and can grate against the player's nerves. The atmosphere, though, is harrowing and claustrophobic, and the musical score is great.Several episodes in the game come up a little short, but I finished the game feeling satisfied.I recommend to survival horror and Resident Evil fans to give RESIDENT EVIL REVELATIONS a try.

												Resident Evil: Revelations is a departure from where the main, numbered series has been going, and the game works and is a fun, scary blast despite a few disappointments. The game takes place in between RE4 and RE5, but the storyline has nothing to do with the main series at all. Aside from a few characters (Jill, and Chris) and a few organizations mentioned (BSAA, Umbrella), everything is wholly original making this game a good standalone for those curious about the franchise. The story is all about spies, bio-terrorism, counter-terrorism, and attempts to go into some interesting psychology behind the villain's motivations but it falls a little flat. The story is told with that same goofy, almost-not-b-movie quality that has become the staple flavor for the series, and for a tale spanning countries with some really fun twists and turns that tone works surprisingly well. Couple that with the game's episodic chapters and it feels like you're watching a low-budget TV show from the 90s, and it's great.The gameplay really isn't anything too different than the rest of the series. It has an over the shoulder, third person perspective, shooting certain points on enemies will weaken them and allow you to melee them to great effect (I still think that Chris's fists are more powerful than shotgun blasts). For the majority of the campaign you have an AI partner following you around, ala RE5, except this partner doesn't need your healing items or ammo and can't be controlled by another player, which is actually an improvement for this game. Despite it's similarities to 5, the game actually made me frightened, which only the first game (the Gamecube remake) managed to do. The atmosphere is very well set up, and one of the main locations in the game requires back tracking, but it's done so well you feel like you're running hopelessly in circles. The most frightening, and challenging, part of the game actually has you search for a dead comrade, only to find she has been resurrected as a disgusted squid-mutant-lady, and you then have to hunt her throughout the games main setting, which is a creepy, derelict boat that sways slowly beneath your feet. This moment is when the game really, truly shines as you never know when she's going to pop out and scream in a girlish voice, ""found you!"" Unfortunately the rest of the game is nowhere near as scary, but it is a lot more tense than any of the resident evil games after the REmake and RE0. My disappointments in the game are minor, but still important. After defeating the squid-mutant-lady, non of the game's bosses are particularly challenging, but they are still fun to overcome. However the final boss made me so mad, because he requires almost no strategy to overcome, just a bit of quick timing, he has way too much health, and the fight just drags on. It was not fun for me, some people may enjoy it, but I didn't. Another complaint is that the game is a port from the Nintendo 3DS, which is actually quite amazing the 3DS could handle this game, but it shows. It's supposed to be an HD remake, and some textures are bumped up to a higher quality, but a lot aren't, and some of the level geometry gets blocky, and the ""hidden"" loading screens consist of doors with spinning wheels, you try to open the door, the wheel spins, and boom you go through. It sounds like a quick and easy way to get the game into small, bite sized chunks and remove loading screens, but I once had a door refuse to open for nearly five minutes (yes, I timed it) and ever since then I would groan when I realized my objective was on the other side of one of those blasted doors.Overall, this game is really good. I had a ton of fun with it, and despite it's few shortcomings it really is a fun game, I would recommend to anyone who wants a scary Resident Evil, and I would recommend for people curious about the series. On a scale of:  1) Avoid like the plague 2) Maybe you'll like it? 3) Not bad 4) Good 5) AmazeballsThis game would be a: 4) Good.			"

												An HD Port of an early 3DS release, Resident Evil Revelations ended up being a much more faithful representation of the franchise as a whole than it's widely panned console brethren Resident Evil 6.While RE: Revelations was originally advertised as a sort of prequel to Resident Evil 5, about all is shares with the previous title is it's main protagonists, Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, and their current positions as field agents of the counter bioterrorism NGO BSAA.Revelations brings subtle improvements to RE5's controls, in particular the oft requested ability to strafe, and includes new functionality such as equipment tuning.  Weapons are now socketed equipment able to hold a number of custom components that augment their performance, these components effects range from higher magazine capacity to greater damage output and faster firing rates, among other more unique effects I'll let you discover.Revelations also features the Genesis system.  The Genesis is a handheld scanner not far off from Metroid Prime's scan visor, and quickly proves to be just as useful, allowing the player to locate easter eggs, hidden items, research dead enemies for healing items, and so forth.  The downside is you'll end up spending quite a bit of time behind the Genesis HUD, which can deflate the horror athmosphere for some.The story of Revelations brings the series back to it's zany horror roots, this time mixed with a bit of old school Ace Combat crazy.  Some time after the fictional island utopia of Terragrigia is laid waste by solar sattelite weapons, Jill and Chris find themselves on opposite sides of the globe following the trail of a bioterrorism organization named Veltro, with Jill's search bringing her to an abandoned cruise liner named the Queen Zenobia.  In Resident Evil tradition things quickly go off the rails for both, and the story becomes a globetrotting race against time to unearth the plans of whomever, or whatever, has taken residence on the doomed ship.The story also spends a significant amount of time fleshing out the BSAA and the people who work there,  and the game occasionally puts the player in control of a few of Jill and Chris' fellow agents following up on leads the former have discovered.  It provides an interesting look at an organization that has become the series sucessor to the ill fated S.T.A.R.S. unit of the first game.Graphically the HD upgrade makes the game somewhat above average in visual polish, and a few bland environment textures notwithstanding it looks pretty good for an uprezzed 3DS game.  The character models can be slightly off, Jill's being the most noticable, it would have been nice if the character models and full motion video cutscenes had an upgrade pass as well.Revelations has several other flaws, the transition to PC has led to some glaring omissions such as the lack of the laser sight present on it's handheld counterpart.  It would have also been nice if the PC upgrade could have had an increase in enemy variety, as most of the undead creatures you'll be facing on the Zeonbia share the same general design.  None of these issues are gamebreaking, however.  And while the game does feature on rails sequences, they're nowhere near the frequency and general unplayability found in those of Resident Evil 6.Bottom line, this is an incredibly successful if somewhat flawed transition from handheld to PC.  And even for those who can't agree on whether Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 4 are the pinnacle of the series, there's something for everyone to enjoy.  So if you're a fan of Resident Evil or Survival Horror, you can't go wrong with Resident Evil Revelations.			"

												Resident Evil Revelations / Biohazard Revelations seems like a new game but it was released in 2012 on the Portable gaming platform that is the 3DS and then, a year later, on the XB360, PS3, Wii U and naturally, PC. The game itself was surprisingly decent. I had a whole lot of fun with it and a little piece of advice, the game plays way better with the Keyboard + Mouse scheme (a word of advice though, disable the mouse acceleration though!). With the XB360 gamepad, the aiming was all jerky and you end up missing so many shots.As for the game itself, it was so much superior to the pathetic Resident Evil 6 which in my opinion was one of the worse RE game ever made. But this one, RE: Revelations, redeemed itself well enough in its atmosphere setting, the gameplay mechanics, voice acting and even the music department.To make it short, this is the game RE6 should have been but wasn't unfortunately!For a ported game, the only big noticeable CON would be the graphical and visual side of the game.PROS: +Ghost ship horror atmosphere.+Decent campaign length.+Neat characters models (well modelized, especialy Jill's Azz!).+""Auto-sufficient"" A.I. (partner manage itself so no need to run at him/her to heal).+Nice soundtrack.+Replay value with the Raid Mode or if you seek achievements completion.CONS:-Awful textures.-Weak controls with XB360 gamepad.-Messy story.-Weak A.I. but helpful at times as it brings the enemies to itself.-Limited enemy variety (same monsters that you see all game long).-No chapter replay option in the main campaign.-You cannot run... like, what the hell is that?-No puzzles.-This is no ""survival horror"" game like we used to play on the early RE games and keeps the game into the ""action horror shooter"" mode.RECOMMENDATION:Decent port to say the least! If you're a Resident Evil fan, you'll enjoy this game for sure! If you're a new comer, you may want to play earlier titles since you'll be really lost in this game, story speaking!PS. The extra DLC doesn't add much to the gameplay. If you can skip it, do so! It is not really worth it in my opinion!RATING:7.5 / 10			"

												Resident Evil has long been a franchise close to my heart, which is why when i saw what capcom had done with 6 i felt horror of an entirely different kind. However after seeing revelations i knew all was not lost. It's far from perfect and doesnt make any attempts to reach for the lofty heights that 4 did. What it does is present an interesting mix between old and new, a collaboration of sorts between what it used to be and what it wants to become. Overall i still enjoyed the game for what it is now, alongside RAID mode (which is awesome) they bring back the replayability with extra unlocks for NG+ which is a welcome bonus. Any true fan owes it to themselves to play this game, as for the not so hardcore, if you had to pick beteween this and 6, this game wins everytime.			"

												Good game, not worth the stupidly high full price i got hit with.  Especially since 10 minutes after i bought it, it went on 75% off sale.  Talk about feeling stupid. Anything less that 49$ would have made this game worth it.  I also beat it in one sitting so, yea, its not very challenging either.  Puzzles are nothing like what I remember for the earlier games.  Too easy, no challenge and certainly nothing even resembling a puzzle.That said, it is a good game.  Its well crafted, well built and has its fun moments.  If you have to pay full price, forget it.  If you can get it cheap, worth a play through.  Most certainly start on hard, normal is too easy.  Its kinda sad really, i used to love the tense slow character of these games.  I liked the viewpoint from the older games and the tense quality the game used to bring to the table.  This was just a graphically nice FPS game with slower fire rates.			"

												It's a port of the 3DS game. Buy it when it's on sale. It's the closest thing to a Resident Evil game made in 10 years. Some parts are super spook. You mostly play as Jill's butt in a wetsuit taking up 20% of the screen, but most of the game you have people following your butt or you have to change butts for the story. It's way better than RE5. I'd place it between RE5 and RE4 in gameplay and say it's as scary as RE4(it has its moments), but it could have been way scarier if you didn't have followers.			"

												This game is fun, it's not as scary as everyone says it is though. It is scary in the begining but then starts switching you to diffrent characters in diffrent locations, this is bad for two reasons it doesn't make you feel traped in the other enviroment like the mansion in the first game, and these parts are more action based. Even the scary enviroment starts not being scary when you get more weapons and they start having less slow bulky enemies and more fast ones and ones that shoot projectiles.			"

Visuals are much improved over the 3DS and it supports controller and mouse+keyboard inputs. Finally it has the best female protagonist EVER, Jill Valentine.			"

In this game you will find of the things you love from the first 4 main games: runing from monster, not so much ammo, a place full of keys and objects that you need to find in order to continue, monster that sudently jump from a corner, etc. The technical aspect is average, it is obvious that this is a port from a handle console, as the textures, models and sounds are under the quality you would expect from a 2013 RE game. Maybe the game is a little pricy, but fans of the old RE games will love it.			"

												This game was... okay. I'd never gotten into the older RE games, and as I understand it this is sort of a call back to those. As a point of reference, I really enjoyed RE5. From a modern standpoint, this game gets a bit tedius due to lots of backtracking and running down the same hallways looking for keys and whatnot. The guns all feel pretty weak, which is unfortunate, and the dodge mechanic is garbage. The story is pretty convoluted, as expected, but it's alright. It was originally a DS game, so the graphics aren't really great by any stretch of the imagination, but they're functional.			"

												I highly recommend this to anyone who liked the old Resident Evil days before 5 and 6. This one goes more to its roots with cliche lines with characters, weapons, story, and also it feels a lot like the Aarklay Mountains Mansion... even though you're on a giant ship. Enemies walk very strangely and headshots aren't exactly the best option to shoot all the time either for regular ""zombies"".Raid Mode is a great addition to the life of this game and is extremely fun with a friend.Campaign was done fairly well I thought it was good throughout but the ending was a little strange.Feels like the game is worth $30.00-$35.00 as opposed to its steep regular $50.00.

												Campaign      really linear almost droll, but if you take your time it can be suspensful. The characters are the classic Jill cardboard and Chris cardboard. there are other characters they introduce into the story of resident evil such as parker, quint, keith, o'neal, veltro, jessica, rachel (barely), red hair dude (conan o'brian ripoff), and some other characters. The only one you atcually really care about is parker. parker is like a shadow of barry he acts like him. all in all the campaign was ok at best.Multiplayer       What do you get when you combine diablo 2 and gears of war. you get the multiplayer that is what revelations brings you. you and a friend or other player play through scenarios from the campaign while bumrushing through hoards of enemies. all to progress and make you guy better. there are different rarity's of weapons red being uber rare. also you are given the chance of upgrading weapons to a make of 30. the multiplayer is what this  game was made for. i will say this at the very least if you do not like grinding to make your character better, then i wouldn't suggest to get this game for multiplayer. please note after grinding sooo much you will see just how much of a difference you have made in your progress.

Drop that game on the PC with good ol mouse n keys, and HD graphics...well you get a kick♥♥♥♥♥game!The game oozes atmosphere everywhere, and most importantly Resident Evil atmosphere. The game play is spot on, delivering a fun-filled ooze blasting fest from beginning to end. I wish there were actual zombies in the game, but oh well!The most entertaining part of the game for me is the raid mode, which sets you in certain stages filled with enemies for you to dispatch. You level up and earn cash to buy and upgrade weapons. It's EXTREMELY fun.If you are interested in RE games at all, or though RE4 was pretty great, you will pretty much love this game. It really takes a step in the right direction for Resident Evil games. I can only hope they make another Revelations-esque entry into the franchise.			"

												While RE6 was a guilty pleasure, I can safely say this is a genuinely good Resident Evil game. There are a number of artifacts that remind you of this being a handheld port -- the episodic format mainly, but poor textures as well -- but this a step back towards RE4; less action, more survival horror.  Well, maybe not horror.  Nothing in this is scary, per se.  The weapon customization is excellent, and this game's arcade/mercenaries mode (called raid mode) is suprisingly good, being what I can only describe as a mini-campaign.  Raid mode is multiplayer if you want, the campaign is single player with an AI partner you'll barely notice because he does nothing and I'm pretty sure can't die at all.  The story is awful, but that's Resident Evil for you.  If you can get it on sale and liked RE4, you literally can't go wrong with this.			"

												It's Resident Evil. It has Jill and Chris. At first it feels too different and fast-paced but Revelations slowly sets off the nostalgia fireworks here and there.They used a different face model for Jill than the one seen (and loved) in Remake.Still - there's no way around this Biohazard.

												It's like RE4 but with Jill as a main protagonist... Well, almost like RE4... Anyway, much better than RE5 and RE6. A good return from stupid zombie shooter back to survival horror. Just like old times. Nice amount of weapons and bosses and playable characters. Everything is as it should be. No QTEs though, but I personally find them pretty annoying, so it's not a big loss IMHO. Good game for those who likes horrors in general and definately must-have for all RE fans.			"

												Fan might know before playing, that revelations told series of event before Resident Evil 5 took place in africa.Yet, Unlike RE5 that emphasize action, capcom's revelations clearly accentuate their ability to combine classic gameplay with modern 3rd person shooting.If you are a big fan of RE previous installments and you like to feel alone in confined space. This game will be your bread and butter.And for people who already complete the campaign, capcom provide additional challenges through raid mode.For me, raid mode probably the most valuable gem this game had to offer. You can play multiplayer, collect weapon a la borderlands, add mods to enhance them, and many more. I spent 8/10 of my gameplay time on raid and i must say it is REALLY satisfying.In the end, i recommend this game for anyone who never played RE before. You are not going to regret buying this game.And for you fan of RE ? I dont think this review matter for you guys. You probably already ""add to cart"" this game a minutes ago.			"

												I first played this on the 3ds and it was one of my favourite games on the system which does actually have a fair few games I consider to be some of the best games of recent years. This game is a better Resident Evil than Resi 6 and it shows because this game had enough sales on the 3ds (a system that many still say is doomed) to warrant Capcom releasing for every other console. The graphics are improved from the 3ds version which had very nice graphics for a handheld. This game is also getting a sequel that is for some reason not being released on 3ds or Wii u but w/e.This is a good game and I would give it 7.5/10 as unlike previous Resi Evil games I find it hard to come back replay this one.

												Resident Evil 6 was unfortunately a big let-down in the Survival Horror department, but Revelations is here to change that. It may be noticeable that it was once a game originally for the Nintendo 3DS, it's tense, sometimes scary, and the Queen Zenobia is an incredible place to explore. It may have a dumb story and half of the game consists of playing as other characters, but the sections that let you play as Jill Valentine exploring the ship alone is worth the price of entry. Also, should I mention RAID mode is a great new addition?			"

												When I heard that this game was getting a PC port I was extremely excited, since it was branded as a survival horror game that was true to the Resident Evil's of old, and frankly, the only Resident Evil games that I 100% enjoyed. This is somewhat true. The gameplay is a mix of what you find in Resident Evil 5 and 6, and what you find in the classic Resident Evil games. The over the shoulder camera is fine, boss fights are difficult, and ammo conservation exists, but only to the extent of Resident Evil 4, in the sense that conserving ammo never becomes a major problem because you always have more weapons. Backtracking, puzzles, and non-linear gameplay is also present, however the disappointment is the fact that all of this is present only in small amounts. There aren't many puzzles or doors that you can backtrack to, and when you do, you typically find that the contents inside are completely optional anyways. It was kind of a tease for me, but still better than the crap show that was Resident Evil 6.			"

												Fans who disliked Resident Evil 5 and 6 will find much more to like in Revelations, though it's still not the return to survival horror that many have been hoping for.   The game plays like a hybrid between Resident Evil 5 and the original Resident Evil, pairing the modern combat system with the cramped, atmospheric indoor settings of the older games; think of what the GameCube remake of RE1 would feel like with an over-the-shoulder camera and you're halfway there. The combination works so well that it makes one wonder why Resident Evil 4 abandoned so much of the classic gameplay in the first place.   The Queen Zenobia and its enemies are actually frightening (even if there aren't many of them) and the game often manages to build up genuine dread about the scenarios the player is in, something newer titles sorely lacked.  Ammo and health are also more limited, but not to the point of making Revelations a true survival horror game.   Unfortunately, the exploration still feels watered down compared to the older games with less backtracking and fewer puzzles to solve, but it's still far less linear than 4, 5, or 6.  Capcom can't seem to let go of action and Revelations is packed with a few over the top sequences, most of them occuring in chapters that jump to other characters outside of the Queen Zenobia.    These chapters break the immersion in the ship setting and feel like obligatory diversions from Jill's more interesting campaign, but they're brief enough to be excusable.   In general, the game feels like a broken up collection of moments from all across the series history, in both a good way and bad way- the dumbed down action rears its head once again, but the horror of the older games resurfaces to counter it, sometimes within the same chapter.   The campaign can be beaten in about 5-8 hours, a far cry from RE6's 40 hour duration.  Unlike most entries, Revelations does not include the Mercenaries mode to fill out the package, instead offering a new take called Raid mode.  Raid mode has much more in common with the original RE3 incarnation of Mercenaries in which the player would travel across a large, linear stretch of the single player game rather than fighting enemies in a closed arena.  It's generally fun and serves as a welcome break from tradition, but there are many odd choices that hinder the experience.For one, each weapon has its own level.  As the player collects xp from matches, they will be able to purchase higher and higher level weapons, which forces one to keep purchasing the same guns over and over each time they level up while simply discarding their old weapons (they can't be sold back).  This is already tedious, but the fact that the store randomly displays only a few guns at a time makes the process that much worse.  Trying to do something as simple as upgrade your pistol from a level 41 to 42 may require opening the shop 4 or 5 times until your handgun is displayed, and even then it may actually be a lower level than your current gun or it may inexplicably lack any item slots to equip perks to, forcing you to repeat the process until you find one that does.  Why in god's name they didn't use the system from RE4 and 5, letting the player keep and upgrade the same gun over time, is beyond me.  Online play is also tedious in that a level 50 player will have guns capable of killing enemies in single shot while a level 5 player will have to empty several clips to get the same effect.  To avoid a wild mismatch of power, high level players have to lower their level manually.   Considering that this must be done every time you play with a lower level player, it's hard to miss the straightforward simplicity of dropping into a Mercenaries match.  In terms of what's different from the 3DS release, there's not much worth mentioning- it's 95% the same and the few alterations are meaningless.  Even when maxed out, the game doesn't look good enough to make the 3DS version any less impressive, and the loss of 3D may even give the original  the advantage.  To put it bluntly, it's absolutely not worth upgrading if one already has the 3DS version. Revelations isn't perfect, but it's hard to complain when the game gets so much closer to the classic RE gameplay than the newer installments.  It's certainly worth picking up, but don't expect it to solve all of the series' problems and don't forget it's origins as a more limited handheld game.			"

It is how RE5, 4 ,3 ,2, and 1 should been if 5 4 3 2 and RE 1 were to be remade for current GEN. Storyline, I don't care much for storyline because I hated this stroyline honesty. Revelation is what happened before Chris and Jill went to the masion and got their♥♥♥♥♥handed to them by Wesker, thus RE 5 happens. I miss the shooting zombies.... well wait... Capcom had never made a true zombie survior horror games that were 3rd person. Sure there were the old camera view but we need a true 3rd person view and I""M NOT TALKING ABOUT RE RACCON CITY. Raid is second best to RE5 mercenaries with the add on gun parts and such... worth the money alone. Buy it for RAID co op but there are no storyline coop.			"

												Revelations is an attempt to take Resident Evil back to its horror roots while still mantaining the action aspect the franchise has become known for since Resident Evil 4. Overall this attempt is successful and Revelations hits somewhere between Resident Evil 1 and Resident Evil 4.The game has a ton of content and the single player campaign is very meaty, the multiplayer Raid mode is fun but the strength of the game is the single player.The DLC is mostly worthless and should be avoided.The PC port runs well and even though this game is ported from the 3DS graphics are still pretty nice.

												Resident Evil: Revelations is a departure from where the main, numbered series has been going, and the game works and is a fun, scary blast despite a few disappointments. The game takes place in between RE4 and RE5, but the storyline has nothing to do with the main series at all. Aside from a few characters (Jill, and Chris) and a few organizations mentioned (BSAA, Umbrella), everything is wholly original making this game a good standalone for those curious about the franchise. The story is all about spies, bio-terrorism, counter-terrorism, and attempts to go into some interesting psychology behind the villain's motivations but it falls a little flat. The story is told with that same goofy, almost-not-b-movie quality that has become the staple flavor for the series, and for a tale spanning countries with some really fun twists and turns that tone works surprisingly well. Couple that with the game's episodic chapters and it feels like you're watching a low-budget TV show from the 90s, and it's great.The gameplay really isn't anything too different than the rest of the series. It has an over the shoulder, third person perspective, shooting certain points on enemies will weaken them and allow you to melee them to great effect (I still think that Chris's fists are more powerful than shotgun blasts). For the majority of the campaign you have an AI partner following you around, ala RE5, except this partner doesn't need your healing items or ammo and can't be controlled by another player, which is actually an improvement for this game. Despite it's similarities to 5, the game actually made me frightened, which only the first game (the Gamecube remake) managed to do. The atmosphere is very well set up, and one of the main locations in the game requires back tracking, but it's done so well you feel like you're running hopelessly in circles. The most frightening, and challenging, part of the game actually has you search for a dead comrade, only to find she has been resurrected as a disgusted squid-mutant-lady, and you then have to hunt her throughout the games main setting, which is a creepy, derelict boat that sways slowly beneath your feet. This moment is when the game really, truly shines as you never know when she's going to pop out and scream in a girlish voice, ""found you!"" Unfortunately the rest of the game is nowhere near as scary, but it is a lot more tense than any of the resident evil games after the REmake and RE0. My disappointments in the game are minor, but still important. After defeating the squid-mutant-lady, non of the game's bosses are particularly challenging, but they are still fun to overcome. However the final boss made me so mad, because he requires almost no strategy to overcome, just a bit of quick timing, he has way too much health, and the fight just drags on. It was not fun for me, some people may enjoy it, but I didn't. Another complaint is that the game is a port from the Nintendo 3DS, which is actually quite amazing the 3DS could handle this game, but it shows. It's supposed to be an HD remake, and some textures are bumped up to a higher quality, but a lot aren't, and some of the level geometry gets blocky, and the ""hidden"" loading screens consist of doors with spinning wheels, you try to open the door, the wheel spins, and boom you go through. It sounds like a quick and easy way to get the game into small, bite sized chunks and remove loading screens, but I once had a door refuse to open for nearly five minutes (yes, I timed it) and ever since then I would groan when I realized my objective was on the other side of one of those blasted doors.Overall, this game is really good. I had a ton of fun with it, and despite it's few shortcomings it really is a fun game, I would recommend to anyone who wants a scary Resident Evil, and I would recommend for people curious about the series. On a scale of:  1) Avoid like the plague 2) Maybe you'll like it? 3) Not bad 4) Good 5) AmazeballsThis game would be a: 4) Good.			"

												Amazing RE4 style game with a lot of elements from the classics including some genuine terror and key collection to progress. The story is probably the the most entertaining (certainly most convoluted besides maybe 6) in the RE franchise and most of the new characters are a welcome addition to the cast. The episode style setup may please some and be an annoyance to others. I really didnt enjoy the ""next time on RE Revelations"" between episodes, Im playing the game, ""I'll find out in the next few minutes without you telling me what is next!"" If you enjoyed Resident Evil, RE4 especially, and action/horror games, this is a must play.			"

												Resident Evil Rev. brings back the horror elements which were missing in Resident Evil 5. The enviroment is mostly dark and grim and it even has some shocking moments. The campaign is split up into 12 Episodes, each takes about 45-60 minutes to complete. The story is OK I'd say.Beware that the Coop Mode is NOT a standard Coop-campaign mode. It is rather a playthrough without any story or cutscenes. Fans of the Resident Evil series should definitly get it, they won't be dissapointed. All others should be aware of the typical ""flaws"" of this series (controls and a dull storytelling mostly).			"

												A mixed bag of a game. While the setting and atmosphere are infinitely better than Resident Evil 4,5 or 6, the game has numerous problems, raging from ""who cares"" plot and annoying shooter gallery segments. Some episodes are absolutely pointless and exist only to provide some mindless shooting and prolong the game play time. The entire thing also suffers thanks to the game being the obvious handheld port... small, bland areas, minimal inventory etc. However, despite all this, I had a blast playing Revelations from start to finish... even if it goes out with a whimper. This is probably the best we will get as far as injecting ""classic"" Resident Evil elements to modern RE goes. Recommended but be wary.			"

												There is a rediculous amount of lore when it comes to the Biohazard/RE series but I'd consider Revelations a pretty important part of that lore. I wasn't sure exactly what to expect, right off finishing RE4, I started this and I was first impressed how fluid it ran on my PC. Secondly, the pace of the story and gameplay was great, the only problem I had was the episodic delivery, I guess not all that bad but the chapters really only take 20-40 mins to finish, that's a plus and a negative, it keeps the pace going but short...depending on how you like your games. Me personally, I was glued, the story was a little hard to follow to start but makes sense at the end. Much more fun with a play through but I didn't bother finishing a new game +, I was only in it for the story. As for the Raid mode, I didn't even play much but it seemed a bit like a skirmish mode, adds nothing to story but a nice little side game.I any RE fan could appreciate this game.			"

												Alright i know it say 5 mins but i have honestly played this for around 15 hrs. Pros:Gameplay: Good. It works, it  still feels a lot like the old once even though you can now move and shot at the same time.Story: A Decent story  with at least two  good twists that caught me off guard.Horror/Survival: A great survival game and far more horror in this game then Resident evil 4, a bit less then Re 2/ code veronica, re zero etc. And you cant just spray bullets out or you will have a hard time.Music: A great soundtrackDecent: Characters: could be better but some of them that is intruced is alright.Graphics/Atmosphere: The Graphics is alright , but the amostphere is great and you real feel close to being alone on the ship ( Minor Spoiler, you have a partner).Cons:Lenght: You could argue that it is a bit shortDifficulity: You could argue despite playing on normal that it is very easyReplaybilites : They are really no reason to play trough this game more then onceShort summary before the score compared to other re games, worse then of those i have completed is worse then Re 2, 4 and 5. But its far batter then re 6. I wouldnt say despite i havent completeded re  zero or 3 that its better then those two games.Overall score:  8/10 N.B : Most of the time my steam reviews get written right afteri have completed the game . Specially after my completion of Deux Ex. but since i remember alot from this game even if is a 2 or so years since i completed i decided to write a qucik review. "

												Absolutely disgusting. From the horror made a corridor shooter with the novelty of a camera. The whole point of the game:You looked into the camera, found ammunition with the help of this camera. If there is an enemy - analyzed the enemy, received a cent for receiving the medications, shot the enemy. The end. Your A. I. partner in single player, on the level of boots with eyes. Help absolutely no, infinite ammo, invulnerability and a long response to opponents. The story is really boring. The developers apparently tried to make the twists and turns and an intricate storyline, but in the end, decided to just suck it up. The level design is terrible. It does not return to the atmosphere of the first 4 parts and not trying to hold in tension. Monotonous locations in which it is possible to predict who and where will come out. The soundtrack sucked. Again, not attached to insecurity, loneliness and despair.Boss battles are just ridiculous. ""We'll just do the soundtrack, which we think will sound epic and players will love it."" Speaking of enemies. Who am I fighting? Why are my enemies this shellfish-the inbetweeners, some fatties with bone circular saws, similar to large polyps? Secure shell lizard men with eviscerated entrails? What the hell? Where are the good old zombies? Where mutated animals? Where biological weapons is terrifies, not make to spit at the screen in disgust? This stupid new camera. How it detects the ammo? Why it does not display information about the weaknesses of the opponent? Where is my inventory? Instead, the bottomless pockets adds three weapons and ammo for 700-800 rounds? It's all very ""complicated"" game. System Dodge nightmare. It works from time to time. Alteration hand-to-hand combat, also makes a note of idiocy in the game. Why do I have to hold the button? What do my characters while I hold the button? Accumulate power for hitting? Click ""X"" at a time when your scale superkick filled... if before, I could shoot obvious weak point, for example in the knee and was able to finish his melee attack. Now, I need to harrass him, shoot him all the limbs and only then, will I be able to finish it... Like, a melee attack was done to save bullets, and not vice versa?Mode ""RAID"" is just the height of idiocy. If used, the mode ""Mercenaries"" contributed to the rivalry between friends, the interest to obtain the best results alone, tense fights against crowds of enemies and mini bosses, the current ""RAID"" is boring, uninteresting continuation of a corridor shooter we've seen in the storyline. Stupid sweep locations, search medals the experience and attempt not to die of boredom releasing 4-5 clips at the enemy a couple levels higher than you.So what we have, or rather do NOT HAVE this miscarriage of the series Resident evil?Storyline. Boring, monotonous and quickly. Atmosphere. At first it seems interesting, but the absence of a coherent soundtrack, boring level design, stupid enemies, disappointedly forced to cover his face with his hand.Gameplay . It seems to be okay and that operation converted under the keyboard and almost does not feel the port from the console, but the modified system of unarmed combat, Dodge irritate. Artificial intelligence. It simply does not exist for a partner in a single game, and for the opponents.And what do we have? A bunch of suits, for which the developers require money for a DLC.My assessment of the game 2 of 10. Thank Cthulhu, I didn't buy Pak with costumes. The game is not worth the money, but if you bought the full pack... Then congratulations, you have been fooled			"

												Let me make it very clear from the beginning why I'm recommending Resident Evil Revelations at all - Raid Mode. This minigame is what will sap up most of your time, and can take anywhere from 70 to over 100 hours for you to unlock characters and bonuses, find rare weapons and achieve S ranks.On to the campaign.Resident Evil Revelations plops RE mainstays Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine into a 'web of intrigue and conspiracy' (inverted commas because....) with new partners, Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat. After Chris and Jessica drop off the grid while investigating a possible terrorist group's revival, Jill and Parker and sent to check on them. Parker and Jill end up at an abandoned ship, the Queen Zenobia, which is where most of the Campaign happens. The plot of Revelations is the cheesiest, lamest, cheapest, worst pulp fiction plot I have ever come across. There is no criminal mastermind in this game, the game IS the criminal mastermind for coming across as utterly cheap and unconvincing.Through the campaign, certain parts and boss fights just drag on and on. Instead of creating tension, you start hoping for the game to just be over and done with. The unconvincing, cheap plot makes this worse because you often just feel like a fool wandering the corridors in search of keys and key items to unlock this and that - but for what? Everything feels like a wild goose chase - and players who have finished this game will know what I mean.The controls are a step up from the uncomfortable, inconvenient 3DS ones. The ability to map your subweapons to specific keys will allow you to toss subweapons (grenades, decoys) quickly, saving your skin in precarious Raid Mode situations. Where the triggers on the 3DS were cramped and caused hand fatigue, you'll of course find no such problem on the PC. The half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥dodging is still here, however. There is no laser sight in this game. Be sure to turn off Acceleration/Auto-Aim and other options in the game's menu, because your crosshairs are going to be 'sticky' otherwise, making it harder to aim.For Mercenaries veterans, Raid Mode is definitely a different flavour. Instead of building combos and adding time, the game offers 20 stages, all mini-maps taken from the main Campaign. In each, your objective is to get to the end point. To get there, you have to make your way through the map, kill enemies for keys, etc. To make Raid Mode challenging for trophy hunters, Trinity Bonuses (achieve No Damage, kill all enemies, play at lower level than recommended) have been added, and will often require a good co-op partner for you to get them all.You choose from a variety of characters, each with different weapon perks, pick 3 weapons from your inventory and then enter the stage. Generally, there are characters for different playing styles. E.g. Morgan Lansdale, with his Rifle and Magnum perk, will be popular with people who like the powerful but slow-reloading weapons.Co-Op has a number of known issues as well, such as horrible lag and failure to find matches. The lag affects gameplay badly, since enemies will regenerate health, enemies might continue walking around despite having 0 HP, enemies (and your partner) 'teleport' across the map, etc.Revelations is a rather weak game. It hasn't got an amazing combat system, it hasn't fully retained the flavour of older RE games, it gets utterly boring at points, the enemies are rehashed zombies, it's not an immersive or convincing game world, etc. But I still recommend it for the co-op experience of bonus-hunting with a partner. Raid Mode is a content-heavy section that stands well on its own and has high replayability. For players who lament that this game is a 'disappointment' and a 'disaster', my reply is to simply play through the game to get your money's worth, then uninstall it from your system and be done with it. This is the new direction the games are taking, and you of course, as a consumer, have the choice not to part with your money and time.Revelations gets a 7/10 from me.			"

The graphics were way less demanding than RE6. You do play as more than on scenario of characters, however it is in one linear campaign so the gameplay is more pleasing. You unlock weapons by finding them and completing puzzles. No stupid currency system like there was in RE6. Graphics: 7/10Gameplay: 8/10Replayability: 6/10			"

												A worthy successor to RE4, which does much to try to reconnect the series to its roots, emphazing a careful use of resources and juking over blasting wildly and hoping your target will stagger. Puzzles are simple, but present again, after a two game absence. The shifting narrative is a bit obnoxious, as many of the characters are less likeable than Jill or Chris (the creepy hacker Jackass comes to mind), but sticking with it will yield good results.The real draw is Raid Mode, a seemingly endless grindfest which puts you at odds with lifebar sporting enemies, featuring an item shop, which lets you buy weapons and upgrade plug-ins with your hard earned points, and a multitude of playable characters.The Genesis scanner, a carry over from the DS version, seems a bit tedious, but becomes less obtrusive as unlockables are found and the player develops a sense for where items might be hidden.Female characters are designed to be eye candy, which is a bit creepy, particularly in the case of Rachel, and Jessica's fashion sense is bound to make some cringe (her one-legged wetsuit comes to mind.) Worth considering if that sort of thing bothers you.Otherwise, a very solid RE game in an era of not-so-solid RE games.			"

												I've never played a Resident Evil game before, and for my first one, Revelations did a great job keeping me on my toes. It was constantly dancing the line between survival horror and traditional third-person shooter, and I never felt like I had enough ammo to feel fully comfortable. The Genesis device was used to its full potential due to the myriad of hidden objects, invisible/difficult-to-spot enemies, and the storyline was full of cliffhangars and drove me insane because my work only gave me enough time to finish a single chapter every night. I have two major criticisms: the dodge mechanic is unreliable at best, I never used it because it didn't seem to do anything. On occasion my character would dodge an attack but it felt completely divorced from whatever buttons I was pressing at the time. This meant that I mostly shot my way out of situations, which necessitated heavy usage of the Genesis device and my AI partner to keep my limited ammo stocked up. But complaint number two is that your AI partner is almost useless. The doors in this game only allow one charcter through at a time, meaning your partner shows up late to every fight, never seems to bother shooting anything and can't seem to hit anything with the few shots they take. But all in all, the game is well worth playing. The swimming mechanics are some of the smoothest I've seen in this sort of game and the arsenal of weapons and enemies is diverse and keeps things interesting. Wish more PC ports were like this one.			"

												Great game, and can be found for dirt cheap. Good story with lots of twists, great atmosphere, engaging weapon upgrade system and pretty good monster diversity. The setting is also used extremely well. The only real con would be that the combat isnt as fluid as any of the other modern resident evil games, including this games sequel. Still though, highly recommended.			"

In terms of controls and gameplay it's basically among the best, following the tried and tested controls schemes which Resident Evil 4 started, and improved upon by 5 and 6.			"

												It's one of the best Resident Evils since 4, but it does suffer from the same pitfall that Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker does-- they are simpler (for instance, there's very little enemy variation) games because of their original handheld exclusivity, which is fine on the 3DS, but suffers on a dedicated platform. It certainly does try to create some kind of atmosphere (though the ever-present co-op partner doesn't help) and to bring back the campiness of the pre-RE4 days and it deserves some recognition for that. It's no RE4, but it does trump RE5 and in some regards, RE6.			"

												If you are in for a good-old school resident evil experience you are in for a disappointment. While many people talk about RE going back to its roots with the revelation series the honest truth for RE veterans is that Capcom is very far from it. For me RE last root installment was Code Veronica everything afterward is closer to being a shooter than a survival horror.Let me start with what I look for when talking about ""root RE experience"":- Teasing, mysterious, cold, intriguing and uneasy atmosphere and level design- Limited resources that forces you to strive for any items/ammunition you can find and think once, twice and five times before firing a bullet- Narrative driven enemies that you are both annoy and scare the S#$t out of you and yet compel you to respect their presence- Music that defines the installment and propels the atmosphere and level design.- Puzzles, locked doors, some positive back tracking to find out what's behind that door or corridor that you couldn't explore beforeNow back to Revelations. Apart from the ""Resident Evil"" title and the presence of known characters from the franchise it has non of the elements that defines a root RE experience for me.- The game is basically a shooter. The main value of the game if running around shooting creatures.- Narrative is laughable and reminds me of RE arcade shooters. I think resident evil survivor has a storyline way better then this game. You can barely relate to any event or character in here- Atmosphere and nostalgia is a thing of the past. Here you will be going through various shooting galleries where you walk in shoot a bunch of enemies and scan stuff and move on to the next gallery- The game episodic design makes the pacing of the game absolutely horrendous- Unless you are shooting blindly, resources are almost unlimited. Healing items, ammunition and other items are everywhere and the game will baby you if you run shortTLDR: If you are looking for an original Resident Evil experience (pre Code Veronica experience) this game is not for you. If you are looking for a horror shooter garbage (Resident Evil 4 onward) this game will be OK			"

												Campaign is pretty lame, but Raid mode is fun, especially with co-op. Poor story/writing/pacing, poor graphics. Mechanically the game feels like a mix of different parts of the RE timeline. The mixture really doesn't work well with the bad partner AI, but it works alright in raid mode. It feels like it was supposed to be like RE4 + elements from old RE games, but then randomly added RE5 elements to it. I actually LIKED RE5 (as an action co-op game), but they took the worst parts of RE5 (AI controller partner), made them worse and shoved them into this game. Raid mode is the only part worth playing because they remove the AI partner completely or replace it with a human. Only buy this game for dirt cheap.Pros:- The beginning of the game, is decent. Playing as Jill alone on the ship is the best part of the game and really should have been the entire game.- Some light puzzle/key/backtracking that feels like old school RE games.- Somewhat limited ammo can feel a little like old RE games, but there's usually more than enough ammo (except for maybe 1 part of the game that spikes in difficulty randomly).- Raid mode. Removes your annoying partner and optionally replaces him with a human controller character.Cons:- The rest of the game you are given a partner. This is probably one of the worst aspects of the game. People complained about the RE5 partner AI, but this AI is pretty much non-existent. Your partner never does anything to help you, even if you're getting smothered to death right in front of him. He occasionally shoots, but that's all. The monsters walk past him, completely focused on you. Thankfully you don't have to worry about him dying, since he can't die. But The fact that you have this invincible person with you at all times who really doesn't help you at all ruins the experience a lot. It ruins the immersion a lot, they don't add anything to the game. Would have been much better if they weren't there.- Stupid/annoying characters. For a game with so many characters, there aren't really any likable ones. One of them is one of the ugliest characters I've ever seen in a game. There's also a lot of random partial female nudity for a people who are supposed to be in these important serious organizations. It makes it hard to tell if the game wants you to take it seriously. - Writing/Acting. The plot itself might be ok, but it couldn't hold my attention because of really poor line delivery of really bad lines. The game also tries to be funny at times, but any attempt at a joke just comes off as awkward and cringey. A lot of dialogue boils down to:Person A: ""We have to go there."" Person B: ""Ok, let's go there.""Nothing ever sounds like two humans talking. It sounds like people reading lines in different rooms from eachother. For comparison, I've been playing Metal Gear Rising which has much better conversations that sound like real people interacting, I've sat for hours just listening to the people talk in MGR. Can capcom not afford decent writers after so many games?- Wonky game mechanics. The dodge mechanic is unreliable. Sometimes it works but I only got it to work consistently by mashing Up when I was about to get hit, it's never obvious when you're supposed to do it. The game also wants you to aim at certain parts of enemies, but it isn't always obvious what's the best place to hit. I didn't find out until after the campaign that shooting both arms of the monsters stunned them, I thought it was occuring randomly.			"

												Sooo... This game is from Resident Evil series, but it's less of a survival horror, filled with puzzles and secrets and more of a shoot-the-zombies kind of game. I won't tell you about the story, since there will be spoilers and some reviews already covered that part of the game. I will tell you my impressions instead.-The first thing I noticed is awkward movement of the main character. It does not go smoothly, but I suppose it's because the game is designed to be played on a console on some sort with a joystick.-Cheap scares. Like, moviement in the ducts, an unexpected corpse falling from nowhere with scary music on the background. Or you are all like ""It's a zombie"" and nope, those are rats... Stuff like that, to keep you tense on the transition of the story... In theory. This one is an old formula from scary movies and games.-The game itself is pretty much has been made to connect the dots between the story lines of previos and next game. It's made to fill the gap holes in the main story of the Resident Evil games. So, if you are more interested in action game and you want to know a little bit more about the Series and why the ♥♥♥♥ zombies suddently become parasitic worms, infrecting the host and such... This game is made to supposingly explain it to you.-The characters are looking a little bit weird. But maybe it's just me.-Also, you get to scan stuff. Which would be allright as an optional game dinamic, but it's mandatory one and sometimes the game become a sort of ""Scan them all"" kind of game. Which is exactly as fun as it sounds.-The inventory is weird, different from the previous games. So, you just go there... Scan some♥♥♥♥♥♥ kill some bad guys, look for ammo, medkits and grenades... Which is okay for shooter game but kind of dissapoining for resident evil series.-There aren't much puzzles, it's more like the 4th and 5th RE, but here it's more of a ""Go and find the item X to activate thing Y"". So... Yeah. That sucks too.-The game itself is pretty short and it feels more like a series of short interactive movies, rather than a RE game.So, in short. If you are interested for a Resident Evil series main story, you should get this game. But it's pretty much just that. A series of short episodes made to close some story gaps and connect the games between themselves. So... Yeah. It's not entirelly bad, but it's not a big deal.5/10.			"

												Clearly it is not a RE as the old school RE game, which has been happening since RE4.It's an interesting game, in some ways more than RE4, 5 and 6 combined. The story leaves much to be desired, but the gameplay is decent.It has its moments of suspense as the old RE, but that is not enough.Visually its quite inferior compared with the predecessors, but for being a port of handheld its not bad.The raid mode is very entertaining and addictive.Without going any further, it is worthwhile, but not at full price.

												I'm a die hard fan of the Resident Evil Franchise and this game is no exception to that rule. The game on it's plus + side is alot of fun and there is enough things to do to keep the player occupied while shooting mindless slashing blob like foes. I like the game it is rough around the edges and there is not much to look at or awe at graphics wise. For a decent sale price pick the game up if your a fan but Co-op mode isn't a run through of the Campagin which is boring and flat. Raid mode is the only Co-op to play online with a friend and is highly sad to play through.			"

												Oh man, this game was awesome. The gameplay was fun and action-packed, not too much of it was actual horror like the tags suggest. The main story takes about 9 hours to complete, but the storyline is amazing. Rather unexpected plot-twists, betrayal, etc. Once you beat the story, there is also a Co-Op Raid Mode for you to take on solo or with friends. On top of that, New Game+ gives the game slight replay value. I would definitely recommend this game to TPS fans or story-driven game fans. Even if you are not familiar with the Resident Evil Series (this is the first RE game I played), the story is very enjoyable.			"

Now that it's on sale I decided to buy it... so far i'm enjoying this game a lot. The series had some bumps in the 21st century but this game most def has the RE vibe. The controls are easy to handle and remember, I enjoy that you can switch to the K+M or XboxOne controller in real time.Let's talk about how much of a baddie Jill is in this game? In the first 5 minutes of the game her perfect [Bass and Bits] triggered me.

There is also plenty of stuff to discover and achievements to get which lends itself to multiple playthroughs (you can do a new game+ and retain your equipment).The best part of the game perhaps is the new Raid mode which has endless replay value and great rpg-like depth.

It may be noticeable that it was once a game originally for the Nintendo 3DS, it's tense, sometimes scary, and the Queen Zenobia is an incredible place to explore. It may have a dumb story and half of the game consists of playing as other characters, but the sections that let you play as Jill Valentine exploring the ship alone is worth the price of entry.

												When I heard that this game was getting a PC port I was extremely excited, since it was branded as a survival horror game that was true to the Resident Evil's of old, and frankly, the only Resident Evil games that I 100% enjoyed. This is somewhat true. The gameplay is a mix of what you find in Resident Evil 5 and 6, and what you find in the classic Resident Evil games. The over the shoulder camera is fine, boss fights are difficult, and ammo conservation exists, but only to the extent of Resident Evil 4, in the sense that conserving ammo never becomes a major problem because you always have more weapons. Backtracking, puzzles, and non-linear gameplay is also present, however the disappointment is the fact that all of this is present only in small amounts. There aren't many puzzles or doors that you can backtrack to, and when you do, you typically find that the contents inside are completely optional anyways. It was kind of a tease for me, but still better than the crap show that was Resident Evil 6.			"

												This is definitely one of the lesser RE games. The visuals, combat, and enemies all seem watered down from proper numbered entries in the series. This one has a lot of the same problems as RE5. Most of the action takes place on a cruise ship, that's shiny, sterile, and empty. A cruise ship is a very unscary place. Don't make me go to the casino, NO! There's also a LOT of tight corridors to fight and run through. And there's only really one room in the entire game that has creepy monster stuff adorning the walls and floor. It's the only room with an ounce of atmosphere and there weren't even any enemies in the room. Everywhere else could be a part of any other cookie-cutter action game. Put a freaking spider web up somewhere! There are not a lot of different enemy types. A lot of them look like slight variations of each other. What I did like was that the game kind of has the format of the older style RE games where searching around and solving puzzles is necessary to advance. The map does has an objective marker at some points, but it's a good compromise between the more difficult, slower-paced original RE games and newer action-oriented entries. The story is classic RE rubbish. You know all the words to that song so feel free to sing along while you're playing. The campaign takes around 11 hours. When comparing this to RE6 which came out around the same time, there really is no comparison. RE6 is better in every way. It's baffling that Capcom is charging more for this than the much superior RE6. Do not under any circumstances pay full price for this 3DS port. Wait for a severe discount if you really must play this.			"

												This was a pretty fun play. You could probably beat campaign in a day if you really wanted to though. The fights were fun, weapons were fun but the mechanics are a little odd in RER. It's easy to forget/miss things collectibles but you can always retrace your steps for them or you can always play through again with your old gear after you beat the game and save. All and all glad i picked it up from humble bundle, lots of interesting plot twists. 7/10			"

												After Resident Evil 3: Nemesis I find it very hard to enjoy any subsequent Resident Evil game. But Resident Evil Revelations was the first one I managed to play through its end. Dividing story into chapters keeps the dynamic flow. And even though the story isn't anything special seeing it from different perspectives and timelines creates the illusion which makes it less dull and fun to watch. Despite the fact that majority of the game takes place at one ship, I had hard time remember where I want to come back, the map (basically location layout) in these situations isn't very helpful.Everything is plentyful, ammo, herbs, grenades. I believe the transition towards more action oriented experience happend with Resident Evil 5, so no big surprise here. Weapons aren't very fun to use and some of them are basically useless (sniper rifle?). And while the ship chapters have some atmosphere it's immidietly killed with goofy intermezzos with Keith and Quint. The biggest positive is probably that's really good port unlike Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD. I hadn't encountered anything annoying or uncomfortable. It is OK game, it won't offend you but it won't blow you off either.			"

												I have RE1, RE2, RE3, RE Code Ver, RE4, RE5 and the remakes on Gamecube and PS4 on my resume. Unfortunately I slept on this game when it came out in 2013. Now that it's on sale I decided to buy it... so far i'm enjoying this game a lot. The series had some bumps in the 21st century but this game most def has the RE vibe. The controls are easy to handle and remember, I enjoy that you can switch to the K+M or XboxOne controller in real time.Let's talk about how much of a baddie Jill is in this game? In the first 5 minutes of the game her perfect [Bass and Bits] triggered me. If anyone else tell you other wise they are lying.8.5/10Pros+Jill Valentines BODY+Controls+AtmosphereCons-Jill is not real so there will never be any leaked nudes or X-TapesWith amount of Jill♥♥♥♥♥in this game, someone should make a mod that includes a BRA$$ERS/Bangbros logo overlayed during gameplay.

												This game is definitely for diehard fans of the Resident Evil franchise. I wouldn't say I suffered through the game, however, I did not enjoy it as much as I think I could have. That may be because even for an RE story, this game has one of the worst narratives. There are worse so...Anyway, I won't be too negative since this is a port of a game that was originally released for the Nintendo 3DS. Instead I'll  plus/minus the highs and lows. Easier to digest the point of the review.+ Hi-res texture upgrades are very welcome+ Music and sound effects are excellent+ If you're a diehard RE fan, it's more RE- Story is uber boring- Weapon upgrade system is lacking- Movement is horrible considering the agility of some of the enemies and bosses- $50 price tag. This is a $20 game at mostAn Ok side story that I will probably not revisit, but did not hate. I can recommend this game but only if it's on sale and if you're an RE fan like myself, even though the writing in this series has entered comedy.			"

												It's been a while since the last time I played the RE that could completely gratify me.Some day, after being disappointed by the RE6, I heard that the RE R excluded by the 3DS would be released on the PC platform, I felt excited but also confused, because I didn't know whether this new RE could express the true meaning of the RE. However, as a fan of the RE, I still pre-purchased it before the day it was released. Thank god, I felt really satisfied by the first time I played the game. The atmosphere it created in the story mode was similar to the one in the old RE , suddenly, it reminded me of the day I play RE 3 with my best friend in Primary school....Tears really burst out at that moment.....The story of this RER is also good and reasonable, it perfectly complements the blank between RE4 and RE5, so we can know about the origin of the anti-Bioterrorism organinzation BSAA. Although this game's story mode is awsome, it still has some shortages. It doesn't inherit the Gun-carrying system from the RE5 and I take that as a great pity. Because it will make the game more realistic when the characters carry the gun they don't use on their back. It feels weird when i see the characters grap their gun from the air. But this is just a small shortage, I still recommend this game to you guys.			"

												With this game I have to say that Capcom made some progress to return the series to it's former glory. I hope this was a wake up call for them, it's a small step in the right direction. It makes me exited to see what will happen to Resident evil in the future because it seems to look a little brighter. Anyhow the game is good and older RE fans will feel more at home with this one than the most recent installments. But there were some things that could have been better gameplay wise but it's understandable since it is a port of a 3ds game. Another thing I want to mention is that the game is pretty short for being a RE game, took me about 6-7 hours to finish while RE 4 took me like 14+ hours to finish. I think it's a good resident evil game and definetly shows that Resident Evil has potential to become perhaps the best survival horror series again even if it might take some time for it to happen.

												Closer to the original Resident Evil than RE5, nice character switches and levels, though a bit redundant. Nevertheless worth the time and cash for the sake of a typical RE-Chapter, if you like 3/4-Letter-Agencies, mutants and the solving of almost all problems with guns facing boss enemies.

												I liked it more than RE5, but the game still lacked the intensity of RE4 and the puzzles/tension of the other RE games.  Another issue I had with the game was that I did not like the episodic structure since it messed up the pacing and ruined the intensity that was building up.  The controls are a tad sluggish, but for the most part they work and the action is fun, but not as well done as in RE 4 and 5.  I liked the ability to customize my weapons and the inclusion of a new game plus mode adds replay value to the game.  My Rating: 3.5/5			"

												A mixed bag of a game. While the setting and atmosphere are infinitely better than Resident Evil 4,5 or 6, the game has numerous problems, raging from ""who cares"" plot and annoying shooter gallery segments. Some episodes are absolutely pointless and exist only to provide some mindless shooting and prolong the game play time. The entire thing also suffers thanks to the game being the obvious handheld port... small, bland areas, minimal inventory etc. However, despite all this, I had a blast playing Revelations from start to finish... even if it goes out with a whimper. This is probably the best we will get as far as injecting ""classic"" Resident Evil elements to modern RE goes. Recommended but be wary.			"

												There is a rediculous amount of lore when it comes to the Biohazard/RE series but I'd consider Revelations a pretty important part of that lore. I wasn't sure exactly what to expect, right off finishing RE4, I started this and I was first impressed how fluid it ran on my PC. Secondly, the pace of the story and gameplay was great, the only problem I had was the episodic delivery, I guess not all that bad but the chapters really only take 20-40 mins to finish, that's a plus and a negative, it keeps the pace going but short...depending on how you like your games. Me personally, I was glued, the story was a little hard to follow to start but makes sense at the end. Much more fun with a play through but I didn't bother finishing a new game +, I was only in it for the story. As for the Raid mode, I didn't even play much but it seemed a bit like a skirmish mode, adds nothing to story but a nice little side game.I any RE fan could appreciate this game.			"

												My first initial thought on the Resident Evil Series was 'Hell No, I ain't playing that crap."" I decided to try one of them and someone recommended This one. Let me tell you that I coudn't have started with a better game. The claustraphobic hallways and rooms provide eery environments which always had me on my toes. The game doesn't use any jump scares, the cheapest of all scares, even though it had countless amount of times to do so. The acting ofsome of the Characters is a bit dry (Especially Chris and Jill, Jill sometimes is okay but Chris is awful) but, it's not very important considering the dialogue is at a minimal. You have to make every bullet count as some enemies can take lots of hits and you run out of ammo hella fast. They Ported this game super well from the 3ds(used to be 3DS exclusive). Controls are super smooth and real easy to get used to. If you want to start the Resident Evil Series, I recommend this one to the end because of the presentation that it has provided, that being really good.

												This game is a bad joke by every definition. While the graphics aren't completely outmoded, prepare yourself for visuals that would feel right at home during 2008. Literally. Voice acting is God-awful. Characters are creepy automotons with some stalker-ish characters like CreepyJessica asking if you like her rear end while she takes her time to save you from a pack of zombie-wolves (yes, zombie wolves --- wth?)The game maps are horrendously linear and absurdly small. Weapon ammunition is limited in order to amp the feeling of powerlessness but the weapons themselves feel underpowered and worthless compared to...get this... a karate kick. There is no dedicated dodge key and instead you have to time the forward movement keys to avoid some attacks. Puzzles are brutally stupid and often make no sense.Oh and the story...where do I start. The story is nonsensical and designed for morons. You spend a good 10 minutes collecting ""data samples"" with a magical device that can analyze ANYTHING from giant mutants on a beach about a quarter of a city block in length, while your boss stands 50 feet away demanding what's taking so long. You reach into mutated, infected biomatter with your bare hands without fear of contamination but apparently everyone else is infected by the merest scratch.A terrorist group leaks information of a secret base in an arctic location...so they can lure Chris Redfield and CreepyJessica to a radio-silenced area. Redfield and Jessica find the base but it turns out it was all an elaborate ruse to actually lure Jill Valentine and some pudgy Redshirt into a derelict ship...how exactly? How was Redfield's signal drawn there? Why not just capture Redfield and bring him to the ship? I mean, you're going to build a BASE in the ARCTIC so you can trick two different agents onto a ship thousands of miles away. Wait, what? And that's just the first quarter of the short, uninspired, ridiculously-plotted game.People will argue that this game was a DS/Gameboy game and that its limitations are born from that. My rebuttal is that iOS has plenty of full-fledged games with better graphics (Infinity Blade III), better gameplay (Implosion) and better voice acting/plot (Republique) than this normally 30 dollar crapshow.  I suppose if the game was priced like an iOS title, at 5-10 dollars, it might be worth it but not at that price. What a ripoff.AVOID.4/10.			"

												I've never played a Resident Evil game before, and for my first one, Revelations did a great job keeping me on my toes. It was constantly dancing the line between survival horror and traditional third-person shooter, and I never felt like I had enough ammo to feel fully comfortable. The Genesis device was used to its full potential due to the myriad of hidden objects, invisible/difficult-to-spot enemies, and the storyline was full of cliffhangars and drove me insane because my work only gave me enough time to finish a single chapter every night. I have two major criticisms: the dodge mechanic is unreliable at best, I never used it because it didn't seem to do anything. On occasion my character would dodge an attack but it felt completely divorced from whatever buttons I was pressing at the time. This meant that I mostly shot my way out of situations, which necessitated heavy usage of the Genesis device and my AI partner to keep my limited ammo stocked up. But complaint number two is that your AI partner is almost useless. The doors in this game only allow one charcter through at a time, meaning your partner shows up late to every fight, never seems to bother shooting anything and can't seem to hit anything with the few shots they take. But all in all, the game is well worth playing. The swimming mechanics are some of the smoothest I've seen in this sort of game and the arsenal of weapons and enemies is diverse and keeps things interesting. Wish more PC ports were like this one.			"

												Ahh Revelations. This game is especially perfect for the people like myself who have only played RE 4-6. This game is very much mostly old school survival horror from the days of RE1-3 and very little emphasis on action, just mostly on throwbacks or on the side characters. Now to those who loved RE5-6 only for the co-op, you will not get co-op in the story but only in its other part, Raid Mode, which is very different to The Mercenaries in the recent entries. This game has a lot more weapon customization than RE6. Also be wise with your ammo as much as you can since you won't be able to melee as easy in this game compared to RE4-6. However, the story is on par to RE4-6 if not better since there is more common sense in the situations and to reasoning compared to RE6 especially. Well Raid Mode, all I'm gona say is that its really fun. If the game was 40 I would give the immediate recommendation and 8.5. but since its not the case, it gets an 8 from me, Well hope RE7 can be on point with this game and the upcoming survival horror game, The Evil Within, :).

												Overall, while Resident Evil: Revelations may not be the most polished experience, it’s still a joy to play and has some scary moments as well as the potential for great value for money with its higher difficulty setting that completely rearranges enemy and item placements and the interesting 2 player raid mode, this is something you’ll probably want to pick up if you’re a Resident Evil or survival horror fan. If Resident Evil isn’t a series that you love, you might want to skip it, or wait for it to be reduced on sale, however, as it largely relies upon throwbacks to earlier games in its ported version.Read the full review on GSM Gaming: http://gsmgaming.tumblr.com/post/65250527803/halloween-2013-resident-evil-revelations "

												Alright, let's cut through the BS you read in other reviews and get down to it.The good,The writing, yes, the writing, it's succinct , punchy, and entertaining. The character known as Parker really tugs on the heart strings, and is genuinely relatable. Anyone complaining about the plot obviously never played RE1. It's always been hokey and awkwardly paced. This game is no different.Level design and art direction, everything feels creepy and alive.Overall flow, fun and easy to get through, with new game plus options.The BadGone are series stables such as, complex puzzles, green/blue herbs, inventory management, ammo scarcity, and most of all, areas to explore that function as open area puzzles, like the mansion, or police station.While I was most disappointed in how linear it was, it's still fun to play and has some eerie moments. It is slight, being a handheld port, on unique interactions with the environment, I find it still scratches the RE itch.The shooting, you basically just dump ammo into to things. Once you get and upgrade your auto-matic weapon of choice, that'll be your main stay anytime you have ammo. The reason being is that combat is just too fast paced over short distances to try and use you're rifle (which will miss) or handgun (goes in the trash asap), or magnum (three enemies later, no more ammo). It's pretty much smg/shotgun all day once you get the ammo capacity upgrades.The cut-scenes, we are talking MGS levels here. Cut those out and your playtime will he halved.in conclusion. It's a good game, just not the return to roots people have been saying it is. Just solid all around, while being just two shades away from borderlands. If Capcom just (they won't) slowed it down, made ammo scarce, and made the protagnist not a super solider, we'd be right back to our roots. P.S. please bring back Carlos and HUNK.			"

												Alright i know it say 5 mins but i have honestly played this for around 15 hrs. Pros:Gameplay: Good. It works, it  still feels a lot like the old once even though you can now move and shot at the same time.Story: A Decent story  with at least two  good twists that caught me off guard.Horror/Survival: A great survival game and far more horror in this game then Resident evil 4, a bit less then Re 2/ code veronica, re zero etc. And you cant just spray bullets out or you will have a hard time.Music: A great soundtrackDecent: Characters: could be better but some of them that is intruced is alright.Graphics/Atmosphere: The Graphics is alright , but the amostphere is great and you real feel close to being alone on the ship ( Minor Spoiler, you have a partner).Cons:Lenght: You could argue that it is a bit shortDifficulity: You could argue despite playing on normal that it is very easyReplaybilites : They are really no reason to play trough this game more then onceShort summary before the score compared to other re games, worse then of those i have completed is worse then Re 2, 4 and 5. But its far batter then re 6. I wouldnt say despite i havent completeded re  zero or 3 that its better then those two games.Overall score:  8/10 N.B : Most of the time my steam reviews get written right afteri have completed the game . Specially after my completion of Deux Ex. but since i remember alot from this game even if is a 2 or so years since i completed i decided to write a qucik review. "

												A very underrated Resident Evil game. I would say it's the best recent Resident Evil game. It is actually scary with amazing environments unlike the more recent games. The gameplay adds to the game as it keeps ammo scarce making you feel like you are in danger at all times. The enemies, especially the bosses are terrifying.The graphics are decent, especially given that this is a port from the 3DS. Everything runs smoothly at over 144 fps on my setup.The story is decent. You switch between different perspectives and areas which does affect the pacing a bit, however it is an enjoyable story. It is a bit over the top and some of its twists are very predictable, however there are no major flaws.Raid mode is dead, but if you can find a game it is fun to do with friends. You can also play it solo but it gets very hard to do in the later levels.Overall, this game is worth it when it's on sale. I wouldn't pay full price for it. The campaign took me about 10 hours on the hardest difficulty, but it is important to note that I had played the game before on the 3DS so it should take you longer to complete.EDIT: Raid mode is the best game within a game.

												This game... is awful.  It takes all the worst parts of Resident Evil and then manages to try and break it up into chapters as a DLC sales model?  They had the opportunity to make an interesting game like Resident Evil 1-3 but zombies drop ""random loot"" and the disjointed story makes almost no sense.  The supporting characters are sacks of uninteresting trash, and just retract from the game at large.  The one good thing I can say about the game is that they managed to find a good setting and atmosphere.  The rooms feel like they did in RE1/2.  They hit the perfect combination of regal and claustrophobic which could have been interesting, had you not been handed a bucket of ammo, and had waves of zombies thrown ineffectually against you.

												A very solid game, but with a weak story that doesnt really captivate the players exept a few times far and betwen,  does have a little exploration through the levels with the normal backtracking RE games have, satisfying shooting mechanics and simple puzzles to cativate the more casual gamers. The campaing is nicely split into episodes, and can go from 8h to 15h depending your playstyle, sometimes it requires a little too much backtracking, but if you arent explorer much of it can be avoided, the graphics are good for its time and in some ocasions, you have the RE feeling, but Revelations grounds, is more a of shooter that anything else.The story isnt great, but voice actors do a good job making it belivable, the sound is also good and help keep up the pace of the game and provide the creepy feeling on some ocasions.Besides the story, you have the raid mode, that can be played solo or coop, and there is where revelations really shine, you can add hours of fun with your friends or just muckaround in pub to get company for the horde mode, it have 3 stages and many things to unlock.Overall, revelations is solid experience, and a must for any RE fan that like the world around the franchise, even being more action oriented, still keep some old traces to destinguish himself from other shooters.

I sat down and played 6 episodes staight (took me 5 hours to do so).Graphics is nice, no bugs what-so-ever, gamepad controls feel fluid and the gameplay itself is a mix of puzzles, exploration, horror and action sequences (from each a bit so that the pacing is up the whole game). There is also a bit of humour (Jackass character) and tentacle scenes (yes, that is present in this game).Overall a good experience I would say (4.5 out of 5) - let's see what the remaining 6 episodes have to offer.

												This is another title I waited on till it was super cheap before diving in. The game has solid RE guts and doesn't miss the beat on the classic feel. The game could have used a better variety of enemies overall and maybe some cameos from other RE alumni. the controls were pretty tight and the game also works well on a controller. The story is kinda the same thing as others in the RE universe, we have an outbreak, must destroy/escape, rinse repeat. Not a deal breaker but just a heads up for fans coming in late like I did. Well worth the couple of bucks I paid to score this one.			"

												Resident Evil: Revelations, the first RE game I've played and beaten, which got me into the series in the first place, What all do I have to say here? First off, I'll explain what made me want this game; I was browsing the Wii U Eshop one day and saw the demo of this, so I tried it out and wanted the full game ASAP because it was so interesting to me.Anyway, onto the pros; Got a nice and simple atmosphere, area design, Action packed areas, cast of characters, and even a decent difficulty range.Con; Making me think 2 of the characters died in this, one from a gunshot wound, and the other in the self-destruct fire, as well as SOME annoying enemies...Overall a great game and a brilliant way to introduce newcomers into the mix.8.5/10, Would play again one day			"
