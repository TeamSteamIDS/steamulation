												9/10+ very nice presentation, art is awesome, runs great on max settings+ nice music, good voice acting+ point and click adventure game with some very hard puzzles, that are not essentially needed to proceed, meaning you can just explore the environment and complete the story without solving almost any puzzle. this is NOT recommendded - the puzzles are extremely well designed, they are mostly about reconstructing a memory by reading and finding relevant items, cracking safes etc.  -  great idea about moving between the 2 worlds of the game and storing items or reading the important documents you found so far+ complex story, emotional at times , with some horror elements, very interesting though you will want to see what happens+ controls and gameplay mechanics flawless+ good duration, replayability (as it is very hard to complete it the first time by solving everything)- playing for the first time you might not understand exactly what you have to do or how to solve the puzzles, if you have the patience to proceed a bit you will be rewarded though - it could be a bit more beginner friendly- sometimes finding items needed to solve puzzles is frustrating, they might be far away from the scene or even in a totally different location (item or hint)one of my favorites adventures of the year, very professional work, highly recommended to those who like adventure and puzzle games in general with a good storyhint: don't forget to hold left mouse button on an object (that you can get) to read its description/name, this is vital for some puzzles			"

												Did you ever have somebody tell you about a movie they saw or a book that they read, saying it had so much depth and was so thought-provoking that you knew it must be worth a look. But when you did, you saw none of what this person described? That's Ether One.This is going to be a spoiler free review, largely because there isn't much to spoil so it is easy to avoid.When you start the game, there is a great deal of promise. Presentation is good and the pacing is decent. Voice actors are good. The art-style is interesting and the environments well designed. But it doesn't take long before you find yourself in a game where you find yourself casually walking through the clearly marked core of the story but completely unaware of side-quests which make up the bulk of the content. When you start to understand that mundane objects have a larger significance you turn into a kleptomaniac, expecting to encounter some truely ingenius puzzles which remind you of games like Resident Evil or Myst, but suddenly discover that the developers have hidden the puzzles so well that half the time you're walking past them or completely clueless about where to start. So you start poking everything randomly to see if anything happens. Not to mention that much of what you've been collecting doesn't actually have a use at all. It's like buying one of those Lego kits and then discovering you have loads of bricks left over and actually feeling like somebody intended to use them for something but never did.Ether One pitches itself as a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. What you get is a short-story which starts off being subtle, then gets bored and screams all its secrets at you part way through the story resulting in an anticlimactic and utterly unsatisfying ending which you unfortunately saw coming if you were paying any attention to the many blatent clues peppered throughout the game. I get the impression that the developers had all these ideas in their heads but didn't really understand how to deliver them. So to ensure players didn't miss the point they painted the 'clues' in neon pink, wrote them in capitals and also attached sirens and bells to make sure you saw them.For a game intended to convey how confusing dimentia is for a sufferer of the condition, the developers have clearly gotten too close to their source material. Because the game itself ended up being as incoherant and haphazard as the memories of a typical dimentia patient. I actually worry that they intended to make the game like this on purpose and completely forgot that it was still meant to be about having fun.I really cannot recommend that anyone hands over money for something like this. If you want to have a game like this I'd actually recommend Master Reboot.			"

												I just finished Ether One.  It's a brilliant game with an exceptional story.  It reminds me of the Adventure games of yore where it is best to take notes, make maps, draw diagrams and exam everything.  I took my time and I worked on a section at a time trying to complete it before moving on.  The puzzles can be challenging, but your note taking efforts will greatly help.  This also comes in mighty helpful when it is necessary to go back into an area.  These efforts will help to complete the game as it should be completed and the rewards for doing so are three-fold.  The story is in-depth with a lot of substance.  It's also a teaching experience.  I finished with tears in my eyes, a filled heart and a mind enveloped in wonderment.  This is, by far, one of the best games i have ever played.  Outstanding !!			"

YouTube™ Video: Let's Play Ether One - Part 1 - Joining the Ether Institute 

			Views: 26,000		

			This is part one of my blind Ether One let's play. The game is available either on the PC via Steam or the official Ether One™ website (listed below). In this episode we join the Ether Institute!		

I now write this review as I finished the game (main story). Gotta say: mind blowing. Without trying to spoil anything, let's just say the game puts you on somebody's shoes living a terrifying experience, one impossible to picture, unless it actually happens in your life at some point (hope not). It's an indie game delivering completely different experiences, the ones you don't find in most AAA games. Great adventure.			"

												Ether One is a first person adventure where you play as a restorer and it's your job to restore the memories of a patient suffering from dementia. There are two paths you can choose, one where you casually experience the story and another where you test your own mind by solving the many optional puzzles sprinkled throughout the game.Puzzles became challenging (at least for me) which I loved. The pacing of the story is perfect and I never felt rushed through the experience. I was able to go at my own pace and fully enjoy the Bioshock meets Half Life art style and the triple A quality voice acting. I defiantly recommend checking Ether One out for yourself, especially if you love a good puzzle and a look inside the human mind. Here is my video review of Ether One:

												It's not easy to properly comprehend the effect debilitating diseases have on people until you experience their effect yourself. It's easy to see them as terrible but improbable occurrences, something that clearly happens but is impossible to envision yourself suffering from. And yet, dementia scares the hell out of me. The idea that there's this invisible force that has no cure, no prevention, that will almost certainly affect you at some point in your life and only becomes more likely the longer you live somehow feels so much more real to me than cancer, or ebola, or any other life threatening disease that I could come in contact with.Perhaps that's due partly to how much dementia affects not only yourself, but the people around you. Watching your grandparents forget you along with themselves is a cold shock to reality that puts things into startling focus the way statistics and symptom lists never could. And it's the inescapable nature of something you can't predict or counteract that makes it difficult to just push the thought out of your mind that one day you might wake up and have forgotten who you are.Ether One isn't really about a hypothetical cure for dementia, or the life of someone finding slowly losing themselves to it. To me at least, it's about giving that human perspective to something in all likelihood we will all go through. Inhabiting the memories of someone undergoing experimental treatment, you travel through their life learning the events that shaped them and then watching them fall away as the disease takes hold and they struggle to hang onto even the moments most important to them.It's depressing but not in a way that makes you sad, so much as it causes you to feel empathetic as you watch a character you've become emotionally invested with have everything taken away from them. Reading through personal letters, town events, job descriptions, and fidgeting with character belongings, you get to know these characters to even their most mundane and ordinary level. Life is often unfair, but Ether One captures the sense of uncontrollable tragedy and desperate attempts at resolution that's almost painful to see because it's so understandable.Ether One has built a world so close to our own, but given it a purpose and a life that makes every scrap of paper and ordinary item feel meaningful. I wanted to know more about these characters, to pry into their emotions and personal thoughts to try and understand what they were going through, and Ether One allows you to do this in a way that doesn't feel intrusive or emotionally manipulative. You're trying to help your character remember who they are; trying to put things back together in a desperate hope to save their memories, and prove the procedure a success so nobody will have to go through something so destructiveEther One's only real problem is that it tries harder than it probably needs to to be a more traditional game than first-person exploration games are often considered, and ends up making it incredibly hard to see most of its content that it hides behind obtuse puzzles and logic that's often difficult to understand. There are a lot of objects you can interact with, but just enough which you can't that it's often incredibly difficult to know which items are for solving puzzles and which have been included just as a means of world building. My solution to this was to attempt to scavenge everything I could pick up, but that makes for an extremely cluttered and impractical playstyle that still often left me clueless when it came to solving an actual puzzle.I say puzzle, but the projectors you need to reassemble in Ether One were often more comprehension barriers than logical conundrums. I was at such a loss as to know even where to start that even with the answer typically staring me in the face it was near impossible for me to solve anything without the help of a guide. In a lot of ways it feels very much like the sort of obtuse puzzles found in a lot of old adventure games, an I imagine people missing those games will feel right at home, but in my case I was more frustrated at trying to parse an endless stream of relevant and irrelevant information than I was satisfied by actually managing to solve one.And it's a shame because it makes it extremely easy to miss huge swaths of content for those less inclined to sit and ponder solutions or look them up online, content which gave a larger context to the story that I feel is important anyone playing the game experience. Were it any other game I'd have likely given up and just skipped to the end, but Ether One deserves more than that. I felt like I owed it to the game to see all it had to show me, no matter how trivial it might be because even meaningless documents and items could eventually serve some significance. Ether One certainly hasn't dissolved my fears of dementia, but it definitely helped show me that I could be doing more for those affected by it instead of turning away because I'd rather not deal with the emotional trauma of someone you have to reintroduce yourself to every meeting. What that might be I'm not entirely sure of yet, but I feel Ether One is important for even daring bring these ideas up, and I hope they won't be lost on others who play it.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												While I appreciate the originality of the idea and theme, the execution of the gameplay falls flat. Simply put, it's boring. And when it's not boring, it's just frustrating, two qualities that will ruin a game every time. Why do I play games? For fun. This game misses that mark by a longshot. The voice acting is good. There is not much else I can say that is positive.   Despite the use of Unreal Engine, the rendering is cartoonish, stylized and outlined as if it were hand drawn. I understand if this was a creative decision, but it's a shameful waste of Unreal Engine's potential. Texture resolution is extremely low, even on max settings. Regardless of this, performance is not great, indicating shoddy construction and poor use of the engine's resources.    It is never clear what can be interacted with and what can't be, and the interact mechanic often doesn't work, so you end up clicking on something multiple times before discovering if it's static or not. Solutions to puzzles are arbitrary, counter-intuitive and make no contextual sense, so that it becomes a random guessing game with a lot of back and forth expirementing. It has that old-school Hidden Object Game feel to it, where you end up trying every possible combination with everything in your inventory. Except you don't have an inventory. You can only carry one item at a time, while other items you have collected are stored in a seperate location that requires a loading screen upon entry and exit. Why they thought it was a good idea to exchange an inventory for a stash room that requires a double loading screen for the retrieval of each individual item, I do not know. But tedious is an understatement.  If the point of the game was to get you to feel the frustration of memory loss and dementia, then it succeeds. It could have more appropriately expressed itself with logic and memory puzzles. The mind is a use-it-or-lose-it faculty, so a game designed to exercise it, while addressing the issue in the story, may have been the admirable goal of the developers. They over-reached, and fell miserably short.   Worst of all, achievements that I earned did not unlock for me. That was the final straw that prompted me to write my first ever Not Recommended review. For the price, there are many more far superior games to choose from.			"

												In this game, you play as a professional puzzle solver, who has travelled to a curious village to help a bunch of helpless villagers who have all conveniently lost the fourth slider wheel from their combination safes, broken all of their projectors, and rearranged their homes and workplaces into Myst-like puzzles. The game does a good job of capturing that classic Myst feeling of wandering around an expansive puzzle-filled area for 20 minutes, flipping a lever to test it out, flipping it back after wondering whether or not you were actually supposed to flip it yet or not, and then exploring for 20 more minutes until everything finally starts to come together. The only problem is the strange inventory system, in which instead of having a typical inventory system, you can only carry one item at a time, and have to warp back to your ""Case"" (which acts as a hub between the different maps) and place items on the various shelves in the main room to store them. It's not as inconvenient as it sounds since the transition between the map and the case is mostly seamless and the shelves are right beside where you arrive in the Case, but it's also somewhat glitchy - at one point early on, one of the safe wheels found in the Case itself vanished after I put it on a shelf and went back to the map, and it never came back. It was presumably a spare wheel since I was able to fully complete the game without it, but if it were to happen to someone else to a more important item it could be game-breaking. But the inventory system also lends towards the ""fun confusion"" factor of the game, because since a somewhat large amount of items can be picked up and stored in the game you're never as sure whether you need to use a particular item as you would be in a game where you only had three items in your inventory. This was particularly relevant in my case, since on two separate occasions the instructor gave me a friendly reminder that I could store items after picking up an item, and in both cases, that item was a bottle of alchohol. This led me to believe that the bottles might end up somehow being important, and it wasn't until the credits began to roll that I realized that there was no great alcohol puzzle, and I didn't actually need a shelf full of 30 bottles of the village's finest cider for anything other than a good time. Overall, if you like puzzle games, especially exploration-based ones, this is a pretty easy recommendation. The story is great, and the puzzles are challenging. It's worth noting that while almost all of the real puzzles are optional and completing them only fleshes out the backstory, you won't really get a good experience if you just wander around collecting the ribbons that are the only thing completely necessary to finish the game, but if you're looking for a reasonably challenging puzzle game then this is a great choice.

												This game, has to be one of my all-time favorites, amazing world, amazing story, and one of the few times I've really cried during a video game and to that I say, just play it for yourself.  But before you do play it, just some words of advice for you to get the most out of this game.  You can complete this game just by finding these ribbons throughout the game, which kind of trivializes the entire experiences.  There are optional puzzles in this game and they provide a lot of the story along with notes that you find throughout the world and both make the world feel as though it’s living and breathing.  I encourage you if you want to truly fully experience this game, complete the side puzzles and read the little bits of exposition, and if you get stuck do not hesitate to look up a guide, I repeat DO NOT HESITATE TO LOOK UP A GUIDE to 100% this game.  You get so much more out of the story, and trust me the story is amazing, it may seem nebulous at the beginning, but once you have all the info you can scrap from the world it all comes together in a beautiful narrative, that is really, really worth the time and effort.  Also if you do 100% this game there is a second ending, and it adds to story just that much more and really makes you understand everything.  Sometimes the puzzles while they are really interesting are just really obtuse, and don’t feel bad if you don’t get it, just try it out for yourself, and if you aren’t figuring it out, use a guide.  Also one big flaw with this game, there are some bugs in it, not like game crashes or graphical bugs, but things that won’t let you progress and you can’t seem to figure out why, like you just needed to re flip a lever to progress.  For this, again, LOOK UP A GUIDE, a video guide may help a bit more here, but most of the time, you won’t be able to realize the bug, but once you see how things were really supposed to go you’ll be able to see what went wrong and how to fix it in game no problem.  All that said, if you like, say, old point and clicks, or games with really deep stories, than this game is a must, but even if you don’t like those kind of games but are still interested, than still try out this game, it may be an awesome experience for you.  Really this game is amazing narratively, it's just a matter getting past the sometimes annoying quirks/bugs and getting past the sometimes fairly obtuse puzzles to enjoy the narrative fully.TL;DR: This game is awesome, but take the time to 100% it, and DON’T BE AFRIAD TO LOOK UP A GUIDE, can’t stress this enough, but if you put in the time and effort the game will give back like no other.EDIT: The Ether One Redux is included if you buy this game, which may fix some bugs and definitely will make the game run much better, as it now runs on a newer version of Unity than previously in the game.  Now I can't confirm if this will fix the bugs in it since I have not played through the redux version.			"

												This will go down as one of the best games I have ever played. Everything about it, from the great voice acting, to the nuanced story-telling, to the stunning world building. The feeling I had upon completion of this game was not unlike finishing a beloved novel. Once I am done I enter a period of post story depression, wherein I am sad the world I had been living in is now over. That is exactly how I felt after completing EO. I wish I could take my memory away of this game and play it again for the first time so that I could have the same feelings of awe and wonderment. The feelings I had were not unlike playing/completing the amazing games I played as a youth.   To point, I highly recommend this game to ANY player. With one caveat. Know that the game you're about to play has a set pace, is not an action game, requires remembering details and difficult puzzle solving, and maybe 30% of the incredible story telling comes from notes/newspapers/items/ect. you must find YOURSELF in the world of the game. This game requires and deserves your time and attention. Also, like a good book, the story and answers to questions are not all handed to you in a gift wrapped box at the end. You, like the developers trained you throughout the game, must use the pieces to solve the puzzle that is EO. If any of this sounds like the worst way to play a game, then wait until you do feel like something thought provoking. Like many pieces of great art/entertainment you need to be in the right mood. If I had just finished playing something like Call of Duty and then tried to play this game, I might not have enjoyed it as much. So wait for yourself to be in the mood for this game, that way you give yourself the best opportunity to enjoy it. Pros +Voice acting(waaaay above average)+Graphics (it has a style, and does it well)+World Building (I don't know if the town the game is set in exists, but god did it feel like a real place with a real history)+Story-Telling (There is a deliberate pace to the story-telling, and its executed superbly)+Game Play (Again it requires reading and collecting, both things I already do in any game that allows me. But it is an adventure exploration game, so there is a lot of reading/collecting)+Ending (without revealing too much, there are two endings. Both are great, but the second one, which I stumbled on accidently, left me without words and nearly in tears)+Puzzle-Solving (to say the puzzles in EO are difficult is an understatement. I had to consult a guide on a number of them. Luckily I found a guide on the steam forums that gave three hints before giving the solution so I felt like I was cheating less)Cons+ bugs (this game has them, every game has them. Luckily the ones I encountered in no way effected my gameplay)+ length (I wish it were longer. I don't feel cheated in any way, but like all good things, I just wanted more)\Bottom line - You should play this game, just play it when you’re in the mood for it.  "

												I'm one of those who really, really wanted to love this game. I heard so many great things about the story, but I never got far enough to know if it's really that good or not. The controls are terrible, the gameplay is obtuse, and the whole thing seems designed to induce motion sickness.The motion sickness was what really got me (and I see from other reviews that I'm not the only one). I play first person 3d games all the time and I never have a problem, but in Ether One I never last more than 15 minutes or so before I have to turn it off (and I get a headache and upset stomach for a long time afterwards). I suspect the main cause of this is the movement of your character. You can reduce the head bob, but you can't turn it off. More importantly, you walk *excruciatingly* slow (feels like walking underwater wearing a heavy suit), while the mouse sentivity for looking around is ridiculously high. They don't match, and the dissonance causes motion sickness. Now, you can reduce the mouse sensitivity, but in order for it to match the movement speed, you have to turn it all the way down, and then you're not only walking through water, you're also drugged and unable to move your head around.I persisted long enough to solve a couple of puzzles, but the game really gives you no guidance whatsoever on what to do, and everything is counter-intuitive. The level design is quite poor. For example, there are several points where there is a lengthy audio clip playing, but you have to stand still to hear it all, and there's literally nothing to do while you listen. No reason to stand there. So you either keep walking and miss some of the background, or you just stand there until the audio finishes feeling bored and foolish. Furthermore, for some reason you're only allowed to carry one item at a time, yet you can store as many items as you want on a shelf which is instantly accessible from any point in the game. Why make the player jump back and forth? Either you only want us to have one item (and there should be a reason for that), or you want us to have access to many items, in which case we should simply be given an inventory.It may be true that the story is extraordinary, but it's not worth the slog to actually experience it. I think there is potential here, but the problems are too severe for the game to be playable.			"

												I also fall into the ""really wanted to love this game"" camp. The overarching concept is fascinating, the presentation is very slick, and the voice acting is superb. Unfortunately, some of the puzzles are mind-bogglingly counter-intuitive, and remind me a lot of some of the worst puzzles in old point-and-click games which would have you tearing your hair out randomly clicking on every item in sight and mixing every item in your inventory with every other item. Progression through Ether One occasionally feels very much like this, which is enough to make it a truly maddening experience at times. Furthermore, and possibly most importantly, the story becomes frighteningly dull towards the latter half of the game. Whilst - again - the overarching story remains interesting, teasing apart the tiny little mundane fragments of the lives of Jean and her friends and family in Pinwheel and the surrounding areas is just painfully boring. This is a game that could have been brilliant, but just ends up being a frustrating and dull waste of a great idea.			"

												This game has all the elements that I, personally would have asked for in a game.It is a great story! I loved the whole idea of exploring memories and the human mind, it actually got me thinking of my own memories and how they are connected to people I've meet and things I own, just amazing storytelling!The art and voice acting are also great and work very well with the story.I would say that this game is great for those who like story driven puzzle games, and that have the patient and interest to really go through the story and do all of the ""quests"".Yes, you could ""just"" do what you need in order to progress, but in doing so you miss out on the whole experience.With that I hope that more people take the chance to play this game, because it will stay with you for a long time!

												I like what they've tried to do and how they've tried to do it, and wish more developers would start with the story and let that inform everything else.  It is well written and well told.However, in good conscience, I can't recommend this game because the puzzles, a fundemental part of what this game is trying to do, don't work.  Some are obtuse; some are illogical; one is actually broken.  The playtesting either wasn't done properly or the developers didn't fix the issues raised.  You can technically complete the game without attempting the puzzles, but that's like listening to a radio on mute.If the developers can improve in that area, everything else was of a high quality, and I have high hopes for their future output.

Very fun adventure game, its nice to take a break from the constant fast paced FPS games of today. Although for me some of the puzzles were on the more challenging time, I never felt hopeless like I do in many puzzle games, and the game seemed to keep pusing you along even if you coulden't figure a puzzle out. I really do like this game, and I will definately reccomend it! Can't wait to see more come from White Paper Games!			"

												If you are a fan of puzzle games you probably won't like this very much. The gameplay seems to consist of inspecting every little nook and cranny of the world, hoping that you've picked up or looked at the right things so you'll be able to solve future puzzles. The ""puzzles"" seem to consist of remembering stuff you've picked up and figuring out that you need to use it on something or put it somewhere. Having to remember things doesn't make for very fun gameplay or puzzle solving. Having to explore every stupid item and look in every stupid, boring drawer in an office or mining facility isn't very fun. Compare this to something like the Zero Escape series where you aren't having to manually wander around and just have to look at still scenes and it's clear what you can and can't interact with. I don't feel that the freedom of moving about in first person contributes much to the fun of this game; if anything it detracts from it.The gameplay is definitely ""exploration oriented"" but I don't personally find that very fun. Wandering around and sometimes getting lost in a bleak, boring mining facility while the occassional weird ambient sound plays is just annoying and I can think of many things I could be doing that are more entertaining. There were times where I was just wandering around trying to figure out how to get back to a place I wanted to go to and not being able to do it because there are so many branching paths in the levels. I'm fine if puzzles are self-contained, where all the elements for solving a particular problem are in the same, clearly delineated area, but this game doesn't do that so something on one far end of a level might need to be used with something on the other side of the map.And finally, the worst part for me, is that this game gave me motion sickness. I've played other first person games without this problem, but I had a problem with this game. I'm sure I'm not alone.If you want a fun puzzle game, this isn't that. I'm not sure what's fun about it other than a compulsive desire to advance the story (I'd rather read a book if I wanted that, considering the gameplay isn't fun for me).			"

												--- SUMMARY ---- The puzzles are moronically random and difficult. BUT you can completely ignore them (just find the ribbons) if you just want to finish the game and unlock one of the endings.- Story: Confusing until you get to the end, which means you're just floundering for hours in a world that doesn't really make sense. For me, the pay-off didn't offset the frustration I felt while playing this game (or I wouldn't be writing this lengthy review).--- ""GAMEPLAY"" ---The ""gameplay"" in Ether One is an absolute game-design abomination, breaking many obvious game-design principles. As you've probably seen from many other reviews, the majority of the game mechanics is you walking around (similar to Gone Home) solving puzzles. This isn't bad by itself (and I really enjoyed Gone Home); it's just executed very poorly in Ether One.The main complaint everyone has is the puzzles are EXTREMELY random and frustrating. As an example, one of the first puzzles you encounter has you free-form type out the answer. By free-form I mean you can type whatever you want, selecting letter or number character-by-character with zero guidance whether you're on the right path or not. TERRIBLE GAME DESIGN MECHANIC!!!!!!!! I have never, ever seen that in any other modern game. Maybe in games from the 80s, but modern game designers should know better. Now here's the kicker, you can't use your keyboard! Let me say that again: you have to TYPE the answer, on a COMPUTER, and you CAN'T USE THE KEYBOARD. WHAT. THE. F!!! Yes, you have to press up/down dozens or hundreds of times to sequentially type out a single word. If this game mechanic was submitted in a game design school, the teacher would probably smack this student up-side the head. Requiring the player to type out free-form answers to puzzles is *already* a Game Design 101 atrocity, but not being able to use a keyboard is idiocy to the absolute MAXIMUM. This kind of typing-puzzle mechanic occurs many times throughout the game and infuriated me every time I saw it.Continuing on with this same puzzle, not only do you have to free-form type the answer by pressing up/down repeatedly, but there are not one, but TWO notes a few feet away saying that this item is a ""shoe"" or whatever (avoiding spoilers). I spent what seemed like ages trying variations on ""shoe"" or ""dancing shoe"" with capitalizations etc to no avail. Finally I looked it up and (minor spoiler) you have to find the item somewhere else, pick it up, and HOLD the inspect button to find out its true name. That should tell you right there how unforgiving this game really is, with nearby notes meant to confuse and lead you astray. The amount of rage I felt for having wasted so much time for following the clearly designed notes left nearby was indescribable.This puzzle was when I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that I was in for a VERY frustrating experience. Another early puzzle has you use a wire in a place where it doesn't seem like the wire should fit at all, since the two wires are *completely* different. GRRRRRR!!! Another section leads you to a locker room where the combination is already in place. You can open/close the lockers freely but (and I'm hoping this is a bug) as soon as you change the combination by 1 number, and change it back, the combination no longer works. WHAT THE !??!??!?!?!?!?!?!I decided to press on with the game instead of just quitting, purely because I didn't want to waste the money I paid. That being said, a few hours later I found out that you don't really need to solve the puzzles (just find the ribbons). So I ignored all the puzzles for the rest of the game, hunting for the ribbons hoping to get to the end as soon as possible.--- CONTROLS ---What makes all these puzzles incredibly insanely frustrating is that the game offers zero clue on what you can interact with and what you can't. There are no colored outlines on interactive items, no clues as to when an item needs to be inspected or used, no sounds, absolutely nothing at all. I'm not looking for an easy-mode, but the game is a flat world that expects you to basically just spam your mouse buttons for hours on end because the graphics do not do an adequate job of showing what items can be used. Even worse is that there are hundreds of items that you can pick up but are never used. Having unimportant items isn't bad by itself; but when 99% of them are useless, it makes puzzle solving even more frustrating. This is worsened again by the fact that you can only hold one item at a time. Frustrating beyond belief.The controls themselves are another section where the game designer's drunkenness shows true. The controls clearly list that there are two buttons that basically do the same thing (use an item). I went into the controls area dozens of times not understanding what the heck I was doing wrong because some buttons did nothing. Little did I know that more than halfway into the game you find something and then understand why some of the buttons do nothing. Very poor game design. The controls section should either not have those buttons until after you find ""X"" or have a note that says ""Some actions may not be available until later"".--- STORY ---The main problem with the story is that you can't appreciate the story (and thus the entire reason for playing the game) until AFTER you finish the game. You are 100% lost and confused and wondering what in the heck is happening for 6-10 hours, and then the game explains it at the end. *** BUT *** that means you spend 6-10 hours in complete and utter frustration. The problem is a huge one: THAT ISN'T FUN!!! If it was a movie or a YouTube video, fine. But a game is supposed to be fun while you're playing it, or at the very least, avoid frustration. Look at Gone Home for an example of how exploration-focused gaming is done right. Things actually make sense and the story makes you want to keep playing.The other problem is that the game, before you understand what is happening, is completely and utterly just plain old BOOOOORING. I had to stop playing many times simply because I was falling ASLEEP! No, I'm not kidding. This game literally put me to sleep with its boredom on numerous occasions.Lastly, the way the game handles the ending is yet another game-design abomination. Here's a quote from the official PC Gamer review: ""The ending sits in contrast to a game of impressive freedom. In the final half-hour, Ether One forgets its free-form puzzling. It worries that you've missed the story teased at on your journey and decides to rectify that. It sits you down, bids you be quiet, and lectures on the details in a fit of exposition to rival Bioshock Infinite. It's unnecessary; a blunt-force ending to a game which should have left us guessing."" Yes that's right: the last half-hour of the game forces you to literally just sit and watch. Why not save yourself the money and just watch a YouTube video then?--- CONCLUSION ---A) Make sure you're ok with the frustrating puzzles (or will just hunt for the ribbons) and before buying this game.B) If you're ok with the preceding point, make absolutely sure you buy this on sale please. Don't get it at full price.C) I will admit that the story about dementia is somewhat of a tear-jerker and actually does make you think. That is by far the only positive redeeming quality the game has, in that it brings more attention to mental health issues.This game is overly difficult to the point of frustration. Difficulty isn't bad by itself, but how it is handled. Dark Souls is incredibly difficult, but when you beat a boss, you feel a sense of accomplishment. This game is difficult, but when I finished a puzzle, I only marveled at how poorly designed the puzzle solution was and became even MORE frustrated.I wanted to like this game, I really did. To the developer, PLEASE if you make another game, make it less frustrating. There is absolutely nothing to be gained from a frustrating experience.			"

												This game has everything an adventure puzzle game needs. It has an engaging story line, great aesthetics, and challenging puzzles. If your not a fan of the puzzles or get stuck, you are able to continue the narrative and come back later if you choose. I found this game to have great pacing (go the speed that's comfortable for you) and to be nonlinear. Some elements of this game have qualities found in triple A titles (i.e. voice acting). I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in narrative focused or puzzle games.

												There are many positives with this game, the graphics, overarching story, voice acting, are some of them. The developer has worked hard. However, there is one BUT and for those who, like me, want to chose this game for the opportunity to do puzzles then this BUT is HUGE. The large majority of the puzzles are solved by performing totally random actions. Other reviewers has used the term  'counterintuitive', which sounds like you need to think outside of the box here. This is not the case, most puzzles are just random, which can work in small games where you have a screen or two and just few items in the inventory. Here the map is huge and having to go back and for continously and interact with everything with no clue of what you are looking for or trying to achieve is exhausting and frustrating. In my case I also had a couple of bugs, which meant I had to lose +2hours of game to back to an earlier save to be able to proceed. It was luck I still have that save as you can only keep three saves. I am sorry, but I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												Ether One is a rather ambitious game that falls under the ever-popular ""walking simulator"" genre. On it's surface, Ether One seems like another stab at an Amnesia game, and whilst it does borrow alot of key features from them, it is something so much more different.I have never quite played a game like Ether One, but it is one I have always dreamed of. A compelling narrative that can be enjoyed without the need of puzzles (but there are tons of optional ones) and a story that just makes you want to keep playing and playing until you reach that ending. Despite the core narrative being rather short, you can get well over 10 hours out of this game.Whilst the game begins off rather tedious, Ether One quickly grabs you in with it's impressive story. Impressive is an understatement. It's been a long time since a game made me think, not just about the game itself, but about the value of human life, and just how fragile a thing like life is.For an Indie title, this deserves the AAA treatment. Buy this. Right now.+ Amazing narrative. One of the best I have experienced in years.+ Puzzles and optional areas are plentiful+ Looks, sounds, and is overall great+ A very ambitious project. I'm glad it managed to produce something so inspiring.- Gameplay will be boring if you don't pay attention.10/10			"

												Hands up, I never finished the game and to be honest I'm not likely to.Gameplay in Ether One is frustrating and counter intuitive.I know there is a puzzle to solve because there is a broken projector on the floor, but in order to solve the puzzle I have to first uncover what the puzzle is.To solve a puzzle I may need 1 of many items that I have picked up and deposited on the shelves of my ""Base"" because I can only carry 1 item at a time. But which one goes where? I have to teleport back and forth in the trial and error of finding the right item.I quickly encountered some game breaking bugs with some items not fitting where they should.I found the graphics diassapointing in their blockiness and flat lack of detail, and to top it all I found myself frustratinglly stuck in a toilet stall unable to get out!Other reviewers seem to love the story and gameplay of Ether One, and I am sure I am missing out, but this game is not for me			"

												I don't really know where to start with this review, other than saying this game was an incredibly touching experience. That may not be what you want from a video game, and if you're in the latter category it's probably not going to be your thing. However, if you're open to it, there's a very unique experience here that has the ability to tug at the heart strings of even the most cynical, hardened gamer. Ether One shares a lot aspects with games such as Gone Home and The Stanley Parable - that is those games which present a narrative primarily through exploration. Although similar, it has a much stronger puzzle element than most of it's peers which is refreshing and really brings it into its own. So word of warning - If you're one of those people who doesn't get the exploratory narrative genre (sometimes referred to as walking simulators) you're probably not going to find much to like here.Ether One revolves around an experimental treatment for dementia in which a volunteer (dubbed a Restorer) enters the mind of the patient. You play as one such volunteer, who apart from being a Restorer is a somewhat non-descript character. The restoration process is presented  through a combination of exploration and puzzle solving inside the patients memories alongside a hub known as ""The Case"", which is accessible instantly at any time with a single button press. Most puzzles involve a form of  ""filling in the blanks"", which entails restoring the missing parts of memories into a comprehensible whole. Everything needed to solve the puzzles is strewn somewhere in the patients memories, usually in the form of a collectible item. These items are sometimes hidden, sometimes  in plain sight, and they don't always have an immediate use. To make things slightly more complicated a Restorer can only hold 1 item at any time. The game provides a mechanism for this by allowing you to store items at ""The Case"" for retrieval when required, and you'll be wanting to stash anything that seems unusual right from from the very beginning.The memories explored are meticulously crafted, although usually jumbled and sometimes nonsensical due to the patients dementia, and they weave a thought-provoking story that will keep you guessing until the credits roll. Graphically speaking, Ether One has a hand painted feel similar to Dishonored, although it is a more simplistic art style that fits the dream-like qualities of the patients memories. The music is excellent (particularly the main theme) and the voice acting presented throughout is extremely well done.For fans of narrative exploration this is a must play. Anyone who enjoys puzzle solving should get a kick out of it too.Highly recommended.			"

												let me begin with the nutshell version of this review: Ether One will give back to you, threefold, whatever you put into it. if you take your time with this game and immerse yourself entirely in the story, the ending will likely bring you to tears. if not, you have missed out on a wonderful opportunity to have your heartstrings tugged at. Ether One is gorgeous in a thousand different ways, and although it isn't exactly a next-gen game, White Paper Games has managed to bring some incredible ideas into play. some of these worked and some of these did not, but the overall impact of the game is a positive one, bittersweet-ness included.i'll begin with what worked: the graphics had an almost Walking Dead kind of feel to them, and when coupled with the MASTERFUL ambience and audio of the game, the effect was honestly enchanting. i was concerned at first when I saw the ""horror"" tag but, although the game both deals with and alludes to very serious tragedies, it could hardly be called a horror game. when putting enough effort in, your input is rewarded in a way that truly feels satisfying, as more pieces of the story come together whenever you complete a specific task.another aspect of this game i enjoyed (albeit reluctantly, at first) was the kind of real-world puzzle-solving i've only ever experienced in Amnesia (i can't attest to the rarity of it; i only mean to say that i'm newer to exploration games). recreating the life and times of Pinwheel -- even something as simple as putting coffee on someone's desk -- is something i'll have a hard time forgetting, because nearly every puzzle was so meaningful in and of itself. the ""inventory"" system was also one that was a pleasantly odd choice: instead of having a ""bag"" or ""backpack"", the player will be able to physically store items on shelves in a small room you can instantly transport yourself to and from. this, although seeming to be inconvenient at first, really serves as a 'centering' place, and allows the objects you pick up to really and truly seem like objects of interest and not just flat tools you equip and never see again. you have the ability to misplace things (if you're stupid, like me), which really does add to the immersion, as odd as that sounds.now, onto the more negative aspects:i may just be inexperienced with these kinds of games, but the puzzles ended up being relatively difficult at times. keep in mind that the core of the game doesn't necessarily involve puzzles as much as the ""projector side quest"" does, but i was dead set on trying to get as many as i could and, therefore, did a number on myself trying to solve a thousand puzzles.my favourite area, the harbor, was followed by my LEAST FAVOURITE EVER area, the industrial area.hear me out when i say i LOVED this game, but i HATED the industrial area. this is probably a highly personal issue, but i got lost ALL THE ♥♥♥♥IN TIME and i ended up getting frustrated to the point where i had to go have a snack to calm down.granted, this frustration made it slightly more worth it in the end, but i think the layout of the area was confusing with no real signs pointing anywhere or telling anyone what to do. although this contributes heavily to the realism -- you must solve puzzles as you would in real life, which is one of this game's shining points -- it ended up being very difficult, at least for me. it was something that held such promise and followed through with a lot of it, but ended up causing a lot of frustration that pulled away from the depth of the immersion -- and the deeper you are, the more annoying it is to have to come up for air.another issue i found was actually a result of this realism: the game does not always react so realistically. moving through water has no effect (no ripples), you cannot just place things down on the floor or on a table -- in fact, if you pick something up and decide to hold onto it, you can only put it down in PLACE of another item you pick up, or on one of the surfaces in your ""home base"", or scattered sparsely across the maps. some items -- we'll say a bottle of beer, for example -- can be picked up, and others are just textures in the background. this is also quite frustrating, because when you feel like everything in the world is so real, it's jarring to be unable to touch something or move somewhere.in spite of these issues, however, Ether One is a gem of an indie game. the story is rich and compelling, unfolding itself deliciously slowly as you learn to love the characters within, the environment feels real, even without next-gen graphics -- i wanted to walk through the forests of Pinwheel more times than i could count, and if i had been able to open the fridges and see some fresh food in there, i would've wanted to live in this world forever. this game took the hours i invested into it and rewarded me with a subtle, sweet, and heart-wrenching conclusion -- it made me cry, and i'm glad it did.an easy 8-8.5/10.if you have some time on your hands, some patience, and a penchant for the enchanting and bittersweet, this is absolutely a game to pick up.

												This game is a borderline one, but ultimately I have to come down on the side of not recommending it.Tackling something sensitive and complex like Alzheimer's is ambitious, but sadly I find that the gameplay itself is confused, disjointed and frustrating and the plot doesn't make a lot of sense.  Perhaps the developer was trying to elicit those feelings to make the player experience something akin to an Alzheimer's sufferer (NB: I'm not trying to be sarcastic; I genuinely can't tell if that was their intention or not).[SPOILERS FOLLOW]You are a ""restorer"", working to restore the memories of a patient suffering from Alzheimers by reliving important events from their life in a deserted representation of a small mining town called Pinwheel.The gameplay consists of wandering around, looking for red ribbons to collect and store in ""The Case"".  The Case is a safe-haven that you retreat to when you're not delving into the patient's memories and it contains various items of importance to you.  It should therefore come as no surprise whatsoever that the patient is actually you, since these items crop up in the patient's memories almost immediately.  Despite having guessed that this was the case very early on, it didn't help me to make much sense of the plot.Once you have collected 10 of these ribbons, you return to The Case to play a music-box, which makes a door appear.  You walk through the door, slow to a crawl and point a camera at anything that is slightly colourful and take a photo of it.  This causes the scene to change subtly, then once you've photographed enough things, you're catapulted back to The Case (or something random happens) and then you move to a new area and repeat the process.  At some point you pick up a lantern that has two purposes - one; to restore/rewind some broken elements of scenery (the number of times that you are required to do this can be counted on the fingers of one hand) and two; to make things brighter.  It's also possible to miss large sections of the game entirely before you get to the ""end"".  If this sounds like a mess of disjointed ideas, it is.  There is a real problem here; the game doesn't explain itself particularly well at all, so your objective really is to just wander around and click on things.  In addition to the red ribbons, there are countless random objects of (presumably) some importance.  You can only carry one at a time, so you teleport back to The Case and put them on a shelf for later use.  Once you realise how frequently this is needed, the veneer peels away and The Case is revealed to be little more than one of the worst-implemented inventories I've ever seen in a game.Combine the ""first-person inventory"" with the completely bizarre puzzles and frustration and tedium abound.  In addition to the red ribbons, you can restore broken projectors by completing arbitrary, completely unrelated puzzles nearby.  Sometimes this means placing an item in a particular place, or using an item in some way to make something else happen.  Then presto - the projector is restored piece-by-piece.  The total lack of any indication of which puzzles do what (and the lack of a map to navigate by), make this process excrutiatingly tedious.  If you want to try to use a different item to interact with the world, you have to teleport back to The Case, swap your current item for the new one (you can only drop items in pre-determined places, presumably so it's harder to lose them), teleport back to the memory and try again.  Just in case that wasn't frustrating enough, when you teleport back to The Case, you always return to the same spot, so you have to walk over to the shelf that you want, or downstairs to look at a note that you'd only half-remembered.  Fortunately the game remembers where you were in the memory, though that does little to reduce the ridiculous amount of wandering around.  I nearly quit the game entirely after spending a small eternity traipsing around the Industrial area looking for the tenth ribbon needed to proceed.The game has some interesting ideas and there are some moving moments, but there are just too many ideas here and not enough gameplay or refinement to make it worth recommending.The ending does little to explain the plot.  Is Thomas really undergoing an advanced medical treatment to restore his memories, or is the doctor just visiting him in his care home and showing him objects from his past that trigger memories?  Does the Ether One facility really exist?  His wife Jean is presumably dead, but how and when?  Did she suffer from Alzheimer's too?  Where are all the people in his memories?  When did this all take place (Alexander Graham Bell seems to have been a resident, but the telephone was invented in the late 19th century)?  Why does picking up small troll figures cause a narrator to start recounting a children's tale?  I'm a big fan of ambiguity, but when you feel that even the developers can't fully explain things, it kills a lot of the interest.Maybe this all makes more sense if you complete all the puzzles, but the pathway to achieving that is so daunting and tedious that I just can't face attempting it - and that is ultimately the game's biggest failing.

												This review is for Ether One Redux, the ""remastered"" version of the game that's included with your buy.TL; DR: STAY AWAY FROM REDUX AND STICK TO THE ORIGINAL.After patch 1.0.4, Ether One Redux continues to be a ludicrously buggy mess.I played through most of the base Ether One without problems before suddenly finding Redux in my Library.Deciding I wanted to start from scratch anyway I decided to give Redux a try.  This was a huge mistake.Making it to the second full area of the game (after the tutorial - the industrial centre), I've encountered 3 fairly significant bugs that I've been unable to work around.First, in the mostly-unguided scene at the end of the tutorial section, there's a part where you're whisked through multiple doors.  In one screen two doors appear.  I held A attempting to direct myself towards the door on the left. The game pulled me towards the door on the right but because I had been slowly strafing I missed the door and the game got stuck.Second, the projector in Miner's Dry is uncompletable.  It doesn't matter what variation of the solution I try.  I even managed to fill all the bullet points on the map for it, still the projector remains on its side and uncompleted.Finally, every other time I launch the game the settings are reset to the default.  My texture quality drops to Medium and my language is set to Polish.While the first bug may be an edge case that's hard to run into, the other two are highly visible and problematic.  None of these bugs affected the base Ether One.  I'm afraid the improved graphics are insufficient to compensate for what is sadly still a ridiculously broken remaster.			"

												Ether One is an exploration puzzle game about the tragic story of a dementia patient.  Ether One delivers an interesting narrative, but ultimately I am not recommending the game due to poor gameplay elements.  Ether One suffers from a lot of negative possibility space.  You will spend a lot of time exploring rooms that ultimately have nothing in them. The two core gameplay objectives are solving puzzles (to learn more about the story) and collecting ribbons (to progress through the game).  There are hundreds of objects scattered across the levels.  Similar to L.A. Noire (but even more poorly implemented), a lot of the difficulty comes from determining which items are needed to solve puzzles.  The inventory system is atrocious: only one item can be held at a time. and picking up an item will put your currently held item in its place.  Items can be deposited at vault-like location that is easy to access at any time, but the player will often not know if an item is actually part of a puzzle or not.  So, if you were to pick up a puzzle item, travel a bit, swap it for another item, and then continue, you will no longer have any way of knowing where the puzzle item is located.  In addition, movement is very slow and the maps are pretty big.  You may know exactly what it is you need to complete a puzzle but end up spending a long time slowly trying to find a building or item.  Solving the puzzles is not required to progress, but the puzzles are the only engaging part of the game.Some of the puzzles are fun and engaging, but other puzzles are extremely lacking.  The most frustration came from combing the levels for items and trying to determine which items are puzzle items.  Many puzzles make you search for a needle in a haystack.  Some involve leaps of logic that are difficult to make.Ether One has some positive aspects.  The narrative and writing are good.  The environments are well crafted.  You will find notes that do a good job of describing the residents and events of the village.  The sound, music, and voice acting are all very good.Overall, Ether One is too slow paced and frustrating to enjoy.  The great narrative is hampered by poor design.			"

												I don't think I'd be going above my station to call this a mature game, both in its story and the themes it deals with, but also in the very hands-off approach in expecting the player to deal with the puzzles without a litany of hints and signposting. Though I kinda wish it wasn't quite so mature in that part, as a lot of the puzzles pretty much kicked my *ss.Playing as a ""Restorer"", you'll enter the mind of a patient suffering from dementia and attempt to retrieve their memories of the town they grew up in and the people and events that shaped them into the person they are now. Exploring a manifestation of the small town of Pinwheel during the '60s (minus the townsfolk), you'll learn a sweet and tragic tale of how its people tried to live their lives as normal whilst coping with huge losses and trying to stay productive and relevant in a bigger world that's starting to leave them behind. Gameplay comes in two distinct flavours, as there's an exploration side, and a largely optional puzzle side, designed with the intention of providing a balance for players of all skill levels allowing everyone to complete the game as hastily or as thoroughly as they prefer.These lost memories appear as large, red ribbons dotted around various places, eight in each of the four main locations you'll visit. Finding these ribbons is all that seems to be required for actually seeing an ending and finishing the story, but there are also several broken projectors in each area that can be fixed to add further layers to the story. This is done by completing a series of tasks located roughly nearby each projector, which is where the optional puzzle elements come into it, and where the game is either at its most fun or its most nightmarish.The puzzles can range from relatively simple, like finding an item and placing it somewhere, to more fiendish like assembling the digits for a code, the clues for which could be scattered throughout the environment rather than in the immediate area of the puzzle it's needed for. Puzzles wouldn't be so hard were you just looking for a single piece of information among a small pool of only necessary pieces of information that were imparted to you, but what makes this game so tough going is there's SO much information tucked away everywhere and you never know which will be vital and which is merely world-building, as both are presented as one and the same. So, for example, you may wander around an area reading lots of notes and letters that seem like everyday communiques between people about their home lives or their jobs, then later on find a wall chart that needs to be filled in and realise the answer lies in one of these earlier communiques. Now the hunt is on to retrace your steps and try to find the original letter somewhere among the labyrinthine layout of the world.I like the idea of puzzles that are interwoven like this and taking place across whole levels as opposed to the more regular, self-contained types we usually see, but if you're not paying attention or have a bad memory as I do then this will be a huge uphill struggle for you at times. In fact, sometimes it's pretty easy to walk by something repeatedly and not even be aware that it part of a puzzle. I don't know whether this was to try conveying the sense of confusion and bewilderment of dementia sufferers, or if it was just the style and approach they were aiming for, and I feel like one of those definitely informed the other, but either way the result is the same, an incredibly trying array of puzzles that will most likely have you eventually conceding defeat and resorting to a guide to finish the final steps for quite a few of the projectors.The inventory system is kind of odd as well. You have a sort of base of operations called The Case where all your gathered mission information is stored (though sadly not every letter you find, as it would have made it a lot easier as a puzzle reference), this is also the location of four large shelves which can hold 30 items each. You can only carry one item at a time, so if you think you may need an item for later but have to carry something else now, you have to press the T button to teleport to The Case, drop the item on one of the shelves, press T again to return to the same location, then pick up your new item. Thing is, you're never entirely sure what you will or won't need (just as with the information), so you end up being something of a magpie as you pick up every shiny, new object you find to hold onto for later... just in case. And, of course, more often than not the item will serve no useful function and will only be taking up space. I guess it's to add to the overall mystery just as with everything else, but I can see it not being a big hit with some players.I don't think I'd be exaggerating to say this is probably the most demanding game I have ever played, in terms of just how much the player is expected to retain, both as raw data and as physical items, and putting all the pieces together was way beyond me for many instances. But even as much as the game made me feel like a potato-hugging simpleton on more occasions than I'd care to admit, I still really, really enjoyed my time with it. Its pace is entirely at your own discretion, the story - though fragmented and at times confusing - is, by the end, incredibly touching and had me wondering what was going on and what would happen next. This is helped hugely by the outstanding writing and voice acting which honestly embarrasses the efforts of many bigger, more experienced studios. Play time seems to vary wildly among players, some report 10 hours, but depending on how much or how little you want to see and do, and the kind of player you are, it could easily be half or even double that number, such is the nature of the game. But if you're prepared to put in the time and effort, and want a rich story and some challenging puzzles among some beautiful locations, then this one just might be for you.			"

												A thoughtful, heartwrenching tale about a patient suffering from dementia, and the tragic events that took place in the seaside community they grew up in. Themes such as loss, love and the beauty of the mundane echo throughout the game, which on a full playthrough took me around 10 hours.Visual and sound design come together beautifully in Ether One. Soft, melancholic tracks complement the watercolour aesthetic, and an attention to detail gives each area a vibrant, lived-in vibe.The gameplay design is pretty intriguing. There are two main pillars. Exploration, and puzzle-solving. Exploration simply involves walking through each location, and finding all ribbons to progress the story. It's not as linear as it sounds though. These levels are sprawling. The environments tell additional stories, some self-contained, but most tied loosely with the main tale. Through scattered notes, diaries, and voice overs you learn about the inhabitants of this small, seaside town; a town that slowly lost its relevance as the decades wore on.The puzzle sections are optional, but make up the bulk of your gameplay time. As you explore, you will stumble upon projectors, which can be restored by interacting with objects and buildings, in a similar vein to classic adventure games. These puzzles vary from stupidly easy, to obtusely hard, which can be problematic if you're aching to 100% the game. I know many people find the puzzles frustrating, however, they really aren't necessary to enjoy the game's story in full. They're really more like collectables. You do the ones you can, and puzzle the rest out later if you want.It was a masterful stroke for the developers to do this. Instead of alienating players of either exploration or adventure games, both could experience the beautiful story while playing the game as either or.			"

Ether One is a narrative and explorative puzzle experience. Immerse yourself into the mind of another person and find out about their long-lost past, solve their history and help them overcome a chronic dementia.Design & ArtWhile using the Unreal Engine 3 (Redux Version uses 4), the art style is kept fairly simplistic, while still looking unique and refreshing. Ether One's visual style is comparable to ""The Long Dark"", since both games' textures essentially seem very similar with their cell-shading look. Ether One mostly shines, when you do not take a closer look into its art detail. Nothing really looks odd or bad yet visuals are noteworthy and interesting, because of their unique appearance. Overall, for a game in this genre, which mostly focuses on its storytelling (next to ""MIND: Path to Thalamus""), graphics are okay.ControlsYou can choose to control the game by standard keyboard & mouse or fully fledged controller support. Ether One delivers tooltips on how to play itself but most of the time, you will use standard first person shooter controls. I cannot rate controller support and key bindings, since I do not own one.Sound and MusicSoundtrack of the game reeled me in: Very emotional and fitting for its genre. My favorite piece played near the start and is called ""Total Relapse"". Although the musical backdrop sounds mostly shallow and eerie, I can hear that it was created with utmost love and care, being a musical creator and lover myself. Absolutely magnificent and gorgeous soundtrack created by Nathaniel-Jorden Apostol! Give this man a medal!That goes for sounds and voiceacting as well. At no time did the game disappoint me by its auditory design and I can remember a great trailer score to be most of my conviction to buy this game. Voiceacting is done nicely, the actors took care in displaying realistic emotions. Some text passages sound odd in their choice of words, yet everything is within the smaller bounds of a well done voicecasting. Awesome!GameplayEther One features a relatively well done level design with multiple areas. You are a ""Restorer"", a person sent into another persons mind to restore specific memories within their mind, that have been lost due to dementia.You can restore said memories by collecting objects within a level. Next to that, there are certain side objectives you can complete (like restoring film projectors, who offer a deeper look into the whole operation and therapy process of the person in whose mind you are currently in). You complete a level by accessing core memories and hereby accessing mysteries of the past. Various and well hidden clues and sometimes baffling puzzles need to be solved to complete these side missions. In reward, you will uncover more about the backstory. You can always come back to areas you already visited, in case you want to try figuring out that last clue you never got. During your travel through the mind, you will encounter multiple objects of interest, which you can store within your ""case"", a secluded area within the mind of the person, that you can always resort to, to go over crucial hints or review interesting plot details. Everything is tied to one location, so no objects from other locations are needed to solve a puzzle in another area, especially if you use your storage often. Choose wisely!The story is well written, cohesive and emotionally engaging; never did I lose interest or intentionally skipped parts because I knew what was going to happen. But I felt a little disappointed at the ending, maybe that is not because the writing disappointed me, guess I was just sad that the game was over. Feels were felt and need to be felt.WeakpointsNow here is the crux of the matter. As much as I admire the gameplay of Ether One, I also hate it for some of its parts. Solving some puzzles involves running and walking around. A LOT of tedious walking back and forth, since the levels tend to get bigger. Finding crucial objects you left behind on particular locations can be a thorn in your side, even more if only one instance of said object exists. You need to go back the entire way to pick up the object. I do not know if I am too stupid to figure this out, but I thought you can teleport yourself from the ""case"" to any area within the mind, but that does not seem to be the case; It only teleports you to your last location you teleported to the case from. This is enervating and should have been done differently and easier.Gamebreaking bugs still seem to exist after a batch of patches. At some point, I needed to consult a walkthrough, because I couldn't figure out what to do. I did EXACTLY what the walkthrough told me to do and STILL nothing happened, which led to desperation quickly. This happened MULTIPLE times and was really irritating for me.The achievements for the Redux Version of the game do not work for me at this time. And speaking of the Redux Version: It is a complete port of Ether One into the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and nothing more. You get it for free, which is a nice feature I guess, but I cannot see the value of this port. I actually hate the UE4, because most of the games I play which get imported from the UE3 look worse and run worse on my machine than before (the same happening for MIND: Path to Thalamus in my case).In my opinion, most of the puzzles were really tricky and challenging, some really felt absolutely unsolvable for my tastes. Maybe I get frustrated too soon and give up easily, but the some of the bugs I mentioned above really gave me a hard time. Overall, the difficulty of the puzzles is above average and needs some serious wits. A fair warning for everyone.Concluding ThoughtsEther One is a narrative puzzle experience with several explorative aspects.For what its worth, the game takes itself extremely serious to plunge you into an interesting plot and engages your gray matter. A game that revolves entirely around dementia, the changes, daily challenges and emotions that come with it all seem really well executed and realistic, even if some of the puzzles seemed way too hard for me. The game feels mature in its theme and actually seems to be directed to mature audiences. Dealing with loss, in any shape or form, is something we all have to deal with at least one time in our life. And Ether One delivers a beautifully, above-average experience of everything that comes with it. "

												I was kinda let down by this game. Its not all bad, the concept and ideas behind it are really interesting; the physical exploration of a troubbled mind, aided by a Stanley Parable-style voice over.  Though when it comes to exploration and interface it all kinda goes down hill. It seems you spend the majority of your time hoarding useless items such as bottles and spanners in an attempt to 'trigger the subjects memory' - and I find it mind numbingly repetative. After a while the story seems to become quite dry, the characters aren't developed amazingly and I begun to find it hard to care what happens next. Its a shame because the plot has enourmous potential. Maybe I havent given it enough time to develop in the coupple of hours that ive been playing, but I can't bare to carry on. An interesting game, but in my opinion not worth the $14.99.			"

												I was excited to play this game, but it turned out not to be particularly fun or satisfying. The solutions to the puzzles are too arbitrary, requiring various items distributed randomly around the environment. A tricky puzzle will have you searching and re-searching the same areas until you decide to just play a different game. The dev needed to design the puzzles with more logic and flow, or at least put everything needed to solve the puzzle in smaller areas so the player doesn't spend so much time uselessly rifling through drawers. Really a shame since I like the game's style.Also, the story is about dementia, so it's a bit of a downer, but you don't need to solve the puzzles to get to the end.Recommendation: play Gone Home instead.

												Ether One is a pretty decent puzzle game/interactive story, offering a beeline to the very end for those who don't have the patience to finish the real puzzles of the game (filthy scrubs). Those who enjoy puzzle games such as Riven or Schizm, this game is sure to impress. It'll encourage you to explore the detailed enviroments in depth to uncover deeper parts of the plot. The music, area design and voice acting are fantastic and the story is enough to get atleast two playthroughs out of you.The controls are somewhat sluggish however and it'll chew your ram and gpu to pieces. It's probably unreal engines fault more than anything. Ether One also requires a lot of back tracking and sifting through large areas to progress, so clipping on every single clutter object and shin high fence does get annoying. My pinky is tired from holding shift the whole time. As for the difficulty of the puzzles, I can't complain. Some were tougher than others, but the solutions were always surprisingly fair. I suppose going on treasure hunts for smaller items in random seemingly unrelated houses was a let down though.Completionists beware, this game has other problems. Many of the puzzles are currently pretty buggy which is a real shame, considering their difficulty and general time consumption factor. These are very much game breaking ones that'll either reset completed areas or lock you out of them by having a moving object in the wrong place on loading the area. It's a save file related problem, most likely. If these are ever fully patched out, this'll sit as one of the better puzzle games on the market. All in all Ether One is a real good package with a really solid story and world to immerse yourself in. Bugs let it down heavily.6.5/10 It's good. Check it out if you like this sort of thing.			"

												I really liked this game. I liked its visual presentation, I noticed that all the human ""actors"" were left out, I think perhaps to keep the ""cartoonish"" style out of the uncanny valley. I don't think the game suffered at all from this decision. I think the game's visuals consistently managed to achieve what was necessary for the game, and then keep going (I'm thinking of the scenes after each core memory). I read another review complaining about the underwhelming use of the unreal engine, but how this game looked never distracted me, but rather fascinated me, except for when I had to brefly change resolutions to read handwritten things (my computer isn't great, so I don't use max settings).The story is the money maker here. I'm the kind of guy that is surprised by a movie's ""twists"" when everyone else in the theatre saw it coming a half hour ago, so I'm not hard to captivate. That being said, I feel this game puts the player in a very unique position, one that generates a lot of empathy for the characters and also leaves you hunting for every last hidden bit of the story - to try to make sense of it all as your character does. The voice acting definitely makes up for the lack of character models in the game, I thought.The puzzling is alright. The puzzles don't make sense in an exactly rational way, which is why you have to remember that you're exploring a person's mind and you aren't in the real world. Each puzzle is essentially about laying an anxious thought to rest, which is very interesting when combined with the story, but if you lose sight of that you'll probably find the puzzles boring, or at least run-of-the-mill.Overall the game kind of plays out like you're living in the audio diaries that you find in a game like Bioshock, say, though they are less of a distraction, and more the driving aspect of the game. Some people love that stuff. And those people will not be dissappointed by the attention to detail and careful exposition of this game. I wouldn't play it just for the puzzles.			"

												Ether One looks like a Walking Simulator at first but it's actually more like an evolution of Myst/Riven combined with the new Dear Esther line of games. A meatier Gone Home if you like. While you will spend most of the time exploring a masterfully handpainted British coastal village of the 60s (powered by the latest Unreal Engine) getting sound cues whenever you approach something meaningful, you will have to collect pieces of the various puzzles scattered around and put them together to learn more about the story of this now abandoned village and its long gone inhabitants.While one could maintain that the environment is beautiful and extremely fascinating by itself, and the puzzles easy enough that you feel compelled to complete them even if you are usually not a big fan, it's the story that draws you in. It begins without telling you much, other than you are someone willing to undergo a certain experiment apparently dealing with memory recovery and memory loss. You enter a high tech facility and sit on a weird chair that sends you back to the magnificent Pinwheel Village and its wonderful tangle of intense, dramatic and lovely little stories. As a detective of memories, that you will somehow piece together, you will learn about a slew of minor facts and most importantly what led the village to its downfall, not to mention the most important task you've been sent to solve: who are you. As I mentioned, I don't have the patience for puzzle games anymore, but Ether One got me hooked since the very first minute. The smartest idea White Paper Games came up with is that you DO NOT really have to solve the puzzles if you don't want to. You can advance the main story simply collecting some red ribbons in the each area you visit, but it goes without saying that by doing so you will skip the large amount of content they filled Pinwheel village with. Every house has a story, every office of the mining facility seems to have some memories worth uncovering and every character you find traces of in one part of the little town might have more of his/her personal story revealed later on as the lives of all these people were intertwined with each other, and their sons and daughters, as you would expect from such a tiny community. Thing can get emotionally intense, which is a bonus for me, but never in a suffocating way. For a puzzle game this does a really good job in leaving the players freedom to play it the way they like.Took me about 15 hours to go through all the content I could find only to realize there's a whole extra section I missed that will totally make me replay the game. I feel like I am from Pinwheel too now, and I care about my neighbours or at least the memories of my neighbours, and feel bad for what happened to some of them or happy for the positive outcomes of some others. While I am sure that more expert puzzlers than me can finish the game in about 8 hours, there's much more to see and do than I was expecting from a 7€ title. The visuals are great and so is the level design, and a special mention deserves the audio department which does a wonderful job in giving life in an otherwise empty and abandoned village.			"

												I really want to like this game more than I am able to. It has very good voice acting and the story is interesting, yet there is always something missing from the gameplay. Once the game was booted up, I had to go right to the settings and turn of the annoying motion blur. The lack of detail in the objects you pick up in the game really hurt it since you will spend most of your time trying to put these things in their places. The game when you step back is just one big jigsaw puzzle that at times is fun, yet most of the time ends up being dull. You might end up fighting yourself to not stop playing in order to write down things, so you are able to solve a puzzle and progress with the storyline. At first this was charming, since it ties in with the story and games don't play like this anymore these days. But then I noticed the puzzles really don't go any further than just gathering notes and then using them to fill in the blanks. I found this to end up being boring and was the main reason I would save my progress and start playing something else. This game trys to sell itself on the idea of two play styles, one being without the puzzles, yet if you don't solve puzzles, then the story really is lacking. That brings me to the puzzles themselves, which consist of nothing more than trying to remember or add things up. Most of them are not at all difficult and end up just being a chore in order to keep the story going. The asking price is a bit much without any online or planned DLC. The game also uses an older game engine from time to time looking like it wants to be Bioshock but does not give any good reason to play more than once. I have found on more than one time the letters I picked up scattered around the game had grammar errors. This made it seem as if these were rushed and written without love. You can tell what this game wants to be and it gets so close. For ten dollars I would tell you to get it, yet what they think it is worth is far more than what you'll get for your money.			"

The world is massive and expansive, ranging from a small harbor to industrail factory. The narrative is outstanding, never making you rush or feel pushed in a direction.  And the story, holy hell is it original. Ether One, for me, will go down as one of the most memorable games I've ever played.			"

												Sometimes one should simply meditate on an experience, for sometimes to explicate is to belittle. When a game is shallow in its presentation, in the various mediums that inhabit a game, there should be no such worry. But a game can sometimes transcend what language can delimit and truly calcify itself as something, as a life-experience. Ether One is a game like that. “Life-experience” is an equivocal term, I suppose. It can be thought of in the Husserlian sense of being a lifeworld (lebenswelt), an experience through the faculties of the body, and as such an Umwelt (vaguely translates to “surrounding world”). And can be seen as the insightful nature of a learning experience. Experience in the sense of wisdom, or knowledge. With that being said, Ether One becomes a twofold experience. On the one hand it is fleshed out in its world building, the player inhabits a physical world, a consistently built world. On the other, we, as players, inhabit a conceptual/metaphorical world. We are experiencing a true fact of the world through analogy, and visual representation of a physical dilemma. It in a way elucidates the split between the behavioral experience of intention and the supposedly immanent but silent world of bodily interactions; a world of pure experience. These notions are hinted at in the game, and make for a unique world physically, and likewise a uniquely conceptual experience. A unique insight into one aspect of human possibility, especially human beings as they experience their pathological self. It was with these realizations I found myself in an unusually touching experience. I have come across many games that attempts to deal with heavy topics, but rarely do they reach my humanity, or show any humanity on their own end. Ether One, however, managed express something uniquely human. It almost perfectly delineated the confusion and tragedy of experiencing your own path, perhaps especially the world's path, towards oblivion. I would liken it to a conscious experience of death. Nothing in the world sounds more horrifying. But it is that experience wherein we swirl around as we play Ether One, I believe that is what it – in its core – is trying to put forth. And that is what constitutes the ache; the desperation of wanting to find out more when side-puzzles are offered to you that give you a small appendage that might prolong the inevitable for a moment longer. If only to have an emotional connection to an item, if only for a strip of light against eternal darkness, you fight and you ache to cling onto that something, the something of tangibility; the something of sensual collisions. To explain the fleshed out nature of this game, and its brilliant presentation is not an easy matter. It comes with playing, and feeling the impact of everything, hearing the sounds of each step on the different surfaces, of the fading sounds of memories going in and out with differing correspondence to a spatio-physical node. The point being that it feels like a lived in world, like an inhabitable place simply due to the lushness of sounds and objects. Interconnectivity is vital in this regard. There is an interconnectivity of the world itself, the levels as such, along with an interconnectivity of the puzzles and an over all cohesive narrative. It is by virtue of this threefold cohesion of gameplay, world-building and story and their fantastic interplay that makes the atmosphere of Ether One so personable and conducive to lived-experience, and that is personally what adds to its emotional impact; its closeness and solidifying of subjective-experience as actual in this particular game. At moments you are holistically immersed into this world and its stories; and that statement carries weight that cannot be applied to many games. Moreover, I think the small town setting adds to this homely feeling as well. It's a tight knit community you're reminiscing about, where the economical strife becomes that of everyone's, the family death of the other becomes your own, and so on. There's a strong positive valence in regards to the elements that make up this game. On top of the setting, there is the music that adds to this atmosphere of sentimentality and closeness. The music you play when you interact with the different instruments are jazz-inspired and soft – homely – while the background music is often somber and melancholy, sometimes with a saliently horrifying touch that adds an uneasiness to the experience in the vein of Gone Home. A lot of similarities can be discussed between the two games, but I feel Ether One elevates each aspect of Gone Home in sheer complexity and scope. While Gone Home is confined to a house, Ether One sans out over a small town, hence making certain oversight acceptable, such as not as much of a fleshed out interactivity with everyday items and their variance. Personally I much preferred the maturity of this game, its meditation on a truly scary prospect and its ability to visualize this into both narrative and environment. This is a brave game, with one of the most tragic and truthful, thus satisfying, endings I have ever played through that adds to the experience as a whole and what it in each step tries to accomplish. Precisely this makes the game feel thoroughly thought through, and executed according to a proper plan. There are few, if not no, discrepancies or discordant moments, nothing to break immersion or thought-processes that may arise while you're trying to figure out the somewhat circuitous narrative. It's a terribly pleasant experience with a great emphasis on exploration and memory, something that is seemingly simple, but that I imagine would confound most players more often than not (I could easily be wrong in this, ultimately this is a game that transcends its gameplay, rendering that possibility irrelevant). A final thing that solidifies this game as worthy of time and money spent is the writing. Many games that stray into the more emotional side of storytelling tend to be a bit too mawkish or immature in its expression for its own good. The same goes for voice acting, generally. This game avoids both of those possible downfalls, and lands itself somewhere on the scale of fantastic. Both the writing in its vocalized and written form has a wonderful flow and naturalistic feel to it. It's free from clumsiness or cliché, or arbitrarily obscure poetic language without context. It is very effective and clear, while managing to avoid inane simplicity. Ether One deserves manifold appreciation for its accomplishments, for each of its elements and how they come together beautifully to create a thing of genuine human expression. A fact of some uniqueness, both in this genre and industry.  "

												Ether One is a very different game. On the ""cover"" it is a first person puzzle adventure game. But it is much deeper and darker, where it deals with dementia and its treatment, while delving deeper and deeper in hidden memories.One particularly good aspect of Ether One is its puzzles. Most of them are tricky and difficult, but they make sense as long as you pay attention to details and explore well. There are no ""how the hell was I supposed to know THIS"" puzzles, and if you experience them, it means you missed a clue somewhere. The game looks, sounds, and feels very immersive. Graphic style reminds of Borderlands and is very pretty. Ambient music and authentic sounds for all locations are varying from relaxing to unsettling. The movement of the player feels natural and interaction controls seem clunky only till you learn how to use them.The story is written well. In games like these with unusual themes the story tends to become a mess, and even though there are points of it in Ether One that you have to think over to understand, it's a story that could be a well written novel where you need to use your brain to interpret parts of it in your own way. The game invites to this interpretation, while at the same time remaining logical and clear on the main parts of the story.Keep in mind that there are a few bugs in Ether One, so some puzzles randomly may not be solvable. I am missing a certian part of a smaller story because of this. I hope there will be more patches fixing those. The game is dark and emotional, and probably one of the most ""grown up"" games that exist out there. This was an experience I won't forget (hopefully no pun intended). Strongly recommended to anyone who is into psychology, thrillers, good puzzle solving, and anyone who likes getting immersed into atmosphere-filled environments.			"

												it's a fine puzzle/exploration/item hunting game with some nice sceneries and an allright story, but it's kind of ""meh"".the hidden items across the maps which you are supposed to look for make the gameplay too much of a nuisance. it would be much more fun if it were more about puzzle solving than easter egg hunting. i mean, it's not very interesting wandering around maps and trying to find the god damn missing items you overlooked when you walked past exactly same spot for the 4th time. you know, the kind of feeling like when you're trying to finish something on 100% and it's not about fun anymore, but more about ""having to finish it"".i actually quite liked the mining and town episodes but the boring factory level got me so annoyed and lost in a maze that i never finished the game and uninstalled it.don't get me wrong, i would give it a decent 50% if i could but steam only lets me either down or upvoteso downvote from me, i have better things to do on my hand than being annoyed by overly motivated level designers			"

												I love this game. I am a fan of exploration games and puzzle games and this game has all that in spades, however it also has a fantastic story that is subtle, expansive and well told, evocative sound design, detailed art that makes you want to search out every corner of the game as Myst did, professional voice acting which is so often a let-down in games, and an ending that I'll never forget. Thinking back to the start of the game I would never have expected the story to end as it does, and each point on the path is delivered with great skill by the developers. The soundtrack is also worth listening to, aside from the game. It's great value for money - I had nearly 25 hours soaking it all in and I imagine I will play through it again at somet point. Thoroughly recommended!			"

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Ether One 

			Views: 163		

			Ether One is a exploration lead story told adventure game on Steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/265950/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is your thing:...		

	Ether One is an adventure walking simulator, puzzle solving game.  You play as a restorer going into the mind of a person with dementia.  It does a good job of incorporating you into the game, but also keeping you separate,as you are involved in the story, but not personally tied to it.  As you walkthrough the different atmoshperes, you interact with both your 'handler' and theperson whose mind you are in.  	The level design is fairly large and multi-layered, with plenty of areas to explore, which ties into the story well.  There's not just a linear path;  ithas weight and atmosphere, which lends to the aesthetic of the environment.  It feels like everything you are seeing is new.	The puzzles however, which for the most part are optional, tend to bevery repetitive.  It's a lot of memorization as opposed to using your wit andcleverness to solve an issue.  While the levels are vast and the story isentertaining, the repetitiveness of the puzzles takes away from immersion intothe game.  	If you really enjoy the walking and exploration genres of games, this could be a game you would enjoy.  If you are new to this type of game, the negatives may take away from enjoyment of the game.  It comes down to what typesof games you enjoyThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watchif you are looking for a more in-depth review.Thanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:http:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												This review for both the original Ether One and the somewhat updated Ether One Redux.  The games are nearly identical with a few subtle improvements in the Redux version.  If you just recently bought the game from Steam, you'll find both games in your library, so you should probably play the Redux version.  If you played the original some time ago, there's no compelling reason to play again with the Redux version.  Unless you have a really keen eye for subtle differences, you won't notice any difference between the two.  I'll mention the differences later on.At its core, Ether One is a puzzle game.  You start out seeming to be a patient in some sort of psychic treatment facility for dementia.  But you soon learn you're actually a staff member, a ""Restorer,"" who uses newfangled technology to enter a visual representation of the patient's brain to reconstruct her memories by solving puzzles to repair old-timey film projectors to play those core memories back.  Future plot twists occur, but there's no compelling reason to spoil them for you in this review.   The patient, in this case is Jean who is suffering dementia related to some sort of accident in a mine, but we don't know a whole lot of details yet.  These aren't really spoilers because I haven't told you anything yet that you don't learn very early in the game.One of the problems I had at the start, is that the menus start in English the first time you play, then they turn to Swedish (at least I think it's Swedish) on subsequent continues.  In the non-Redux version, I was able to randomly click on Swedish menu words until I got it back to English.  But then it decided to switch back to Swedish at some later time, so I left it.  Except for the menus, it doesn't make any difference inside the game what language you choose.  The Save Game screen is pretty obvious regardless what language it's in, so that shouldn't be a problem for anyone.  Unfortunately, the Redux version starts in English and then witches to Swedish the next time you play.   Even if you stumble upon the slider that selects the language and set it back to English, it stays in Swedish.  The subtitles are also in Swedish, but at least the voices are in English.  This is the only real complaint I have about the game.One thing I like about Ether One is that the harder puzzles are optional.  Yes, if you can't or just don't want to bother solving some of the more difficult puzzles, you can ignore them and continue the story.  You miss some critical story dialog by not solving them, and so may find the ending confusing, but you can proceed to the end of the game without solving them.  I had to give up part way through The Talos Principle and The Turing Test because there was some parkour-like elements involving running past floating bombs and flipping switches quickly and then running across bridges that required fast reflexes; I knew the solution to the puzzles, but I just didn't have fast enough reflexes to do them, so I was never able to finish those two games.  So thank you, Ether One, for letting me skip some puzzles and get on with the game :-)Of course, the downside of this is that the first time I played Ether One, I screwed up a puzzle (one that opened up a lower level of the mine), and had no way to reset it to try again.  Because of that, I skipped over playing an entire level of the game, which I didn't even realize I had done until I finished. I also like that Ether One isn't completely linear.  The major levels take place in sequence, but each level is largely open world and lets you explore freely and solve the puzzles in whatever order you want; kind'a like The Talos Principle.  Except for the very end sequence, once you open a new level, you can go back into prior levels if you want to try solving a puzzle or two that you missed or gave up on earlier.One thing that I thought could have been executed better was the ending.  Without giving any spoilers, I will say that it suffers from the same sort of design that a great many indie games suffer from:  the ending level is largely walk along a linear path under player control, watch a long drawn out cut scene, get control and walk along another linear path, watch another long drawn out cut scene, rinse and repeat, ad nauseum.  The exposition brings closure to the story arc, but isn't good game-play in my opinion.  It's like they got close to to the end of the game, and then rushed it to completion rather than fleshing out how it could have actually been ""played"" to the very end.So despite a couple of minor quibbles, I would say it's very well done and worth playing.  It even has replay value to play again to solve some of the puzzles you may have skipped the first time.  I would highly recommend you play through first without watching any Let's Play videos or breakthroughs; you'll skip and/or miss some puzzles (and maybe entire levels), but that's okay.  Then play a second time with a walk-through to play all the levels and get all the puzzles and collectibles -- there's these little Ogre statues that you can collect, and...What are the actual differences between Ether One and Ether One Redux?  Well, there's one elevator that had a button on the wall; the elevator doesn't work and the button doesn't do anything.  They removed the button on the Redux version.  In the original version, you can only pick up items related to solving a puzzle.  In the Redux version, you can pick up almost any item, regardless whether it's useful to solving a puzzle or total decoration.  The Redux version has more ambient background sounds and sound effects; for example, you flip a switch and you hear machinery starting in the distance, which can be an aid in solving some puzzles.

												A good story and setting augmeted with good voice acting gives this game a lot of promise, but the item hind-and-seek sort of mechanic for progression, which I assume is an attempt at pushing exploration, just ends up being frustratingly boring.  A common problem in these types of games, but it's especialy noticeable here.			"

												You don't need to go into Pinwheel Village’s blacksmith forge and learn how, during the patient’s youth, blacksmithing within the village began to stray from indispensable function to obsolescence. Or how the smith slipped quietly into depression as he watched his chosen trade slowly die. You learn this if you do explore, though, from the narration offered by the doctor as well as from a voice more directly linked to the memories. One approach offers facts and the other insight, talking about how heartbreaking it was to see the smith retreat into himself over the years, despite still being able to produce items of immense beauty that he would sell to try and eke out a living. The tale of the smith is largely irrelevant to Ether One’s plot, but it’s absolutely vital to the world the game attempts to build.Full Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12626/pc/ether-one/review.html "

												Months later, the imagery of bright crimson ribbons sitting on posts, starkly contrasted to the small mining oceanfront village, still sits at the forefront of my mind. The minutia, the lore, the style- still sticks with me, a handful of games later. I'm fond of this one, I would recommend it. I sat with my thoughts on it for a while, since I had not determined whether or not I felt it worth recommending. Despite the potent, vivid, beautiful imagery, we're left with a story, that I did not find satisfying at first. The framework, the conceits, the guises, are simply excessive for the story they want to tell. this game is like an elegant tapestry, with many frayed strings, obscuring the main image. If you can look through them, the plot holes, the obtuse leaps of logic, the over the top ending- it's simply put. beautiful.And, months later- I figure it worthwhile, to leave it a positive review. Since that's what I took with me, the beauty in such darkness.			"

												Pro+ a modern 3d Myst world - awesome. + good game design. Eg. meta-world to store inventory is clever+ no-hand-holding makes it feel like you are exploring+ great story with themes of [not going to spoil it for you] + wonderful graphics+ Voice Acting is good+ probably an amazing Occulus Rift game+ intriguing background story to discoverUnfortunately there are problems that cripple the game:- a few unforgivable Bugs (now fixed)- most puzzles are find-the-hidden-object to progress- some puzzles are arbitrary - - (eg, a particular door must be closed for a puzzle to continue)- - (tin & iron puzzles: one with reference sheet adjacent - now fixed at village)- - (all suitcases in the game are static except for one in the mines)My main problem with Ether One is that sometimes it is arbitrary, the antithesis of a good puzzle game. In some puzzles there is no clear indication you have made progress because the overall area puzzle is just a bunch of unconnected tasks. This leaves you with no clue about what you should be trying to achieve because of poor puzzle design.I would have said Ether One is a 9/10 but for some really stupid bugs and other issues, so an 8/10 from me. If you have no patience and/or you dislike adventure games, then it would be a 7/10.			"

												I saw an intro on Extra Credits and was drawn in by the graphical style. I started playing and stayed because the story was so strongly working on the theme of altzheimer and dementia. The story really showed me how a world could look like if you have to deal with such destructive diseases that leave a person physically fine but cause so much struggles. I have completed it, and did a rerun the next week because I couldn't let it go.			"

												Buying this game gives you two versions, the original and a rebuilt redux version; I played the redux version so all opinions expressed here are based on that version.I bought this game months ago in the sale and by the time I came to play it I had completely forgotten everything about it so I started playing it with absolutely no idea what to expect. This is an excellent way to appreciate the narrative; throughout the game you find notes and audio clips by exploring and solving puzzles which allow you to gradually piece together the story.The levels are quite large and intricate. The visuals are pretty good and the voice acting is excellent.  The exploration part of the game is great and some of the puzzles are great however many of the puzzles are overly obscure. But overall I am still giving this a thumbs up as the story more than makes up for having to look up a walk through for the difficult bits.I did encounter a number of bugs whilst playing. None of them were significant but I am going to list in detail as the developers seem very engaged on the community hub and responsive to feedback.- The game switches to Polish every couple of times I launch the game.- The texture detail reverts back to medium every time I launch the game. This is particularly infuriating as one of the puzzles near the start of the game requires  you to read a number off the back of a plate but the number is not visible at medium texture detail.- Most of the achievements don't work.- The trading cards only drop when playing the original version not the redux version- The miner's vigil projector wouldn't trigger after lighing the correct number of candles.- The piano won't play for the church projector, This is possibly because I saved my game whilst the tuning animation was running.- After triggering the plaque in Pinwheel village, I was stuck in the room with the red chair by the fire. I had to go back to the cage and travel to a different area and after that I was unable to jump. "

												A pretty decent and pretty challenging game. First thing I want to mention is that I seen some reviews of this game where people were saying this game was easier than MYST. Absolutely not true. I played MYST when it first came out and played REALMYST last year, and this game is alot harder. When looking at the achievement rate of completion, none of them are over 20%. They also state that if you can't solve a puzzle, you are missing something right in front of you. Again, not true. So if you are getting this game because of those types of reviews, nix that real quick.Now as for the game, you arrive at the Ether One Institute and you are what are to be what is called a Restorer. You are brought in to go inside of a patient's memories and find their core memories and help them escape their dementia. You are guided by a doctor (whom has a very soothing voice)  as she tries to help you figure things out. As you get deeper in the story, you find out many news truths that reveal more truths. You are going through 5 different areas solving puzzles so you can move on. Trying to solve the projector puzzles are very difficult and you sometimes to have to go all over the level to find your clues.Graphically sound with some nice sound effects add to the ambience of the game. SPOILER ALERT: You do not have to solve the projector puzzles to beat the game which I thought was wierd. Just find the 8 items you must find on all levels and you can get to the last level. Also, 1 level you don't even have to go through. So easy game to beat, unless you want to do the projector puzzles. Challenge is about a 2 out of 10 w/o puzzles, 9/10 with the puzzles.Also, not sure if it still does, but when the game was made for consoles, they also included the updated version (Ether One Redeux) with your purchase. I started by playing this version, but the next day it changed from the English version to one of the other languages. And even though the settings say English, it wouldn't go back, so bummer there.Solid game if you do everything.			"

												If you can finish the puzzles in this game without the occasional (or frequent) glance at a guide, you should probably stop playing games and start a career in Brain Surgery or Rocket Science.In all seriousness however, Ether One is a fantastic experience. With a captivating story that focuses on something very real and scary, Ether One had me hooked the whole way through. The voice acting and soundtrack played a huge part in the success of the story also, both excellent. Graphically, the game is pleasing with some nice diversity in  locations.While the puzzles seem overly intricate and unintuitive, they are completely optional to progress through the story (bar the first one) and they serve a purpose. Dealing with a topic such as mental illness, it seems as if the puzzles were designed in such a way that you would feel lost trying to figure them out, like a real patient searching for lost memories. Naturally, struggling through puzzles may not appeal to everyone, yet there is a lot to be said for the feeling of solving a puzzle, using an item you obtained hours previous. (Any item you find can be stored in the main hub for later use.)To those interested, there is an excellent community guide by Steam user 'Crinkle' called 'Ether One - Complete Guide'. Instead of simply giving you the solution to the puzzles, this guide provides hints to help you get through them yourself.I encountered a few bugs while playing, but they were mainly graphical and did not hamper my progress in anyway.

												First off, let me say this:  If you're looking for a mindless, button-mashing type of game where you can vent your frustration on a hapless 12 year old kid (who is apparently also your father), this game is not for you.  If, on the other hand, you are looking for something to challenge your intellect both via in-game puzzles and through a touching story, then by all means, take my recommendation and play on, Restorer.As this is an independently developed game, I was prepared to grant some leniency for in-game errors.  Imagine my surprise when none was needed.  Sure, you may have some slight clipping here or texture issues there, but I have personally experienced far worse from AAA-developed games.  Early in the game's release, bugs seemed to be relatively commonplace.  After my playthrough, I believe that the vast majority of them have been addressed in an adequate manner;  I experienced no faults throughout my time in the game.  That having been said, let's get into the categorical scores.GRAPHICS:  8/10Not terribly graphics-intensive, but then again that wasn't the emphasis of the game.  If I had to describe it, it would be Minecraft meets Fable meets Borderlands.  The effective use of cell-shading and traditional art styles really gives the game a unique look that oozes style and mystery while still being relatively believable.  As mentioned above, there were some slight graphics issues, but on the whole seemed really well polished.  I'm giving it 8/10 because I feel that with a bit more work they could have made the game just a *wee* bit more realistic, which would have added to the immersion factor.ATMOSPHERE:  9/10Very unique locations help the game's immersion.  Mines, lighthouses, harbor towns, industrial complexes, forests and laboratories; this game covers a wide variety of terrain, and does so well. The artwork helps blend them together into a seamless backdrop for the story.GAMEPLAY:  9/10Gameplay was smooth as silk.  The game ran fine on my laptop, which is by no means a dedicated or optimized gaming rig.  You should have no issue playing this on a desktop.STORY:  10/10Allow me to preface this by saying I wish I could give it 11/10.  Oh wait, I'm the author of this thing, so yeah, I CAN do that!  The story is brilliant.  The mechanic of dementia is not a common element in video games today, though if it is, it is most likely used in the horror genre.  The game sets you up on the path to unwinding the story and lets you go at your own pace.  There is no time limit, no pressure, nothing to compel you to complete it except for your own desire to know how the story ends.  I don't want to give anything away, but I will say this; the ending is well worth the time and frustration of figuring out the optional puzzles.TL;DRGreat game, thoroughly enjoyed it.  Puzzles left me thinking about the game even after I quit playing, and the compelling story kept me enthralled.  Refreshing change of pace from my usual games.  If you're on the fence, I recommend going for it.			"

												This one really flew under the radar for me but I am glad I stummbled upon it.  Its a first person adventure game where you begin in a research facility whos main purpose is to study dementia/phsychological issues in various patients.  You are conscripted and given access to these patients most distressing memories in hopes of curing their psychoses. An omnicient female voice interjects various background info as you work your way through the memories.  This aspect, along with the research facilty reminded me of portal 2, but dont think the entire game is spent within the research facility, to the contrary, most is spent exploring rich environments within the memories of the above mentioned patients.  In terms of game play, movement is tradional with the ability to jump, sprint and crouch.  You use a ""crosshair"" dot to interact with various items in the game i.e open doors pick up items etc.  Now concerning inventory, this is where its a bit different than most adventure games i have played.  Typically you have an inventory bar right.  In Ether One you are only able to pick up and hold 1 item at a time.  So how does this work?  Their is a central room within the facility which allows you access to the patients memories.  This is the launching point for every ""memory"" walk.   The room is ringed with shelving which acts as your inventory store.  When in a memory and you pick up something of interest you press ""T"" and it teleports you back to this room where you drop of the item.  At first I was like wtf but it works surprisingly well and really immerses you in the background story as well as keeping your screen free and clear of clutter. Also of note - only when 1 memory walk is completed can you move to the next.  You have no choice in this regards everyone starts with the same one.The environment is beautiful and up to now void of any life expect yourself and the female voice in the sky. Think Myst in terms of serenity and overall feel.  Welcoming but earie at the same time.  The art style within the memories immediately reminded me of orcs must die.  Its more cartoony than realsitc and gritty.  This is neither a positive nor a negative just an observation.  I have yet come across a ""true"" puzzle i.e. circuit puzzles, contraptions etc. They seem to be more interactive enviroment type challenges. If you have ever played the pnumbera series, kind of like that.  They are logical but hard enough to be fun and challenging.  The memories are also fairly linear so you are not running back and forth between memories and the facility to hunt for missing clues.All and all I highly recommend this game to any fan of the genre.  Enjoy!			"

												This game is something else let me tell you. Firstly, it is a very good game and worth the buy. I like to call it an extreme puzzle game. You can solve the main story / smaller puzzles very quickly. However, there are 20 extra puzzles you can try and fail and fail and fail and somehow magically succeed to put together. The puzzles don't really have hints. You just try a bunch of different things and throw it together. But it's new and frustrating and makes me want to rip my hair out while saying ""of course you write on the sheet of paper based on some other paper who may have read, of course."" The difficulty of the puzzles adds so much to the game. You'll learn more about all the characters and even the town. There is notes you can read and collectibles you can find. The voice acting is great, the story is heartwarming at the same time heartbreaking. The graphics are superb, audio is wonderful and the different places are really cool to explore.There are some downsides. For one, the game doesn't have enough music for me. Some will come on a play but that happens mostly when you're playing for the main part and not the side puzzles. Since I spent most of my 12 hrs on those puzzles,  I needed to play music myself because I got bored. Another is the fact that the puzzles aren't thoroughly explained. It does give you a small tutorial but you really have to simply play for long periods of time to even get the gist of the side puzzles. One part of the game I thought I would hate actually turned out a plus for me which is the inventory. You can only carry one object at a time but you can teleport back to a home base and store a ton of items. It became a sort of game. Filling each shelf with the same object I found through out the game. And it was really cool to see how those random objects came into the main story. Yes, I fully recommend it for those who like a challenge and a very pretty game.			"

If you weather through the difficulty, or use a guide like I did, its got a narrative with lots of heart, and a joy to experience to its conclusion.			"

												Ether One tasks the player with diving into the mind of a patient with Alzheimer's Disease, and using the power of the recently discovered science of telepathic medicine to seek out and destroy the amyloid plaques causing the dementia. What follows is  puzzle-exploration game where you explore locations from the patient's past and seek out their memories in the form of ribbons and optional projectors all while the patient's past is slowly unveiled.The game's puzzles range from the somewhat obvious to the incredibly obscure, to the point of its detriment (you may well go through entire areas being unable to solve any of the optional puzzles), especially when considering the projectors ultimately lead to a longer ending (I'd advise anyone who wasn't able to 100% the game to at least view the bonus ending on youtube).Trying to complete the projectors, which really are the meat of the game regardless of how optional they are, leads to long segments of backtracking and trying to work out red-herrings. This is a shame as they also carry a large chunk of the narrative along side all of the puzzles.There is also a segment of the game, the Mines, which can be entirely missed if you do not spot the entrance along the path of the river. Missing 1/4th of the game by accident was a rather terrible design choice.The graphics are also not stellar, being the clear product of trying to leverage a small art budget as well as possible and muddy textures are omnipresent. Although it does its best to mask the low fidelity through a painterly art style.Music, voice acting, and sound design are very well produced however. Although until you've completed an area's projectors you will not see the sound design in its entirety. When you've fully completed an area it gains back the sounds of life. Children laugh, miners work their machines, and pubs announce closing time.The game ends fittingly for its chosen subject matter, straying away from tasteless fantastical elements which could have been present. It did not surprise me in any strong way, but it was emotionally effective.8.5/10 -  A game with great narrative strengths, but weak and occasionally obscure gameplay design. Play it, but have some walkthroughs on hand.			"

												This could have been one of my top favorite games. I found it extremely beautiful and creative...I wanted to play the whole thing in one night. Alas, technical difficulties. I had several bugs throughout the game which just meant I couldn't do all the puzzles...I was okay with that. Unfortunately, I'm now glitched at a spot I can't get past and won't be able to finish the game. My computer has been able to run every other game I've bought on Steam, so I didn't think it was particularly terrible.  I am incredibly disappointed, and I hope these issues will be addressed.			"

												This game, I believe, is fantastic. I bought it because the trailer looked interesting and it did not disappoint. The main storyline itself takes about 3-5 hours, depending on your pace, but if you do all the little extra things it takes quite a bit more. I do not think this game was boring at all. Sometimes frustrating, as all the puzzles aren't completely obvious, but I think that is what makes this game a truly great game. You actually have to think and recall things. They don't lead you around by your hand and make everything obvious. Throughout the game, I got both endings and all 20 projectors. I sincerely recommend everyone do the same. You get so much more of the story and a great feeling by the end of it. The only issue with this game I've seen is if you are trying to listen to the voice recordings for the projectors again, sometimes they don't play and you have to restart the game. I also heard of someone glitching through a gate they weren't supposed to be in and missing a part of the game so they had to go back. Otherwise, it is a fantastic game.			"

												Well, just to give you the context, I'm crazy about first person narrative driven non-violent puzzle games. My Top 5 all time includes Talos Principle, Mind: Path to Thalamus, Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Portal 2, and, say, Naissancee. But this game is not up there, imho.  For me, it started out very well. I managed to solve riddles one by one using no walkthroughs. It felt natural and empowering. However, it got tougher. Much, much tougher. And I didn't want to go through without solving puzzles - which is an option in this game - because when you do, the game starts resembling Dear Esther, which I didn't like at all... But the main problem was the lack of motivation to press forward (i.e. to look for walkthroughs) to see what happens next. Maybe that's because I have no relatives with dementia, or maybe because I myself have it, I don't know ;)Anyways, there were also graphics. Not impressive, imho. And incredibly slow. In the age of Ethan Carter, technical implementation like that does not deserve more than 5/10. And now it's redux (I played the original), so probably even slower (did not try).That's more or less it. I agree with one of the reviewers that a somewhat simmilar Master Reboot is more engaging, even though the graphics there are actually even worse than in this game. Sure, if the price suits you, try it. Many people loved it, so maybe you will too.p.s. I've played this game at least a few times longer than my Steam record suggests. This counter used to be seriously broken in the past, maybe still is.			"

												Ether One is a pretty fun, but frustrating game. I completed the game by only solving a few puzzles, because most of the puzzles make you think outside the box, and for that, you also need other objects that you pick up in later or earlier parts of the game. I learned to watch more gameplay and look at more reviews of what the game is actually about before going for that impulse buy ""must have"" game.			"

												The story is broken and unclear, yet a wonderful tale with what it tells you even before that. This game is equal parts walking simulator and puzzle game. You are under no obligation to solve all the numerous puzzles that outline this game, so many that even I had to stop and think for half an hour or so. If you're familiar with To the Moon the idea is relaively the same, but taken to a higher degree.Either One takes place in a particular mind plagued with dimentia and the process of finding the way to undo it all from within. Although it's a bit curious at times with how everything works and especially finding all the sections of the knocker story this game is about exploring and finding every little nook and cranny.Either one is a game that curiously not just conveys the memories of someone with mental illness, but the affect it has on immediate family with what appears to be phone messages to someone about the patient in particular. There's even quips about how this case could be the one to secure funding for the company as their methods are considered unsafe or inconclusive. The story is a lot more than just the patient and their backstory, and feels just wide enough to make the epilogue feel like a solid ending that is happy if a little bittersweet at the implication of just what happened in the patient's past that they can no longer seem to remember.

												For the most part, I really enjoyed this game. I found many of the puzzles to be challenging and unique, loved the style, and thought that the story was intriguing. Personally, You come across many clues & hints that you don't necessarilly need right away, so I recommend using pen & paper. Also, the way in which you store items is original!I had one big issues with this game. I purchased the original & the redux versions. I assumed that the redux version would be best so I began my game with that. I got probably about 3/4 of the way through the game (in the redux) and came across a glitch w/ a coffee machine. Due to this glitch, I can't continue on without restarting because I don't have a save file that can help me, which sucks. I really wanted to finish this game, but for the time being I'm not restarting.tl;dr: Use normal version and NOT the redux version. I have read numerous places that the normal version is less buggy/glitchy.			"

												I bought this game as part of a Humble Bundle, and for the record I bought the bundle nearly exclusively becasue of this game! I have now played through (a bit slap-dash as I've missed some bits) and finished with *an* ending and I must say this is a WONDERFUL, insightful, challenging, and creative game - to say the least!  It is possible to play through without silving the puzzles, but I think FAR more rewarding to complete them! I must say, this is one of the BEST 1st person adventure games I have played in a looong time. I grew up on this genre and it tends to be my favorite. Once I go back and complete the bits I missed I don't know what I'll do. I already want more of this game, of this story and its characters before I've even completed all of it. Really high praise to the devs, you all have made a really fabulous game here, I'd love to see what else you come out with!Highly recommend the game!!			"

												Revised and extended review:Exploring another persons memories like in the movie The Cell sounds like great premise for a video game, Ether One is the first game that truly lives up to that idea.Now I know that the majority of people have never heard of Ether One, it went completely under my radar until it showed up in a Humble Store sale and the trailer had me sold immediately. Thankfully the game itself also lived up to my expectation. The closest relatives to it are games like Dear Esther and Gone Home, which I both liked but weren’t really challenging or what some people call ‘traditional games’.Ether One is in my opinion the better game. The story a bit tricker to figure out though but instead of one house like in Gone Home you have a small town on your hand.The beginning is a bit odd, but once the games opens up it starts to shine. Ether One also proves once again that video games don’t have to offer traditional mechanics or violence to offer a deep and rich experience.The main gameplay involves the player solving puzzles by picking up items, inspecting them and trying to find clues and hints in the environment. There are no NPC to guide or distracts you, the environment is the true main aspect of the game.From the moment you step into the town of Pinwheel you can see with how much love and care the world has been build. All the puzzles have a purpose in the context of the town itself and don’t feel forced or just there to be an obstacle for the player. This becomes even more apparent as a majority of the puzzles are actually skip able and completely optional.Their difficulty levels vary but figuring out the creative way they are tied together is what makes Ether One truly shine and will keep you coming back till you solved them all. The moment when you realize a connection and solve a puzzle because of it is almost as good if not a better feeling than defeating a boss in another game.Weeks after beating it I still think of the feeling of being in Pinwheel and the time i lost sleep thinking over how a certain piece would fit in a puzzle. I can recommend Ether One to everyone who likes atmospheric games with challenging puzzles and who can appreciate subtle storytelling.			"

												An underknown gem, this game is a beautiful combination of clever mind-bending puzzles and deep, thought-provoking narrative that, at it's conclusion had me in tears of both joy and sadness.An exploration/puzzle game that heavily relies on ""dream-logic"", most of the puzzles are actually completely optional. The game simply sets you down in the world and lets you discover what you want to at your own pace. Each puzzle gives you small tidbits about the town and its inhabitants, allowing you to become as invested in the game as you want to be.While definitly not a game for everybody, I highly recommend giving this game a try.

												I've started playing this game, haven't gotten too far yet but really enjoying it.  As someone who doesn't usually enjoy exploring in games, this one is an exception, I've found myself enjoying the exploration side of the game and checking every corner.  From what I can see so far the game is full of puzzles and mysteries and it's your job to work things out.The sound is really nice in the game, I found it quite immersive walking around in different locations and the art style is really really nice, I love how from a distance things look pretty realistic, but up close it's as though everything is drawn and painted onto the world, it really seems to fit the game and is an excellent design decision.I've started a playthrough on YouTube if anyone would like to watch my first impressions:

Every now and again, I come across a game that exceeds all expectations I have from it, Ether One is one of these. It’s a first person puzzle adventure game brought to you by White Paper Games and my first impressions of the title were fairly average and nothing could have prepared me for the experience that lay ahead. An absolutely fantastic game that is worth your time, IF you enjoy the first person ""walking simulator"" puzzle/narrative genre. :)			"

This game is actually the perfect example of choosing the wrong medium. If this were a short story I had read, it would have been amazing, but as an interactive medium, it just fails due to lack of interaction that has any meaning to the central game.

												Game is worth checking out if it's on sale.It's essentially a walking simulator where you're slowly unraveling the story line as you pick up and make sense of memory fragments. The mystery of what you're doing is revealed later in the game and makes it all the more interesting if you happen to replay it. Suddenly things you overlooked towards the beginning make sense. The puzzles aren't all too difficult and can be fun to figure out, although the hardest puzzles simply reward you with more character development so it may not be worth it if you are not as invested into the characters as I was. This game is something that appeals much more to storytelling than gameplay. It reminds me of playing through To The Moon. As it can get slow at times, I only recommend it to other people who are able to push through drab gameplay in order to complete the storyline. The story was touching enough to make it very worth it in the end.			"

												8/10 First Person Puzzler. Hard. Walkthrough Hard for at least the first 50%... but If I had known I still would have purchased it.... It is very easy to mess up a puzzle by carrying an essential item from one part of the map to another.... beware. These maps are too big for the players own good.... and this hurts the game.Also this suffers from the problem of ""Guess what I am thinking...."" Steam should allow me to rate a game out of ten.... like metacritic.... And keep the thumbs up/down option.... "

												Its an excelent game and gets really addicting. Set in a beautiful world its full of puzzels you must solve in order to restore the memory of a patient and its really good at connceting you with the character you are helping. It's challenging without being completly impossible and always has small hints to make sure you don't get completely stuck. Worth playing.			"

												This game is for people who liked the narrative of Dear Esther or Gone Home. It's also for people who like puzzles. The game has two layers: a layer where you just walk through areas grabbing certain ribbons in order to unlock parts of the story, and the part where you rebuild 'projectors' that unlock parts of a second plot line. There's a lot to gather about the background of the story from the environment, and it's an interesting play.			"

												It's a game about exploring someone's mind Inception-style to help rid them of dementia.It's a beautiful looking game and a pleasant world to walk around in. I wish there was a soundtrack, instead it's silent unless you turn on a radio you find. The voice acting is also superb.Some of the puzzles are quite rewarding I think, there was one recently which if explained would sound quite complex and not something you would think to do in a game, yet it just made sense when I was playing it. Alternatively there was another puzzle where I had to write on a painting but I was not actually aware I could click and write on it!You can only carry one item at a time but you can teleport to 'the case' at any time to store items there, I do that a lot, maybe just having a bag would be good.A downside is that most clues and exploration of memory happens through the finding of notes lying around the world, but one scene had me triggering memories of a birthday with a camera by using the flash, it would be great to have more instances like that.On a more technical side I've fallen through the world a few times and had a few visual distortions, according to the website this is an on-going issue and it's being dealt with.

												At some point in every gammers life you descover your jewel. The one game that you think of instantly when you think of a good game. I think i found that. I went into this game expecting absolutly nothing. By the end of the intro i was ready to get my hands dirty into this amazing story of unlocking somones past by litteraly delving into her mind through the ether technology. I was ready to unlock the secrets of the client and have a bit of fun doing it. I was expecting some easy puzzles but what i got was a decently sized area to walk around and descover. This is a game of exploratoin and puzzle solving. And if thats your thing then this is deffently worth your time.			"

												I'm really on the fence about this game. I wanted to like this game, but after finally completing it, I had a hard time finding that one thing to make me feel like I was connecting with some character in the world. It lacks the writing and the heart that other games similar to this like Gone Home or Dear Esther (hell, even the wacky heart of Jazzpunk) have. It seemed more interested in telling the story of the world rather than of the people who live in it.			"

Posted: June 27, 2016
												Ether One is probably the most subjective game I have ever played due to its story and game design choices. I would recommend taking each review with a grain of salt (like most reviews) and make the choice for yourself.I've reviewed a lot of games and I generally have a clear vision of whether or not I would recommend them - but none have baffled me as much as Ether One. What's odd about Ether One is that it's obvious that a lot of love and devotion went into its craft. But while the love is clearly there, the execution (at least for me) is not.Criticisms:Ether One is completely story driven and you have the option to play the game in one of two ways:1) Simply walk through each area, find the main points of interest, and move on with the story - or2) Solve side puzzles which give more insight and provide additional context to the world and plotTo give the puzzles more context - the puzzles, for the most part, are not obvious and tend to be obscure. Some puzzles cannot be solved immediately and you must wait until you find another area or more information in later parts of the game and then return to finish the puzzle. Overall, the puzzles are NOT easy and sometimes don't make a whole lot of sense. And herein lies the problem. I know stories are subjective to each individual, but I personally did not find the main story interesting - or at minimum, I did not find it engaging - which leads into the next section.Remember, the puzzles are optional - you do not have to complete a single puzzle to finish this game (minus 1 puzzle in the opening act). Since I was not forced to complete any puzzles I felt less invested in the story. I would argue that completing puzzles gets the player more invested and engaged. Allowing the player to simply bypass the puzzles does not create an interactive experience. If the player isn't engaged, then it's possible the player may find the story less engaging as well. If I wanted to discover more about the plot, I could go out and complete some of the side puzzles in order to learn more. But that's the problem. If the main story doesn't draw you in, then why would you go out and solve side puzzles? You simply wouldn't. I would have enjoyed Ether One more if the puzzles were woven into the gameplay (like in the very first area you are forced to solve a few puzzles - why wasn't that continued at least a few more times?)Verdict:I think Ether One can be an emotionally rewarding game. Solving the difficult puzzles and learning more about the characters and their past is definitely a solid feeling.Like I said in the beginning - it's obvious the developers put a lot of craft and love into Ether One. There are many reviews saying just how well thought out and beautiful Ether One's story is. I personally couldn't get into the story and therefore I had no interest in solving the puzzles. I wish the puzzles were more integrated rather than being completely optional.  For this reason, while Ether One is certainly a well written and thought out game, the execution just seems awkward - and for that reason I can't recommend it.Without doing the puzzles Ether One is rather short - about 3-4 hours to complete. Obviously if you are completing the puzzles the hours will vary beyond that.			"

												Ether One is a first-person, story-focused, no-combat exploration game.  Gameplay includes walking around in four different areas, reading things, finding specific objects to progress the story, and completing optional puzzles that reward you with more bits of story.Though not a horror game, many parts of Ether One are unnerving, perhaps unintentionally.I felt that many of the puzzles were arbitrary and I was not motivated to complete many of them during the game.  However, after beating the game, I found that the story was good enough to tempt me to go back and complete those puzzles to uncover more of the story.The game's audio and music is minimalistic and sets the mood well.  The game's graphics appear to be cel-shaded, and although I was initially disappointed by the graphics, I got used to them and they hold up well.  Because of the game's descriptive subtitles, it can be fully enjoyed by the deaf.Although the game's writing is good, there is a bizarre amount of repeated grammatical errors that turned me off at times.I beat the game in 4 hours, but I skipped most of the puzzles.  Virtually all of the puzzles in the game can be skipped.I recommend this game to anyone with patience, as I initially found the game boring and the story too vague to appreciate, but the ending (which I liked) makes me want to replay the game now that I have a better understanding of what it's all about.I do not recommend this game to those who are not willing to read or to immerse themselves in the game.  This is a game that should be played with headphones on, lights off, and in a relaxed state.			"

												Excellent game about exploration and memory. There are puzzles to be had if you're into it, with the reward of deeper exposition and a more fleshed out world. If not, you can still work your way through the narrative by exploring memories and finding certain emotional touchstones. The gameplay of physically piecing things together and reconstructing memories is highly resonant and works very well.			"

												Amazing. Puzzle adventure with hard but very satisfying, totally optional, puzzles. Everything needed to solve them is somewhere for you to find and use to piece together fragments of the gripping storyline. By making the puzzles optional it outright dares your inner completionist to use your natural curiosity and intellect to explore further, to write things down, and to hoard everything that might be important!I've not played a game this involving in a long time, and there are a lot of rightful favourable comparisons to Myst. Last night my brain actually tried to solve the mysteries and puzzles of Ether One in my dreams. I can't get it out of my head.I'm thoroughly enjoying it so far despite being totally stuck for the third or fourth time, but I will solve all the puzzles damn it! I will!			"

												I want to like this game, I really do, but I can't in all honesty recommend it to anyone.What I like about this game is the storyline and the subjects it deals with. As someone with a loved one who had dementia, this was something that I could really empathise with. It gets pretty emotional at times, and there's a The Sixth Sense-esque twist in the middle that makes it even more endearing. Also the puzzles are really contrived and can get frustrating, which I like, but it's something you either will love or hate.But this game has too many @*&# bugs. I ran into at least three so far, and I had to either repeat things I already did to reset some programming, or load an old save and redo a half-hours worth of content. It's a shame really, because it breaks immersion in an otherwise immersive game. Also there's so much walking, and there's no run button. This would be fine if the levels weren't huge mazes with puzzles that involve you walking accross them MULTIPLE TIMES. Seriously most of this game was spent travelling accross the map in a slow walk, which just got boring after a while.			"

												A bit disappointed in that in just over 4 hours I had completed the game.  All it seemed to be was search for the ribbons in each level!I never got the idea what the projectors were meant to do and the collection of stuff was generally all but pointless.  A few times you needed to unlock certain pathways but in general most of the time was wondering around looking for ribbons, and solving simple puzzles. The graphics are not overwhelming but okay as such.  Player control seemed a little clunky.It got a little tedious sometimes running around endlessly in numerous circles and some items just seemed wierd. I think if the various stories actually linked more with the gameplay it might have been better as it often seemed that their was 2 or three story lines and yet none of them seemed to matter that much.It might be better if played slowly and methodically finding every tid bit of the story, but as stated it gets a little monotonous whene wandering aimlessly from building to building with no real idea of what path your meant to follow.The ending was a little surprising but that was the highlight of the game.

												I so wanted to like this games. I tend to love the so called walking simulators, games where you can enjoy the story while solving some puzzles among the way. Ether One seemed like a perfect game, interesting, good looking and engaging. Unfortunately it is also surprisingly boring and slow paced, even for a walking simulator. The puzzles can be well thought out or just infuriating, the kind that makes you click random items on other random items in the hope that something finally will work. I tried to like this game, really, but I think I'm giving up after just 2hrs, there are more interesting games out there.			"

												Its been compared to Myst - suppose thats not far off. You wander around solving puzzles based on either environmental patterns and clues or basic written hints.The twist is that theres no inventory (you can only hold one item) and ""key"" items arent as easily recognizable. This mug saying ""Worlds biggest Dumbass"" might just be junk - or a hint for a puzzle or directly usable for something. So you might decide to keep it for later and teleport to your hub and store it on a shelf. Then later when you find a paper saying ""Worlds biggest ???"" you teleport back to your hub, look at the mug and solve the puzzle.If youre worried about aimlessly wandering around not knowing what the eff to do, the basic story path is very easy and amounts to finding things. Actual puzzlesolving is all optional and id say only 1/4 of it falls into the outlandish ""snort two lines then it makes sense"" category these games are always kinda endagered by.Whats it all for? Lets say to remember...BEWARE : You might ask why this review is not for the Redux version. Thats because while Redux is very pretty and a clear graphical update it also was very broken and glitchy for me. Stuff like activated levers with their related effects and such resetting on a map transfer.  Environmental effects like moving machinery and even audio missing when compared to ""old"" ether one or working once then breaking. Interactable stuff plain breaking and locking me out of progression (optional maybe but still). 5 hours in my hub teleport stopped working, couldnt retrieve/store items anymore nor access story progression stuff. Wasnt scripted, wasnt fixable so that was game over, fun fun.After i was done being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥i tried the old version on a hunch and it had none of these problems. Obviously several scripts didnt survive the engine conversion.TL;DR : Ether One Vanilla : Polished, fun, recommended.

First, the inventory system is a bit annoying. Because of the huge amount of stuff you can store, it's not easy to find things on all those shelves. Secondly, there were a few areas in the game that didn't make it  very clear they could be interacted with. (pipes)But these are minor nitpicks, the game is a perfect mix of Myst and Dear Esther. Loved it.			"

												If you want to know a story quick and clear, Ether One would definitely not do that.Pros: The story is touching but requires quite a bit of brain workThe environment it beautifulGreat sound work and nice voice actingSounds good from here. However, the pacing is so slow that I can't sit thorgh two hours a day. The whole game is pretty much a walking simulator with somewhat ""spooky"" music. I understand that storytelling is supposed to be subtle here but I wouldn't want to buy a game where I sit at the computer doing chores that I would be doing in real life. Even the puzzle solving are considered doing ""everday activities"" or basic interactions with objects. I am still salty about the text puzzles because how would I know it was a part of a puzzle in the first place. Also, since the colors in game are pretty much focused on browns and blues, I got so lost easily. But coming from someone who hates slow paced walking simulators, this game to me was a pain to complete.			"

												I've played this game for a few hours.  While it supposedly is a game based on dementia, I'd call it a exploration game with a story line mostly revealed by solving puzzles.  The puzzles are largely solved by finding objects/clues that enable certain actions to be taken.  When the requisite action for the puzzle have been taken the puzzle is considered solved.  It can be tedious.First off, the installation went a little oddly, I had to restart the game before it ran smoothly.  I didn't have any further issues with the performance but others have reported issues.  The game play seems fairly open in that you can find the objects and solve the puzzles out of order within a given level.  There are some bugs (or possibly arcane order requirements) that cause one to have to repeat the actions required to solve many of the puzzles.  I find this annoying even if one chgaritably assumes this is intended to simulate the confusion of dementia.  So far there is no tricky jumping such as in Talos for example (i.e. easy navigation).  In fact, the player motions are very hobbled even in areas where a player ought to be able to easily jump (ala HalfLife).  Restrained motions degrade the exploration aspects to that of poking around in persons underwear drawers (yes, really).  Also the many of the bathrooms doors can't be shut when you enter them (that's quite a flaw).The game is built on the Unreal Development Kit (UDK).  Graphically, the game itself is rendered more like a comic book than like a typical 3D (not saying that's bad but it is not using much of the UDK capabilities).  The game supports Nvidia 3D vision well if you like that sort of thing in a comic book rendering scheme.  The audio is overall quite reasonable but the controls for audio are minimal.  Also the keyboard controls options are limited (a reflection of what is needed in the game).  I didn't try it with game controller as yet (in this game it might be preferable to a keyboard/mouse).   The walking pace is rather slow (even if you run).  The action controls are a bit awkward and do not repond uniformly across the game.  I'm torn in my opinion of this game -- while It certainly has a few interesting puzzles, it's no Talos or Portal.  The clues it provides are rather peculiar/obtuse and some clues IMO are non-sequiturs.  The voice acting is adequate.  I sometimes find the game play compelling but more often it feels tedious.  I can't honeslty rate it a thumbs up even though I like the game enough to have played it for several hours.  I suggest that you first read the helpful negative reviews and if you still want to try this game, wait till it's on sale.			"

												As a gameplayer I like to think that games are a more constructive occupation than watching videos but this is an example where it's not true. The game is all about dementia, a worthy subject to learn about. We may be super clever today but the time will come when our cognitive faculties go the same way as our ability to play football and rugby. Unfortunately the game doesn't offer any insight into memory loss. I recently watched the film Still Alice and was struck by how much more interesting its treatment of the subject was. If you are interested google ""join dementia research"", sign up and contribute your stats to this worthy crowd-sourced research project.As for the game itself, I found the gameplay simplistic and it feels like an adventure game from the 1990s. Havnig been persuaded by all the positive reviews, I felt more than a bit disappointed.			"

												This game is just so bland and boring. There is literally zero incentive to keep playing until or unless you're a mindless zombie. I played with the intention of solving the puzzles, so perhaps that makes the pace so slow. Will try again later just blazing through the story for completion's sake but so far not good at all!And the game is so badly optimized it is not even a joke. Can't get 60fps in the ""simple"" forest section on a GTX 750 even with AA turned off!! (My PC runs Bioshock Infinite, Tomb Raider and SC Blacklist among other games 60fps on medium settings at 1080p). The optimization here reminds me a lot of Gone Home, though admittedly this isn't as bad as that and at least has better visuals and more complex environments.			"

												A story telling game (a damn good story at that) with optional yet pretty difficult puzzles in the mix. Ether one is the indie game that reminded me a lot about Bioshock, not the fps part but rather the incredible story involved in the mix. You work in the MIND OF A DEMENTIA PATIENT if that doesn't sound like some fun puzzles to work with I don't know what does. Now the puzzles are pretty difficult so if you like turning a lot of gears in your head, this game is perfect. Now if the puzzles turn you off that's okay because they're completely optional and the storyline alone (in my opinion) is worth the money if you get a good deal on it. Long review short: If you love the puzzle aspect with the story buy it full price if there's no deal. If you only want the story, buy it anyways when you see a good deal on it. Other than that buy the game it's definitely worth the money.			"

												It's not often you find a game that's calming, but this is one of those. The atmosphere is quite pleasant, with some fantastic visuals, and I did just as much exploring just to see what I could see as I did while actually working towards any sort of goal.The story is quite interesting, and even heartwarming at times (with moments of creepiness and humor for added flavor), although it's unfortunately rather short. I genuinely did not expect the ending, but that may be partly due to an assumption about the story I made early on that I later took to be a known fact.The puzzles are, at times, somewhat counter-intuitive, but I've never been good at puzzle gameplay so that might just be me. Be warned, however, that you will end up hoarding lots of meaningless junk under the assumption that some of it will be needed for some puzzle or other. Much of it is needed, and it's not always what you'd expect, but an awful lot of it isn't.			"

												Now that I've played the game in it's entirety I feel able to make this review. This is without a doubt one of my favourite games at the moment. It has a beautiful storyline coupled with gorgeous settings to explore and the soundtrack is superb! The tone can be slightly creepy at times but it is the perfect level, I was slightly terrified at times, but really enjoying myself. I also think  the style of the game and the directions the narrative takes are unique which makes it feel fresh and exciting to play. The puzzles offer the right level of challenge for me and the narrative pay off for completing them really makes you feel like you've acomplished something. Whilst the creators offer you the choice of following the direct plot or solving the puzzles as well, I would reccomend running with the puzzling aspect. They give you so much extra story and insight making it a much fuller game. If anyone is interested just to see how it plays I'll link a video from my channel, which the full game will be up on soon. I can't reccomend this game enough :)

												My overall experience with Ether One was positive, however I can't help feeling that the game could've used a couple more months of polish in certain aspects.In Ether One, you're tasked with curing a patient suffering from dementia using a new form of therapy in which you, the player, are asked to make sense of the world you encounter in the patient's mind and discover torn fragments of their memory that can help them reconnect with the present world. Guiding you along is the voice of the psychiatrist that came up with the therapeutic treatment as well as echoes from the patient's past. This premise means that if you enjoy filling in the gaps of the world created by the designers using your own imagination, you'll probably find the game entertaining as it manages to strike a good balance between explicitness and obscurity when revealing new bits of the plot. The story is a strong point throughout the experience and it keeps you going forward all the way to the end even when you might be frustrated by other, sub-par aspects of the game's design.Collectors and completionists are rewarded with more insight into the patient's past and present, with a second ending granted to those who uncover all memory fragments, which requires solving puzzles. These also task the player with making sense of the world, albeit in a different way than the story does, and in my opinion it is here that the game's few shortcomings first manifest themselves. Although I managed to solve every puzzle in the game without consulting any outside source, the time this took was artificially lengthened by the following issues:  the game often introduces objects without any special purpose in one environment (i.e. decorations), then goes on to break this established notion by making them part of a puzzle in a subsequent zone;  artificial limitations are sometimes imposed on the way objects have to be used that not only make no logical sense but also have no impact on the related puzzle:  you have to wait for the sound of a ringing bell to fade before ringing the next one for it to register correctly as a solution  you can't replace a certain light bulb without first blowing the fuse in the breaker box next to it  some clues are so poorly placed that by simply traversing through the environment you obstruct them without ever seeing them (e.g. I knew the general location of a label I was supposed to read, but it still took me 20 minutes of running back and forth to find because I opened the door that obstructed it from the other side than the developers intended me to)Each of these aforementioned issues could've been fixed by allocating more resources to asset design, object scripting and playtesting respectively, and although none of them are game-breaking problems, fixing them - along with the myriad spelling/grammar errors, duplicate journals and notes with missing that you can find throughout the game - would've given the game a much more polished feel to go along with the great story and good voice acting.All in all, the things the game gets right outweigh the ones which end up feeling sloppily made and I would recommend Ether One to any fan of story-driven exploration games, but it's a pity how a few mistakes keep it from shining as brightly as it could have.

												I’ve been meaning to write a review when I finished basically since I started, because it’s a relatively unknown indie game but with an interesting gameplay dynamic, and the art is beautiful. It’s definitely in the realm of puzzle games - it could be described as a “walking simulator” depending on how you play, because the puzzles are technically optional, but for me they were the crux of the game’s appeal, and they very much tie into the plot.My first impression of the game was pretty mixed. The plot is compelling and draws the reader in right away, and I loved how the tutorial was integrated with the game more or less seamlessly (I hate long tutorials and prefer to trial-and-error it, so I liked that the game didn’t really interrupt that process).The control scheme of it is very simple - mainly WASD and mouse, with no complex inventory system or anything like that. I thought the game’s use of the “hub”, a location to which the player can warp at any time resembling a house, working as both an information storing system and an inventory, was efficient and innovative, although I still found myself covering the back of an envelope with codes and notes from the game that weren’t stored in the hub.The plot, too, was well-crafted. Without giving too many spoilers, it’s an exploration of the memories of Jean, a dementia patient, by the player, who serves as a “restorer” working from the inside to restore said memories - it ends on a very satisfying twist that's hinted at throughout the game. (I was in tears when the credits rolled.) The game has a very eerie feel to it. The landscapes inside Jean’s mind are totally deserted, which is very disconcerting, and there are other minor details of it that drive home the feeling of “wrongness”. Despite the fact that this isn’t really a horror game and involves a minimum of jump scares, I avoided playing it at night and enlisted a friend to sit with me through some of it! That’s partially because I’m a wimp, though.I did have a few small complaints about it. There’s an option, that can be turned off, for “head bob”, which is an aspect of the first person view that I found very irritating. Even with it off, something about how the view was rendered tended to make me nauseous when I played for long periods. (I can be prone to that, though, so YMMV.) There were also certain aspects of the puzzles that the game expected the player to extrapolate that took me a while to figure out - such as the fact that if you do the puzzles out of order, you’re likely to get stuck, as later puzzles often rely on earlier ones to some extent. The game leads you to believe that the puzzles are totally independent of each other, at least early on, with all the “parallel paths” stuff, so that was a hitch for me. Some of the puzzles were generally unintuitive, while some were easy - they were a very mixed bag. In sum, you’ll probably end up looking for hints on the puzzles before you figure out their unspoken rules.Overall, though, this game seriously impressed me with its artistry, and the plot was just incredible. An absolutely worthwhile indie game that should be better known.It took me about 12 hours start to finish; I finished all the puzzles but I may have skipped an area...? It was unclear. Content warnings (some of which could be considered spoilers, but nothing too revealing): The first five minutes of the game were a bit harrowing for me as there was a quasi-medical environment and a scene that set off claustrophobia that I didn’t know I even had. So I’d warn for that. The game also explores themes of alcoholism and the idea of a child growing up in a difficult home, and it may not be the best choice for people with unreality issues (DP, DR, whatever) - I personally struggle with those sometimes and it was okay for me, but I think if I’d been in a bad state of mind playing it there definitely may have been issues.I’d give it a 5/5, would recommend to a friend with no issues with the content of the game, and would recommend with reservations to people who aren't good with horror games, as it's scarier than the summary implies.

												Basically this game was pretty fun.  If you like wandering around and solving puzzles that are not necessarily obvious (which I like), you'll like this game. Searching for the ribbons is important to advancing in the game, which was not hard. If you are a stickler for getting every single puzzle completed, the projector puzzles will make you happy.  There is a variety of scenery and the graphics are very good. The only think I found to be incredibly annoying was having to store your inventory in the 'hub' and going back and forth everytime you saved something or needed to get it back.  The idea is clever except it is awkward.  I would much prefer to have an inventory with me at all times.  That annoyance, however, is not enough to make me not enjoy this game.I recommend this game for anyone who likes the exploration/casual experience with high quality graphics.  The story was also pretty decent, although I rarely care about that part. "

												8/10The story, art, puzzles, and core mechanics of the game are superb. Ether One is a mixture of narrated first-person exploration (aka walking simulator) and environmental / inventory puzzles (similar to a point & click). The environment is incredibly detailed and tells the individual stories of many inhabitants in the town of Pinwheel. It's very well written. It took me 9 hours to complete, which felt about right for the amount of content. If I was only judging the game by these qualities it would get a solid 10/10.There were a few annoyances that brought my score down. For instance, the walking speed didn't feel fast enough, even with the Run key held down. Also, many of the clues were on notes in the game world, but you couldn't take them with you and it wasn't obvious which ones were going to be needed later so you would sometimes have to go back and find them. If you're a fan of narrated exploration games or point & click adventure games, you'll definitely enjoy Ether One. There may be a few annoyances, but the core experience is highly worthy of your time and money.			"

												There were plenty of technical issues trying to get the game to run.  Once in game, I found the puzzles to be basic and unengaging.  At times you'll be wandering about, just trying to find that thing they want you to click on, and that thing won't really be intuitive.  The story got me interested in the game, but they just hammer you with too much exposition that doesn't quite make sense.  I lost interest and never finished the game.  Dissapointed.			"

												For fans of myst this is quite a fantastic and coheasive adventure game that is similar but completely different and new yet the same.Similar to myst the puzzles revolve around understanding who you are where you are and what you're doing. All questions that may not quite be what they may seem.			"

												So beautiful and sad. If you like story driven games, then this is for you. Controls are easy to get use to and the whole game flows smoothly. Sometimes travelling around can be jarring and confusing (there is no top down map) but that just means you need to explore! Steam achievements aren't hard to get either. The story has excellent plot twists and I thoroughly enjoyed playing. 9/10			"

												Wonderful narrative game with exploration and puzzle solving. The more you explore, the more you discover about Pinwheel and it's inhabitants and the more rewarding the game will be. You can skip the exploration elements if you want, and projector puzzles, but you'll miss out on 80% of the story and find the experience empty. Once you understand the underlying mechanic of the projector puzzles, they're all entirely doable. Every one involves discovering the events of the nearby area and re-enacting them in some way. To solve them you have to learn a bit more about the story which makes them a very worthwhile exercise.Prepare for some feels as you play though			"

												I really wanted to enjoy this, but due to terrible framerate issues, I can't get past the first memory. (I think that's what it is. I'm not sure because, as I said, I couldn't get very far story-wise). I turned down all the settings to minimum, which makes it look almost as bad as the original Half-life, and makes it run a fraction of a frame faster. I can run Garry's mod on GM_bigcity_night_hdr with 3 planes flying around, a pile of ragdolls, and all settings on max with a smooth 45 FPS, so my PC shouldn't be too dated. Here, I can almost literally count the frames when just walking around. Either this engine is not as optimised as the 6 year old Source engine, or I'm doing something wrong. Leave a comment on my Steam profile if this is a known issue with a simple fix. I am willing to open game files (.cfg files and such) to play this, it looks super promising!For now, it was a waste of the €5 I spent on it.			"

												I played this game in two big sessions separated by several months. To be honest, the first session of playing made me think the same thing as many of the negative reviews below. Some of the gameplay aspects such as the slow walk speed were highly frustrating. These factors made me give up on the game for a little while.However, the second time around I powered through and I started to appreciate how the game was built. There is some level of randomness and it is difficult to know what is relevant and what is not. In fact, there are so many irrelevant items in the game that it is hard to know what to pick up (which is annoying since you can only have 1 item at a time, although you can store items easily). While this was annoying for me while playing, having gotten to the end I felt like I had gained for that reason - it made the story more genuine and was a real representation of what was going on in the story.I think this game is good for someone who is willing to power through moments of frustration and (occasionally boredom) to get to the end while solving the puzzles. The story is beautiful and the gameplay, especially through the things that people see as flaws, complements it perfectly.			"

												A puzzle / exploration game inside the mind of a mentally ill patient. Ether One has a lot of content if you're eager to track it down, and some of the optional tasks can be pretty challenging. The story is pretty solid, unraveling numerous layers as you progress. Visuals are simple but nice, audio the same.Sadly the gameplay gets a little tired over time, and I found myself ignoring a lot of optional content simply to clear the game. Nonetheless, if you're a patient player, or have a penchant for puzzles, then I'd heartily recommend it.[6.5]			"

												Amazing game. I dont say that lightly, I mean really. This is the best puzzler game Ive ever played - maybe it didnt sell well because of how much it asks you to think, but I wish there were more games like this. I was writing everything down, cross referencing things and it all served to just push me deeper into the experience they crafted.Each of the cutscenes are masterfully well crafted (the elevator scene blew me away!!), and if you completely restore the main characters memories it has a happy ending.

												Loving the game visually, similar in art style to Borderlands. Story concept is interesting, but feels like it's only doing the bare minimum to keep me interested in seeing where this goes. Feels predictable so far, so I'm hoping for a fun twist somewhere along the line.Most puzzles are moderately difficult for me, but probably not too much of a challenge for people who are good at adventure game puzzles. Completing a puzzle tends to leave me feeling like the solution should have been obvious from the start if I'd looked at all the information available. Definitely recommend it.			"

												It's not often you find a game that's calming, but this is one of those. The atmosphere is quite pleasant, with some fantastic visuals, and I did just as much exploring just to see what I could see as I did while actually working towards any sort of goal.The story is quite interesting, and even heartwarming at times (with moments of creepiness and humor for added flavor), although it's unfortunately rather short. I genuinely did not expect the ending, but that may be partly due to an assumption about the story I made early on that I later took to be a known fact.The puzzles are, at times, somewhat counter-intuitive, but I've never been good at puzzle gameplay so that might just be me. Be warned, however, that you will end up hoarding lots of meaningless junk under the assumption that some of it will be needed for some puzzle or other. Much of it is needed, and it's not always what you'd expect, but an awful lot of it isn't.			"

												First-rate storytelling at a perfect pace, basic but effective game mechanics, and a cohesive, immersive aesthetic in Ether One help further the argument that video games can be art.  In case that isn't sufficient, the puzzles here are simultaneously challenging yet perhaps the most intuitive I have ever experienced in an adventure/puzzler -- it felt is if the developers and I were almost always on the same wavelength.  One gripe:  there were a handful of puzzles that depended on (the modern equivelent of) pixel hunting; but in an exploration-based game, that can be forgiven.  Ultimately, Ether One is a true and touching joy.Buy this game.  Play this game.  Cry during the ending(s).			"

												It is clear that a lot of love, care and emotion went into crafting Ether One. It is a beautiful, poignant, peaceful and incredibly challenging game, based around exploring the memories of a dementia patient. Playing thorugh this game gave me 'Myst' vibes, through the challenging, puzzle and exploration based gameplay. I found the story telling to be top notch, a feat only compounded considering it was produced by a small indie team. Ether One is a little rough around the edges, as is apparent with some of the graphical features though the effect of this is only minimal, and I imagine it is merely a hallmark of not having access to all the latest tools and expertise. For me, these little nuances actually served the hit home the personal, and home-grown feel of the game. It is overall extremely well done and deserves all the praise it gets. The game world is immersive and atmospheric (oh so quintessentially English!), The voice acting is superb, the way the story unfolds is intriguing and leaves a lot to the player's own exploration and problem solving skills, a welcome throwback to puzzle games from days gone by (there's no hint system or anything like that. If you're stuck, go root through a walkthrough!). Character development is a success, particularly how it is tied in with solving the puzzles in the game. Would absolutely recommend.			"

												This is a very interesting game. The whole concept of exploring another characters mind isn't something new, but this game brings it to a new level by introducing memory fragments which, when put together, tell a story of a dementia patient. The game has a very gloomy tone in a very pretty environment, which makes it even creepier. I specially like the mini games which are optional, but will give the player more details on the main character. Beware, the puzzles are pretty hard and many details can be easily overlooked :)			"

												The premise alone for Ether One probably would have been enough to get me interested in playing this game, not to mention that it had mostly positive(ish) reviews upon its launch earlier this year. Gameplay wise, it's kind of one is one part interactive story and one part puzzle game. It's like if Gone Home had a baby with the old school adventure/puzzle games like Myst. In Ether One, you'll be playing the role of ""The Restorer"". You're contracted to help a medical researcher treat a patient with dementia by entering the patient's mind Inception style and then finding and restoring the patient's lost or broken memories. Really interesting premise, right? Unfortunately, most of what's typed below are a lot of the faults I found with the game. There's a lot of good stuff to be found with Ether One too, but I chose to focus mostly on the things I thought could be improved to make a more complete experience. I want to submit some constructive criticism because I know that Ether One is the type of game that I usually like, but there were a few problems in the way of making my experience truly awesomeLike Gone Home before it, the story of Ether One is told via voiceovers that occasionally kick in and give you narrative details when you're standing near or looking at something of importance. You'll be exploring a deserted island as it exists in your patient's memory and discovering your patient's life history by exploring this small island. The primary voice you hear is that of the lead researcher of the project you're assigned to. She chimes in now and again to give you your objectives and bark out orders on how you're to carry them out. Her character reminded me a little bit of GLaDOS from Portal. She serves to guide the player and move the game along, but her motivations seem questionable. You don't feel like you can completely trust her. The game seemed content to keep this character sort of ambivalent all the way up until the end of the story. Actually, I found a lot of the story's details to be a little vague and I'm not sure if this was intentional or poor narrative execution.Adding to the confusion and the vagueness of this story is the other female character's voiceover who just starts talking to you out of nowhere. For the longest time, I thought I had missed some important cutscene where the game delivered a bunch of narrative exposition and this other voice was introduced, but nope. For most of the game, you're not sure who this voice is supposed to be or what the relevance is of the details she provides are. To me, this sort of ambiguity wasn't even interestingly vague or mysteriously vague. It was more confusingly and annoyingly vague. A lot of what either of the two voices talk about seemed incohesive and irrelevant to the rest of the story. Because of these problems, it took Ether One quite a while to grab me and for the game to really click with me. There's some really well executed scenes about halfway through the game that pulled me in and there's also an interesting twist at the end, but unfortunately you'll have to tough it out while the game stumbles through the confusing introduction of the setting and characters.The focus of the gameplay in Ether One is on exploration. You need to find a certain number of red ribbons in each area before being allowed to proceed to the next one. The game also includes some puzzles, but interestingly, nearly all of the puzzle sections in Ether One are completely optional. Since they're not required, solving these puzzles serves only to give you an extra bit of narrative about whichever area you're in. I think it's fortunate that the designers made these optional, because the puzzles I attempted to solve were so frustratingly poorly communicated. I had absolutely no idea what the game wanted me to do with some of these puzzles. Sometimes I wasn't even sure if what I was looking at was supposed to be a puzzle at all. I happened to accidentally solve one of the puzzles, and I wasn't even really sure what I had done to complete it. A lot of them involve placing the correct items gathered from various places around the island, but you can only carry one item at a time for some odd reason. It felt like the game designers were hacking around the game engine rather than coding a decent inventory system. It was a pretty unintuitive mess. Mercifully, these are indeed optional. Aside from the puzzles, the rest of the gameplay was sort of unremarkable and uninteresting. If you're playing Ether One, you're doing it for the story, nothing else. But just like its story, I felt that there was something missing from Ether One's gameplay that could have really made this game specialDespite all of my ranting above, I still liked Ether One. I wanted to like this game more than I actually did, but there was some bungled narrative and some really poor execution in gameplay that I just couldn't get over. It's also another pretty short game. That is, unless you try to figure out some of those crazy puzzles. That might pad the game a bit, but I'd advise against it. Skipping nearly all of the puzzles, I was able to knock this game out in about 3 hours. The subject matter in this game is really interesting to me and there are a few short sequences in where Ether One really shines. However most of the rest of the game is unfortunately kind of dull, incoherent or overly vague. Artsy folks who like the ""open to interpretation"" kind of story may dig this, but I found too many details were missing and my interest wasn't adequately captured at the game's opening. I really still did enjoy playing through this game though. Just not as much as I hoped I would.For more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/ "

												This game is pretty cool. While little more than a ""find the hidden object"" game with a first person perspective, the production value and the strong narrative make that experience enjoyable.The gameplay is super simple for the most part: find the ""ribbons"" in the level in order to continue through the story. You can also solve simple puzzles to help you find hidden clues and narrative points, but it is mostly finding the ""ribbons"". This game is not mechanically rich, which is not a bad thing but simply the truth. If you want a gameplay focused game, look elsewhere.But I have to say, the environments are really cool. The intention was to make them look like they were painted and for the most part the effect is good enough. The level design also helps sell the painted environments, with homes that look lived in and mine shafts that look intimidating. In a game that is as mechanically simple as Ether One it is crucial that the visuals are extremely interesting in order to keep the players interest. The good news is that for the most part the world stays fun to explore and because of that it was always fun to look for the hidden ribbons.The story is probably the best aspect of the game though. It tells a highly personal tale about experimental research on a person who is losing their memory. There are twists and turns like all good stories have and I won't go into anymore details than that because I think it is best to know as little as possible about the story going in.I liked it. If you like narrative driven games like Gone Home then this is worth a shot.  "

												Ether One reminds me of Iris, the most terrifying movie I’ve ever seen. This film contrasts two seasons of British novelist Iris Murdoch’s life: one at the genesis of her career as a brilliant philosophical force, and the other later in life when Alzheimer’s disease rips from her everything she knows and loves. This contrast of two realities weighs heaviest on Iris’ husband, who watched Alzheimer’s ravage his wife’s mind and slowly made her forget their life together.Ether One concludes in a way that brings all of the disorientation and unclarity into perspective. The richness of the conclusion redeemed any doubts I had of whether or not this game handled the subject with care and grace. As a person with Alzheimer’s has moments of clarity, so do you as you share their experience. I felt like I got to walk with somebody through the terror, grieving, and solemnity with Alzheimer’s disease. And as I shared that brief window of clarity, the only emotion I could describe was reverence.Read more: http://gamechurch.com/ether-one-and-real-world-horror/ "

												Ether One is an emotional exploration/puzzle game in which you enter the mind of a patient and move through their memories.    Overall, the puzzles are fairly sensible, at least within their context, and none require quick reflexes or parkour spills.  The ""two paths"" feature is somewhat over-stated- since all the puzzles are optional, you can play it as a pure exploration game - but that would cost you much of the plot's background.Of special note is the game's excellent use of sound, and voice acting to set and maintain the mood, plus the respectful handling of mental disease.

												My overall experience with Ether One was positive, however I can't help feeling that the game could've used a couple more months of polish in certain aspects.In Ether One, you're tasked with curing a patient suffering from dementia using a new form of therapy in which you, the player, are asked to make sense of the world you encounter in the patient's mind and discover torn fragments of their memory that can help them reconnect with the present world. Guiding you along is the voice of the psychiatrist that came up with the therapeutic treatment as well as echoes from the patient's past. This premise means that if you enjoy filling in the gaps of the world created by the designers using your own imagination, you'll probably find the game entertaining as it manages to strike a good balance between explicitness and obscurity when revealing new bits of the plot. The story is a strong point throughout the experience and it keeps you going forward all the way to the end even when you might be frustrated by other, sub-par aspects of the game's design.Collectors and completionists are rewarded with more insight into the patient's past and present, with a second ending granted to those who uncover all memory fragments, which requires solving puzzles. These also task the player with making sense of the world, albeit in a different way than the story does, and in my opinion it is here that the game's few shortcomings first manifest themselves. Although I managed to solve every puzzle in the game without consulting any outside source, the time this took was artificially lengthened by the following issues:  the game often introduces objects without any special purpose in one environment (i.e. decorations), then goes on to break this established notion by making them part of a puzzle in a subsequent zone;  artificial limitations are sometimes imposed on the way objects have to be used that not only make no logical sense but also have no impact on the related puzzle:  you have to wait for the sound of a ringing bell to fade before ringing the next one for it to register correctly as a solution  you can't replace a certain light bulb without first blowing the fuse in the breaker box next to it  some clues are so poorly placed that by simply traversing through the environment you obstruct them without ever seeing them (e.g. I knew the general location of a label I was supposed to read, but it still took me 20 minutes of running back and forth to find because I opened the door that obstructed it from the other side than the developers intended me to)Each of these aforementioned issues could've been fixed by allocating more resources to asset design, object scripting and playtesting respectively, and although none of them are game-breaking problems, fixing them - along with the myriad spelling/grammar errors, duplicate journals and notes with missing that you can find throughout the game - would've given the game a much more polished feel to go along with the great story and good voice acting.All in all, the things the game gets right outweigh the ones which end up feeling sloppily made and I would recommend Ether One to any fan of story-driven exploration games, but it's a pity how a few mistakes keep it from shining as brightly as it could have.

												I have not completed the game but this is a fun first person adventure game. I don't know if you rush through and grab all the red ribbons if it's over but I'm not attempting that. This game has a very unique puzzle idea. You really need to think about EVERYTHING you see, hear, and pick up as having some kind of use towards a puzzle and getting more information about whats going on. The people who made this are amazing. It is rare I find a game worth the full price.  Get this game and at all costs don't cheat and use a walkthrough. Finding it out for yourself is extremely rewarding.  As for hour length, 10h in and 7/20 puzzels completed. The atmosphere and music is also a great addition.Edit: Now that I've finished, make sure you actually complete everything. The knocker story tells you a lot of what is going on and is a very sad story. Really one of the best games I've ever played..			"

												Ether One seems to be the kind of game you love or you hate, and personally I loved it.  Ether One's environment is a very slow-paced and nostalgic one (the game's about memories after all), and the puzzles are really esoteric.  Honestly I think you have to be okay with looking up some answers and not determined to figure it all out yourself to fully enjoy it, and for people who would argue that defeats the point of a game, y'know, yeah.  But Ether One's environment and story was worth it to me without necessarily being able to pro through the whole thing myself.  It's absolutely gorgeous, the music really makes the isolation and nostalgia stick, and there's so much to explore.  The difficulty of the puzzles encourages you to examine the whole environment very carefully and methodically, and having a physical space to stop and think things through and examine everything you've collected is really nice.However, I can't really recommend the Deluxe version.  I ran into a pretty well known game-breaking bug on that, which was addressed in the original version.  So they may eventually fix both of them, but I'd really only pick up the Deluxe version if you're already in love with the game and want to support it.A side note too, if first person games really unsettle you (like they do me), then there are some frightening and unnerving points here and there.  Especially the beginning of the game was kind of overwhelming to me the first time, but other than those few points I found it to be a very peaceful game.  You're alone in the environment, but you don't get stalked or terrorized, and there's a safe space you can return to at any point with a single keypress; on top of it, from there you can travel to a different location immediately.  So unless that's a serious problem for you I wouldn't let the opening sequence deter you.Finally, the story is a sad one.  There's a silver lining, but seriously it's a clearly dementia-related downer, go in prepared.			"

												For fans of myst this is quite a fantastic and coheasive adventure game that is similar but completely different and new yet the same.Similar to myst the puzzles revolve around understanding who you are where you are and what you're doing. All questions that may not quite be what they may seem.			"

												Ether One is an exploration game somewhat in the vein of the Myst series that examines the theme of memory and its decay. I won't reveal much more than that to avoid spoiling the plot. The world is well designed and entices you to explore every nook and cranny of it.The mechanics mostly revolve around finding items in the world and placing them in their rightful locations. There is also a fair bit of deciphering codes to unlock safes, doors, etc. One of the more unique puzzle mechanics involves discovering key bits of information and writing them on chalkboards, envelopes, and the like to solve the puzzles. For the most part, the puzzles don't require any outrageous leaps of logic to solve, although you will likely find yourself heading to the forums for a hint on one or two particularly pernicious conundrums.My only gripe with the game is movement. Moving around the world makes one feel less like a human and more like a drunken pachyderm. This is not such an annoyance when you first visit a location, as you will want to move slowly to take in your surroundings. However, once you've explored a location and are trying to solve a puzzle that requires backtracking across the location in search of a note or item, the slow stumbling movement becomes quite frustrating.The main plot is fairly interesting but I found the small side plots riddled throughout the world to be the game's forte. That said, I highly recommend this game on the basis of it's puzzles, plot, and interesting world to explore.			"

												There were plenty of technical issues trying to get the game to run.  Once in game, I found the puzzles to be basic and unengaging.  At times you'll be wandering about, just trying to find that thing they want you to click on, and that thing won't really be intuitive.  The story got me interested in the game, but they just hammer you with too much exposition that doesn't quite make sense.  I lost interest and never finished the game.  Dissapointed.			"

												Beautiful.   While the ending doesn't quite live up to the rest of the game, it does still hit all the right emotional notes.  There's real excellence in subtlety in very small details throughout the game, even if the overarching themes are more direct.  And as someone who lost a parent to dementia, I found this exactly the right mix of realistic and optimistic/hopeful.  No candy coating, but little gems of joy still to be found.Highly recommend this game, especially if your life has been affected by dementia - although make sure you're in a sturdy emotional state before taking it on, if so.

												I had a decent amount of fun with this title. Some of the puzzles are intuitive, but some are a bit tricky. The worst part is when you do something out of order and the game doesn't recognize it. I had to flip a switch off then back on again once, after watching a walkthrough, just to get one to trigger.And this is exactly why I encountered a game-breaking bug that stopped me from completing one of the puzzles. I got a piece the solution the first time instead of entering an incorrect combination. This stopped a script from running and ran another script which prevented me from undoing it. It locked the piece of the puzzle in a completed state without giving me credit.The point of a game like this is to solve all the puzzles, so I quit playing.I cannot recommend based on this.			"

												It's not often you find a game that's calming, but this is one of those. The atmosphere is quite pleasant, with some fantastic visuals, and I did just as much exploring just to see what I could see as I did while actually working towards any sort of goal.The story is quite interesting, and even heartwarming at times (with moments of creepiness and humor for added flavor), although it's unfortunately rather short. I genuinely did not expect the ending, but that may be partly due to an assumption about the story I made early on that I later took to be a known fact.The puzzles are, at times, somewhat counter-intuitive, but I've never been good at puzzle gameplay so that might just be me. Be warned, however, that you will end up hoarding lots of meaningless junk under the assumption that some of it will be needed for some puzzle or other. Much of it is needed, and it's not always what you'd expect, but an awful lot of it isn't.			"

												Really a great game, growing up I loved playing games like the mYst and THe dig. Ether one has great elements of both. A interesting story line , puzzels that are challenging but not impossible or mindless.  I would recommend to anyone who can take the time to really engage them self in a game. I filled up about 2 pages of notes and clues so far. A nice aspect of this game is you dont get stuck and are free to move forward in the game at any point , or take it slow and solve everything. I did run into one Bug but a quick reply form the developer fixed the problem> GOOD developers and Good game is win win. Cant wait to see what they make next			"

												First-rate storytelling at a perfect pace, basic but effective game mechanics, and a cohesive, immersive aesthetic in Ether One help further the argument that video games can be art.  In case that isn't sufficient, the puzzles here are simultaneously challenging yet perhaps the most intuitive I have ever experienced in an adventure/puzzler -- it felt is if the developers and I were almost always on the same wavelength.  One gripe:  there were a handful of puzzles that depended on (the modern equivelent of) pixel hunting; but in an exploration-based game, that can be forgiven.  Ultimately, Ether One is a true and touching joy.Buy this game.  Play this game.  Cry during the ending(s).			"

												This wonderful game has feels, atmosphere and rich environments. But don't take my word for it.What you should understand beyond all doubt, however, is that this is classic puzzle gaming at its core. There's no learnable formula like in Portal, or recordable journal like most RPGs and adventure games, this is old fashioned puzzle solving amid a gorgeously aethetic and connected world. Very, VERY few puzzles are convoluted by nature, the rest incorporating elements that are logical, and sufficiently hinted at. Of the 5 or so I had to look up, three of them I felt dumb about ""cheating"" on.This is an expertly created game, a little rough around the edges with minor bugs, (nothing that couldn't be fixed with a restart) and full of enough intrigue and English history and mining culture to keep you engrossed to your own preferable degree. Check it out, you will be challenged, impressed, and immersed.			"

												My overall experience with Ether One was positive, however I can't help feeling that the game could've used a couple more months of polish in certain aspects.In Ether One, you're tasked with curing a patient suffering from dementia using a new form of therapy in which you, the player, are asked to make sense of the world you encounter in the patient's mind and discover torn fragments of their memory that can help them reconnect with the present world. Guiding you along is the voice of the psychiatrist that came up with the therapeutic treatment as well as echoes from the patient's past. This premise means that if you enjoy filling in the gaps of the world created by the designers using your own imagination, you'll probably find the game entertaining as it manages to strike a good balance between explicitness and obscurity when revealing new bits of the plot. The story is a strong point throughout the experience and it keeps you going forward all the way to the end even when you might be frustrated by other, sub-par aspects of the game's design.Collectors and completionists are rewarded with more insight into the patient's past and present, with a second ending granted to those who uncover all memory fragments, which requires solving puzzles. These also task the player with making sense of the world, albeit in a different way than the story does, and in my opinion it is here that the game's few shortcomings first manifest themselves. Although I managed to solve every puzzle in the game without consulting any outside source, the time this took was artificially lengthened by the following issues:  the game often introduces objects without any special purpose in one environment (i.e. decorations), then goes on to break this established notion by making them part of a puzzle in a subsequent zone;  artificial limitations are sometimes imposed on the way objects have to be used that not only make no logical sense but also have no impact on the related puzzle:  you have to wait for the sound of a ringing bell to fade before ringing the next one for it to register correctly as a solution  you can't replace a certain light bulb without first blowing the fuse in the breaker box next to it  some clues are so poorly placed that by simply traversing through the environment you obstruct them without ever seeing them (e.g. I knew the general location of a label I was supposed to read, but it still took me 20 minutes of running back and forth to find because I opened the door that obstructed it from the other side than the developers intended me to)Each of these aforementioned issues could've been fixed by allocating more resources to asset design, object scripting and playtesting respectively, and although none of them are game-breaking problems, fixing them - along with the myriad spelling/grammar errors, duplicate journals and notes with missing that you can find throughout the game - would've given the game a much more polished feel to go along with the great story and good voice acting.All in all, the things the game gets right outweigh the ones which end up feeling sloppily made and I would recommend Ether One to any fan of story-driven exploration games, but it's a pity how a few mistakes keep it from shining as brightly as it could have.

												I recently reviewed Master Reboot and complained that some of the puzzles were not intuitive enough. That is doubly the case here as there are times it is hard just to know what the puzzles are, never mind trying to solve them. However, if you explore enough (and maybe get a hint from a guide everyone once and a while) you will be treated to a very moving story. I would get it on sale, because even exploring everything the game isn't that long.			"

												Idea and setting of the game are nice. Sadly, execution of the game mechanics is utterly horrible. Where do I start...Inventory system. There isn't any. You can hold only a single item. If you want to pick up another you have to drop the current item, or teleport to your stash (called ""the case"") and drop it there. So the item management gets incredibly tedious, you never know what items you currently have unless you go to the stash and back all the time. And if you don't bring everything to the stash you can easily lose an important item somewhere in the level; good luck finding it again. How could anyone think this is ok?Active zones. They are not marked in any way. No visual clue, the cursor doesn't change, nothing. The game wants you to click everything just to check if you can manipulate it or not. To add insult to injury, objects have no description and to show their names you have to hold mouse button over them for a second. I don't think I've ever seen such user unfriendliness in a modern adventure game.Levels are huge. Huge and extremely nonlinear. And of course, there is no map. For people with bad sense of orientation (like me) it was hell to navigate through the game.Last but not least, the puzzles. There is only one type: the ""what the f- am I supposed to do"" puzzles. Their mechanics are completely obscure, random, they make little sense in context of the surroundings and the clues are sparse and very vague. Often I didn't even know there is a puzzle to solve! Combined with the inventory system which hates me, I gave up on all puzzles very soon (they're optional) and just collected ribbons to get to the end as fast as possible. And I'm sure it was not intended to be like that.This game is the definition of unfun. If it wasn't too late, I would have asked for a refund.			"

Ether OneI really enjoyed this game.It's a horrible story about death and neurodegenerative illness. Get some tissues. Honestly, go, get tissues.Kind of like the early Myst titles, you actually have to think about how to solve the puzzles, and they actually do progress logically (as opposed to puzzle games where you have to figure out wtf the dev was thinking about on that particular day at that particular moment). Research shows that engaging the brain with puzzles can help to fend off the neurodegenerative a$$hat family.There are a lot of notes in here, you have to read them, you have to remember them, you may need to make some notes of your own. If you're not into reading, you're going to want to change that, or miss a great game - your choice.100% you should play this exceptional game.ReduxWhen you buy this you also get the new completely rebuilt (with UE4) version, Ether One Redux. Dont bother with it. Spent 4 hours having an awesome time playing Redux, - laughing at all the idiots who couldn't get it to work properly - when suddenly a fatal error appeared, rendering the game unplayable.Yes, I tried a milion fixes. Many people said the achievements aren't popping, mine worked. However, like a bazillion other people, the game was loading in Swedish (which is incredibly irritating when you're restarting every few minutes to see if you've circumvented or fixed the fatal error). No, updating the .ini didn't help. Just in case you're thinking ""duh, bet you haven't got the patch"", I purchased/downloaded this after all the patches had been released. My computer specs are so far above and beyond whats necessary to play Redux but still it died. Stone cold dead.The only differences I noticed (and I was really keeping an eye out for the differences) were updated graphics in Redux (which is what the dev's said). The changes were really nice, smooth, more 'modern', and suited the theme better, but not that great and different.I recommend not wasting time with Redux, just go straight to the original. "

												In this review I'm trying to not give too much away about the game, although I think the central thesis of it becomes obvious within an hour or two of playing it.I'm not sure I can say I ""liked"" this game. Given its subject matter, it's definitely very dark. But it's also very haunting. I will say this game haunting me in a way I can't describe. It is definitely worth ""finishing"" the game, and the find the ribbon quests before you complete all the projectors.Completeing the projectors on your own I'm pretty certain is impossible. Which I'm also pretty sure is part of the point of the game/the message of the game.Others may complain about the inventory system, in which it is easy to lose objects. Again, I think that's part of the point of the game. Simliar for the lack of any map.Overall, I have nothing but very high recommendations for this game if you are one who looks to have an experience/looks for artistic merits from a game. From a purely ""gaming"" standpoint, the software lacks, but I do not think that delivering a A+ gaming experience was the intention of the developer.			"

												This game was phenomenal. If you enjoy first person adventure games with puzzles, then you'll likely enjoy this game. I will do my best to avoid spoilers, the only one i'm mentioning here is literally explained in the first moments of the game (the entire premise of the game is based on it). You are delving into the mind of a person suffering from Dementia with Lewy bodies. You play as ""The Restorer"" who is searching through this person's memories. You explore beautiful worlds, but they seem to be a bit off. Things are scattered about, the world is devoid of other human beings, and you are wandering about trying to put the pieces back together. In doing so you learn more about this person, about their life, about their struggles with the disease. What you'll find is an interesting look into the mind of a dimentia patient, and it is an absolute wonder.One word of recommendation. Look up how to get there if you have too, but do the Brimclif Mines BEFORE you do the Village. The area isn't intentionally hidden, but it seems to be common for people to run right past it. In chronological terms, the mine took place before the village. "
