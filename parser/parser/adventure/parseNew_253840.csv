Half-genie, all quality.CONTENTWhile this game is a bit shorter than the series' previous outings (though the addition of in-development add-on content at a later date will likely change that), the gameplay, animation, sound and visual design are all utterly fantastic.The game sports pop-in voice overs at select points in the otherwise (and more often than not hilarious) message box based dialogue, that the developers at WayForward used to great effect to enhance the charm of the game. There is also a bevy of usually well-hidden items to collect throughout the levels that will require copious backtracking to acquire all of- several of which, as with past entries in the series, will result in encounters with some of the game's highly amusing NPC characters.The soundtrack to the game is also completely fantastic. Composed by WayForward go-to composer, the masterful Jake 'Virt' Kaufman, the entirety of the game's score is nothing short of pure ear candy. Every stage, cinematic, screen and else all exude top-quality music that earns the games' track list the highest of marks.CONTROLSThe game controls extremely well with tight responsiveness to input, and features native controller support for those that want a more classic gaming experience.The series' signature transformations are triggered by pressing a key/button to enter dance mode, at which point any currently available transformations can be selected via a wheel that will appear on screen, which switches pages in time with the beat.In addition, usable items such as those used to restore health are accessed via the game's item menu, which features a simple and efficient design with scrollable lists and fields rather than relying on spreading items and features across multiple pages.GAMEPLAYThe game is entirely a side-scrolling single-depth platformer, as with (for the most part) all previous Shantae installments.There are a few spontaneous and sudden upswings in difficulty at select points throughout the game, though most players will find that in some cases these troubles are merely caused by a lack of clarity as to the intended objective at hand, rather than that of a spontaneous rise in the actual challenge of the gameplay. In most cases, these unfortunate but minor hurdles can be overcome quickly once the solution is discovered, resulting in a speedy resolution and a return to the game's usual play.In addition to the previously mentioned (as of this writing) pending additional gameplay content, the game also boasts a new game+ feature which allows you to replay the story after beating the game once with all of your main transformations unlocked from the start of the game, perfect for speed running purposes.GRAPHICSFeaturing a clean blend of high-quality hand-drawn character sprites, specific world elements, enemies, items, etc., and typical 3D environments, the game's '2.5D' graphics presentation are refreshing and striking. The combination of vivid color palettes and layered animations make the game stand out noticeably and beautifully. Even in spite of combinations of multiple entities, particle effects, and more on screen at many points throughout the game, it maintains a consistent run speed that should function fairly well even on less than impressive machines (I played the game on a relatively underpowered laptop, and suffered no lag or frame loss the entire game).Overall, Shantae: Â½ Genie Hero is a stellar addition to an already extremely consistently quality franchise that will likely go down, and unsurprisingly so, as the greatest installment in the series yet. While a tad underwhelming in length, the entirety of the rest of what's on offer is fantastic. If you like classic platforming games, striking visual presentation, and constant comedic banter, then you're sure to come away from this one thoroughly satisfied.			"

												A few years ago, I was browsing the virtual console games on 3DS and found a game called Shantae, which was originally for Gameboy Color. I played it and found it clunky, but the characters and world were very charming, so I picked up the next game. Risky's Revenge was solid and improved a lot of the gameplay, and I became a bit excited when I heard that Shantae and the Pirate's Curse was coming out. Shantae and the Pirate's Curse was absolutely one of the best games I've ever played, so when I found the option to kickstart a new entry to this series which I've become really fond of, I absolutely did.And it delivered.Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is an incredibly solid entry into the Shantae series. While the pixel art of the previous games was amazing, I really do like this new art style, and I'm a sucker for 3D backgrounds with 2D characters. The game is really pretty, keeps up with the silly quirky story and characters I've come to love, has great platforming, and is absolutely a worthwhile sequel.The game improves upon a few things from previous entries. One of the biggest problems in the first two Shantae games was how long transformations took for the amount of times you needed to use them. Transformation dances took a LONG time, and really took you out of the moment. To be completely honest, the best part of Pirate's Curse was how there were no transformation dances. The Metroid-style pirate items they used as a replacement made the action smoother and more enjoyable. Half-Genie Hero did take a page from this to an extent, and made transforming MUCH easier and quicker, especially with the optional Metronome item that increases the speed further, but the best thing they did was triple the amount of dances Shantae could perform. This gives the player many options on how to tackle a puzzle, and while I think some could have been utilized further than they were, I really appreciate having so many creatures to transform into! I really feel like they hit the sweet spot of Shantae having her signature transformations while keeping the gameplay smooth.In terms of music, Half-Genie Hero has definitely gone more electronic than its predecessors, but in a good way. It's very lively and really gets your heart pumping. It makes you feel good to play while listening to it. I think good music is a very important component to making a game enjoyable, and the Shantae series has always delivered on this. I love the track for Mermaid Falls especially!There are a few negatives, of course. I feel that some of the unlockable items are utterly useless except for achievements (a lot are just attacks for your animal forms, which generally are very weak and serve little purpose). There are also times where I would get stuck in an area after a puzzle and need to exit the entire level just to get out of that room, or going into a new room would totally screw up my camera requiring exiting the level as well. I also really miss dungeons, which were a Shantae staple up to this point, but the new level-based design really wouldn't have allowed for them the same way, so I can give them a pass on that.In terms of gray areas, things that some people might like and some people won't: There is a LOT of backtracking through levels, and its really hard to avoid some enemy attacks. You're going to get hit and need items to restore your health. Both of these are really common in all Shantae games though, so they're just kind of expected at this point. I didn't mind backtracking in this game as much as games like Pirate's Curse or Risky's Revenge, though, where you have to go back through entire dungeons to find stuff you might have missed. I also really don't like the TOTALLY CAPS YELLOW TEXT that appears in a lot of dialogue. I just feel it shows up way too often, but it's really not a dealbreaker to a lot of people.Overall, I think I would still consider Pirate's Curse to be the better game. I think its puzzles, bosses, and levels were more fun, and it had a really good story as well as some interesting bombshells, whereas Half-Genie Hero's story falls a little flat as far as these games go. That said, Half-Genie Hero is no slouch, and has been an overall great game that I had a really good time playing.Whether you're a fan of the series or just want to try it out, I recommend Shantae: Half-Genie Hero as a very solid platformer with wonderful visuals and music, and I recommend checking out the other games in the series if you can!

												The 4th Shantae game in the series. Although some people argue this is a remake of the original game, it is not a remake. Regardless, most people think this is the 4th game in the series as the events in this take place after the pirate's curse, and i agree with them, that this game is the 4th in the series.A platformer game that requires different powers to find everything. For example, trasformation dances, which was not in the last game, but comes back for this game. If your not a fan of platformers, I suggest avoiding this game. If not, this is a pretty decent platformer. Unlinke the previous games, this one feels much shorter and linear. There are planned DLC coming out later for this game, so at the writing of this review, the planned DLC had not been made yet and released. Please check out the other two games in the series, which i will provide links below:`Second game in the series.`Third game in the series.Recommended game for fun platforming. Recommended to all my friends.			"

												I never really knew about this game series, before the Kickstarter for this game kicked up a storm of fanart on the internet, I'd never even been much of a platformer fan... but...Playing Shantae: Half Genie Hero, kinda feels like being a kid again, it feels like I'm an 8 year old me sitting on the floor in front of my Playstation with a new interesting game I'd gotten my parents to buy me at the mall.I'd have sat in the car reading the manual booklet from cover to cover all the way home, and now I sit here with the game... and just the game.There's no DLC, no micro-transactions, no gritty realism, no â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t lies about your choices mattering, no tacked on multiplayer as an excuse for always online DRM.Just the game.Just a fun, silly, pun-filled and really well made game with a surprising amount of depth and challenge to it and a great soundtrack too.I'm actually getting a little teary eyed sitting here thinking about why I like this game as much as I do.Like I said, it kinda feels like I'm a kid again, and it feels â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fantastic.Thank you Wayforward.

												I'm not normally one to write reviews, but I really want to write my thoughts on the game somewhere. It's like 4AM though, so I'm not sure how coherent this is going to be, but uh, here we go.First of all, I love the direction that they've taken the art style. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous. The hand-drawn characters over the 3D backgrounds look very nice. Speaking of the characters, I feel that the more chibi-style is really cute. All in all, it's just a great game to look at.The soundtrack is fantastic as usual. A couple of tracks really reminded me of Mighty Switch Force!, which y'know, makes sense considering Jake Kaufman composed the soundtrack to that too. I don't think he's ever produced a track I haven't liked.Now in comparison to the previous titles in the series, I do feel like Half-Genie Hero takes a couple of steps back in places, particularly the level design. I wouldn't really call the game a Metroidvania. The more exploration-based dungeons are gone and have been replaced with much more linear levels divided up into a few sections each followed by a boss. If I had to draw a comparison to something similar, it'd probably be Mega Man. (This certainly doesn't mean I think Mega Man has bad level design or that I think the level design in this game is bad. Really, it's just different.) The scale of the worlds also feels a lot smaller, especially in comparison to Pirate's Curse. I was a little surprised at how short they all felt, even on my first playthrough. I also feel like the game doesn't utilize all of the transformations enough. There are a couple that are really only used once and then never again. There are also a few that don't even really need to be used at all. Most of those are optional though, so it's not a huge deal.I've got a few small issues with the story, too. I'm sure others have said this before, but the game is sort of a soft reboot. There were some character development moments in Pirate's Curse that I was interested to see possibly get expanded upon, but the game kinda just ignores them. It's not really that big of a deal, though. It was just something I was kinda hoping to see. Something that does bother me though, is how disjointed the story feels at times. The events of the game never really feel all that connected and are more like random tasks that are just there to move the plot along. It doesn't really feel all that much like an adventure. The dialogue is great, though. I did enjoy the references to previous games and I laughed at most of the jokes.I know it probably sounds like I'm being too critical, but I really enjoyed the game. It just feels a little weaker compared to the rest of the series, in my opinion. On its own, it's a really great game and a hell of a lot of fun. If you've never played a Shantae game before and you're interested, this is a great place to start. I feel the game does a good enough job of introducing the characters and the world to newcomers. If you do pick it up and enjoy it, then I strongly recommend you check out the others as well. It's a great series and it's really a shame that it's still so relatively unknown.To sum everything up, I feel the game takes some steps forward in certain areas and some steps back in others, but it's still a great experience. Give it a try if you're interested!There's probably more I would like to say, but it's really late and I'm tired so I think I'm about done here.			"

TLDR; if you like collecting stuff and revisiting levels to collect more stuff, you'll like this. Sort of like a Metroidvania with the level-to-level gameplay of Mega Man.Gameplay is fun. There's lots of items to collect if you want to get the 100% clear rating! Revisiting the stages with power-ups you've collected since is rewarding, occasionally expanding into areas you didn't expect. The upgrade shop is a nice idea, but could do with a bit more stuff in it. The difficulty curve starts a bit higher than average - it might be a bit difficult for a beginner player - but it peters out towards the end as it doesn't scale well to match all of the upgrades you've amassed. The bosses are okay, but some of them are quite boring, especially the two phases of the final boss. Controls are nice and responsive (as they should be!), but I'd recommend using a gamepad.The visuals are great! Shantae definitely benefits from not being on a tiny handheld screen! They've built upon the techniques they learnt while making Ducktales: Remastered - bright 3D environments with 2D animated characters. The characters are really well animated, and share a nice, consistent style.Music is on point as well! It's been done by the wonderful Jake Kaufman (who also appeared on previous WayForward titles). Definitely some very catchy songs in there, my favourite being the haunted castle stage.Luckily the story isn't the focus of the game, because it's an afterthought at best. I'm not familiar with the series, but it seems clear that they tried to squeeze every single earlier-established character into the game. They also introduce a new character... only to have that character be killed off five minutes later. Overall, it doesn't really make much sense.The writing is terrible - it definitely tries way too hard to be funny. It seems like it was written by a four-year-old; I remember one of the worst offenders being ""hey, guess what? Monkey butts"". Unfortunately, you need to read some of the text to know what to do next; if you don't want to read it, try skipping through the main text, then talk to the NPC characters afterwards to get them to repeat the important details.Overall, it's a good platforming experience! It suffers from being a bit short - it took me 7 hours to 100% it at a rather leisurely pace - but I'm aware that there's more content coming in the future.			"

A worthy successor to the Shantae franchise Once again imbued with her magic powers, Shantae has access to a record-breaking twelve transformations. Each form bears a unique function that allows you to further unravel a level on subsequent playthroughs. There's plenty of fresh, risque content to pique your interest. Several new, cute enemies are bound to catch your eye. It's refreshing to see fantasy mainstays like ghosts and slimes portrayed as cute, sultry ladies. Newcomers and familiar faces both are given a fresh look as the entire game is now beautifully rendered and animated in cel-shaded art, an upgrade from those classic pixels. The storyline remains as lighthearted and humorous as ever. Progressing the story once again hinges upon catering to fetch quests and revisiting old levels with new powers. Levels are now incredibly linear, complete with a level select screen ala Megaman.  A tremendous amount of effort has been put into developing the bosses, these are by far the most developed in the series. Unfortunately I must temper my praise for this game by pointing out a few fundamental, glaring flaws. Several transformations and their upgrades go nearly or entirely unused. Most forms can't attack by default, and those that can be upgraded to strike are not viable compared to Shantae's regular form. This game should have focused on four main transformations, consolidating their abilities (Mermaid and crab have too much overlap) and giving them decent attacks. Majora's Mask did it better. In Pirate's Curse you had access to every upgrade at the press of a single button. The final gauntlet was complex, requiring all of your abilities in conjunction with one another. In here you have sections of gameplay sharply divided between each transformation with no interplay. I love going back to a level with new powers to find new items. Here I ended up repeating the same levels four or more times, well beyond being able to enjoy my revisits. You can 100% the game in under 3 hours, but your first time without a guide may take you up to six. Since the levels are entirely linear, the game world feels less interconnected and more sterile. Unlocking new transformations no longer fills me with any sense of wonder partially since there are so many and also since they're not punctuated by deeply buried, ancient shrines. There are no dungeons, and the penultimate level is painfully brief. Amazing art direction coupled with Jake Kaufman's musical prowess make for a winning combination. Half Genie Hero is another wonderful installment, but doesn't hit the same high notes as Pirate's Curse.			"

												After 3 years in development, the fourth installment of the Shantae franchise has finally been released. Is Half-Genie Hero worth the weight? Well, let's find out.Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is the fourth game in the sassy and charming Shantae series and now in high-definition. The visuals in this game are fantastic to say the least. The game mixes colorful and nicely textured 3D assets with high-quality 2D sprites. The animations on characters are also excellent and gives the game some life. Game also ran very well at least for me it did. No crashes either.Unlike Pirate's Curse, Half-Genie Hero brings back the transformations from the first two games; however, they made some more changes to the system in this one. The way transformations work now is that you go into dance mode and the game goes through a menu of transformations automatically and you use the d-pad (if you played it on a controller which I did) to select your transformation. Additionally, there is now a grand-total of 14 transformations (2 of them can be swapped) with some being more useful than others. The transformations are fun to use but they are not as good as the Pirate Gear from the previous game due to having to pause and wait to select the transformation you want to use which can ruin the flow of the gameplay. There is an upgrade that increases Shantae's dancing animation speed which helps somewhat.Now for the most important part, the gameplay. Is it any good? Absolutely. It controls nearly as well as Pirate's Curse and using the transformations is still fun despite not flowing as well as the Pirate Gear. The game is more linear than its predecessors but the metroidvania elements are still there as you will be doing a lot of backtracking in earlier levels to go into areas you wouldn't have access to before. The levels are fun to explore but the lack of dungeons is really disappointing. The Shantae games always had really fun dungeons to explore and the lack of them in this game is a crime. I don't know why they removed them but hopefully they will bring them back in the next game. Also, there is no map in this game which is odd considering that Risky's Revenge and Pirate's Curse had maps. The game seems to be quite shorter than the other entries but there will be new character modes that will be coming up later on which should increase the length of the game.The music is composed by Jake Kaufman once again and I must say, some of the tracks in this game are the best in the whole series. The soundtrack of this game consists of high-quality remixes of songs from previous games and new tracks. There is one track from the previous games that gets reused but is only used for one section. Overall, the soundtrack does not disappoint and Jake Kaufman has done an amazing job once again.Now for the story, I know the story isn't really the main focus in these games but Pirate's Curse did a pretty good job on that aspect and this game seems to ignore some of the character development from that game. Risky just goes back to her ""LOL IM EVIL"" self without any explaination and a few characters from the last two games don't make an appearence in this game. Speaking of Risky, there is a lack of Risky in this game as she only appears in the beginning and the end of the game. The story feels pretty unfocused throughout the majority of the game as each level in the game feels more like an episode of ""Shantae beats the bad guy from doing bad things"". The rival Half-Genie that appears early on in the game would have made for an interesting story but they just conclude her story shortly afterwards. Despite the story being unfocused, the dialogue is still very funny and charming.Overall, Half-Genie Hero is a very polished and well made game that will not disappoint any fan in the series. It may not be as good as Pirate's Curse but it's still a great entry to the franchise. Due to its pretty short length, I would recommend to pick this one up on a sale and/or when the new character modes come out.			"

												Disclaimer: I backed the kickstarter (sort of). To be more accurate, I gave a paypal donation that counted towards backing the game well after the campaign had been successfully funded. I'd just finished Pirate's Curse and was excited to see how they'd treat the franchise going forward. Well, you see that red thumb in the corner so I've got some explaining to do.Let's start things off by saying that my actual feelings towards this game lie somewhere in the middle, however, steam only has a binary ""good or bad"" system for rating games. Given what I have to say though, I'm sad to say I'm going to have to give this a thumbs down. The game leaves a great first impression but the deeper you get in the more you can see the cracks in its structure.Let's start off with the positives. The music is fantastic, Jake Kaufman continues to be one of my favorite game music composers and I'm delighted to enjoy the soundtrack to most games he's worked on. The upgrade from pixel art to drawn sprites is absolutely wonderful. The future looks great assuming they stick with this art style, the game looks fantastic. The controls are nice and responsive and the basic gameplay has a good feel to it. While my issues with the genie transformations, that have followed me as I've played through all four games in the series, aren't entirely solved in this game they're much quicker to access, especially with the metronome, which I consider a must have item. There's a couple fun ideas for settings and it's neat to see how the tech of this world is advancing in each installment.Unfortunately, good music and visuals do not alone for a good game make, now we're in the negatives. The game only has a small handful of levels that feel shorter and shorter the more you have to scour over every inch of them to find more collectables to progress the story. That's the biggest problem with the game, it's spread incredibly thin over a very small and tightly packed space. I loved my first run through each level, the first time through mermaid falls is my personal highlight of this game. The second run through, it was neat to see how little elements had changed. However, by the time I'd finally gotten everything there was to pick up I was pretty much sick of every area. Well, aside from the first and the fifth one which are both, comparatively, tiny levels with little to do.The linear ""level"" structure really went against what I've become familiar with in this series. While the map design is nowhere near as bad as Risky's Revenge, (Which, as it stands, is my least favorite entry in this franchise by a wide margin.) it's definitely a huge step back from Pirate's Curse. They went from open maps to screen to screen ""levels"" packed with things you are required to get but can't until you get more transformations. Aside from that, the biggest problem with them is how they're checkpointed, which is really only an issue because of any of the instant death traps that are in the later environments. The game isn't really all that hard but instant death spikes/lasers isn't how you remedy that. (Side Note: Games don't have to be ""hard"" to be good.) At best, it's a nuisance, but at worst it's a complete waste of time. Some genie transformations are usefully only for one or two manditory uses to collect an item but outside of that are completely pointless when put up against the other transformations you get (spider). Any points I can get into beyond this get more into the territory of nitpicking so I'll spare you that.If I were to give you a recommendation it'd be for what is, in my opinion, the best of this series and perhaps the only 5/5 worthy one on the list. I'd highly encourage you to check out Shantae and the Pirate's Curse. It goes above and beyond all 3 of the games it sits alongside. Funnily enough, it's the only game where Shantae doesn't have her genie powers (animal transformations) and I think it plays like a dream because using your abilities flows better with the controls. There's no stopping to turn into a less powerful, less interesting form. Instead you flow smoothly through actions. Be careful though since there might, unfortunately, be some odd issues with the PC port of Pirate's curse based on my browse of the community page.  If Wayforward could ""remaster"" Pirates Curse with these visuals it'd be a dream come true. Edit: 12/30/2016 This review was made with the base version of the game in mind. In the event that any of the added characters/campaigns be paid DLC I feel my review will not need to be adjusted to reflect content sold separately of the original product. There's no guarantee that I'll think to return to the game by the time additional content is added. Any willing to ""take up the mantle"" are free to do so in my absence.Author's note: If you enjoy the game, great, more power to you. I'm honestly happy that you have a thing to be happy with. You don't have to agree with me, in fact, I don't expect you to. I just felt compelled to put this together by the time I'd finished with the game. I don't often share my opinions in writing like this but I felt like I had a case to make even though it was going against the tide. Hope your day treats you well.			"

												Okay... I have no idea where to start. Shantae and The Pirate's Curse amazed me. Half Genie Hero astonished me. I have literally tried for hours to find the right things to say and give this game a proper review, but I'm at a loss. There are just too many good things and not enough bad things to say about it. Nonetheless, here are my personal pros and cons...Pros: AMAZING GAMEAdorable charactersWonderful visuals and animationJAKE KAUFMAN'S MUSICExtremely fun gameplayShantae's voiceDecent game lengthGiga Mermaid was such an awesome boss fight!ShantaeCons:I sometimes felt that having to transform so frequently stalled gameplay.Not enough spoken dialogue for our favorite lil genie girl.Some of the fan art was... weird :PI was initially disappointed at how Shantae goes off-center of the screen when running through Scuttle Town. I wasmuch relieved to see this wouldn't be the case throughout the remainder of the game.Last but not least... I really don't like how the background of the stages adopt a blue fog after you've completed it. It especially hurts the Mermaid Falls' appearance... there goes my prerry sky and clouds.. :(I feel really awful that I wasn't aware of the kickstarter campaign. I had no internet at the time, but I would have gladly pitched $100 to this game. I also feel awful that it was gifted to me... and my friend got it on sale. I would have wanted WayForward to get the extra $2. Every little bit counts, and it certainly shows in this game. I love Shantae and I love WayForward for making this amazing title happen. An amazing series with an amazing character, Shantae Half Genie Hero is a continuation of some of the best games I have played since the rest of the gaming industry went nuts on us.9/10 "

												[Full Disclosure - Kickstarter Backer ]The game is short.If you don't know what you're doing, you'll beat it in about 6 - 7 hours.If you do know, you can beat it in less than 3.Fortunately, the game has enough charm and fun to make up for it.The art direction is cute and full of color.The platforming and exploration is solid - and the sped up transformations keep the gameplay snappy.Jake ""Virt"" Kaufman knocks it out again with amazing musical tracks.Overall, a wonderful addition to the series. If you don't mind short, but fun, experiences - I highly suggest this game.But, if you're iffy about your purchase due to length, there will be multiple character campaigns coming soon to extend the experience.

												Full disclosure: I am a Kickstarter backer of this game.The Shantae series has been a consistent provider of well-crafted platform adventures since the original was released on the Game Boy Color, with each game adding new refinements to a proven formula. This latest release continues the trend with updated abilities and a combination of hand-drawn and 3D graphics.As mentioned, this game doesn't deviate much from previous Shantae games - though this isn't a bad thing. Bad guys are up to bad things in Sequin Land, and it's Shantae's job to collect what she needs to stop them. Fans of the series will be on familiar territory, and metroidvania fans will find a lot to like. The characters are endearing and memorable, and the plot would fit nicely in a well-written Saturday morning cartoon.Of course, an important element in any game of this type is the quality of the puzzles and secrets. This game has well-crafted ones just difficult enough to make you want to finish them, without being overly frustrating. I was able to clear 96% of the game without a guide, and the items I had to really work for can be passed over if you just want to play through without finding every little secret. The boss fights are mostly of the ""action puzzle"" variety as well. At times, the method for beating them wasn't immediately clear, but it didn't require much work to figure it out, and the fights themselves were still challenging.As for the shift in art style, I am in favor of it. As much as I appreciate well-done sprite graphics (and I do), the hand-drawn characters really suit this series, and it goes well with the cartoony atmosphere. Speaking of, I enjoyed the dialogue as well, with well-written humor that managed to be sharp without resorting to being too crude.All in all, I think adventure fans will enjoy this game if they've never tried the series before, and returning Shantae fans will be well satisfied. Shantae is securing her position among gaming greats.			"

												It's a Shantae game, in both the good ways and the bad ways.The good ways are that Shantae looks and sounds better than ever, and that the characteristic good writing is present, along with all the characters you know and love(or love to hate).The bad ways are in the sense that every Shantae game is, to some extent, experimental. Some aspects and mechanics recur, but every single game is made up of those ""classic"" elements mixed evenly with the developers tossing new ideas up into the air and seeing what sticks. But it feels like they rarely test these things(except to avoid bugs), as long as nothing's outright breaking the game, it stays in, and the final test of whether it's actually fun or functional, is left for the game's buyers to figure out.For instance, we've got the shapeshifting from Risky's Revenge back again, this time with even more forms. But there are a couple of forms that you'll never actually use(outside of their mandated one or two applications for gaining bonus items or quest items), because their uses are either extremely niche(elephant, spider and mouse, looking at you) or heavily overlapped with another form. Some also feel like they weren't tested much, since the Bat allows you to trivialize large parts of some areas(sky bridge in the desert, hello to just flying past all those platforms).Boss fights also still feel spastic rather than tactical. I'm sure I'm going to get the usual ""git gud"" comments for this, but in some platformers, I can go into a boss fight, and after screwing up one or two waves, I can go: ""Oh, okay, this is what they want me to do."" And then sure, I may lack the brains or dexterity to actually do it, but I can always see the IDEA. In HGH, there are some attacks where I just can't see HOW to dodge them, some bosses where I just can't figure out their mechanics(what actually triggers the Tinkerbrain popping up its canisters?) and the game also suffers a bit from some things that look good being a bit counterproductive.In the case of boss fights, circular boss arenas are VERY neat, since they basically give you ""infinite"" horizontal space without any screen scroll, but it makes it hell to judge the distances of something rolling towards you, and when there's a LOT of stuff in the middle of the circle, like in the final battle, it can be hard to see projectiles spawned on the other side of the circle before they're all the way past the clutter and way in  your face.In general, the improved graphics also feel like they make things a bit more vague. It's less ""sharp"" where spikes end and where they begin, or what parts of a heavily animated flame projectile actually burns you. I mean, it looks GREAT, not denying that, but it feels like if you're gonna do that in a platformer, you should be a bit more forgiving about hit areas. It also feels like there's no ""good"" difficulty in the game. Like, again, I enjoyed it, but I never really felt challenged except by instakill spikes in a couple of areas, and that's not the sort of challenge that appeals to me(seriously, WayForward, the final dungeon of Pirate's Curse was a mistake. PLEASE don't try to recapture any of that. Ever.). But unless you intentionally avoided upgrades and heart holders, it just feels like you can brute force your way through most areas, chugging a few consumables when necessary, and the same for the boss fights. On the one hand, a bit more challenge would make it feel a bit more satisfying when beating an area, but on the other hand, I appreciate that if I really get stuck on doing something ""right"" I can just power through it with potions.I'm also not sure how I feel about the new approach to travelling, with the world map and warp dances. It makes everything feel easier, backtracking is considerably less of a pain, but it also makes Sequin Land feel less like a world, and more like a series of levels. But that's probably a personal thing.Finally, there are a few technical issues, mostly related to some animations ""chopping"" a bit, sometimes characters flicker partway through animations, etc. but it's pretty rare. It's almost completely isolated to the world map screen where Sky, Wrench and Shantae sometimes behave a bit oddly.So ultimately, the verdict is: It needs polish, and in some cases issues that have been showing up in Shantae games since Risky's Revenge need to be recognized as issues and addressed, but it's got so much heart that I can't pretend I don't love it. This was money well-spent for me, and it will be for anyone else who likes the Shantae games. Because like me, I bet you've spent half an hour listing all the things that could be fixed about Risky's Revenge and Pirate's Curse, but then you finish by going: ""I loved the game anyway. How did they manage to make a zombie so cute?""You know, unless you have no taste and don't agree that Rottytops is best girl.			"

												I AM A BACKER OF HALF GENIE HERO'S KICKSTARTER AND I HAVE PLAYED MORE HOURS THAN LISTED ON STEAM.The 4th game in the Shantae Series, and it continues to be an incredibly funny, and fun Platformer.For Shantae Fans, Half-Genie Hero is more Shantae Goodness to enjoy, and it's the easiest entry in the franchise.For New Comers to Shantae: Gameplay-wise: Half-Genie Hero is a fun platformer with great controls and dance abilities to traverse and explore each level in it's entirety. With new dances/abilities you can explore and discover secrets as well as new methods to blast through each level. It is not as complicated and vast as previous entries. There's no chance of getting lost as there are plenty of hints in the game to tell you where to go. The challenge only comes in from getting 100% Collectibles.Story-wise, It's best to play previous entries before Half Genie Hero, as the story HEAVILY references events from (2nd) Risky's Revenge and (3rd) Pirate's Curse, with previous villains return to fight Shantae. Anything beyond treads Spoiler TerritoryThe only Technical issue I experienced was the frustration from restarting the game in order to change the resolution or switching from Windowed or Fullscreen.Other than that, the tranistion to HD was well done.One of the most Successfully funded Crowdfunded Games ever made. And There is promised additions and characters to the game incoming in 2017.Half Genie Hero is a Highly Recommended Platformer. Shantae is Cute, funny and too pure for this world.			"

												Everybody's favorite Half-Genie Hero is back and Ret-2-Go! She's dancing her way through the danger with a variety of forms, spells, and items--but does it hold up compared to the former entries?Mostly, yes. Let's start off with some pros.PROS: *The new art design is absolutely gorgeous, with painstaking attention paid to both the animation fidelity and character design. Sequin Land and its people have never looked so good. *Core gameplay is still superb: jump, whip your hair back and forth, and dodge what you can as you make your way through levels and discover hidden secrets with the help of any shapeshifting forms you happen to pick up along the way (and after). If you've played a Shantae game before? You'll feel right at home.*As always, the soundtrack is a joy to listen to. Nothing more to say on that--the music is great!*If you're a fan of the usual dialogue found in a Shantae game--wacky, weird, and sometimes a little 4th Wall-Breaking with a veritable drenching of saccharine Feel Good Vibes--then you're in for a treat. It's not gonna make you think on the existential crisis that plagues us all, but hey, it'll warm your heart and probably get you to crack a smile. Just as good, right?But, no game is perfect. So let's look at some cons.CONS:*While the backtracking you'd come to expect from Shantae, or any Metroidvania for that matter, is still present? It feels cut down, streamlined, and less rewarding than before. While you'll amass over a dozen new forms that get your hips shaking, most of them are rarely used for more than bit puzzles--and then they're never really needed again. Mermaid, Monkey, and Harpy eventually become your main forms, and the rest are kind of left hanging.*While the dialogue remains as endearing as ever, the main storyline itself feels somewhat disconnected from the actual theme it's trying to convey. There are also elements that're introduced, but addressed in a manner that feels lacking--looking at you, Holly.*While the UI itself is very comfortable, the menu screen suffers from some clutter issues that were a minor irritation. Items you wouldn't think to use again--like the previous ranks of your damage upgrades--are kept in the inventory as toggles, so you can weaken yourself by choice. Still, that's a case of ""Your Mileage May Vary."" I could see somebody using those toggles as self-inflicted ""hard mode"" conditions.*It's not long. I clocked in at around seven hours to complete the main campaign, though there's the additional Hero mode to tackle for fun--you get to start a new game with all of your main forms.Shante: Half-Genie Hero isn't -better- than the previous games, but despite some minor gripes and irritations, I find it still holds up rather well to former iterations of the series. There's also the point that DLC will be introduced at a later date which may shake up some of my points. If it does? I'll revise my review to accommodate.Still, if you're looking for a simple ""buy it or not"" deal? Go ahead and buy it. It's good, simple fun that's worth the price of admission. "

												This game took me 6 hours to complete at 100%. I'm a tad disappointed but I had a lot of fun. It's not as thorough as the other games were when it came to level design. One entrance, one exit. Small puzzle rooms inbetween and one main gimmick. I miss the Zelda like dungeons from the other games, but this Mega Man like approach isn't so bad. It's just a shame that it starts out with huge amounts of puzzles in the first 2 levels then the rest just peeter out. The last 2 levels have like no collectables in it whilst around 45% of the games collectables are found in the SECOND one. It's insane the weighting on content. Not too pleased at the concept of DLC being made during development that's free to backers. I'd have backed if I knew backing was even an option. Oh well hopefully it's not stupidly priced considering the game makes stabs at that concept. tl;dr: It's fun, but it won't last you long. The other games have more content but it's pretty and Jake Kaufman is still legendary.			"

												For the most part, if you want Shovel Knight with breasts, this is the game for you! But in all honesty, this game is quite the sight to behold. It was one of the Kickstater Triplets. Shantae and Shovel Knight were, and I can proudly say this, amazing games. Shantae's platforming mixed with item play to help increase the color and gameplay style is something that I've come to love in platformers as a whole. Shovel Knight is another great example of this. This game brought me a good share of laughs and a good share of, ""Holy Skag Sack! I can do that!?"" I recommend this game for those who enjoy a good platformer with some RPG aspects. Along with jiggle physics and a colorful artstyle.			"

A solid step forward for Shantae Games ||  Spoiler FreeI LOVE the Shantae games, and after waiting a while for Half Genie Hero to come out (not a backer, wish I was, just love the series) I was very very excited going into it, and after finishing the game, I can say that it is my personal favorite Shantae game in the series, and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good platformer with solid graphics and excellent music.Half Genie Hero is a lovely HD entry in the Shantae series, and the music and graphics is a nice step forward for the series, as it breaths new life into the franchise and makes everything look, feel and sound better. One thing it does differently compared to Risky's Revenge and Pirate's Curse is change up the level.Where Pirate's Curse changed Risky's Revenge's world layout from a single world to a hub system, Half Genie Hero took the hub world and made it level based. There is backtracking in this game, but once you have completed the level through once, you can use a special dance to warp from one part of the level to another. There are typically three parts to a level, but [side note] if you warp from the first part of a level to the second part, you cannot go back. This can be a little annoying, but it isn't too bad so long as you remember why you came to a level. The level design also makes it a bit easier to track item collecting throughout the game, as you can see which items you have / haven't collected in the level select area, and compared to last game, this made it enjoyable to collect everything in the game.One thing that I VERY much enjoyed was the unlockable concept art. This is something that I found to be very rewarding, as I am one who likes those unlockables, especially when the game makes it doable and entertaining to unlock (and is a pretty enjoyable game). There are seven concept art galleries and three fan art galleries, but that's as far as I'll talk on that.The bosses throughout the game are pretty fun and interesting, and they all added a little bit of personallity into the game. The enemies were okay (or as okay as enemies get); they look beautiful thanks to the HD graphics and, like the bosses, add personality to the levels they inhabit. ""Will this take long to complete?"" No. It took me around nine-ish hours, give or take. I was able to get about 93% of the achievements in the process, but I definitely see myself going back for the Hero Mode and perhaps another general playthrough.Overall, I really enjoyed this game. Is it different than Pirate's Curse? Yeah. Do I like the changes made? Yes. So take my opinion and review as you will, but I do recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good platformer with solid graphics and excellent music, as I enjoyed every minute playing it and am excited to see where this franchise will go next.

My first jump into Shantae: Half-Genie HeroThis felt magical again! Like ""Risky Boots Revenge"" - the first Shantae game I played. Transformations are back, the graphics feel more HD (the previous games were made for the Nintendo DS and thus had a way smaller resolution), and familiar faces in every direction.Stages are set up ""Select Screen"" style again. I preferred the way they did it in Risky Boots Revenge - the world map I mean - and thought it was a downgrade to the game world as a whole when it went from that to a simple stage select in The Pirate's Curse - which they kept for this. It's not the worst thing in the world though.The puzzles weren't hard until the final level. Most of the stages weren't set up with puzzles.  There were some here and there (avoiding laser beams, climbing a maze before time is up, the entire final level) but most levels were based around exploration or simple advancement from point A to B through a horde of enemies.A lot of the transformations completely outclassed other transformations. I enjoyed using them anyway - and I felt a bit more lenient about there being forms that were less useful when I found out some of them were just tossed in as extra rewards for the players to enjoy.While the graphics themselves were enhanced the animations for the characters seemed a little less amped than the previous games in the series. I mean I still enjoyed them and they still came to a point I feel keeps WayForward of the ""We care about the animation quality"" mentality, but they were clearly a little less ambitious than previous games on that specific detail. There's only one dance animation for example when everybody was amazed at her dancing in Risky Boots' Revenge. I can totally understand why though: they added several times more transformations so waiting for a cycle of 20 dances to roll through would have been unintuitive and probably aggravating after a bit.Pet PeevesThere weren't many levels. At the end I felt like the game could have gone on another few hours. The game length on my first play through - which included a lot of fooling around, some gem grinding, and a decent amount of backtracking for 100% completion - was roughly about 10-11 hours. So the game holds up in length, but the stages don't feel numerous - especially after finding out two of the levels were added as Kickstarter rewards.The final stage was another spikes-and-pitfall level that made the game hard for the wrong reason. To be fair sometimes the only reason the challenging parts are challenging is because they can be cheap, but in Shantae's series it's always shooting itself in its own foot since it throws away the point of spending extra hours finding more health. I'd have preferred more numerous enemies and stronger enemies over spikes and pitfalls again; something to give the health bar some stress in combat.Holly, a character that seemed centered on an  interesting rival-genie arc, is resolved very quickly. She has a decent buildup to what ultimately just concludes and disappears into thin air all of a sudden. I think she would have offered something new to the universe as an rival character even if only for one game before the rivalry were concluded, but it ended so fast it could easily have been skipped entirely. ConclusionI played with the transformations like toys. I love the transformations. I did what I could to try and beat every stage I reasonably could as each transformation (which I'm still in the middle of doing). Ultimately I feel the transformations are what make a Shantae game a Shantae game. I feel like the game lost something about it that was there in the earlier games but I can't put my finger on it. It also added more ""something else"". It still feels like a Shantae game. Just somehow with a little more and a little less ""something"". I really could have seen it being longer but despite  feeling as though I blazed through it they did pack content into this game. I think it feels slightly unfinished because a lot of this content can't be used effectively.			"

												Shantae: 1/2 Genie Hero is exactly what it was initially intended to be: a shined and polished Shantae title that offers a fourth helping of exactly what made the previous titles so well-loved. While it still has a lot of growing to do to live up to everything WayForward has promised (in the form of DLC and other bonuses), the core game is ret-2-go, and for the most part, it's pretty wonderful.As with previous installments, Shantae: 1/2 Genie Hero follows a policy of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" retaining the same core gameplay mechanics it's always had while further refining the way extras like items and transformations work.As always, Shantae runs, jumps, and attacks enemies with her hair, exploring (and occasionally backtracking through) five main worlds, each chock full of secrets and surprises, and as with the first two titles, earns (or discovers) new transformations that enable her to navigate her world in different ways.While the immediate predecessor (The Pirate's Curse) temporarily did away with transformations in favor of new abilities that blended seamlessly with Shantae's standard controls, reverting to the transformation mechanic is handled tastefully. Shantae can now choose from a palette of up to 12 ""dances,"" which are accessed via a single button press and subsequent single directional command, enabling Shantae to transform in and out of forms hastily to suit the occasion. Many of these dances are optional, hidden, or available for purchase, and a few are actually mutually exclusive- players must decide if they'd rather hold onto, say, a convenient teleportation dance, or a form that spits out free money. Players are free to change their mind on these choices, but only via trade with the merchant who sells said optional dances.While a few of these forms are combat-capable (or can be made so via hidden upgrades), few if any are ever more viable for combat than Shantae's base form. Though Shantae can no longer pick up hand-to-hand secret techniques or upgrade her arsenal with pirate weaponry, her trusty battle-ponytail can be upgraded as in previous titles do deal quite a bit of damage. If this seems duller than integrating projectiles and blades into your fighting style, fear not. Series mainstay items like the Pike Ball and Storm Puff have been given a very welcome upgrade- rather than consumables to be purchased and used at the player's discretion, these magic items now manifest as permanent upgradeable skills in Shantae's arsenal, swapped out as sub-weapons and usable for as long as Shantae has the magic power to deploy them (think Mega Man). Thus, players can now hurl flames and thunderbolts at will, or protect themselves with barriers and damaging satellites. While not quite as seamless as the previous title's pirate powers, this is a fun system that puts the series' classic quirky weapons on full glorious display. This is largely a welcome change, but I couldn't help but notice that sometimes the extra powers made things *too* easy. The fully upgraded bubble shield, for example, makes Shantae completely invincible for as long as she has magic remaining. This synergizes very well with items that expand Shantae's mana pool, to the point that by the game's final challenge, I found I was able to remain invincible indefinitely. I'm not sure if this was an oversight or simply poor judgment, but I hope to see it fixed in the near future- I'm not opposed to letting players enjoy some casual godmoding, but I feel like offering it to players just before the last boss is in poor taste.Indeed, the difficulty of the game is perhaps its weakest attribute. While the game has a few sections that new players are very likely to need to repeat again and again (an aspect soothed tremendously by the introduction of frequent autosaves), I often found myself sufficiently geared and upgraded to pass most challenges on my first try, not from skill, but from simply having so many health items and defensive upgrades at my disposal. The game does offer players the choice to turn off any specific upgrade at will (which is, honestly, a fantastic option to provide), but offers no real incentive to do so- after facing the odd gauntlet of instant death two or three times, I falsely presumed the rest of the game would match that challenge and prepared accordingly, only to watch the rest of the game crumble before my seemingly-bottomles well of force fields and monster steaks, and before I knew it, it was over.After three years in development, I'm a little surprised. True, the worlds are enormous and the powers vast, but five main worlds? Just five? I confess I'm a bit disappointed by the shortness. I completed this game with 100% progress in exactly the same amount of time as I took to complete the previous title. DLC promises new levels and modes, such as the ability to play as the other main characters in their own separate stories, and as much as I did truly and consistently enjoy my first playthrough as Shantae, I do welcome the chance to do it all again differently. Still, until those new modes arrive, I must say, the game feels a little scant for all the work that's clearly gone into it.And to speak of that work- my goodness is this game ever gorgeous. The characters are presented as hand-drawn faithful recreations of their old sprites, and if one recalls just how fluidly-animated those sprites were, one can correctly assume the degree to which this title absolutely gushes charm. The visual style of lively 2D characters against lovingly-rendered 3D backdrops works marvelously here, and unlike other 2.5D titles there's no question of where obstacles begin and end.  Shantae: Half Genie Hero is without a doubt the tightest 2.5D game I've yet experienced.As for the story, it's a bit less compelling than its immediate predecessor, but every bit as hilarious. Shantae has really found its essence in humor and awkard charm- I caught myself laughing out loud once or twice, and my heart lept to see certain characters reappear. Still, while I was never bored by the dialogue or story, I don't feel that this game has yet managed to outdo itself in terms of weaving a truly epic narrative. Pirate's Curse opened the characters up to a measure of depth not previously seen- we saw a powerless Shantae, a vulnerable Risky, a lost Rottytops, a successful Bolo and a terminally misfortunate Sky. None of this is present in Shantae's latest adventure, and while it does tell a pleasantly lighthearted story, we've seen WayForward do better.After so much time in development, Shantae: 1/2 Genie Hero feels solid, if surprisingly sparse, and is over long before it has a chance to wear out its welcome. With the promise of expansive DLC on the horizon, I feel hopeful that WayForward will gradually flesh this game out into the epic adventure we imagined it becoming. Perhaps future stories will introduce us to new sides of beloved characters, offer us the chance to approach the world from a new perspective, or simply expand upon an already successful formula. For now, though, it's another short yet fantastic romp through Sequin Land, and well worth the price of admission.			"

												A very enjoyable and well crafted 2D gaming experience. The best way to describe it would be a ""Meteroidvania light featuring cute girls""If you like a game that has:- A cute art style- Some great humor- Varied gameplay with some really creative transformations and settings, light puzzles and some backtracking- Metroidvania games- Neat and enjoyable music- Tight 2D Action controlsYou'll like this one! If I had to criticize it, I'd say that the difficulty really ramps quite suddenly at the end and some of the checkpoints can be a bit heartless here and there. Generally, I really loved it however!

												So far it's absolutely amazing, this is one of my favorite series and this new game doesn't disappoint. Unforunately there are a few issues but it's mostly due to techincal issues. The two issue I'm currently running into are Screen Tearing and Resolution Cap however through doing some configuration in the NVIDIA Control Panel I managed to fix it. The resoultion cap hasn't been so lucky, whenever I set the resoultion above 320x200 and restart the game there's sound but only a black screen. This might have to do with my setup but I know a few people have ran into this problem so your results may varyAside from that I can easily reccommend to anyone looking for a good metroidvania platformer or if you like the previous Shantae games, but if you do mind the techincal issues I would hold off until this gets patched.EDIT: I did try this game out on my Desktop and not only was the screen tearing gone but also it ran at all full 1080p so it definitely varies.

												Elephant Dance? Check. GAME. OF. THE. YEAR.Half-Genie Hero feels and plays like an HD 2.5D Shantae should. The animation and music are, as usual, incredible. The dialogue is hilarious and it's great to see all the old favorite characters return. This entry has more in common with Risky's Revenge than Pirate's Curse, as you'll be dancing to take animal form, INCLUDING THE TRIUMPHANT RETURN OF THE ELEPHANT! It feels rock-solid right from the start and you'll be hair-whipping mermaids in no time.Two very minor, very patchable gripes though: my natural instinct is to use Escape to get out of/go back in menus, and that doesn't work here. Two, monkey controls for climbing might take you a bit of getting used to, as they're not what you'd think they'd be (pressing toward the wall does nothing, pressing away from the wall holds you still, can't remember if it felt this sticky in Risky's Revenge).Overall though, I am loving the game and am very happy with how it turned out! Worth picking up if you enjoyed the previous games or are in the market for a fun, colorful, and actually fairly challenging Metroidvania platformer! "

												This game takes all the charm and fun from the previous Shantae titles and presents it in a beautiful package.This was definitely worth the wait from the earliest days of the kickstarter campaign through today.I cannot really recommend this game highly enough.  If you've enjoyed any of the previous Shantae games, or are just a fan of action platformers in general, do yourself a favor and pick this game up for yourself.			"

												A great addition to the Shantae line of games that have become big favorites of mine. To start off, 2D animation amongst 3D shaded backgrounds looks sharp! I was a little surprised at first, because I had played Shantae so much in it's pixel art form, but this new style WayForward has adopted for the series is fantastic and I got used to it fairly quickly. That also including the control scheme which is very snappy and responsive! Shantae has become a living realtime cartoon and it is a major factor that I'm so glad the series now has.Major and minor characters are back including Bolo, Uncle Mimic and Rottytops and they all have great dialogue and look great in the new style. The character interactions and text are all very funny, even including some fun unexpected moments where the characters will speak automatically, used a bit more here than in Pirate's Curse. I also really like how townsfolk give you hints and small clues, which comes in handy for dummies like me in those moments where I'm stupid and can't put 2 and 2 together.Music is great as always, Jake Kaufman bringin' it down with more sick remixes of Scuttle town and Burning Town. The new song sung by Shantae (Cristina Vee) is awesome when you first hear it on Main Street. Absolutely a major factor that makes the game stand out and goes along great with it. Though I will say I take more of a liking to Pirate Curse's tracks, these orchestral songs are great and are very dance worthy.The transformations are back from Shantae's earlier games, being staple powerups. They are used awesomely in this game! Very quick to transform and each stage uses different transformations for key areas to find secrets and other essestial items for achievement hunters and casuals alike. For Pirate's Curse of course, I did like how snappy and fast it was to use the pirate items for the corresponding buttons, but each key feature of the chosen transformation helps out greatly in areas, not just to get around the level, but also to find secrets. And hey, it's all worth it just to see Shantae dance again!Oh man, the bosses are pretty good too this time around. They all have some cool attack patterns and look great all while the kickin' battle them is blasting from your headphones. They're all varied and some do bring out great fun. Whoever thought up that rad giant mermaid needs a big ol' smooch.If I had to bring up any cons at all or stuff that just irked me personally, there's nothing that kept me from enjoying the game majorly. But the story is a biiiiit more straight forward this time around, and each world is sort of broken down into tiny subplots that don't really show up again, such as with Holly Lingerbean, the new kid on the block who's sort of just kicked out in a few minutes. But the small stories are essential for getting items back into the main plot.Some characters also felt kinda weird in this game, there's not a lot of ongoing character development carried on from past games. Risky in Pirate's Curse was Shantae's arch nemesis doin evil stuff as always,  but when the pair had to work together, she became a sort of hothead with a short temper while she worked with the good guys compared to Shantae's upbeat goofiness. She also came with a backstory where she used to have a powerful master. Here's she's just kind of the generic main baddie. Don't get me wrong, I know they kinda want the games to be accessible in any order, but for me it was just kind of a shame to see characters who have been sorta fleshed out in other games back to their plain old selves. Though it was kinda just a thing for me with Risky upfront.Something I noticed was that some aspects can make the game feel too easy, flight abilities can have you skip entire sections of levels, you can rack up gems like nobody's business though who's ever complained about free coinage?? And with enough gems, armor and hearts, getting hit every once in a while is really no problem.But hey, I love Shantae, and overall, this is a dang fun Shantae game with lots of great powerups, funny writing, a sweet new artstyle once again and a great soundtrack. It's just that compared to Pirate's Curse, it felt a bit more compact. While I would rate that game my favorite in the series, trust me, Shantae Half-Genie Hero is definetely my second. A great effort to everyone at WayForward and another definite step in the right direction. Can't wait to see that future character DLC!			"

Product received for free
												(Note: Shantae Half-Genie Hero was a Kickstarter-funded game, and this reviewer backed it at the $12 level.)Shantae Half-Genie Hero is an exploratory platformer made by developer Wayforward Technologies, and it's absolutely fantastic. As the titular half-genie, Shantae, you run all around the world of Sequin Land, alternating between finding machine parts for your uncle and solving various crises that might pop up. Instead of an interconnected sidescrolling world map with towns and dungeons like previous games in the series, Half-Genie Hero opts to give you a handful of large stages, each divided into sub-areas and each filled with hidden permanent upgrades and/or new mobility options. On your first visits to these stages, you'll only be able to grab a few items. As you unlock new powers, however, you gain the ability to explore new parts of the levels and gain even more abilities and powerups to help you through the game.Shantae's main attack is whipping her hair, but you also have the ability to transform into different animals. These vary in usage, and they'll be often used to get to the aforementioned new areas. From a wall-climbing monkey to a sea-swimming mermaid to a high-flying harpy, the powers are welcome and interesting to use... although some are situational. You can also purchase magic spells for more offensive/defensive capability, and these are helpful items to grab as well. The game looks and sounds amazing, with HD art assets for all the characters and 3D rendered platforms to jump and climb over. Its soundtrack by Jake Kaufman is especially catchy, and you'll have the hooks of more than a few stage tracks in your head. Helpful, since you'll be revisiting them a lot.There are only one or two flaws with the game, and one is far less a transgression than the other. Some of the upgrades hardly change anything, and feel like filler. Attacks for forms you'll hardly use unless you're messing around, or powers used exactly once in a single area to gain another hidden item. In addition, things peak before the climax; the final two stages offer almost no hidden treasures to be found whatsoever. It's as if the game runs out of momentum before the end, and speaking of that we must discuss the penultimate boss. The fights before and after it are relatively engaging and straightforward, but in this middle fight you can only deal damage when the boss uses one of three attacks. The problem is that it spams the other two over and over again, turning what should be a three-minute fight into an agonizingly slow-paced slog where you're just waiting around, dodging the same two easily-dodged attacks over and over again and waiting for the game to decide to give you a chance to deal damage. It's unfortunate and really deflates the climax of an otherwise great game.At $16 USD you're looking at a five to six-hour experience, if you go for 100% item completion. That would be a bit short for the price, but there's an unlocked ""Hero Mode"" that lets you play the game over with most of your endgame transformations, and fly through it for kicks in half the time. Other playable modes are forthcoming, so I feel confident in saying the asking price is a worthy investment and giving this the thumbs-up. If you're a fan of the ""retro"" style of platformers, or love exploratory games like Demon's Crest or Odallus The Dark Call, this will absolutely be your jam.			"

												Worth it. Sure it took 3 years for this kickstarter game to come out, but I can say I got my money's worth for backing this game...and the game only just has the FIRST of FIVE playable characters so far with the rest coming up soon!Wayforward's best traits are simple yet enteraining gameplay & amazing animation, and both are on full display in Shantae: Half-Genie Hero. They really took what they learned from Ducktales Remastered and refined it into some of the best use of 2D Sprite and Vector animation in a videogame to date. All the characters are drawn by hand this way, no cop-out use 3D-Model characters like in Rayman Legends and many other similar 2.5D games. 3D is only used for the colorful levels and backgrounds, but even you can hardly tell half the time by how well painted and textured they are that the characters feel right at home in the game.The game itself is probably the easiest to get into of the Shantae series; keeping the mainstay of the series' gameplay, but reducing the amount of backtracking of its metroidvania roots for a wider audience, though a little bit does remain, especially  when trying to get the optional upgrades and 100% completion. I would say that Pirate's Curse is a bigger and more epic adventure entry in the series then this game. However throughout the development of this game I felt like Wayforward were trying to make a more accessable game for the Shantae series, as the first three games are all tied together in their overarching story, making playing only one of the games a bit confusing if you didn't know the plot of the previous ones. Half Genie Hero is its own self contained story so there is no need to play the other games, which can be troublesome for many people as the first game for the Gameboy Advance is a bit arcadic; Risky's Revenge though still enjoyable is a tad flawed with bits of its gameplay, and Pirate's Curse relies on the player knowing the story up until that point in the series.Currently as of the day before release, none of the DLC has been implemented yet, but once everything is set in it should be avaliable. The only DLC that may take a while is the other playable characters as Wayforward plans to release them one at a time as the three stretchgoal characters Bolo, Sky, and Rottytops aren't quite ready if I remember one of their previous development logs. But the backer level DLC and Risky Boots character story should be coming in soon hopefully.That said, there are a couple minor shortcomings I am a bit disappointed about. Nothing that impacts my enjoyment of the game, but just a couple nitpicks I have:1) Once you beat the boss of some levels, if you return to a place you have beaten before, the background is fill with a glooming fog, obscuring the wonderful and charming backgrounds of the levels. It's a shame that such nice looking levels become muddied up by the choice to put up a fog in some of these levels once they are beaten.2) This one bugs be more then the other: Shantae only has one dancing animation for all her transformations and magic dances. Reguardless of which transformation you choose, she currently only has the hip-shaking dance and the finishing pose for all 14 of her dances. In previous games she had various dancing moves for each one; most notable was the first game where each dance was unique to the transformation or magic; then in Risky's Revenge she only had three dances, but each one was different for the animal she transformed into though the final pose was the same one for all three. FInally is Pirate's Curse, which granted do to plot didn't have transformation dances, but using the lamp item did give two different animations, one of which was a all new belly dancing animation. It wasn't necessary for the gameplay or plot, but it was a nice little touch to her character. However here in this game there are 14 dances, but they all use the same one.It could easily be fixed by tweaking the animations a bit. Here's how the dancing works to get an idea. You press the ""Dance"" button to bring up the dancing menu. Soft music and a steady beat starts playing and Shantae dances to it in rhythm. The menu shows the first 4 dance slots for 2 beats then for the next 2 beats it switches to the second set of 4 dances, then 2 beats for the third set, then it cycles back to the first four, making 12 slots for dances total. Risky's Revenge had a similar concept with the dances where holding down the dance button would cycle through the three dances in that game and releasing it activated the transformation she was performing. The issue of Shantae having only one dance and one finishing pose could be fixed of each of the 2 beats she did a different dance move for each set of dances, then finally once the dance is selected she does a finishing pose that represents the transformation she turns into.However, regardless of the minor shortcomings that may get fixed, Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a success in my book. Sure this kickstarter isn't the groundbreaker or epic adventure Shovel Knight is; but it is FAR from the disaster Mighty No. 9 was. This game isn't meant to be grand, but rather a fun, charming adventure with likeable and often funnily-bizzard characters you know from Wayforward. So if you enjoyed Wayforward's previous games or want to start getting into their games; Half-Genie Hero is a full time winner, and will get even better as the stretchgoal content is released.			"

												Not going to write something long for this one. Simply put it's a well animations and entertaining game. While it has some drawbacks such as being a little short it's charm and fun attitude well make up for these. Certainly worth full price, if you're curious wait for a sale but certainly worth the money.			"

												Though certainly worthy of the Shantae name, one can't help but wonder what could have been when taking Half-Genie Hero's Kickstarter into account, as it is the first one that I've seen for a game where stages within the main story were part of the optional stretch goals, and not just bonus content. Had none of these stages been funded, this game may have wound up even shorter than Risky's Revenge. The stages themselves are a bit more straightforward and arcade-style without any locked doors and such. Not exactly a bad thing, though I can see how it might make the adventure seem TOO laid back for some.As it stands, HGH is as fun and charming as past Shantae titles, with future updates looking to build on the adventure with new characters and alternate playstyles/outfits for Shantae herself. But here's hoping the base length of Shantae's next game is set in stone that isn't cracked and purple			"

												I backed this game during the Kickstarter campaign both due to the fact that the Shantae series has had some excellent games, and WayForward have yet to disappoint with any game they've made. I received the code for it approximately a week ago and basically marathoned my through it.If you've played many platformers, or even more relevant, many metroidvania style platformers, you will find an enjoyable but somewhat short experience in Shantae: Half-Genie Hero. In about 10 hours in-game time I had completed everything the base game had to offer. This includes achieving 100% in the main story and in the New Game+ style mode known as Hero Mode. That being said, the experience was a thoroughly enjoyable one. There is DLC content on that way the will no doubt add several dozen more hours of play time to the game for me. I'm actually half-considering learning to speed run it, that's how much fun I've had with it.The sprite work in the game is phenomenal, animation that is both smooth as butter and full of personality. You can tell just from first the level alone that a lot of hard work and dedication went into producing this game. With all that said, I highly recommend the game to anyone who is a fan of the genre.			"

												Shantae:  Half-Genie Hero is a competent platformer, but it gets too many things wrong for me to recommend it.  There are 6 stages in all, including the final stage which holds no secrets and another stage that holds only a couple that you'll visit maybe three times.  As you play, you accumulate more abilities and forms for Shantae which enable you to visit previously inaccessible areas and acquire more items and powerups.  But because the final stage has no secrets and another one has only a couple, you'll spend most of the game visiting the same 4 stages repeatedly.  To pad the length of the game and make up for a lack of content, you are occasionally given strange, lengthy fetch quests to complete to advance the story.I'll be blunt:  Half Genie Hero doesn't feel like a complete game.  It isn't just the lack of stages.  A few of the transformations--like bat and spider--have no real part to play in the game.  You use them a couple of times to collect optional items and nothing else.  Half Genie Hero was funded on Kickstarter and I suspect the developer may have hoped to be funded for more stages that would make use of things like the bat and spider transformations.  And unlike a traditional metroidvania game, there is really no variety or sequence breaking to be had.  You either have the right upgrade or you don't.  And since the game is so small, there really isn't any sense of progression.The game starts out at an average difficulty, but once you start buying some of the items in the shop and upgrading your life the difficulty soon vanishes.  You'll have so much health and take so little damage from attacks that you can literally just walk through normal enemies.  You can even buy an invincibility spell which further reduces the challenge.  There are a couple of places where the difficult absolutely skyrockets.  One is an area where you must climb quickly to avoid instant death, and another consists of a long path of one-hit kill spikes that you must fly through with extremely awkward controls.  It's like the developers struggled to balance the difficulty and then decided they needed some areas with serious challenge.I really like the style of the game and its characters, but the game just doesn't live up to its potential and I can't recommend it.  If you want a platformer, grab Shovel Knight or Freedom Planet instead.  If you'd like to play a game specifically like Castlevania, I'd recommend Valdis Story.  If you like games like the classic Metroid (or just good games in general) check out Axiom Verge.  If you're set on playing Shantae because it looks interesting, I'd recommend checking out the previous game in the series instead.			"

YouTubeâ¢ Video: Shantae Half Genie Hero ReviewÂ 

			Views: 202		

			Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, stylized as Shantae: Â½ Genie Hero, is a platform video game developed by WayForward Technologies for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, and Xbox One.		

Through the Power of Kickstarter Shantae ReturnsIâm very glad i stumbled upon Shantae game series last year it was relatively unknown to me, but it looked very appealing and i decided to try out Pirateâs Curse and fell in love with the series and recently played Riskyâs Revenge before jumping into latest game the Half Genie Hero.The game feels like improved version on RR with more Transformations and bit more expanded item system that works the same way but offers more choices and upgrades. Half-Genie hero looks very beautiful the art style, effects and characters look very colorful and its really pinnacle of 2.5D art if you ask me. I had very steady frame-rate during my play-through and i felt controls with (Xbox 360 controller) worked really well and smoothly, sadly there wasnât option for windowed mode in PC though (Very few optimization options in general).I enjoyed the music â there was couple remixed songs from older games, but i felt that lot of the map songs were too uptempo, which left me bit mixed feeling (I expand this more on the video).However the game is not that long really, if you donât count Risky Mode and Hero Mode, which unlock later. I had around 12-13 hours with Pirateâs Curse, but with Half-Genie hero i had 93% item completion and it only took me less than 8 hours? Iâm not sure how i feel about that, i mean the game is priced at 20$ but then again ive played lot of Indie games with same price which were longer like Ori and the blind forest or Donât Starve. I Donât regret buying it, but i would recommend buying it from a sale or small discount at least especially if you are not going to do the game on Hero Mode or Risky Mode. "

												It's no secret I love the Shantae series, and I've been waiting for this game to come out since I seen the kickstarter page. Now its out and it time to see if it was worth the wait. Story: Shantae Half-Genie Hero take place after the events of Shantae Pirate's Curse but if you haven't played it don't worry. The game stand on it own. Shantae is the guardian genie of the town and spend her days solving problems and stopping pirates. After a strange dream followed by a pirate attack, Shantae set off again to save her town.The story is straight forward. Not as much character development as previous games, but it felt like a good game for new players to jump onto the franchise.Gameplay: Shantae can jump and hair whip her opponents into submission. As a Genie she can dance and transform into various creatures to gain access to new areas. You can buy upgrades for Shantae hair whip at the item shop and also buy magic spells. The magic spells have always seem to break the game. If you're a completionist  than you're going to upgrade all your magic and with magic that can make you invulnerable, well let just say some bosses become a cake walk. But they give you option in the menu to disable any upgrade if you feel the game is too easy.Final Comment: Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a good game for new players to start at, and veterans will be glad to see the return of loved characters. If you like platformers than Shantae: Half-Genie will grant one of your wishes.			"

												I was a backer of this ""Daniel David"" in the credits (should have been Daniel David Kelly but it seems they acknowledge that some names got messed up), but theres no bias here, the game is good. I'll go into some details on the game however because its not flawless, no game is.Shantae managed to make a game many times better than Mighty No. 9 on a fraction of the budget, beautiful artstyle with solid gameplay with a feel of a Saturday morning cartoon. This really was a kickstarter done right.Shantae is not without its problems however, the main thing to point out in these flaws however is they've been persistant throughout all Shantae, so if these are a problem for you its more a problem with Shantae in general instead of this specific game:1) Game is linear compared to the past..... I guess? The past Shantaes were no Symphonies of the Night as far as exploration goes either, I don't know why it suddenly becomes a huge thing for this game. And in all honesty while they don't have alot of screens, theres still alot of stuff hidden in them for you to find using your powers which kind of ties right into the next major complaint.2) Alot of backtracking and fetch quests as ""content"":  I got no counter for this, its absolutely true. Even if the fetching is comical and corny on what they make you find, a spade is a spade. They do make you backtrack alot as playing in Hero mode proves. Most every shantae I've played however used this formula so its more a knock against Shantae than this game specifically.3) The game is short: my first play through was 6 hours, and has only gotten shorter in replays and hero mode.... once again however this is something Shantae has almost always been known for (I mean hell Risky's revenge you can 100% clear in 2 hours X minutes) Platformers are rarely epic 60 hour games unless they are a castlevania where most of that time is grind.What should be made important here is the game is put together very well and solid, while its a short experience its one that is great from beginning to end and is colorful and fun. I also sort of liked the format of this one that really felt like playing an old Saturday morning cartoon, as in each ""level"" feels self contained like an episode out of a show that all contribute a small thing that the last level feels like the conclusion of a season arc, it added to the over experience and made it fun.If the game is a bit too pricey for you, just wait for a sale, but if you love platformers this ranks up as one of the best ones.

												Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is the fourth Shantae game in the series, and is a pretty good game overall.The minute I started playing this, I was instantly blown away by the amazing graphics and catchy soundtrack the game had to offer. Unlike previous Shantae games, almost all the songs in the sountrack are not remixed and are completely new (one of them being Burning Town). The characters are humorous and lovable, just as usual.In terms of gameplay, Half Genie Hero is a very fun and enjoyable experience. The platforming and quests aren't very difficult. The game itself isn't very difficult either; at most, something in a boss battle catches you off guard but when you try again it's simple. The game is very linear, and there are no dungeons or labyrinths unlike previous Shantae games. Despite these differences, the game is still extremely fun to play and I see it as WayForward trying a new, fresh approach to making a Shantae game. Half-Genie Hero still has its fair share of backtracking to collect secret items, though.The only complaint I have about this game is the amount of content. It feels a bit short. The game also has a weaker plot structure compared to the other games. My first playthrough of the game, collecting everything, took me approximately eight hours. There are always the achievements, though, and you'll probably have to play the game some more if you want them all. The game is good, though, so no trouble. Also, additional downloadable content for Half-Genie Hero is scheduled to come out soon. It looks really interesting and will add more things to do in the game.Overall, I would definitely recommend Half-Genie Hero to anyone who likes Shantae, platformers, or anyone who just wants to play a well-made game. The game has a bit of an arcade feel to it, kind of like Mega Man, and is very entertaining and simple to just pick up and play. While the game may seem short, extensions will be released in the near future. The game is definitely worth playing (especially multiple times) and I suggest picking it up and experiencing it yourself, too.edit: a few soundtracks were remixed			"

												Before I begin, I will let you know that I have played both Risky's Revenge and the Pirates Curse (both prequels). And Although I don't recommend this game, YOU SHOULD GO PLAY SHANTAE AND THE PIRATES CURSE! (which is a great game).First impressions about this game.The graphics are amazing (much more so than predecessors) and music is fantastic. And as usual, the gameplay is exceedingly smooth and controls respond very well. The dances are pretty cool and the story also leans more on the comical side compared to most games leaving a lighthearted feeling.Despite my glowing remarks above, I have 3 large issues with the game.Content: The length of time required to beat the game and get full completion is ridiculously short, ~5-7 hours for the average gamer.Story/Character Development: This is also related to the content. The story is pretty weak and honestly if you remove playing the actual levels, I could tell the entire story of the game to completion with like 2 sentences. Connected to this is character development. This game in no way makes anyone really care about any of the characters! Not even Shantae! If I hadn't played both the prequels, I would have no idea why Shantae was a half-genie and why she cared about the genie realm, or what her relation to Risky was! And then the supporting characters, rotty-tops/brothers + sky + bolo/grandpa: the game really does a disservice to how these people relate to shantae as from this game alone you could barely even tell that they were friends and not just some random townfolk A, B, C.Difficulty: This is yet another problem. Going through the levels are like a walk in the park (even so for non gamers) and the bosses while looking cool, are extremely dissapointing. All of the bosses patterns are extremely easy and they are honestly so weak that as long as you decide to use a potion (which you shouldn't really ever need), you can completely face-tank never dodge any of the bosses attacks and still smash them! Also the 4 skills which have always been a shantae staple are pretty much never needed. The fireball->flamethrower and lightning cloud are excessively weak and useless it pretty much every scenario. The pikeball/scimitar aren't really necessary but are usefull for clearing out monsters/bosses faster. And then the bubble is really good enough to make you invicible to some bosses (not counting the 3rd upgrade which is literally invincibility). And the magic power these things use is almost negligible for the time you need to activate it.Aside from ease in monsters and bosses, getting 100% completion and finding all the ""secrets"" is so simple that I don't even need to put any thought to find every single item! While it wasn't extremely hard in the Pirates curse at least I had to go revisit some areas just to search every nook and cranny for the special tinkerbells. In Half-genie hero, all the secrets are pretty much just lying in front of you waiting for you to get the right power to unlock it.Overall, the game is lovely but is waaaay too easy with a laughably simple and short plot that does not make you care for it in any way. I was really looking forward to this game but it really dissapointed me on many levels, even as a Shantae fan. Although I don't regret buying the game because I was a fan of the Shantae series (and this is probably the last game I'm guessing), I can't really recommend this unless this game is under $10. However, if you haven't picked up any Shantae games before I recommend you try out Shantae and the Pirates Curse. That game is way more polished than this one and doesn't really have any of these big issues that I listed for this entry here.			"

 Target Audience:   Non-Difficult Platforming Fans, or Those who want an enjoyable, relaxing romp  Summary:  The 4th game in the Shantae series (the GBC game counts damn it), Wayforward put a bunch of emphasis in revamping the presentation this time around: and the change definitely works. While I still enjoyed the more classical pixel style of the older series, this new art style brings colors that jump off the screen, while still keeping the animation quality at the series high standards. And while the sound design does leave a bit to be desired, the music is fantastic as you would expect when Jake Kaufman is involved (Shovel Knight, Shantae series fame). This game is just a pleasure to look at, and the character design is probably the best it has ever been in the series.The gameplay on the other hand has taken a step back. While the platforming is still enjoyable, its difficulty in combat has taken a step back from Pirate's Curse, as some of the returning transformations such as the monkey form make dodging enemies a breeze. The emphasis on movement over combat still shows off the smart level design Wayforward is known for. And the boss fights do bring it a bit more this time around, as they are better designed then in Pirate's Curse. But a lack of length in gameplay and just a overall lack of difficulty plagues the game a bit. Overall, the game still is an enjoyable romp that keeps with the Shantae style. If you've liked the previous games in the series, you'll love Half-Genie Hero. Just don't expect an evolution in the gameplay.Video Review:

			Shake, Shake, Shake that booty. Also, Mermaids and Monkeys. The Shantae Series has always been known for solid platforming action, but can the latest kickstarted game in the series keep it up?		

 Lists: Positives: The art work and presentation change is fantastic, as the new color and line work really bring Shantae and her dancing booty to life on the screen.  Good color choices as always: putting the foreground and the action elements with the stronger hues.  Music selection by Jake Kaufman is fantastic, appropriate for the levels in question.  Boss fights have definitely gone up a notch, as they felt like more of a test of my overall skills then previous games. Giga Mermaid fight was a prime example of a good difficulty: not too hard, but needing to take some skill in order to execute. Good humor as always from the writers of Wayforward. Some groan worthy puns as always, but it's the good kind of humor. Level Design great as always. Always good to go through the first time, but still fun to go through on the next few playthroughs.  Enemy variety is good. Good mix ups of melee versus range. Good difficulty for the casual player. Performance is flawless. 60 FPS with no drops. Character design elements are fantastic as always. Being able to recognize Shantae in her transformations is fantastic through the specific characteristics like her headband and her eyebrows.Negatives: The gameplay's combat has taken a step backwards. A bit easier to deal with enemies, and the enemies just don't pose the challenge they did in Pirate's Curse. Was Hoping for more after beating the game. I know that more content with new characters is coming later, but I found myself disappointed. Sound Design does leave a little bit to be desired, as some sounds seems to be missing, while others don't make a lot of sense in the big picture. Squeaky sounds on grabbing metal rings for example.  Shorter then the last games, and to me it showed a bit. Just didn't have the same impact over the full game's length. The Genie sub-plot here doesn't work as well as other games plot lines. The thread connecting the various substories is missing, unlike in Pirate's Curse. Keyboard default configuration must have been done with someone with giant hands. Missing sound sliders. "

												I'm still early in the game but so far music is great and animations/ overall artwork is great.Cons: So far Scuttle Town (main hub area) lags a lot whenever i enter it and the game takes a long time to even start up. controls are a little weird. Seems to be meant for a controller. Will definitively see this game through as i have high hopes for the franchise Still love what i got so far and for sure is a shantae game with its little jokes here and there			"

												I never realized how much fun this game was to play than to watch, and although it's not on par with Pirate Curse's OST, it has some funky music to listen to. The characters are funny, it's challenging but fair (sometimes.) The graphics get inconsistent sometimes, kinda like seeing George Lucas CGI remasters. It also has the flaw of being very confusing as to where you're supposed to go at times. Pirate's Curse fixed this problem in their previous games by adding a map, but for some unknown reason, this game removes it. A quick google will help and you'll get back into the fun. But these are little flaws. I think there's some boobies somewhere in there and that's pretty nice.9/10			"

												While it falls short of previous Shantae-games, it's still quite the fun game and there's currently more to come (I believe there's a Risky Boots addition coming along). The art style alone makes the game worth the money. Game play is responsive and fluid, no major hiccups and as is usual you're able to chose your upgrades freely (magic or pure damage). The game is quite short though, beware.It's way easier to navigate than earlier games and there's more places to save your game - so if you haven't played any Shantae-games earlier this could be a good place to start. Though you will probably miss out on some of the jokes that's been carried since the very beginning.The only real negatives about this game is the lack of dungeons. Those were fun in previous titles. But since this whole game is built on instanced content and each level is a form of a dungeon which you'll need to do several times in order to unlock more and more of it - it's my favourite metroidvania-style-type of game series.Casual playthrough: 7h~ est.100% playthrough: 8h~est.100% steam achievements: 11h~ est.

												This is a solid game, with plenty of charm and great gameplay.  I love hearing the intro song for the first stage, and there's so many little tidbits to make this game extra nice.  I'd say it has that ""Nintendo Polish""... like you know when something's added into a game that's not nessessary but adds positive spice to the presentation and emmersion of the world?  That's the ""Nintendo Polish.""  The dance transformations are back and they're great, with little time used to transform to different animals and objects for all your platforming/spell needs.  And I think the best part is the fact when you get an item like the Max Attract (third tier item) you can switch them off and go into every stage with as little equipment as you'd want, giving you a little challenge should you wish it.  It's wonderful to have that as an option, especially if folks want to challenge one another to beat the game with certain aspects. (hint hint Mr. Dragonrider Completionist ;D )As for completing the game, achievements and all, it's very doable.  So long as you've got a good memory for all item locations and a good place to farm the cash, and with the bonus Hero Mode when you beat the game once, you'll have a fun time.  And I'm looking forward to when the DLC for a new story mode is available.  n_nShantae: Half-Genie Hero is Highly Recommended for all players.			"

I found myself, multiple times, sitting back and saying outloud to an empty room, ""Man, I love this game"".Also, while not a requirement, I'd suggest playing the previous game as well; ""Pirate's Curse"" was fantasic as well. I hope to see a return of some of the pirate items in the future.			"

												Here it is, mentlegen! The third Shantae game has finally arrived (MY third Shantae game anyway)!Boy, this one was worth the wait. Both the animations and the gameplay are silky smooth, the music and the jokes are as good as ever and while I feel that the overall gameplay difficulty may have been dumbed down a little, there are also some new ways built into the game which enables all players to customize the stuff (power-ups/abilities) that they want and don't want to use, so they can manually make their game experiences harder for themselves if they find it too easy.It's so easy that I actually managed to get a 100% right during my first playthrough with some microscopical help.Easy as it may be, it's just as much fun to play. Backtracking no longer feels like the chore now that the dungeons are removed altogether and thanks to the buttload of new transformations and the majorly increased visual quality added to the once again catchy tunes and wacky gameplay it's ensured that you won't get annoyed about the fact that you have to visit the very same place for the 6th time.If the difficulty or the P.O.O.P.load of dungeons were the only things holding you back from getting a sip of the Shantae universe, then now is the perfect time to join our forces of relentless belly dancers.Together we shall dance through the danger! (and we'll never fail!)A must have for Shantae fans and highly recommended for fans of Raymanish games.P.S.: WayForward, you have my moniez for any future DLC content.			"

Great game altough a little way too easyShantae: Half-Genie Hero is that OTHER kickstarted game that was during the days of Migthy no.9 and oh boy, this one delivered unlike that other one. Altough quite short and simplistic on some aspects, Shantae delivers in what it promised. Shantae has:Lovely visuals and character-designInteresting level design that encourages exploration and revisitsLikeable characters and a easy-going plotPower-upsAwesome musicHowever, the game falls kind of short on some areas. For starters, it is incredibly easy... so much in all my playtime I didnt even died once nor had a hard time figuring where to go or do next.  Thats not inherently a bad thing but way sooner than later your character gets so strong it becomes laughable how you breeze through the stages. Magic spells are incredibly strong and in general, power-up items are really easy to get, you can pretty much start breezing through the game after the first hour of playing. Bosses are incredibly easy (with the exception of one or two, but not by much tho) and stages are pretty to see, but easy to traverse once you start getting one or two items and power-ups.Outside of the game being way-too-easy for its own good in general what it offers is great. The levels are pretty and intersting, the music is insanely good and, even if it easy, it will provide you with a handful of hours of great fun.Again, its only sin(?) is just that its way too easy for its own good but that might be a plus to some, not so much for the more hardcore of players tho.

												Put simply, one of the best platforms of the year. Great visuals, charming soundtrack and a solid, back-to-basics, gameplay that also encourages ""Metroidvania-type"" exploration. Unfortunately, its short length is a major let-down, but hopefully in the future more content will be included to extend the fun.			"

												Full disclosure: I backed the game way back in 2013 and may be a little biased.I was really worried that Shantae: HGH is going to be another Mighty No. 9. I reminded myself that WayForward is a company with a good service list, but to err is human, right? Well, It has been out for 3 days now and I'm glad to say that it's not Mighty No. 9. In fact, HGH kinda blows the Kickstarter failure out of the water. HGH is a neat experience of a great colorful and vivid artstyle, amazing music and comfortable gameplay. The gameplay is your typical metroidvania: scattered over the levels are areas that are reachable only by performing a certain dance that transforms Shantae into a spider, a crab, a mermaid and et cetera. You could seperate the transformations into two groups: group 1 is made for platforming and group 2 is made strictly for puzzles (at least I have never personally found a platforming use for the mouse transformation). You're going to spend most of the game travelling back-and-forth, collecting hidden items with newfound transformations.This is when you get to the cons of the game. The transformations are, long term, pointless gimmicks. The mouse transformation is used around 5 times all over the game, while some of the other ones (mermaid, for example) come in too late to be a viable alternative to the one you got earlier (crab transformation). There's also no point to use them to combat enemies. In the end, you're going to use transformations to discover the occasional blocked off area, transform back to original Shantae because she's stronger, faster and more versatile, and then go on. By the way, as I've said, that's all you're gonna do for the majority of the game. I didn't really find that too bad because I'd be doing it anyway, but the fact that you're basically forced to repeatedly go through the levels to find hidden stuff makes it easier to 100% the game. And if you 100% the game too early, you get an eight hours long playtime. Now, I think that's quite normal for an indie platformer (for example, Shovel Knight takes about 8 hours to beat it too), but some people may disagree - that's quite alright, though WayForward has new characters for the game in the works. Maybe that will make the game longer?Basically, as a summary: Shantae: HGH was a very good experience, however it's only two real flaws are the most important ones: the transformation gimmick that dies off as the game progresses and the length.

												I really, really wanted to like this game. And I do like a lot of it! But its issues are just... A bit too large to overlook.The art in this game is incredibly good, as is the soundtrack for it. Where Half-Genie Hero falls short is the level design. It's honestly pretty bad. The whole game suffers for it. The levels are entirely bland and boring, and sometimes enemy placement makes enemies near-impossible to avoid. The boss fights (at least the first two) were just as boring as the levels that proceeded them. It's especially disappointing because everything looks so nice and you can tell people worked rather hard on it. As much as I like nearly everything in this game, one issue keeps it from being a game I'd recommend. Bad level design.			"

Worm boss anyone?-Story basically doesn't exist-Something about the design here feels really bizzareIts fun, its cute but its not very deep and alot of the game just feels... off. The central story is essentially nonexistant, and you just get thrown into one level after the next, all of which are self contained and have no bearing on eachother besides the pickups you get. Characters are introduced directly before theyre relevant and then forgotten about when their level is over, and at one point the game even forgot that shante had been acompanied by 3 of her friends until the level was over and the boss was defeated. Its a good game, just not as good as i feel like it could have been with a bit more cohesion.			"

10/102017 is off to a great start (even though it released in very late 2016 shhh) with the release of Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, and let me tell you, it was worth the wait.  I was so excited for this game, I had to buy the steam version even though I already backed the game, because I just couldn't wait for my copy to arrive. Being in development for for nearly four years after a sucessful Kickstarter isn't always good, and I think we were all worried about a repeat of a certain blue helmeted robot boy's mistakes. Happily though, Wayforward has delivered in spades. Even though it's only January, I can already tell this is going to be one of my favorites, if not definitive favorite.Let's go over a few of Shantae's merits, if I may:The controls are as tight as you could ever want. Never once did I feel as if I messed up ro died because things were out of my control. The music is astounding. Wayforward always does good soundtracks, but they've gone above and beyond for this. It even has it's own single ""Dance Through the Danger"". The first time a Shantae game has had a voiced song, and it's absolutely wonderful. I've been listening to it all week.The art design is beautiful.  The colors and lighting will make sweet, tender love to your eyeballs.Demerits? I can't really think of any. There are some things I'd have liked that aren't there, but nothing that takes away from the experience. The first two games, the original and Risky's Revenge, had sprawling overworlds between dungeons, and while I really liked those and kind of miss them, I can see why they were removed from this game. The dungeons here are the focus, and I think they're stronger for getting the full spotlight.The game is very short. Spent about 8 hours on my first playthrough, but I enjoyed those 8 hours so much, I immediately tried to speedrun the game on 'Hero Mode' right after finishing, so replay value is high.I thought the dificulty was absolutely perfect. Challenging at the right times, and with simple portions as breathers. Some people may find it a little easy, though. "

												PROS:- Amazing artwork, and the animations as always are fluid.- The dialogue and character interactions are pretty funny.- Jake Kaufman provides another great soundtrack.- Good platforming challenges- Controls are snappy and responsive, the best in the series so far.CONS:- The overall length is a bit short. I finished my first run in around 6 hours.- I missed the dungeons that were in previous Shantae games. The levels in 1/2 Genie Hero are more similar to Megaman stages.- Some of the transformations are just a pain to deal with. Looking at you, mouse.- The checkpoints are few and far between, which is made more frustrating with the inclusion of bottomless pits and instant-kill traps.It's a good game, you should consider getting it. There will also be more characters added that will drastically change (or so we're told) how you play the game. Fans of platformers will surely not be disappointed.			"

												Just finished it.It's great fun.My only gripe would be it's too easy once you start unlocking more health and some of the magic spells - the game is quite bad at scaling the difficulty, but it's still really enjoyable nonetheless.I didn't had any technical problems (970M, 1920*1080, Win 10) so I can't really say much about them, but be wary they exist at the time this review is written, so check the forums.Anyway. If you're looking for a casual platformer, you can't go wrong with this. Buy it.On game lenght : 100% item completion, took me about 8 hours, without guides, and two items had me searching for a while. So it's a bit on the short side.That said there's still stuff to do even after that, with a new game + mode (transformations unlocked) and some achievement hunting if you're so inclined (including a 100% speedrun), plus some DLC modes are waiting to be released to replay the game as different characters.

tl;drA fun, if simplistic, platformer with lots of metroidvania-esque backtracking.  8/10Ps & Cs+ Beautiful artwork+ Not everything is voiced (you'd hate it if it were)+ Lots of secrets to find+ A hard mode (which I recommend over the regular game)- VERY easy (on normal)- Levels don't connectNitty GrittyThis was a competent platformer.  If you choose to play, I'd recommend playing on Hard Mode, as normal is a joke (I think I died via damage like 3 times).  The plot isn't anything to write home about, but it's told tongue-and-cheek and it's cute enough.  You'll do lots of backtracking as there are tons of secrets that require advanced abilities to get through.  I got a solid 8 hours out of it, and I managed to collect about 90% or so of all of the games secrets.  Worth $20, for sure.  8/10			"

The usual.The most notable aspect of the game is that Shantae, the protagonist, transforms into different animals, each with their own abilities that'll be necessary at specific moments to reach all sorts of secrets or progress-related key items. There are also a lot of upgrades to these transformations that increase their capabilities to deal with both enemies and the terrain.Every level has a very distinct theme and gameplay focus. Each of them feels original and engaging.The only possible problem with this title is how much backtracking it puts the player through. I personally didn't have a problem with it, but I'd wager some people did. It's probably done to extend the durability of the game, since it's quite short. The silliness involved in the many NPC interactions that occur during these backtrack experiences made them totally worth it to me.Overall, it gets a hearty recommendation. It's fun, it's charming, it's funny, excessive backtracking being the one thing to be aware before you get this title.			"

												Disclosure:I backed this game during it's crowdfunding campaign. Upon launching the game offers a 64bit DX11 version, this is the one I played.Shantae returns to once again do battle with her arch nemisis Risky boots and save Scuttle Town from certain doom. Graphics:This time out the pixel styled graphics from the previous games make way for new hand drawn sprites and 3D rendered environments (think Duck Takes Remastered). The game looks beautiful with high quality assests used throughout also teamed with the high quality animations the series has had in the past. The game also runs at a locked 60fps. However the graphics options are lacking, offering only resolution changes and AA options of off, on or dynamic.Controls:Controls are nice and responsive, press a button and the action is immidiate I was unable to detect any input lag or delay during my playthrough. The game supports both keyboard and mouse and controller configurations. However the game is best played on a controller and also gives out Xbox One button prompts. The default keyboard controls are a little odd with movement on the arrow keys, but are fully rebindable in the optins menu. The options menu is fully mouse driver as is the inventory screen, but the level select and save promps are not which is a little odd.Gameplay:The game plays out in the same way as the other Shantae games. Scuttle Town acts as the main hub world for the game offering a shop, access to the games art gallery (with unlockable concept and fan art), a save point and a selection of npc's to talk to who offer game hints or side quests to undertake. Heading into Sky's Hatchery allows Shantae to access the world map where the games levels are represented as desitnations that are unlocked using maps Shantae uncovers along her journey.The levels themselves consist of two platforming areas followed by a boss battle, however subsiquent visits to a level once completed does not have the boss battle and there is no way I have found yet to replaying bosses without starting a new game. The game does offer three save slots so new games can be played without fear of data loss.As with previous games in the series, Shantae unlocks transformations and abilities which allow her to further explore each of the levels and uncover more secrets each time through. It is the upgrades that are bring up the first negative of the game which is difficulty. The game is more on the easier side than previous installments if you go for all of the upgrades, especially health. Max health gives Shantae 14 hits before she is defeated and the game is quite generous regarding healing items as well. But these health items are optional and the game can be played through to the end with the starting 2 hit points if desired.Sound/Music:The sound in this game is great. Nice high quality sound effects are used throughout and some dialogue is even voice acted at times, although this is limited to Shantae and Risky Boots. Shantae even has voice lines for her magic spells.The music is also fantastic in this game, with personal notable tracks for me being the music for Mermaid Falls, the boss theme and of course the rocking main theme of the game Dance Through the Danger.Overall:I would thoroughly recommend this game as a purchase for those who are into platforming games or those who want a fun (all be it quite short, but replayable) experience. My first playthrough took me 7 1/2 hours to complete, with a 98% completion rating. There are unlockables such as gallery art and a Hero mode which opens up after completing the story once. Not sure what Hero mode is at the time of writing.			"

												This Shantaeâs first HD adventure along with her returning genie powers, and it is excellent.Story/Graphics/Music:Like the previous entries, this is a very light-hearted story, not as great as Pirateâs Curse, but still fun. The cute style and great humor is all there, but in HD. You can probably tell from the screenshots, but this game looks beautiful and set a very high standard for future Shantae games to come. I also donât know how Jake Kaufman did it, but the soundtrack is even catchier than the last. Iâd also like to note that I really like how many older animations were carried over such as the butt wiggle as well as both Shantae and Rottytops idle animation, because it wouldnât feel right without them.Gameplay:Weâre back to regular movement with genie transformations. I thought Iâd miss the Pirate items, but transforming is quick and each one serves a good purpose. Levels are pretty big and while there is a decent amount of backtracking, it really feels like youâre exploring the map a lot more than previous titles. So while it is technically backtracking, it doesnât feel like youâre going back to levels just for the sake of padding. Most of the time youâre looking for more items, if not youâre at least compelled to because finding secrets in this game is fun. Some of the secrets donât blatantly stick out either so youâll have to use a bit of brain power to find everything, which I perfectly welcome. Much of the annoyances some people had are also gone, such as being able to leave a level at any time and skipping any parts that youâve already clear for free (once you receive the ability to). This means more playing and less traveling.The combat is quick and satisfying like an old school Castlevania game. You get access to spells and upgrades that generally help you do more damage and take less damage. One of the great things about every one of these upgrades is that they can be toggled off. This is great because after fully completing the game I started a playthrough with minimal upgrades on for a good challenge. Bosses are generally fun, with a few that are the âwait for your turnâ variety.Some grips:I really only have two issues with the game, the first one being the missing dungeons. If youâve played the previous Shantae games, you would consider these dungeons a staple in the series. You could say theyâve made up for it with bigger, more explorable levels, but they will be missed.My second gripe is the difficulty, way too easy this time around. I actually died being careless once or twice on the second level, but once you clear this and you get access to some money, you can reduce your damage by half. On top of that, you start to gain access to a lot more health upgrades so youâll have tons health. Another issue is that most enemies will not knock you back when getting hit like you would a lot of the time in Pirateâs Curse. Because of this, I normally just ran through levels taking damage for the sake of speed. Most bosses can also be brute forced before you need to use items, however I will admit I had to use healing items for the last boss. If you really wanted to, you could also fully nullify damage by end game which is a very questionable decision. I mentioned earlier I'm on a limited upgrade playthrough thanks to being able to toggle off upgrades. Again, I'm glad this is something you can do.Final thoughts:This marks the beginning of some great Shantae games. They have the engine and everything they need to make a great game now. I see this game as a little reboot to the series so Iâm hoping for many more to come. Some people might call this game too short. My first 100% playthrough was about 5 Â½ hours, about 1 hour shorter than my first Pirateâs Curse run. I would say the amount of content is just a little under the last game because you save so much time with the new features Iâve mentioned before, such as skipping beaten sections. Another thing that saves time is that the town NPCs actually give you hints on where to go so you more or less always know what you have to do. Regardless of the short time, I loved every minute of it and Iâm still re-playing the game even with all the achievements. I canât wait for Riskyâs campaign and any more content to come. If youâre into these types of games, thereâs absolutely no reason you shouldnât own Pirateâs Curse and Half Genie Hero.			"

												I'm somewhat disappointed in this installment, but it was still a solid experience overall.If you're a newcomer: Shantae is a 2D platforming metroidvania series, and this is the 4th installment. It's got very well executed gameplay and controls. Shantae can transform into various animals to get around the area. There's a bunch of world to explore with their own themes and hidden secrets. It's very linear and easy compared to the previous installments, so I would recommend getting this one first to get a feel of the series, but overall I feel Shantae and the Pirate's Curse was a much better game.If you're a veteran: This game left a bittersweet feeling in my mouth. Half Genie Hero is still a well done game, but it feels so terribly bare bones compared to Pirate's Curse and Risky's Revenge. It's much shorter at about 5 hours long, way too easy especially with upgrades, no dungeons, very linear compared to the other games, plot that is very boring and goes nowhere, generic and few interesting setpieces, much smaller and linear stages that don't have any emphasis on exploring since most ""hidden"" objects just require a dance or upgrade you don't have yet. However, with all that said, it's no Shantae on GBC. What the game does, it does well. I just feel it lacks in a lot of areas, but it's by no means bad. Worth picking up on a sale if you loved Pirate's Curse.			"

												Note: I backed this game on Kickstarter.Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is very interesting platformer. Before playing Half-Genie Hero I have played Shantae: Risky's Revenge and Shantae and Pirate's Curse. Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is much easier than previous games. I think I died only once while playing the game. The problem is that you can easily get Shantae overpowered for each stage. You get plenty of extra health, you get different methods of healing and you can power-up Shantae really fast. Also for last stage and bosses in it, I was able to be literally invincible. In other games I was never so overpowered. Good thing is that it's possible to turn off upgrades, so even if you try getting 100% everything, you don't have to be overpowered.  I believe that by turning of some of the upgrades, game gets much more challenging.I'm also little sad, how little some transformations and their skills are used in the game. Some transformations I only needed once or twice and some of their skills I never needed. On the other hand other transformations and their skills you need little too much. Also I used some transformations to skip platforming sections.I really love the new visuals. Every character and stage were visually very beautiful.  I think this game has best soundtrack of the franchise so far. Jake Kaufman truly nailed it with the soundtrack.Game has pretty nice and very funny story. There are lots of jokes with the characters. There's even some fourth wall breaks. It's not very long game, but that is good for me. I finished the story in 100% in 11 hours. After that you unlock a new mode, which I haven't at the time of writing this review.Even though I citicised some aspects of the game, I still loved it. It might be little too easy, if you make it too easy, but it's still very fun. Bosses are clever, though little easy. It is fun game. I'm not sure, if I liked this game more than Pirate's Curse, but I would recommend playing this one first of the franchise.			"

												So I wrote a review on this game before but I'm doing another as there was an update along with hardcore mode. Pros of Orginal:Good musicGood graphics and animationsWhen there is voice acting it sounds goodLevels have many secretsGameplay wasn't too hard or easy (for the most part)Smooth controlsCons of Orginal:Story is very lacking and feels rushed at pointsRisky is pure evil despite what happened in the last game (Pirate's curse)Levels were short and linearDifficulty spikes because of different mechanics (such as the slide or using transformations for difficult sections)Overal fixes:Underwater mines now show explosion effect (No longer causing confusion)Hypno Baron's castle can no longer be flown over at the outside area (at least in hardcore mode, not sure about orginal)and some other small fixes I can't think of at the momentHardcore Pros:Enemies are actually a threat and take more damage while doing more damage (although some enemies do way too much in my opinion)Enemy attacks are faster and aim more for ShantaeDeserves the name ""Hardcore mode"" Hardcore Cons:Enemy placement can feel just jerkish and annoyingThe amount of enemies is way too highSome enemies doing way too much damage for normal enemiesBosses take too long at times or don't give you enough time to attack their weak points (Giga Mermaid is the worst in this case)The first phase of the last boss has an instant kill attack (which is cheap not hard)Risky takes even longer to defeat (doesn't help that if you die on the last boss you have to face her again)The difficulty spikes from the orginal feel even worse and I hated themIt made this game a bad experiance for me (I loved the orginal story a lot and made me a Shantae fan but this made me feel like crap and I didn't enjoy playing it)Overall I feel like people should play the orginal and should only play the hardcore if they're looking a for a big challenge, It's a shame that the hardcore mode changed my opnion of this game so much but it feels like it was made just to be hard, not to be fun or fair. I still like the game and I'm still looking forward to the other modes (like Risky mode or the other playable characters) but if they end up with that same difficulty I might take a pass. My scores of this game are Orginal : 78/100Hardcore: 60/100			"

												This is a great addition to the series.Gameplay, music, visuals, all top-notch. The game consists of bright colors and the cute, cheery half-genie hero Shantae as you play through several different environments, be it a mermaid factory surrounded by water or a hot desert with strong winds. The transformations are really interesting. Some are chibi looking animals while others are cute monster-girls with every one having their own unique abilities that can be built upon if you find the hidden upgrades throughout each level. Shantae herself can be upgraded from the item shop by buying new spells and hair products and accessories.The game is a reasonable length of about 6-7 hours for your frist run (hard for me to judge because I left the game on in the background so my own time is not arcuate), although there's speedrunning challanges that time you for under 2 hours. I'll like to add I completed my run with 100% item collection and I think you should look for all the art gallery keys, the mayor's reward is worth it. There seems to be more content in the works, probable DLC for us none kick-starter folk, but I think as it stands the game is worth the asking price.I do recommend a controller for this game though, the default keyboard settings, at the time of this review, don't make much sense and it just feels way more responsive with a controller in hand. Overall, a great game and I highly recommend you pick it up!			"

												Do not go into this game expecting a metroidvania - this is not what you will find. However, it's still a fun platformer with some exploration elements. The game is really well polished and loves to show off what it does best.Pros:- Excellent graphics/animations, and something I would love to see more of in 2D games- Amazing soundtrack- Solid controls- Interesting levels with some good variety- Hilarious writing, especially with Hypno Baron and Squid BaronCons:- Linear level design loses some of the good qualities the older games had.- Not difficult to get through at all. The game hands out too much money, or makes important upgrades to your hair too cheap.- Forced backtracking doesn't feel natural.- The story had no real payoff. It was quite generic and wasn't as memorable as The Pirate's Curse.			"

												So I've played the first game on the 3ds and risky's revenge on steam a bit... apparently I skipped Pirates curse but meh... Already got the storyline spoiled... This however is what shantae represents... From the art that makes it look like a cartoon series to the gameplay that defines the genie made me love this game alot. And did I ever mentioned the soundtrack? although they did made it a bit linear by putting stages , you can still backtrack for things you couldn't get before. Now I get that not many people would like the game as a linear set , however there is a reason to this. And that is while there is a main story to this game , there are also sub stories that makes it an episodic series. Many foes that shantae faced in the past and new faces (well one from my perspective) has appeared in sequin land. Despite all that , if you think this game is short , don't worry. There are some dlc coming around in the future that makes it even longer than before. new characters , new stages and new stories... Shantae is the game that I'll be looking ""Forward"" too...*Whipped by hair*                         Worth it...         Buy it...             Play it...			"

												I've been greatly enjoying some of the most recent WayForward games lately and this one is definately on the peak of enjoyment. Ever since they made A Boy and His Blob for the Wii, they have had this asthetic of hand drawn animations and amazing backdrops. I feel that Ducktales Remastered helped them solidify their style. And they brought it to Shantae, their own IP. And this game shines for so many reasons. Their art style brings every little detail to life. The music is really catchy, especially the one with lyrics you encounter early on. The gameplay gives this sense of exploration that fits the Metroidvania style of coming back to places once you have new powers. It is fun to play.Now, there are a couple gripes I've got. The game length is pretty short. Getting near 100% took me just about 6 hours to do. If the game had maybe a level or two more, I'd feel more satisified. There is also a huge issue in Mermaid Falls in the factory setting. At one point, you are jumping from hook to hook, but they are not in sync to always line up. I've spent a great deal of time just trying to get up the first time I played. It was frustrating.But beyond the slight flaws, I have to say I love this game. This is one I'd suggest you pick up and normal price if you love exploring based side-scrolling games. If you're on the fence, maybe wait for a sale, but I don't regret getting this game.			"

												Cute characters and light-hearted humor elevate this tiny indie gem of a game.True to the series roots, Shantae combines a liberal amount of classic Megaman-esque run and jump platforming with a bit of exploration and backtracking ala Castlevania/Metroid. As you beat bosses and explore the mostly linear levels, you will earn upgrades to open up new pathways through levels and discover secrets in previously completed areas. While relatively small in scale, it matches the length of the previous installments in the franchise (about 6 hours for my first time to 100%) and certainly lives up to the legacy of its lavishly illustrated predecessors, trading in it's former pixel art for hand animated characters and brightly painted textures. Level design is clean and concise, making up for a lack of quantity with a density of quality content for the price. This game maintains the series focus on light-hearted humor and cute characters, with a strong soundtrack to tie the experience together.Some upgrades curiously seem superficial and under utilized in the level design (i.e. the Bat Sonar ability is only use-able in one side room and the room can still be navigated using visual cues from other light sources), but most content in the game is well utilized throughout the game.The storyline feels much more segmented than previous titles, probably due to the fact that each level was a different ""stretch goal"" when the game was being kickstarted. This makes the plotline and characters feel much more episodic and less developed than previous entries (especially comparing it to Pirate's Curse), but overall tone maintains a sort of ""Saturday morning cartoon"" feel that remains consistent across the entire game.While the current release only includes Shantae as a playable character, future updates have promised an expanded roster of playable characters, but they are not in the game as of this review. Wayforward generally doesn't do many post-release updates (they have a good track record of releasing games that very feature complete), but this is also their first crowdfunded game so time will tell just how well these promised expansions end up being.

												While this game is visually superior to previous games in the series, in other areas it appears to have taken one or two steps backwards.Gameplay is as good as it's ever been, though perhaps a bit stale given how little has changed. Same spells, same upgrades. Even the transformations are largely recycled from previous games. In fact there are probably too many transformations. It sometimes felt contrived how the level layout required certain transformations to progress.This game can't seem to decide whether it's aiming to bring in new fans, or pander to old fans. The game is more simple and linear compared to previous games, but spends next to no time on character introductions, expecting you to already know who everyone is. And while the old transformations do look great in HD, they lack personality. In particular, I really miss the monkey's idle animation from Risky's Revenge.The pacing is also kind of messy. As with previous games, to progress you need to find the relevant collectibles in levels you've already cleared. This creates a sort of slow, leisurely ""scavenger hunt"" type of game, during which you jump around and fight enemies set to an exciting soundtrack. This structure was also in previous games, and is not a problem.What I'm talking about is the ""in-between"" segments, when you talk to NPCs to get hints and hand in quest items. There's very little dialogue before you're onto your next task. So you might spend half an hour finding the item you need, and then you get less than a minute of plot before you're onto the next level. The game felt really short, too.While we're at it, boss battles. This game's bosses are pitiful. I'm not talking about difficulty, I'm talking about buildup. Risky's Revenge had actual dungeons in which the bosses resided, and you would know their name before meeting them.Pirate's Curse was longer, so didn't do this for each boss. Those it did build up, though, were well done.Then we get to Half Genie Hero, and there's practically no build up for any of them, least of all the final boss, which is only introduced when the battle begins.The final bosses are the most irritating example of this. RR had the boss take something the player themselves had come to cherish, and turn it against them. PC had a deliberate repeat of this, but getting the right collectibles adds a twist to the ending which turns everything upside down. HGH has the boss show up and fight you. And... that's pretty much it. If more effort had gone into developing the plot or characters, the stakes might have felt higher, but as it was, it was just a moderately more difficult boss battle.If you've read this far, you might be wondering when I get to the reason this is in the positive reviews section. And that reason is that despite all its flaws, this is a good game that I enjoyed playing, and I think it is well worth the $20 USD pricetag.The other games are better though.			"

												The first game that I've ever backed on kickstarter, and done so on a whim, so I wasn't expecting much out of it......it's actually pretty good.It has great animations, the gameplay is quite the decent metroidvania, and quite good set-pieces. It also runs pretty good, even on this toaster of a laptop I had to play on.It is, as of this writing, quite short, though. Only 5 chapters fill this game right now, with a bit too much backtracking. A normal run should take you between 7~10 hours.Compared to MN9, whose KS was running at the same time, this one turned out to be the better bet. It's a good product, with more to be added later, but as of right now,very short.			"

												Ok this game is worth 20 buck (on sale is even better :) ) It is a solid platformer with secrets to find by getting more powers and reaching places you couldn't before. The music is A-MAZING most of the game i was humming and bobbing my head to it. Art direction is nice to look at with vivid colors the way the characters look very cute in my opinion. The game isn't long but it's not short either perfect length for this type of game. Looking forward to further DLC with risky and the gang to play. Would buy again 10/10			"

												Another great game helped through the magic of crowd funding! This is honestly a really fun game. I love the art style and music. Gameplay was fun, but its not as good as the last game. Trust me, if you really want a good time pick up Shantae and the Pirate's Curse. If this game is good, then that one is FANTASTIC!			"

												I rate this game an 8/10.It's got good graphics, good characters, and some good music. The controls are tight and responsive and there's a lot to find. However, the final boss was a little repetitive and the writing was a little lazy at some points. All in all, It's a pretty good platforming game. Buy it, if you want.			"

												Great action platformer. The visuals are fun and colorful, the humor is fantastic, and the characters are very memorable. The only downsides to this game are a weak story and not a whole lot of replay value, but it's definetly a great pick for people who are a fan of the genre and of the visual style. I'd give this game an 8/10. Good for a weekend of fun, short and sweet with more content coming in the future. In short, quick, fun, action platformer, with great art, characters and controls. Weak story, but the other elements make up for that.			"

												Although I was a little worried by many little things during my first hour or so, like how the storyline almost seemed more on base as a television show rather than a full experience, or even the kickstarter track being the first song you hear in the game, with only a 2 minute loop and such, I was blown away by the end of my experiences. If you are a fan of the Shantae series, this is a must buy A.S.A.P. With little nods to every game in the seires, Shantae: Half Genie Hero is a tribute to the franchise, the fans, and even the indie develop scene. There's nowhere else to go but up, Bozon. Make us proud.			"

Posted: January 12
												I've got a lot to say about this game, but not all of it positive. TLDR; Good game, Wait for sale.---Pros: Character Design, Visuals, and Animations: Gone are the days of the retro low-res character sprites and pixelart tiled level design. Each character has high resolution character sprites that are fluidly animated, and the traversable environments are all rendered in cell-shaded 2.5D. Music: Anybody that has played a Shantae game will tell you that it has some of the best music of the platforming genre. A lot of the more memorable leitmotifs from the series, such as the Burning Town and the main theme, return in a number of ways. This include such tracks as Neo-Burning Town, which retains its middle-eastern flair while also taking on a club-music feel, and Dance Through the Danger, which I'm admittedly biased about because Cristina Valenzuela (the voice actress for Shantae's spoken lines) provided A++ vocals for the song. Never get tired of hearing that woman sing. Like all Shantae Games, you'll be hard pressed not to find a track from its soundtrack that hooks you. Puzzles: The game loves to make you look for the solution to finding that one collectable you can see but not get to. At the same time though, they are never too difficult; it's usually just a matter of backtracking, and if you keep up with chatting with the NPCs, you'll never be short on hints. Just keep on exploring. Just be aware that some transformations completely kill puzzles, and some puzzles you can technically complete before you get the ability or power-up required to do them. Boss Battles: One thing I've always liked about the boss battles in the Shantae games is that they are almost always unique, and in Half-Genie Hero, it was no exception. One battle has you relying on bits of the environment introduced in a mission, while another has you running yourself in literal circles as you try to figure out how to actually damage the boss. Transformations: Lots of them. I won't spoil all of them, but a number of the classics from both the gameboy color Shantae title, as well as the returning forms and abilities from Risky Revenge make their return in Half-Genie Hero, in addition to a number of new ones to play with.---Cons: Performance: For a modern game with such modest specs, Half-Genie Hero has its share. For one, the game has Vertical Sync permanently enabled and expects your monitor to have the exact refresh rate of 60Hz, meaning that if you're running on a 120Hz monitor, or you're playing on a TV at a non-60Hz refresh rate, such as one running at 1080i, you're going to have a bad time. It spazzes out on higher refresh rates, and on lower rates, sprites flicker, FPS caps at 30, and within the first minute of the game the camera goes epileptic before shooting off into the void. Even if you're running it at a 60Hz refresh rate on a progressive resolutionâsay 720pâand your system meets and exceeds the reccomended system specsthere's no guarantee you're going to get that smooth 60FPS the game expects to run at without a bit of fiddling. Case in point, I had to tell Radeon Settings to use the Frame Rate Target Control at 60 just to get that smooth 60 at 720p. Level Design: To put it bluntly, the levels are incredibly short. Most of the dungeons consist of medium or large 'rooms' that require you to navigate back and forth through on the x and y axes, taking into account the elements and obstacles of that particular level. You might be required to hop across a series of platforms that fall if you stand on them for too long, or scale a tall room hopping from moving ring to moving ring. For the most part, it's a far cry from the Shantae standard of dungeons being a series of small interconnected rooms. Heck, it's so simplified that you don't even get a map this time around. This brings me to... World: In the previous Instalment, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, you access to Scuttle Town as your 'hub', from which you had access to a boat which would take you to the world you would then need to navigate and explore, just to get to the dungeon. In Half-Genie Hero, the devs took the 'boat' and decided, ""How about we just drop you right in the 'dungeon' and cut out the middle man."" You just go to Skye's place, hop on her mode of transportation, and off you go to the dungeon select screen. Don't even get me started on Pirate's Curse vs. its predecessor. Of course, to account for the smaller world and bigger, they had to put in a lot of... Padding: With only a series of short dungeons, the devs definitely seemed hard pressed to make sure the game lasted. To account for this, they utilized a number of things to pad out the game. Backtracking was always a big thing in previous Shantae Games, but a lot of it could usually be mitigated by knowing where something was ahead of time. There wasn't TOO much that hinged on you having a specific transformation, or a particular ability for said transformations. I'm not talking about little mini-puzzles that force you to use specific transformations and problem solving, I'm talking about the things that draw things out such as the mouse form mazes, or one-off abilities such as sonar for the bat transformation, which is used for all of one puzzle that can technically be solved without it. You see that collectable on display right out in the open where you can't get it because you don't have a specific ability? You're going to be tormented by those a lot for three quarters of the game until you get that power you don't have. Then of course you have things like rings that disappear from the foreground or the infamous disappearing platforms. If you've played the classic Megaman games, you know exactly what I'm talking about. They're just a right pain to get the timing down on, which just creates... Artificial Difficulty: I just want to say that Half-Genie Hero is not a hard game. That said, it does have segments that will make you want to tear your hair out. For example, in the very final dungeon, you are required to use your Harpy transformation to navigate a series of spiked walls, some of which were moving. This might not have been so bad if the game actually gave you reason to use said transformation [which was only just acquired AFTER the second to last dungeon] and some practice, but you're basically thrown into the deep end of the pool with cement sneakers on, and you've been missing leg day lately. It is basically Flappy Bird in that section. You have an early segment where you're in a restricted movement auto-scroller, and you need to rely on reflexes and skill to not miss a jump or hit something that will inevitably damage you. This kind of segment returns after the final boss and is cranked up to 11, with shorter platforms, the rings where if you're not placed just right, you will miss and go back to the start, and wall of death that continues to take up more and more of the screen, making the segment a game of memory and reflex as you end up with less and less space to work with. It was, apparently, difficult enough that the devs removed your life bar for this segment. I can only imagine how bad it would have been otherwise. Stretch Goals: In case it wasn't readily apparent, Half Genie Hero is a kickstarter game, and budget can be blamed for some of the shortness. Two of the levels in this really short game were in fact stretch goals. Yep, the game would be shorter if those goals hadn't been met. Iterestingly enough, the very first stretch goal, a mode where you play as Risky Boots, is not present as of this review, and is slated as Coming Soon. So in a way, the launch exclusion of Risky Mode, coupled with the performance issues kinda gives the game an Early Access feel rather than a full launch. "

												*Note: I was a backer for this game*This latest installment is a bit of a departure from the rest of the series, but is fun nonetheless.  For those of you that are new to the series, this game is made up of 18 well-designed levels (3 levels per world, 6 worlds total).  There are 8 creatures you can transform into to aid in traversal, but some of them are redundant (do we really need 2 forms for flying, and 2 for swimming?  Surely these could have been merged).  Where the level design differs from past games is that they are more linear like you would find in a standard 2-D platformer.  This is a good or bad thing, depending on your preference.Cons - The game is pretty easy, with up to 10 heart containers to find in the world, buyable armor that you can get very early to cut damage recieved in half, and a bat form that can also be found pretty early that breaks most of the platforming sections after that point (if you really want to cheat).  Bosses can be fun when trying to work out how to damage them, but with lots of health, armor, and recovery items you rarely need to even bother with dodging their attacks.The story seems to be decently written, and funny at times, but is also unfocused.  Each level is treated like it's own episode, which sounds nice, but also means that things are introduced and quickly discarded.  For example a rival Half-Genie Holly appears after the first level, but disappears after some taunting.  After the next level, she appears in 2 more scenes before she's gone for good.The game is really short.  My first blind playthrough of this game took about 7 hours to get to 100% completion.  When hunting for trophies on the PS Vita version I finished the main campain in 1 hour 40 minutes (any %) and 3 hours 30 minutes (100%).  More content is on the way as DLC, and it'll be free for me, since I'm a backer, but others will have to pay for it.Pros - The game is beatiful, with great music.  It is made up of 2-D characters on 3-D background, but at times it hard to tell what's drawn or not.  The style blends very well.  Animations are smooth (though maybe the idle animations can be a bit over-blown sometimes).  I've enjoyed Jake ""virt"" Kauffman's music since the VGMix days, and this soundtrack is no exception.The levels are fun when you don't break them with Bat or Harpy form.  Playing with minimal power-ups feels like a closer approximation of the intended experience.  Level and monster designs are good when the skillset is brought more in line with normal 2-D platformers.Searching for secrets in this game was a lot of fun as well.  The developers put in some interesting puzzles, making re-visiting levels something you actually want to do.Rotty Tops.As for a straight ""Recommend"" or not I'm a bit torn.  I honestly had a lot of fun playing through the game, but at $19.99 USD for what is a 4 - 8 hour game it might not be worth it.  I will click ""Recommend"" for now, but I would advise that maybe you wait for either a sale or at least for some of the DLC to come out.			"

This is a must have for platformer fans, and this is a must have for anyone that wants to enjoy a fun one player game. I recently had a baby, and this game was perfect as I could set it down when I wanted. It also had ""warp"" mechanic built into the game so I could quicky pick up where I left off. Fantastic on nights when I did not know how much time I could dedicate to gaming, as I needed to assist the baby at a drop of a hat.			"

												Great level design, very tight controls, and wonderful music are the best ways to describe this game.  Every level feels fresh and unique, and the game very heavily (almost to a fault) promotes revisiting old areas with new abilities to discover secrets and items.  There are a few bugs here and there, but nothing that harmed the experience.  My only gripes with the game is that there aren't enough areas to explore (5 in total), and the lack of overall challenge in the game.  I said that the areas are fun to explore, but they are considerably less fun the umpteenth time an npc sends you out looking for an item.  Many items can be achieved prior to an npc asking for them however, and those looking for the shortest completion time will be challenged to find the quickest way to collect everything.  Enemies do very little damage and falling down pits does even less.  Additionally, the game hands you upgrades in the form of ""Relics"", which grant secondary abilities to your transformations, magic attacks that draw power from a mana bar, or passive abilities.  One such relic, obtained by gathering 10 keys hidden throughout the game that unlock concept art in the town hall, gives you an endless mana pool to draw on.  This is very easily abusable with the magic powers you acquire over the course of the game, including a shield that makes you invisible.  By collecting this one relic, you essentially activate god mode and can't be damaged at all.  You are able to turn the upgrades on and off at any time, which I found very welcome trying to give myself a bit more of a challenge, but even without them you'll very rarely see the game over screen.  The game also relies on manual saves where an autosave system would serve so much better.  For instance, going to the map screen mid-level calls a save screen, and upon selecting any other area on the map calls ANOTHER save screen.  The game is also rather short (I achieved 100% completion in about 7 hours according to the in-game timer), so I would mostly recommend this game to completionists or those looking to speed run.  Overall, this is a fantastic game marred by just a few disappointments.  As of the writing of this review, I have only finished the standard game mode with 100% completion with an early copy provided by backing the kickstarter campaign, so the bugs I mentioned earlier will probably be ironed out by the time the game fully launches.PROS:-Great sound design/OST-Fun and diverse levels-Incredibly tight controls-Great for speedrunningCONS:-A little too much backtracking-Lacking in overall number of areas-Some minor oversights (such as the save system)I give Shantae: Half Genie Hero a 9/10.

												I came into this game with low expectations. I really didn't like Risky's Revenge, and never played Pirate's Curse. I was prepared to walk into another boring backtracking marathon.And then The title screen came up and I changed my mind. You can tell a game is going to be great when the freaking title screen makes you excited. I made a new file and holyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥everything just blew me away. The animations are so fluent, the graphics are amazing, it controls really well, and that was just from the intro section.I soon got into the game, surprised to see it's really more of a metroidvania hybrid of sorts. There are metroidvania elements, but for the most part it plays like a regular platformer. It's like your first time through the stage is normal, and once you clear it you can revisit it to get the stuff you couldn't before. Unlike in RR, the areas are all REALLY interesting. (Mermaid Falls is easily my favorite level in any platformer, actually!) And the backtracking doesn't get old. It'd be nice if there was a minimap of some sort, so you could easily check unexplored areas on the fly. But it's not that hard to figure out without it. I managed to 100% this game in 7 hours, and I enjoyed every minute of it.A bit of a fair warning, though. This game suffers from ""Help the enemy is too cute and I don't want to kill it"" syndrome. Especially prevalent with Nagas, Mermaids, and Slimes. You may take lots of damage from ogling the things out for your head instead of fighting.I don't usually mention music in my reviews, because there's not much to say about it usually, but this has a really great soundtrack. It's a real earworm that pumps you up. And what else could you ask for with a platformer?The game isn't too challenging, as long as you keep yourself upgraded. If you get 99% before the last level, you are basically immortal, as you can infinitely use Invincibility or Total Restoration. And you'll NEED IT. Because WOW that last level is so freaking rough. It's incredibly challenging, much more than the rest of the game. But all that aside, the game is amazing in every other regard. I would easily say it's My favorite platformer, ever.9.5/10. Go buy this game. "

												PROS:- Wonderful character designs- Beautiful backgrounds- Great soundtrack- Smooth gameplay and controls- Well-designed levels and bossesCONS:- A few minor storyline plotholes- Game is quite short (10-12 hours for first 100% run)- Not all promised Kickstarter features have been implemented (yet)The art and music immediately stand out in terms of quality, making for a very enjoyable gaming experience. The controls, level design and gameplay are all highly polished, ensuring that it isn't too punishing for platformer newbies while there are enough secrets and challenges for more serious players to complete. However, like its previous installments, the game suffers from its short length and limited replay value.Overall, I rate ""Shantae: Half-Genie Hero"" as one of the best platformers released in 2016. The game is definitely worth full price on its own, but do note that several DLC are already in development to add additional costumes for Shantae and new campaigns where you can play as Risky, Rottytops, Sky and Bolo. I'd recommend keeping an eye out for new game updates this 2017.			"

												WayForward once again delivers on the Mega Man X formula that made Shantae and the Pirate's Curse a success with Half-Genie Hero. A not-quite reboot of sorts, this entry ties together the classic tropes of Shantae's transformations and collectable abilities from the original Gameboy Color entry with the streamlined world design of its immediate predecessor. The game rewards exploring previously visited areas with newly gained abilities, and all but the most impatient of players should find it quite clearable without a strategy guide. Though not a difficult game, there are some puzzle platforming sequences and potentially Klonoa-inspired boss battles to keep things fresh. Although not every bit is a slam dunk (a certain escape sequence comes to mind), Half-Genie Hero makes for a breezy, fun weekend's worth of adventure platforming, and I look forward to tackling it again with the unlockable characters.

I wish I could use any of the less needed cute transformations more through the game and not abandon them because they were ""useless"" after a certain time.The last bossfight was cool but I wish it was longer, had more variety in tasks/attacks and could actively use the transformations.The bossfights was boring compared to Pirate Curse and I felt something was missing. Not much of a challenge.I wished the game had more areas to discover and not only 6.I still loved the artwork, music and the characters.I would have given this game a mixed rating if it was possible.

												I should probably say that Iâm newcomer to the series and Half-Genie Hero is my first game in the franchise.  I liked the game, which seems strange considering my final vote on it â my final feelings lie somewhere in the middle, but Steam doesnât have neutral score, so I cannot use this.The game certainly looks polished when you play it â characters look beautiful, music is fantastic and animation fluid. Game plays smoothly and responsively (usually, we will talk later about some forms...). The level design is good and most of the levels are blast to play. Transformation are fun and open a lot of new ways to move though levels, other power-ups and spells make fight interesting and give players a lot of options to dispatch enemies.So far it seems like very nice platformer, doesnât it? However, the longer you play, the more cracks start to show. There are only few (hub, five main and final) levels, which wouldnât be a problem â game doesnât really have to be very long to be good and leave nice impression, but you can see that creators saw short length of the game as big problem and were afraid that it seemed to short. Most of my problems stems from methods they applied to combat this problem.- First, that five main levers? They are very interesting first time you play though them and nice second time, with some small changes in monster or trap placement. However, you better hope you will really like them, because you will be playing them over and over trying to find that missing upgrades necessary to progress your story. At this point I just cannot look at beautifully designed and interesting creepy factory level considering how many times I have to beat it. When you have to give players spell to skip parts of the world to get instantly to next level (you get that and this is immensely helpful, but still doesnât  eliminate main problem) you really should think if amount of backtracking isnât too big. At some point it just stop being fun (and Iâm a completionist type of player) and start to seem like artificially padding the gameâs length.- Instant death traps spanning entire sublevels. Well, they are not exactly instant death (you only lose some energy after failing and are moved to the beginning of challenge), but they are rather long with no checkpoints in the middle. It wouldnât be that bad, but they are designed for you to fail at least few times before you can play them from memory. Two of them remove most of your special skills and make you fall down slippery slope while jumping over chasm and avoiding barrels (donât know, maybe it is series tradition? Doesnât really seem fun), with some jumps timed in the way that you cannot really succeed on them without inhuman reflexes or precise knowledge coming from failing them before â and if you will, you will have to replay entire segment from the beginning.  Another one is âlava risingâ type of the level â you need to climb tower while instant kill condition rise from the bottom. This is classic platformer design, however even in Ninja Gaiden series it was clear where you should jump â Shantae sublevel is long and have tons of blind ends, making you constantly fail until you progress to almost the end and can play sublevel from memory where you should move to avoid moving into blind end.- These instant death trap type of sublevels? One of them comes just after final boss. Itâs extremely fun to have do trial and error long gameplay segment when you have just won final fight and want to sit back and relax while story unfolds ;-)- There is instant death sublevel build entirely on how unwieldy and full of inertia is one of the transformed Shantaeâs forms. I know that controls of that form are bad, you donât have to show me that so much ;-) - Lots of upgrades seem like afterthought â for example, special power of bat transformation is used exactly once and only to get relic that allows another (not really useful for combat) almost optional form to attack.- There is an upgrade late game (I think you get it for unlocking entire art gallery? Not sure) that gives you unlimited mana allowing for endless casts of spells. Doesnât seem too bad, strong bonus for completionists, until you realize it means unlimited instant full life heals, unlimited healing items spawn and unlimited invulnerability bubble spell.  Because of that final level consist mainly of instant kill spikes, while final bosses are a joke.- For the end â characters. They seem fun and interesting. They seem to know Shantae, but I have no idea how and why. If you donât know them from previous installments, there is pretty much zero explanation who they are, how they know Shantae and why are they friends/enemies.To sum up -  I enjoyed most of this game, at least until more annoying parts came up, killing my enjoyment each time. It is a very nice game and I hope there will be next game in the series that will polish problems this one is full of â but at this point, my opinion is a little more negative than positive (I would really like to be able to choose neutral opinion in Steam review options).

												I am confused as to what went wrong. Looking back at the previous installations of this series, all that needed some refinement was the minimap and maybe enemy combat. However, Way Forward tries to solve the navigation issues by making all levels linear, completely debilitating a lot of the established core design patterns, and we can see the consequences of this: the game has a mere six levels, yet there are eight transformation abilities, each of which can be further upgraded. The game's world is too small to bring all these abilities to life in a meaningful manner. What follows is the tedious kind of backtracking: Revisiting previous levels to find that one block you could not previously break, that one spot you could not previously climb, that one platform you could not previously reach, all while traversing exhausted content that has lost its meaning by the time you come back with your bag full of upgrades that allow you to fly past everything, just so you can get some thing using some other thing you just got, which, afterwards, you won't be using again, except maybe once in some later puzzle, deliberately designed to make you use the thing, all in order to feign the presence of meaningful choice; but there is none. This design decision spawns further problems, but I'll refrain from emphasizing. By reducing the world to linear levels selected from one central screen, Way Forward has placed an obstacle before themselves that they could not deal with.			"

												This game is very cute and has a lot of love poured into it, but suffers immensely from a very bumpy difficulty curve. The developers seem to be either unable or unwilling to create levels that are anywhere between easy and hard.Most of the easy levels feature platforming and enemies, but with little or no consequence for failing the platforming - and enemies can be easily dispatched, ignored, or avoided most of the time. I never once died to any of the enemies, including the bosses, and I imagine most other players will be able to say the same thing.However, some of the levels are completely different, and feature very few enemies, and often difficult or finicky platforming, with the consequence of missing a jump being an instakill, which sends you back to the last checkpoint. Unfortunately, there are very few of these, so falling into a pit can send you back quite a distance.The final zone is where this all culminates into one huge mess. The levels leading up to the final boss consist mostly of screens that are almost literally Flappy Bird, with instant kills lining every wall. Getting through those screens took me significantly longer than beating the final boss itself, and after that I was dropped in an auto-run level that was even more difficult, and took me even longer to complete. I didn't feel a sense of accomplishment by the time I was done; just frustration.Bottom line: Watch a playthrough instead. The difficulty of the levels spikes too much for me to call this a good game, which sucks, because there's a lot of great work put into just about everything else.			"

												I am proud to have backed Shantae: 1/2 Genie Hero, and along with games like Shovel Knight stands as evidence to the usefulness of Kickstarter in delivering the game developers wanted to make to the players who wanted to play it. From the onset to the credits, its a delightfully colorful and vibrant platformer, that happens to be well written and funny on top of its mechanical excellence. I consider it a treat for returning fans and I'm sure, for newcomers as well.As the first title in the series built for home consoles and PC, the graphical improvements are immediately apparent. We have come a long way from Game Boy Color, with vastly more fluid sprite animations over pleasing 3D backgrounds. It has notably lost none of the magic of its predecessors, as well as its reputation for charmingly attractive character designs that have just enough appeal to not be tacky. The controls are spot on, and should be familiar to anyone to has played SNES or Genesis era titles with a keyboard. I must give special consideration to the soundtrack, which I coughed up extra for during the Kickstarter. If you're at all familiar with Jake ""Virt"" Kaufman and his work on the previous Shantae games, Shovel Knight, Contra 4, Scurge: Hive and many other projects, you'll know what to expect. He's really outdone himself this time.The transformation dances that are a hallmark of the series return, including at least once dance that hasn't been seen since the very first game. This one has by far the most dances and other upgrades, enough that collecting all of them makes you virtually indestructible, in particular making the final boss fight rather trivial. This would require you to actually FIND everything, but it's not the hardest Metroidvania to explore. In fact, it's structured more like the Megaman X games. It also has some harder platforming segments then Pirate's Curse.The few negative reviews of the game all talk about the difficulty, or rather, the lack of it, and the afforementioned backtracking. At no point in the game did I find either of these things aggrivating. Having recently completed a solo playthrough of Bloodborne, I can tell you that there are hard games out there. And there are cheap ones, overhyped ones, and ones that value leaderboard scores over anything resembling fun. Shantae: 1/2 Genie Hero is none of those things, and that is fine. What it is, is a diamond in the rough, a game that made me feel good just to be alive to play it. I think it will do the same for you, and in the end, that's what gaming is really about.			"

												Love the game but the story feels like each character has their own vertical silo and it doesn't interact together well compared to previous titles.Solid controls, beautiful graphics, fantastic music, slick animations.Had fun solving the puzzles although stage design varied, sometimes yawn-inducing to exciting.The game has been put together well and it's enjoyable to play as an overall package. This is a masterpiece compared to the other kickstarter I backed (Mighty No 9) in terms of project management, community communication and overall product.Main irk for me was the save points. Possibly far too often. I think the game was far easier than the previous ones as well. That didn't detract from how fun it is, but you do become a bit too OP when all upgrades are attained.			"

												Shantae:  Half-Genie Hero is a very fun platformer, I highly recommend this game to those that are looking to get into the genre or for those that enjoy these type of games.The world map is very straight forward, you going from stage to stage with each one containing a boss.  You may choose to do this, but the game encourages you to replay the levels again to find secrets and upgrades.Combat is fairly straight forward.  What makes this game special are the various unique transformations you can turn into to complete stages and also find secret areas withen them.  Throughout the game you can find secret npc's that upgrade your transformations that lets you do special moves/attacks.There are also a variety of spells that you can choose from and each one is upgradeable to a certain point.  The only issue I have is the small amount of content, I would love to see more stages because they are very well done.  The progression system is just right which keeps you constantly engaged, which makes this game very enjoyable and you'll definitely get your money's worth.			"

												Having played every single one of the Shantae games (starting with the very first on the GBC), I must say that this kick-started game is the best one that Wayforward has ever made. Although short (and lacking in the story department), there is a lot to love about Half-Genie Hero. The art style and animations are incredibly cute and vibrant, the music is ridiculously catchy, the dialogue is drenched with the Wayforward wit we've come to know and love from all their other games and the gameplay is exactly how any good Metroid-vania game should be: responsive, precise and genuinely fun. If you haven't played a Shantae game before, do yourself a favor and pick this one up. Show Wayforward some love for all their hard work!			"

												Manages to be a great game despite being entirely different from its predecessors. Transformations, while interesting and numerous, are just not as interesting as the gear used in Pirate's Curse, with most ending up very situational (I can count the number of times I used spider shantae on one hand, and I 100%ed the game). Despite this, the game seems to use the premise of dance-transformations the best of all previous titles, and is honestly a lot of fun to play through.Risky Boots DLC could easily fix these problems, but it's not out yet.If you're looking to get into the Shantae series, I would still recommend Pirate's Curse, but if you crave more, then this game won't disappoint. The story is well-written and entertaining in each game, but the overarching plot isn't too serious, so playing out of order won't hurt anyone.PS: This game does not feature the best girl, squidsmith, and thusly is complete garbage. Bring her back right now, wayforward!			"

												So far, really enjoying the game. It's bright, colorful and is super smooth with it's tweened animations. Really impressive art and animation. I'm less into the 3D backgrounds, they contrast too harshly with the character art, they work for the most part. Gameplay is nice, it's a mix between Risky's Revenge and Pirate's Curse, you get the transformations of the 2nd game and the faster gameplay of the third game....Buuuut it's levels are not as large or have the depth of the previous games. They feel simple and easy. Maybe this changes a bit more later? I'm not sure yet. One thing that's a bit frustrating so far is there's a lot of weird backtracking. Weird as in, you'll beat level, go back to the level with a new power to get some more stuff right? But you won't have the ability to get through a wall...So you can only collect 2/5 items required to progress ...till you go further down the level, talk to an NPC who gives it to you making you walk back what you JUST did....twice. As said earlier, levels aren't massive so it's not a huge deal but it's just weird to make you run back right away. Overall, so far I think Pirate's Curse is a better game. But this is a game worth getting all the same. Lot of charm and polish. One thing is for sure, despite Mighty No. 09 getting all the hype and all the money this game managed to do more with less. It plays better, looks VASTLY better, is far more optimized and has all the charm and character you'd expect from Way Forward.			"

												Half-Genie Hero is a triumphant return of the Shantae series. The art style and animation is so fluid and detailed, there are times when I'm honestly not sure if what I'm looking at is a sprite or 3D model. I've NEVER had a game make me question this, and it's a testement to artists and animators who brought Shantae to life.The game is equally a blast to play. Controls are fluid and responsive, even the seconds needed to cycle between Shantae's animal forms don't take too long to break flow. Combat with Shantae's equally detailed and expressive foes is challenging, without being too frusterating. The platforming never gets so pixel-perfect as to want to break your controller, especially with Shantae having multiple ways to progress through challenges. I am also happy to say I never needed to go Googling for the answer to any puzzles or platforming challenges.The game is relatively short, I finished in about 3 days, spending 2-3 hours each run. Despite being metroid-vania in structure, the game is spread over different stages you chose to travel to, akin to Shantae and the Pirate's Curse. However, every stage is PACKED with secrets, and I found myself going through each stage again whenever I gained a new ability. The stages themselves visually change after the boss is defeated, making return trips feel fresh. Plus, there's new characters that will be added to the game for free with their own campaigns in the future, and I am eager to play them!The boss fights themselves are amazing. Many even zoom out to make room for the massive boss on screen. Each one is intense and satisfiying to fight, though none proved to be so difficult that I could not defeat on the first try.Like most of the Shantae games, the plot is fairly standard, and you can probably see all the twists a mile away. Though, like most of the Stantae games, the story is more defined by the characters and their dialogue, all of which is cleaverly written. Shantae and her friends are utterly hilarious and witty, and it's worth playing the game just to see them bounce quips off one another.My only serious complaint is the relatively weak finale, especially compared to the previous games. The final battle is disapointing, as is the conclusion, at least compared to the last 2 games. For less serious complaints, the story overall, especially in terms of character development, isn't quite as good as Pirate's Curse, though still good. There's also an issue of balance, as most of Shantae's animal forms are pointless to use in combat. You even wind up finding upgrades that enable them to attack too late in the game for them to be of any use. Shanate my actually have too many attacks, spells and abilities, most of which can't match her standard hair attack. And by the end of the game, I was stuffed with so many healing items and restorative abilities, I could brute-force my way through anything.None of these issues make me regret Kickstarting this game. The greatest testement to its quality, is the longing I felt to play more games like it, and seeing nothing in my steam library that match it.If you enjoy platformers, quality indie titles, metroid-vania, or just want a enjoyable tale about a beautiful and witty Half-Genie, Buy This Game!*Note: Was a backer on the Shantae: Half-Genie Hero Kickstarter.

												My favorite Shantae game to date! A great game from start to finish! Although getting 100% completion wasn't actually that bad, I had a lot of fun and I would highly recommend it to anybody who's even slightly interested!P.S. Game's running at 60fps constantly as well, no frame drops as far as my playthrough went (But my rig's probably kinda overkill for this type of game), but I'm pretty sure it will run well on any mid-range GPU or better!

												Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is Shantae's newest game, Kickstarted by the fans. Updated for the modern age and brought to Steam, the game is in full color (big shock) with a wonderful ""indie"" feel. Is it any good? Let's find out!Story: 7/10(Quirky and fun, but awkward pacing)Shantae's story in this game is fairly straightforward. It's definitely an indie-written story, but it wears that designation on its sleeve. The story itself is like the game: Quirky and fun. However, its pacing is somewhat awkward. It's not bad, but it seems to have some sections that drag on from a lack of direction (Thankfully, ""Bathroom Angel"" can fix that somewhat) and some that blow by.There's also some funny references and 4th-wall-breaking. The writing itself is fantastic, giving everyone personality and charm. I just wish the story itself was paced a little better and the initial directions you're given at the start of each quest were clearer, but nothing in the story has made me consult a walkthrough yet.Characters: 10/10 (YESYESYESYESYESYESYES)OK, I have to gush about the writing for the characters. There is so much charm and personality to the characters, ESPECIALLY Shantae. Shantae is a mixture of a straight-woman to the weirdness, a generic hero-type (played with), an airhead (without being a motor-mouth), and a bit of thickness. (She's not dense by any means, she seems pretty smart, just naive.) I like all of the characters and their dialogue is all great.Gameplay: 8/10 (Well-refined platformer with a bit of side-scrolling brawler)Shantae is evocative of the old-school Nintendo platformers, including some Metroidvania elements. You jump around like a maniac looking for platforms, look for every tiny hint to a secret/easter egg/new power-up, and some Castlevania-like brawling.Shantae's also bringing some tricks to help make platforming better and uncover more secrets. She can use her Belly Dance (which has an adorable animation) to transform into different Forms, each with their own unique traits, jump height, attacks (or lack thereof), and special abilities. Most Forms have an upgrade to unlock a new attack, which is, unfortunately, not that interesting. (Mermaid Form gets a bubble, Crab Form gets a quick snap that clips through seaweed, Mouse Form gets a spammable-low-damage bite, and so on.)The platforming itself is highly refined, practically to a science. The controls are tight and intuitive, Shantae's movement and jumping is consistent and controllable (You can adjust and correct your jumps mid-air, thankfully), and it's usually clear what you can and can't jump on. My only real complaint lies with a couple of her Forms, mainly with Harpy Form, where the controls become extremely floaty and nigh-controllable. Sometimes, the hitboxes can be a little iffy, especially with Mermaid Form where I've taken damage while close to (but not touching) an enemy that only damages you by touch because my TAIL got near it.The brawling is very simple: One button makes Shantae slap a short distance in front of her (your generic Hair-Whip Attack) and another uses your Magic. It's very simple one-button combat (technically, two-button, but w/e) and works well.I think my current major complaint with the gameplay is just the insane amount of backtracking you have to do. This isn't anything new if you've played a Metroidvania-style platformer in the past 10-15 years, but it really drives the pacing into the ground sometimes as you run from place to place, running the same levels at least 2 extra times each just praying you'll see the one thing different you can do with a new Form or upgrade. Granted, I'm not huge into Metroidvania, so take this with a massive grain of salt.One more minor complaint I have to get off my chest is the inventory. There's no quick-use keys, so if you want to use something, you have to go into the Inventory screen, select it, and Use it. This is a very minor complaint, considering this actually HELPS, since the Inventory screen pauses the game and can let you get your bearings.Music: 9/10 (Amazing Soundtrack)The music in this game is fantastic. It has that indie quirkyness to it without being grating. My only real complaint is that the music can get a LITTLE repetitive due to the Metroidvania nature of the game, forcing you to backtrack a ton and hear each track plenty of times.Art Style: 10/10 (Awesome, A Visual Treat)The art style in this game is absolutely awesome. It's 2.5D (meaning, gameplay on a 2D plane, but 3D models) with a very anime-esque style. In fact, this whole game looks like a playable anime. Everything has this cute-quirky style to it and just drips with personality. It's an absolute treat to look at, combining an old-school 2D game with a 3D art style flawlessly.Any the animations are just...AAAAAAAAAAA I LOVE THEM! Everything has this bouncy energy that brings the game to life. Shantae's idle animations are fun to watch, her Belly Dance is playful, just everything is beautifully animated.Conclusion: 9/10 (Fantastic)Simply put, Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a fantastic game. I'm rarely a fan of platformers, but Shantae has me absolutely entranced. I can't stop smiling at this game. Its fun old-school gameplay, energy-filled art and animations, just everything about the game oozes charm and personality. This was clearly made by developers who love their craft and wanted this game to be fantastic. While I haven't played any of the previous Shantae games (Nothing against them, just wasn't interested), this game seems to fit perfectly with the rest of them, but with some excellent modernization.It's an absolute STEAL at $20. I can't wait to see how the developers will follow up to this fantastic platformer.Maybe a Squid Baron standalone with $0.99 Shantae DLC is in order too. ;)			"

												Half-Genie Hero is my first venture into the Shantae series, and it is always kinda difficult to review a game in an objective way if said game is part of an established franchise. I went out of my way to look at other people's opinions on the game and reviews of the previous titles in the series, as well as look over the wiki a few times, all just to make sure I knew what exactly what I was talking about. Without further ado, here's my review (oh hey it rhymes !)Half-Genie Hero is fun, really, really fun. The gameplay is just great, with super smooth controls, rapid transformations that open up new paths, magic powers to use and abuse, and despite the level design being on the weaker side, levels are a joy to play over and over again, collecting all the things you can find, and speedrunning is just the icing on the cake. It is a shame the levels are completely disconnected from the main hub, it makes the world feel rather disjointed. A shame for an entry in a series that is usually praised as a good example of Metroidvania (and god knows I'm a sukker for Metroidvanias).Graphically, the game is gorgeous, pure eye candy (and i'm not saying that for all the lovely Jigglypuffs, IYKWIM). The lovely art direction is only an added bonus on top of some of the smoothest animations I've seen in my life. Every level is a joy to explore thanks to the clever mix of 2D and 3D. It's just a shame that most of them are rather generic, with a port, a jungle with waterfalls, a desert, a volcano...the real standout level was the magic carpet ride, which isn't something you see everyday.Musically, it's also great, with many catchy tracks that don't feel the need to venture into 8/16 bit territory to be good. Jake Kaufman's the man when it comes to making great music, and I'm happy to say he delivered big time with his work on Half-Genie hero. The mermaid factory theme has to be my personal favorite, along with the boss fight theme. Sound design is also neat, it's very satisfying to fight enemies and hear them burn or get crushed.The story is pretty weak, however. It's kind of all over the place, with mini-plots that don't go anywhere, and no real big narrative to string it all together. Characters get introduced only to be ignored or forgotten, and it doesn't make a strong impression. For what it's worth, the writing is funny and the interactions between characters are great, and the whole thing can be ignored, but it's a shame that a game like this couldn't give its story more attention. It's all over pretty quickly, as is tradition with games designed with speedrunning in mind. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this game, even if you're not a fan of the series like me before playing it. I'm going to give Pirate's Curse a look one of these days, and I'm definitely looking forward to the extra content coming to HGH in the future.			"

												This short review is based on the first 3 hours of gameplay.Having played Risky's Revenge and Pirate's Curse (both on PC and Wii U) I can say that this game is just as good. Of course, there's some differences, and to some the transformation mechanics can seem gimmicky, but the game redeems itself with OUTSTANDING art and music. Like litterely I was blown away by both of them. And the humor is still present, same ol' characters, same ol' thing. But it doesn't make it a bad game at all. For only 20 bucks, I think it's a well invested 20 bucks. I wouldn't buy it for 30, but I think 20 is a fair price for such a high quality game in the end. I don't know exactly what is its length, since I haven't finished it. But for achievement hunters and collectible OCD people, it fits right in.tl;dr? It's amazing and worth its price so far. If you liked the other Shantae games, chances are you will like this one just as much.			"

												Colorful game with plenty of eye candy and moderate ""lol"" inducing dialogue. Gameplay is pretty Metroidvania, you will be revisiting previous levels to grab tons of items but it's not a big hassle with the transform system and warp dance to move through the level without having to go through absolutely everything. Even if you haven't played the previous game, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, I feel as if the story and characters would still be easily digestable for a new person to follow. The music and colors are great, you can even play on keyboard instead of a controller and if you set up your keys just right you can play one handed. The only two issues I had with this game are that if you run at a 144hz monitor you have to turn down the refresh rate to 60 or the game will only run at 33 fps, and I feel as if the game was a little bit too short. I would've liked maybe 1 or 2 more full levels before beating the end. Other than that, I give it a 9/10.			"

												This is a fun little metroidvania-type title. It's not an especially long or difficult game, but the different abilities are cool and add new dimensions to traversing the levels (except Spider. I like the design but I'm not really sure how useful it is outside of one instance where it's necessary). I also like that it's fairly short because it makes backtracking to use those new abilities much less tedious than it could otherwise have been.It controls well, the art direction is charming, and the songs are all nice. The voice acting is good although there isn't much of it, which is fine; it's not something I need in every game and I would have been fine without it. I also like the fact that you can 'adjust' the difficulty in-game by turning on or off your different power-ups; for example, something you can unlock later is unlimited magic as well as an invicibility spell which can make the last few bosses rather trivial, but if you feel like challenging yourself or 'doing it right' you can just turn off the relic and activate one of the lesser forms of the spell.In short, I recommend it.

												Great platformer with awesome music. The high resolution graphics are also a nice change from all the retro pixel platformers these days.You basically run around whipping things with your hair, defeating bosses, and collecting transformations. The transformations let you access hidden areas and collect all the secrets in the game. Getting 100% isn't super difficult and the basic gameplay is fun enough for some replay.The only piece that doesn't really seem fleshed out is the magic abilities. It's much more effective to just whip everything with your hair. There's only a handful of occasions where magic is useful and it's usually just for slightly more damage output.			"

												Although I did not play the previous Shantae game series before, but I'd still give a thumbs up to this one. This map designs itself has really good view, like in 3D viewing. Shantae's dance transformations allow players to re-explore the stage to collect hidden items, even the purpose is to achieve 100% game completion. What makes the transformations interesting is that players are able to explore certain areas even deeper, including hidden puzzles in certain areas. As a beginner for playing the game, transformations are what increases the player's desire to explore even further. Although there are unreachable areas that requires certain transformations to reach, that doesn't mean it's impossible to progress further.The dialogues before every boss fight (probably except Risky Boots), makes me think that there are some hidden references. That makes the game more entertain, instead of fully focusing on main objectives and beating bosses without hilarious jokes. Moreover, the game is really amazing. Recommend you guys should give it a shot.			"

												To all the backers of Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, thank you for all of your support! I would have happily joined you had I known how awesome the Shantae series was, but I came late into the game, and it was only shortly after the campaign ended did I take the time to enjoy Risky's Revenge and The Pirate Curse. Playing those two games, I've come to expect a lot from this series in terms of its artstyle, soundtrack, and gameplay. Needless to say, this game has exceeded some of my expectations while underwhelming others.The ArtsyleRight away you can tell this game is beautifully drawn and the characters are well animated. The colours, the movement, and even the backgrounds are vibrant and beaming of life. I don't usually pay attention to backgrounds, but I can see how much time and attention has gone into them along with the smooth character animations.The SoundtrackAlthough most of the music is rearranged and redone, the Shantae soundtrack continues to match the levels and the dialogue moods perfectly. None of the new music really stands out as super catchy and memorable, but when they are used for specific moments and levels, it composed well enough to immerse you into the situation.The GameplayAs much as I love the aesthetics for this game, I feel like the gameplay has taken a stepback. A lot of long times fans come to expect a more Metroidvania kind of structure to the levels and worlds, and for me this more level select method is a better for backtracking. There were times in previous games where I just got lost easily and felt like some stages lost their importance after a while.Thankfully the levels are all simply structured to have three stages each, along with a few obstacles you can't get past until you earn an animal transformation. I can see they wanted to focus on the use of them along with making the game more accessible to newcomers.So while the puzzles and extra sections are a ton of fun to figure out in terms of using the right transformations and abilities, I feel like the selection of transformations was overwhelming. There were too many transformations that could have been consolidated into less animals with more abilities as opposed to one animal with one unique ability each. I get excited learning a new ability and this game didn't seem to reward my experience as much as I'd like because you barely ever get to use your new abilities that often except for maybe one or two situations that call for them.Final ThoughtsAll in all though, I still had a ton of fun with this beautifully designed platformer. I patiently wait for the DLC that is already available for backers *shakes fist* and look forward to more of what WayForward can come up with in the future. I give this game a solid 7/10. The art, music, and levels are well crafted. Learning and using new abilities felt underwhelming when they were horribly underused, but the game makes up for some of these flaws for having a decent level of difficulty in puzzle solving and its exciting boss battles.On top of all that, I know that Shantae stories are usually meant to be light hearted and on the Saturday Morning cartoon side, I still can't help but feel like there could have been more to it than what was presented. There were moments where the story could have had some strong themes elaborated on. I was severely disappointed that the evil Shantae section was over as soon as it started. Maybe a level being inside Shantae's heart or something would have been nice. Like a good challenge to rid the evil that she's been inflicted with, instead of just having all these characters monologue at her saying how much they care for her. That would have been better if it was a reward to a one time level in the game.But I digress. Gameplay is king in Shantae games and having the story skimped out on is not a huge loss since they're not usually known for their stories alone. All in all a fun and exciting game that is good for its length and what it offers. Replayability is debatable and more geared towards a speed run, but we shall see what gets add for DLC later on!

												It's been a while since I played a platformer worth it's salt.  Thankfully, I decided to purchase Shantae: Half-Genie Hero entirely on a whim.  I hadn't heard about the kickstarter otherwise there's a strong chance I would have backed it.  I've since rectified that mistake and bought the game when Steam suggested it to me.Shantae is a game with great artwork, and incredibly catchy sound track, and a plethora of unlocks to get you through your quest.  The levels are designed incredibly well which is great since you'll be revisting them multiple times to get any new items you can find as the game progresses.  Bosses are humorous, animated well, and sometimes challenging.  Shantae isn't without it's flaws, though those are incredibly minor.  Really.  While the next bit sounds like a lot, I'm being incredibly nit-picky.  A few animation glitches occur during the opening sequence when Shantae first gets out of bed and in the mid-level save sequence.  Jumping can be a bit stiff but if you've played enough platforming games, you can quickly adapt.  One of the coolest parts of Shantae is also one of the most disappointing parts.  On your first go around in a level, you'll see many details that bring the stage to life.  These are usually tied to the story of the level and once you clear it, they go away.  Future vists see the level altered slightly to reflect what you've already accomplished.  For example, in the second level, a number of fair maidens are being carted away in a factory.  Once the issue is resolved, the women are obviously gone seeing how you saved them, but it kind of ruins the atmosphere a little.Again, nitpicking and critiqueing classical art.  Shantae is worth a playthrough.  It's a tad on the short end but don't let that detract from the quality of the game you get.  TL:DR If you're stillâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥at Mighty No. 9 and need a platformer to scratch the itch that disaster promised, then Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is here to fix you right up.			"

												Half-Genie keeps the charm of the characters but tones down the fan service, to the point where I could let me 8 year old daughter play the game as well and not be embarrassed.The action and platforming is also tighter than Pirate's Curse, so overall it's a very good game.If you like Shantae you should definitely get the game, and if you're looking for a charming new world for you or your kids, it's definitely a good pick.

												Going to keep this short, but I have to say Shantae: Half Genie Hero is a great semi-metroidvania platforming adventure. The music is excellent, the visuals are equally so, and it's a lot of fun, if not a little bit on the easy side.WayForward has stated the game will get additional content if the game sells well, so do everyone a favor, and recommend the game to your friends.

												As many others have pointed out it's not really a metroidvania anymore but it's a great game none the less. Beautiful artwork, great music and hilarious writing. However, it's not all rainbows and roses. The game is tediously easy, borderline boring, at some points â especially after certain unlocks. I was literally invincible while fighting the final boss, not particularly challenging. It's still a good game though, and easily worth the money if you liked the other Shantae games.			"

												This short review is based on the first 3 hours of gameplay.Having played Risky's Revenge and Pirate's Curse (both on PC and Wii U) I can say that this game is just as good. Of course, there's some differences, and to some the transformation mechanics can seem gimmicky, but the game redeems itself with OUTSTANDING art and music. Like litterely I was blown away by both of them. And the humor is still present, same ol' characters, same ol' thing. But it doesn't make it a bad game at all. For only 20 bucks, I think it's a well invested 20 bucks. I wouldn't buy it for 30, but I think 20 is a fair price for such a high quality game in the end. I don't know exactly what is its length, since I haven't finished it. But for achievement hunters and collectible OCD people, it fits right in.tl;dr? It's amazing and worth its price so far. If you liked the other Shantae games, chances are you will like this one just as much.			"

												Pretty faithful continuation of the shantae series.PROS:- Solid animation (some of the cleanest i've seen from 2D)- Tight controls (complete remapping options if you need it)- Dat soundtrack (probably the best in the series yet)- Good level design (for the most part)CONS:- So short (8 hours to 100%)- Open world is gone (style changed from metroidvania to megaman)- Character models cartoony (personal gripe but I liked the pirate's curse art better)- Too many fetch quests (exploration is more forced than encouraged)- Excessive level revisits (for all those fetch quests)- Extremely easy (didnt even know what the death animation was till after I beat the game)- Magic is useless (except for the invincible bubble, which breaks the game)- Too many forms (only a few are really useful while the others fill scarce niches)Wayforward has stated that additional characters will be available later on and hopefully it will help the game retain its value. Its a very fun and upbeat game to play regardless, it just ends too fast to enjoy to the fullest. Wait until more characters come out to buy it.			"

												I absolutely adore this game! The aesthetic is gorgeous, colorful and vibrant, with a range of interesting and distinctive locales. The character designs are absolutely top notch and a treat for the eyes, whether they be cute, sexy or both, not to mention that they are animated so fluidly and gracefully. Truly a triumph!The story, while simple and following the usual tropes of platformers, did through me for a loop and there were genuine surprises and unexpected turns. Even then, the formula is not so much that this game is unoriginal in its approach and more about not fixing what isn't broken.This game is such a treat to play. It controls well, and the unique mechanics such as the dancing to change to different character modes to the use of magic abilities was intuitive and easy to grasp while providing a surprising amount of depth, offering multiple avenues to approach the game. Not to mention the difficulty. True, it isn't Nintendo hard, but it is certainly challenging without being frustrating, for all players of all skill levels.An absolute triumph. I recommend this game to anyone with even a passing interest in 2D platformers.			"

												Having played and beaten every other game in the series, I was very hesitant at Half Genie Hero at first. After completing the first two levels, you see the roots of the game unfurl once again. Half Genie Hero holds true to its exploration heavy expectations in addition to distinguishing itself. That's everything you could ask for in a sequel really! My only complaints about the game is how horrendously easy and exploitable it is. Two hours in I found an exploit for infinite currency. Aside from that, there are items in the game that make your effective health absolutely unbelievable. Not to mention, magic can make boss fights far too easy, and when coupled with insane health, literally a joke. This shouldn't talk you out of the game though, I still had a great time even if everything was easy.Pros:-Beautiful design-Great soundtrack-Easy gameplay-A story far better than Pirate's Curse-Humor-Exploration is excellentCons:-Minor bugs, nothing you'd care about really.-Easy and exploitable. All in all, I believe this game should be in everybody's library. 9/10			"

												I played this game directly after playing Shantae and The Pirates Curse, which I absolutly Reccomend. Honestly, Half-Genie Hero, while visually pleasing and mechanically sound, is not at good. Don't get me wrong, still a good game that I feel is worth the price tag. It is simply that the game did not do what The Pirates Curse did for me. One of my favorite things is that even the hardest levels of the game aren't too frustrating and I found myself wanting to complete the level no matter what. However, my main issue with the game is level design. There are 2-3 levels set up around the idea of you dying a handful of times before you learn the 'pattern' and make it to the goal. Unlike Pirates Curse, where the game would introduce you to new things individually before forcing you to deal with combinations, they made sure you had an idea of what you might be facing and then if you died, it was your fault because you didn't handle a puzzle or scenario correctly. This game makes the mistake of just throwing things at you and forcing you to find the best way while dying several times to do so. The other issue I have with level design is that the game has several animal forms that are essentally the same form just one of them is superior and the other one is required for one or two puzzles. For example, there are two water forms, one is large and lets you swim in any direction, the other is small and lets you walk under water. It can be said, oh you need the small form to get through the blocks of seaweed, but the large form gets an ability that lets it break through large blocks of stone, so the same puzzles for the small form could have been scaled to allow the large form in with the block breaking ability. Similarly you get two flying abilities, one that lets you fly left to right, and one that lets you fly freely, the left to right one also gets another ability that is only usefully for a single puzzle and most of the left to right flying power's puzzles could have been solved by the free flying one if they had simply changed the distance of spike walls or removed one entirely, the left to right form cannot go up or down, so you simply transform on a platform and float lazily left or right. My final two issues are with post game events. During the entire game you can travel back to each location with the boss fights and some hazards removed, ie. sand storms. Yet for some reason they give the option to start a new playthrough with all of the main transformations already unlocked, it seems pointless seeing as aside from the end game boss all the bosses were beaten without using transformations. The final issue is simply a continuity problem in my opinion that involves spoilers, but as you can guess from the title, Pirate's Curse, the previous game was about Shantae and Risky Boots.****Spoilers Below****At the end of Pirate's Curse they show not only does Risky Boots reguard Shantae as some semblance of a friend, but she is extremely smart and was able to plan the entire adventure ahead insuring Shantae's Victory. So why in this game is she so dumb she not only drops a map to her hide out, but several articles of clothing around town? The other issue is that at the end of Pirate's Curse the two part ways, Shantae returning to being the Guardian Genie and Risky saying she must forge her own path, as she cannot become a 'goody two shoes' like Shantae, they part with a seeminly mutual understanding and a few nice words that make Risky seem like she actually has grown to like Shantae as the adventure came to a conclusion. So why would Risky just leave a Shantae after she converts her magic to dark magic, wouldn't she want to take her friend with her? Which reminds me, when Shantae is converted to evil nothing happens, literally each of her friends says, hey snap out of it, and she does. It's very anticlimatic and it feels like a small mini-boss fight is missing.If you actually read to the end, I'm amazed I know I went off on a tangent, but over all the game is good and a worth while buy, it just doesn't stack up to the standard that the previous game set for me.

												*NOTE: I WAS A BACKER FOR THIS GAME'S KICKSTARTER*I'm not gonna go too deep into this game because it's pretty obvious as to what it is by looking at it but I can say it is an excellent platformer from WayForward that has some metroidvania elements. The game is hud based, and you can revisit previous levels in order to collect items needed to progress. So, what you are looking at is a game that's part traditional run left to right platformer, and part collectathon. You will get various powers and upgrades as you progress through the game not unlike a Metroid or Castlevania title. You'll have a scene with characters in a hub town, go to a level and make it through, then likely have to find something you couldnt get before to progress to the next level by revisiting previous levels. The good news is that you won't be playing the exact same things over again as levels do have some changes as you go through them again but it's mostly the same. If I have any major negatives it may be the nature of having to revist old levels over again though it didn't bother me too much, and that it's fairly short, taking about 7 hours for me on my first run to collect everything and beat the game.

												Whether it be a reboot, soft reboot, sequel or soft robot rabbit, Shantae is back in town.  Everything is familiar for fans of the series, maybe a little too much so in some respects, and if you're unfamiliar to the series and looking for a light metroidvania-esque platforming game that isn't too hard, you'll enjoy this.The world is bright and colourful and the 3d background visuals are a pleasant departure from the standard 2d pixel art.  The soundtrack is pretty solid, as usual for the series.  Controls are mostly smooth, some jumps didn't feel quite as responsive as I'd like but good on the whole.  Though, Relic usage for animal transformations could be more seamless in game. On the topic of Relics, there are far too many transformations and not enough puzzles using them.  A few of the transformation upgrades only get used once or not at all.  There may have been plans to use these upgrades that never made it into the game, but it still feels like there's unnecessary clutter and it's disappointing to have useless abilities.  A lot of the magic you can buy from the store also isn't as useful as in past series.Plotline is disappointing.  Just... disappointing.  It's like the events of the previous game were completely forgotten.  Whilst I do enjoy seeing familiar faces like Sky, Bolo, Rotty and Mimic again, too many of the minor antagonists were reused from previous games in shallow ways and the culmination of the plot just felt very half-baked.  That being said, there is some witty banter and some enjoyable dialogue.  And some nice 'plot' as usual.The level design is decent and there are some interesting concepts and designs, though the execution isn't entirely there.  Bosses... eh.  I think the game misses not having any dungeons whatsoever, though, and the difficulty curve is pretty nonexistent.  I've no major issue with the backtracking elements to the game, but I do think that the game spoonfeeds a little too much with regards to some of the hidden items.  The hinting system is pretty inelegant as well.  Overall, enjoyable.  Bit of a step back from Pirate's Curse - WayForward may not be living up to their name - but a nice few hours romping around anyway.			"

Full Disclosure: I'm a Kickstarter backer and am a big fan of the Shantae series.There's three things Wayforward excells at in each Shantae game. Animation, Music, and Writing.Animation: It's literally the best i've seen throughout the games yet, i'm not only gushing over the transition into 2.5D but am also liking the cartoonish character portraits.  The small image bobs gives a sense of liveliness and brings across the way each character is feeling quite adequately.  It's her first HD adventure and and HGH (Half-Genie Hero) fully captures the visual look of a Shantae game.Music: Jake Kaufman (who has composed each Shantae soundtrack) is the ""Audio guy"" yet again and has done yet another great job.  You can listen to remixes of older Shantae music and fully original tracks as well, my favorites being the title screen music and Neo Burning Town.Writing: Wayforward yet again gives you their classic tongue-and-cheek style of writing so you can enjoy both the plot and all of the silly jokes that go along with it with one of my favorite quotes being: ""Blast it All. That airship cost billions of crowd-funded dollars!""GripesThe major gripe I have with the game currently is the content, it's somewhat of a short game and you'll find yourself finishing it with 100% in about 6-9 hours, Risky's Revenge is a shorter game but the story for HGH leaves more to be desired with the only other option available being the speedrun achievements).  Also two of the transformations only really have one-time uses and are under-powered in comparison to the others.  Granted the other transformations are very useful and gives shantae both tools for tackling a stage and a different means of attacking various enemies.However, they plan on adding THREE seperate playable costumes for Shantae (similar to the Dancer costume in Risky's Revenge) and plan on adding FOUR additional campaigns for Risky Boots, Rottytops, Bolo, and Sky which should solve the game's launch-date content issue.If you want to get a full-enjoyment out of HGH, I recommend you play through Risky's Revenge and Pirates Curse beforehand since it'll increase your enjoyment for HGH.  Regardless, this is a good starting point if you're thinking about getting into the series since it does a good job capturing the feel and gameplay of a Shantae game.I hope you enjoy!  I sure did!!

												That game is disappointing gameplay wise. While the universe is brillant, the characters are adorable, the music is great and the controls are close from being perfect, the game requires you to do an incredible amount of backtracking.With only 6 levels, you are required to go back in those levels sometimes more than 5 times just to get what's remaining after you got a new power and progress in the story. The game manages to make that backtracking way less painful with a few mechanics (like that power that allows you to skip a part of a level). You may even say that the backtracking is overall brillantly implemented since everytime you have to go back you would be able to do it way faster than before thanks to your new power. But backtracking faster is still backtracking, even if the develloppers' ideas to make that backtracking not painful were good. In the end, after finishing the game for the first time, I'm not really satisfied and I don't really want to try the new game +.The game is also fairly short. Count around 6 hours to finish it. Maybe a bit more if like me you got stuck somewhere at one point. The fact that the game is short makes all that backtracking even more frustrating and give the feel that all of this is just made to give the feel that the game is longer than it looks. On the other hand, if you're a speedrunner, be aware that Shantae Half-Genie Hero is pretty much tailor made for it.I can't really recommand that game at full price.			"

												+ Fun old school platformer with encouraged exploration+ Great vivid art style that has smooth animation and good soundtrack+ Level layouts and enemies change as you come back to them to fetch new items for your quest+ Unlockable magic weapons and transformations to turn you into other creatures+/- With enough exploration, you can become overpowered. However, you are able to toggle your powers on and off.This was my first Shantae game and it was so much better than I expected. If you're new to the series, there is so much more to the game than the trailer shows (as I discovered).			"

Don't regret buying it for 18â¬ one bit, played it all the way to the end.There is one REALLY great thing though that 1/2 Genie Hero has over Pirate's curse.

												Coming from a guy who played and owned the first game back in the GBC/GBA days (and never playing Risky's Revenge until the 3DS e-Shop re-release) and Pirate's Curse, I can happily say that Half-Genie Hero does not disappoint.The review I'm giving is from a gameplay perspective. If you're looking for technical reviews (minimum spec requirements, game engine options, etc.), I can't help you there. I play games for what they are, not what they're made of.I'd go on and on, but as of the moment (Dec 21, 2016, 0450), I've yet to finish the game, but have reached a substantial amount of length to confirm many things:- the gameplay is solid, platforming-wise (think Megaman-grade solid)- the soundtrack is on point (slightly more bombastic than previous titles, but it still fits)- graphically-delicious even at low-resolutions, and tons of fun little animations that add to the overall quirkiness- story is as Shantae can get, assuming you've played the previous games (if you haven't, it's still fun in its own right)Get it if you're into platformers with solid controls and cute girls.

												I think this game has to be one of the best platform games I've ever played. The gameplay is so good and fun at the same time and it is really unique. The story is silly but interesting at the same time, and there is lots of humour in this game. Even though it focuses a lot on boobs, it makes it as if it is not an important part of the game, hence the older games in this series. The design and graphics are SO good, and the art is outstanding. Everything from ememies to tress, are all designed amazing. They did so well with this game and I definitly think it is a good Shantae game. I give it a 10/10			"

But wait! There's more!So this is the fourth game in the series, crowd-funded, and pure HD.There's something i have to say first, and it's that the game isn't yet fully finished. We're getting some DLC.I sorta find it a bit weird and expensive, but it'll probably get more value as the DLCs release.If you want reference for how good or bad the series is as a whole, it's good, read my other reviews of the previous 2 games:http://steamcommunity.com/id/garketmardener/recommended/277890/Ëshantae_relaxËShantae: Risky's Revengehttp://steamcommunity.com/id/garketmardener/recommended/345820/Ëshantae_relaxËShantae & the Pirate's Curse This time around, they went for a more visually stunning but shorter game, to be expanded with lots of replay value thanks to the upcoming DLCs.So right now it has the same problem as Switch Force: It's cool, and fun, it's pretty in graphics, but once you've done the 2 modes you're basically done with it. Wait for DLCs.As it is, and considering how the game's supposed to be expanded, it's good, it's really great. Most importantly, the graphics are really well done and don't even get close to straying off of the style the game usually goes for: Toonish, charming, colorful, vivid, and with noticeable details and tweaks. I believe it's the first time WayForwad does 3d models on one of their IPs, and they did it great for a first time. Characters are still well-put sprites in a 3d-2d parallax world. Really comes together as a modernized classic way of doing things.60FPS engine, but animations aren't all 60fps. It still looks consistant and doesn't really bother. Also, yes, it comes with chest jigglies. As it's obvious. I mean, WayForward? Fanservice? Isn't that the same thing? /jokeThis however doesn't stop the game from being fun and really great. As always, the prime 3 aspects i like about this company are on point: Decent difficulty (questionable here but whatever) and fun gameplay, great artstyle and personality, absolutely rocking synth muslc from Jake Kaufman AKA Virt. Album is out on bandcamp now btwgame's a bit short, you can get 100% in the base game mode in 5-6 hours approx, considering how the other games took up to 8 hours for that (all of those are player-dependant times, might take longer if you're not familiar with the games or genre).The game's very iconic and takes everything positive from the other games, such as returning gags, levels, enemies, bosses, transforms and abilities, while still refreshing everything really well.On the minus side, because of how short the game is, some features fell under the ""situationally helpful"" cape of negligence, but at least they get used once. There are a few annoying mechanics that were uncalled for, overall for the very stupidly placed pauses inbetween the action (Why is the level start Ready! screen a thing, and why can't you move while it's playing?), but for the most part it still is a great game.Buyer's advice: Play the other games before. Some of the content might go unappreciated if you haven't played the other games, or just watched a full gameplay. Any works. But still, playing is much more fun than watching, at least for me.Overall, i give it a [8.5-->10]/10 depending on how well executed the DLCs and extra modes come along. "

												Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is my favorite game developed by WayForward, and that's saying a lot. Other games developed by WF include DuckTales Remastered, Mighty Switch Force, LIT, Cat Girl Without Salad, and all of the other Shantae games. First of all, I have to praise the game composer god, Jake ""Virt"" Kaufman. This OST is absolutely fantastic. It could be better than Pirate's Curse's OST. The gameplay is very similar to the other Shantae games (and other Metroidvanias), but it's semi-level based and there are no dungeons. This may turn off some, but it's not that big of a problem. The graphics are similar to DuckTales Remastered, probably because they run on the same engine. The art style takes on more of a western approach than Risky's Revenge and Pirate's Curse. I like it, though.			"

												Coming totally fresh into the series I have to say I enjoyed what I played. It's definitely not an amazing game, by any means, but it's good throughout, despite some issues.This is a 2-D platformer that succeeds in bringing in some Metroidvania elements, to a certain extent.Pros:- Self-aware humor.- Good level design.- Colorful graphics and vivid animations.- Lots of power-ups and transformations to play with.- Soundtrack is catchy and memorable (for the most part).- Doesn't overstay its welcome (around 7-7:30 hours, which is perfect for this type of game).Cons:- No map to see which places you've already explored in a specific level.- Way too much backtracking.- Obscure objectives.- Some transformations are redundant, serving purpose for only few specific locations.- Last stage has a rather big difficulty spike with poor checkpoint placement.- Last boss fight is painfully slow and annoying,Overall, the game is bigger than the sum of its parts. I did enjoy it and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good platformer with some solid exploration elements.It's a shame the last stage and boss weren't so good as it left me with a bitter taste, though.7/10			"

												I've always been a fan of the series, so it's hard for me to write a negative review.  So I won't :). Like most of the series it's short and sweet. I think I ran the first time in about 8 hours with a 100% collection.  There are a few items that make the game easy mode but they are towards the later half and by that point I was more focused on the story.There is a part in the begining where they mention that this game is a reboot/sequel/etc, and honestly I feel that is 100% true.This game has a strong feel of the classic Nintendo/Sega 2D platformers with a linearish story line (there are side missions and you do go back to the same maps a few times).  In light of that this game needs a controler so if you don't have one, I wouldn't bother getting it, but if the price is reasonable for you than I would defnitly play this game.  It is good to at least have played the other games in this series (and they are playable even this late) just to know the story line.  The only one that will be hard to play again is the gameboy one which started it all (if memory serves.)Anyway sorry for this scatter brain review, but I hope this helps			"

												As a backer of this game, I've played and beaten this game weeks ago, but forgot to review it so here's my pros and cons.Pros:-animation is top-notch-music is amazing-platforming is easy to master-lots of transformations to go back and collect to 100%Cons:-it feels incomplete as if they wanted to do more, but the budget wasn't possible-a step backward in terms of content wise via pirate's curse-constant reminder to save everytime you head to another area. It's annoying.Both good and bad:-pretty easy to max out your abilities from the shop for some strange reason as you progress. Too easy to get money in a sense.-there are some transformations that are pretty much irrelevant although there are a few that literally breaks the game in certain areas(I'm talking to you ""bat"")Would I recommend this? Yes. It's cheap to buy and....no idea when new content comes........COMCEPT, INAFUNE, TAKE NOTES as a backer to that game, Mighty No.9.			"

												This is for me a difficult game to review â this was the first game I ever kickstarted back in the misty past of 2013, and I never believed for a moment that a 2D platformer would take three and a half years to materialise. With such a long time in development, backersâ expectations were high â Wayforward have a pedigree, and Iâve enjoyed every game theyâve ever produced. The Shantae games in particular are blessed with excellent production values, level design and waifus that are frankly off the hook.Itâs clear to me that those years in development were not spent productively. I completed the game with 100% items in under six hours, and Iâm fairly certain that it could easily be completed in half that. Of course length is not necessarily an indication of quality, as ur mum will attest â but the levels here are short and linear, so much so that there is no map screen. Some levels donât even feel finished, and considering the small number of them and the extensive development time thatâs prettyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥poor. Most of the levels need to be revisited to find items crucial for advancing the story, which is a transparent way of lengthening the dismal play time. Backtracking is of course a metroidvania staple, but here it feels forced and unnecessary.In terms of abilities, transformations are back after an absence in Pirateâs Curse. There are certainly a wealth of transformations compared to previous games (each beautifully rendered and animated), but some of them barely have anything to do, and thereâs a surprising degree of redundancy. The level design also feels very flabby and under baked â certain abilities borderline break the game at the point they can be acquired, like the bat that allows you to pretty much skip half the desert level.Outside of the amazing visuals and music (and they really are best in class), Half Genie Hero is entirely inferior to Pirateâs Curse, and if Iâm being honest it doesnât even hold up particularly favourably to Riskyâs Revenge. Looking at Half Genie Hero in a vacuum, itâs a fun little platformer, and I canât deny I enjoyed my (short) time with it - however, compared to both its immediate predecessor and the stiff competition in the metroidvania market on Steam, it just isnât worth the fifteen quid.

												SPOILERS ALERTLike almost everyone here, I was eagerly waiting for the release of this game.I played every Shantae game in the series and and had many expectations for this last one,I was drooling when reading goals on Kikcstarter achieved one by one and naturally an ideal game picture wasdrawn in my head, a picture of a game that at least does not give in to it's previous incarnation, the brilliant Shantae and the Pirate's Curse. A game with the budget of almost 800,000 USD. I have never been so wrong... GraphicsFrom the very first time I played Shantae, I loved the concept and dreamed it to become an HD.Partially my wishes became true in RR and PC but that only involved sprites, not the actual universe.I like the graphics in HGH, it looks refreshing, though somewhat lacking in magic previous games had.I especially like the the job devs did on some of the Shantae's forms such as Mermaid and Spider, they look adorable. Some of my complaints lie in character animations, they are almost noexistent. Whatever happens during a dialogue, Sky is smiling happily, Risky dances, Bolo remains pokerface etc. It especially strikes your eye during a scene when Shantae turns dark and they come for help. I don't think it is a very difficult job to change a facial expression since it's HD and it would contribute greatly to a scenes' emotional impact. Music Music is wonderful. Kaufman knows his job well. Plot This is what actually disappoints me and what makes me give the game a thumb down.During the whole course of the game an impression stuck with me that devs had some great ideas which they failed (or didn't want) to implement for some reason. The plot seems rushed, teared and incompleted. No character development at all.New charactes appear to be tossed away right after their debut. Main Shantae friends could have more impact on the story. I'll give an example.- In the very first stage - mermaid falls, Bolo catches up to Shantae and complains he is always left out of her adventures.It was a great reference to the previous game but unfortunately it didn't go anywhere.There is a couple of funny moments with him in this episode, but after that he doesn't play any significant role at all.- The same thing with Rotty, I have an impression the devs had no idea how to insert her into the plot and just got away by giving her some nominal role. Abner and Poe are introduced and forgotten.- An episode with Shantae taken over by dark magic just cried for a fight with her dark self or an extra level ""inside her"",don't get me wrong, the thing her friends coming to her rescue is great but still a lot of potential is lost.- The new ""villain"" Holly was downright pathetic. Her reasons ridiculous, dialogues far-fetched, character - bad guy cliche. It was a real challenge to beat the boss with a palm on my face. - Moreover I was negatively suprised when I discovered it was actually a ""bonus chapter"" (along with the cape crustacean) inserted in the story because the kickstarter goal was achieved. Would would be left of the game without those? Bonus chapter should be BONUS and usually after you BEAT the game or can be completed optionally, but here it is an integral part of the story. I don't oppose this approach, just don't call it BONUS. Call it: ""Initially we planned to make the game 4 hours long, but since you funded it we will make it 8"".- The game has two endings and they differ by a couple of lines. If the whole genie realm was destoyed, Shantae will say something like: ""Well, that's a bummer."" and Mimic like: ""Well, maybe it wasn't"". Yes, I know it is a kind fairy-tale and there is no place for heavy dramatic moments but this very ending should motivate a player to search for a better one, but it doesn't.DifficultyToo casual. It does give you some challenge in the beginning, but once you have a bikini and 4+ hearts you dont really care to avoid attacks at all. Some people complained the last boss to be very difficult, but when you have invincibility magic what difficulty are you talking about??? I really like easy games, when I don't have to smash break the gamepad and just enjoy the gameplay, but there must be balance between difficulty and enjoyability, which this game definitely lacks.Conclusion.I, as a fan of the series, am very disillusioned because the potential the series had was destroyed by this game.Maybe the DLCs will brighten things up a bit but we'll have to pay for them which highlights the desire to only earn money, not caring much about their product. I'll repeat myself, as I was going through the game it seemed to me the devs had great ideas but right after the beginning they decided to save budget, which I don't understand. They raised twice they pledged + income from release, did they only care to make it ""ok"" but not ""great""? Well, it was just my personal opinion, there are tons of positive reviews, so I probably just dramatized a lot.Agree or not? Comments are welcome. "

												Once again WayForward have delivered a wonderful adventure. Though different in structure, Half-Genie Hero retains its predecessors' exploration-heavy gameplay, encouraging players to revisit and eke out every secret from its varied levels. The move to hand-drawn HD visuals worried me at first glance, but in motion it's utterly charming and the attention to detail is excellent. Music maintains the very high standard of the series, and our lovable cast of heroes and rogues drive the lighthearted story full steam ahead.Though not a challenging game by any means, Half-Genie Hero keeps the player on their toes with its abundance of secrets and a dash of precision platforming. The highest recommendation.			"

Product received for free
												I've seen Shantae and the Pirate's Curse a couple of years ago and I thought ""that's a pretty sweet game"". Then I heard about WayForward making a new Shantae game. That got me excited about how would this new release would be.I got Shantae Half-Genie Hero as a friend's christmas gift, and needless to say I was really really happy. Not only because I got a gift from a friend, but also because I was really into getting this game. That turn out to be the best gift I received in years!The HD Graphics are amazing! Never thought an 2D platformer could look so good and so fluid (even for my not-suited for game laptop). Which just makes me wonder how much better it would be if I had a better pc.The story is quite interesting, with lots of puns, gags, 4th wall breaking, etc. Never taking away the immersion of the player from the game.Gameplay, which is the most important (imo) is as fluid as the graphics and animations. The challenge of the game is not too simple, not too difficult, it's just right for a non-hardcore platformer. The teleport mechanics are SO SO handy, since there's a lot of sidetracking to do, which could've make the game a bit tiresome without it. So useful.My only complaining (if so), would be that the game seems a bit too short. Which is way Im quite anxious for the DLC.In resume, probably one of my favorite games in my steam library (if not my favorite). So worth it, So recommend it.			"

												Pros:+Same characters, same world, but in beautiful 2.5D+â¥â¥â¥â¥ing AMAZING music, Jake Kaufman does it again.+Really great level design+Transformations are really fun+Monster girlsNeutral:*It's definitely way easier than before (I put this as neutral because some people might want this) but I thought that it was a little saddening that there was a significant decrease in difficutlyCons:-It's a little short (I 100% it in 5 hours, less than half that what it took me in Pirate's Curse)-Continuation of above: The levels are way smaller than in previous games. While the individual areas are bigger so there's less loading between screens there's less going on in each level.-Some of the Transformations are poorly utliziedI'd also like to add that the ""true ending"" you get by collecting the four clues to get the Polarizer is kind of anti-climactic. It just ends and we don't see a final interaction between Shantae and Risky but it's possible that this was intentional because we'll see more in the eventual DLC modes that are supposed to come 2017 and onwards.Verdict:While the game is great in it's own right and a good evolution for the series, I can't help but feel that it doesn't quite top Pirate's Curse which was a really amazing game. It's still a great game, solid 8.5 from me. If you like the series or like 2D platformers then play this game, it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing great.Also, Neo Burning Town is the best version of Burning Town.

												The fourth game in the Shantae series is another instant classic. While not quite as good as Pirate's Curse, it offers snappy controls, plenty of movement and combat options, and a solid (if episodic) storyline with the series' trademark adorable pitch-dark humor.Shantae herself controls as wonderfully as always. Once again possessed of her genie powers, she learns transformations from each stage or from hidden items. Most of them, such as the elephant (which can crush blocks) and the mermaid (which can swim freely underwater) are primarily movement-focused, and open up new areas of each stage.Ah, yes ... stages. And therein lies the only problem with Shantae: Half-Genie Hero. In previous games of the series, Shantae would travel across the land, face a number of challenges, and then open up a dungeon for exploration. These dungeons were very much in the Metroidvania tradition, and navigating them successfully was the game's primary intellectual challenge.In Half-Genie Hero, the dungeons have been removed entirely; at the point in each stage when you'd be unlocking them, you go directly to the boss fight instead. The stages are mostly slightly longer than before, but not really enough to make up for the loss. A couple of them -- Main Street and a late-game castle -- remain downright puny.This makes the game's other negative more serious: the amount of BACKTRACKING. In the previous games, you mostly returned to old areas to seek out power-ups like life bar powerups or caches of treasure. While those are still here, some of the stages have little corners and nooks that contain MANDATORY items, including a transformation without which you can't even enter the last level! It honestly seems like you're intended to replay every stage to date whenever you get a new movement ability, or else take an amount of notes on obstacles that would put a JRPG to shame. (And even that wouldn't help in a couple of places -- I only found two crucial items by exhaustive searching.)All of this shouldn't put you off the game, though. Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is linear, sure, but you'll still get many hours of sweet gameplay for your admission fee. It's absolutely worth the price, even if it doesn't quite live up to its immediate predecessor.			"

			Shantae Half Genie Hero Review! To stop Risky's quest for booty, you'll need to shake Shantae's! Shantae Half Genie Hero is the latest in the belly dancing beauty's tales of half genie heroics!		

+Gameplay is smooth and fluid+Graphics are super slick+Music is catchy as all hell+Great level design reminescent of 8/16-bit Capcom titles+Interesting enemies with slightly more complex patterns than typical of the series+Amazing set pieces and boss encounters-Bikini Armor, Magic Tiara and the ridiculous number of heart containers break the difficulty utterly. Don't go into this game expecting a challenge past the first couple of levels if you aren't willing to handicap yourself on purpose. -Character development has taken a sharp back seat compared to Pirate's Curse, even regressing in the case of characters like Risky Boots and Rotty Tops-Story lacks a strong connecting thread and it feels more like a series of unrelated episodes strung together-I honestly can't remember a single puzzle-I can't put enough quotation marks around the word ""dungeon"" so I won't even try-At least for me, the frame rate stutters when I go through a level as fast as I possibly canThis is the least Metroidvania Shantae game that I've played, so keep that in mind. If you play these games for things like Risky's Revenge's Hypno Tower or Pirate's Curse's Cackle Tower, you should be warned that this game is more like Mega Man X than Super Metroid. That said, it excels at that sort of level design and I welcome the change... at least for now.But yeah, as many issues as I had with the game, it was a load of fun and I'd wholeheartedly recommend it.

Shantae; A Great Game With Problems (NO SPOILERS)         As a New commer to the franchise, I found this to be a fun and interesting entry to the platforming genre. The game overall was a blast to play and I enjoyed almost every second of it..... almost all of it, dispite me enjoing this game a lot there are Two main problems with the game. Firstly, the difficulty is somewhat all over the place for example I found the game to be pretty easy till the last level where there was a huge spike in difficulty as to where the rest of the games platforming was simple to requiring a little bit of skill and finesse. Lastly, the game has some pretty bad glitches and game breaking exploits. the worst glitch I encountered was when I was about to finish the fourth level I missed a platform and died, when I respawned the game freaked out and I belive Shantae had  spawned out of the level then the game crashed; When the game was lanched again I had lost all my saved data. Besides that glitch there were a few minor ones like getting stuck in terrain and getting in to areas with no way to get out with out going to the level select screen. there is also a really bad exploit that lets you to unlock every spell and upgrade that is purchasable after you beat the second level. Other then those problems I loved the rest of the game Expecially the music. So If I had to rate this game out of ten, It would be a 7/10 overal a great game with a decent amount of problems.			"

												This game is really cool. although it is not the best game, to which i prefer Pirates Curse overall, I enjoyed the game. the only problem i could notice were some characters and items felt uncharateristic or useless (like holly) and there is a glitch when you jump and use the mouse bite. But the game is still a hella fun. New places, Old friends, and a fresh feel. they could have worked on it a little more to improve some stuff, but i still enjoyed it. Can't wait for the DLC.			"

												SUMMARY: A fun, colorful metroidvaina-esque platformer with a lot of personality.  Though heir to a fan favorite series, it stands out pretty well on its own and shows a lot of crafting.  There's a few issues of polish and levels of difficulty, but the overal experience is very enjoyable.I Kickstarted this game.  Not because I was actually into the series, but as a lot of friends were, and were thrilled to see it returning.  I figured ""what the heck"" and tossed some money into the pot.Fast forward to now, and the results of a non-fan of the game?  Pretty damn good.Shantae is a platform-heavy metroidvania type game.  Start in a town, go to various areas on missions.  Complete missions, find new abilities, return to other areas to find stuff and use abilities, repeat.  Unlock new areas and new treasures.  It's a standard formula we all love.So let's see how it breaks down.PRESENTATION: The game is colorful and fun, with great graphics and soundtrack.  Characters have plenty of personality.  The game's look and feel is excellent.GAMEPLAY: Gameplay is very old-school and there's a heavy emphasis on exploring the environment and platforming timing. If you're not ready for it, it may be a bit of a shock.  When you ""get"" it then the game really comes together.CHARACTER GROWTH: Shantae basically A) finds new dances to transform into things, B) Buys spells and some combat upgrades, B) gets increased health.  It's not exactly complicated - the dances are the important part as they give you access to new areas.PUZZLES: Though the need to re-return to areas can be annoying,the different abilities you unlock make them easier to navigate, and help you access hidden areas.  A few times you'll have an ""aha"" moment and figure out how to solve something and get a real rush from it.STORY: The story seems to be more of a ""Shantae's greatest hits gets the band back together"" so you're not getting Game of Thrones or Dragon's Age here.If there's a flaw to the game, its some of it feels a tad disjointed, from varied difficulty to a grand adventure suddenly turning into a fetchquest that feels like it should have been optional.  It's a minor concern, but it did stand out for me.So do you buy it?1) If you're a fan, judging by the game's quality AND the fans I know you either should or already did, and I'm shocked you read this far.2) If you like colorful old-school patformers you'll probably enjoy this.3) It'd make a GREAT gift for a friend who liked old-school platformers.Who shouldn't buy it?1) If you don't like platformers, really, don't.  This game will make you angry.2) If you're not up for a game that involves repeating levels several times and poking around in their corners. "

												I've only discovered the Shantae games recently, seeing this game released on Steam a few days ago. I decided to buy Pirates Curse out of curiosity, and boy was I pleasantly surprised. It's so weird that I had never heard of this game before, despite how fun its gameplay is and how charming the world & characters were. After beating Pirate's Curse, I got 1/2 Hero. I had some reservations since it is a Kickstarter funded game but this isn't the the kind of Kickstarter game that disappoints. This one delivers pretty well. It is still fun to play, the character & world is still as charming, the soundtrack is sweet, the art style is much more striking (though I don't see why the character portraits shown in conversations in this game aren't as pretty as those in Pirate's Curse, but whatever), the LD changes still work (fewer and bigger levels with some backtracking, though the backtracking doesn't feel like a chore), overall a nice experience. Overall I am really impressed, and still kind of mad that I didn't know about this wonderful series before.As a side note in the menu there is a play mode that is coming soon (which I assume by the darkened silhouette with the hat that this is a Risky Boots mode). So when it comes out, keep in mind this review only covers the main game - Normal Mode & Hero Mode.			"

												It's still a good game but I feel like the kickstarter model didn't do too much good to the game because it's a step back from Pirate's Curse. Personally I'd say Risky's Revenge is even a little bit better.On the bright side they did progress from pixel art and have what I think is a great engine for the game. So perhaps there's some great potential in the future. The graphics, music and general movements are on point, although there are some minor bugs causing the game to stop for me from time to time. So overall it still plays great like a Shantae game. You get a lot of dances and the typical magic, which is very fun.Where it gets insufficient and I suspect may be due to the kickstarter forcing them to implement so many elements to the game and thus not having enough time left, is the content and the story. The writing, first of all, seems a bit off. Shantae isn't a story focused game by any means but I thought this game story wise is especially shallow and did not portray the main characters as well as they can. Content wise you have so many powers and forms but there is very little content specifically designed for them, in some cases only one zone or none at all. Also, to inflate the content the devs added a lot of backtracing the the zones and since this game is no longer metroidvania style that's also not as good an experience as in previous games where revisiting zones and doing challenge dungeons can be so much fun. Another issue is boss difficulty tuning-- the later bosses are a joke unless you restrict yourself to not using any magic or item at all.I think if this game was a bit more polished story wise and had 50% more content (that's not backtracing) it would have been great. As it is I still can't hate it because it's still Shantae but I don't regret not joining the kickstarter either.			"

												Just what I expected. A cheerful and near flawless platformer, where you are, again, in perfect control of your character. The puzzles and boss fights are  challenging, especially if you're new to the series, which is a good thing! If you played the previous titles, you won't notice a large difference, but won't get bored aswell.The zones' enemies now update, once you revisit them, reflecting that you've beaten the boss of that level.Lots and lots of transformations. WayForward was like: you asked for more transformations? THERE U GO!The playstyle is a mix between the original and Risky's Revenge, regarding the power-ups and weapons, making Pirate's Curse a unique experience. MOST IMPORTANTLY: The items (relics) you buy can make the game a walk in the park, but they can be disabled and you can define your own difficulty. There are some minor tech flaws, which I hope they get patched soon, other than that, I really recommend it. If you're a fan of the series, want a good platformer or another metroidvenia done right, then this is for you.			"

You don't need, although I am warmly recommending it, to have played the previous titles to enjoy this.The art quality (music and graphic) is top notch, offering something that the predecessor could not, yet you can still feel the love the developers have put into making the game. The humor is great and the animations are done very well.I really think that Wayforward needs more attention, as they have crafted an oriental and spunky heroine like we have never seen before.I wish this series to keep on rocking! As long as it will, I will be playing Shantae :)			"

												Disclaimer: I'm a kicstarter backer and I was able to play this game early. I completed my first playthrough on December 19th. There are no spoilers in this review.I have been a long time fan of the Shantae series, the unique charm of the protagonist combined with the world the stories are set in made it for a fun and unique experience every time. The series falls into what qualifies as a Metroidvania. All games encourage backtracking and exploration as you gain more powers and mobility, the rewards being more story and of course, a higher completion. To my knowledge the latest two games even have multiple endings determined by your completion rate.Some history:---------------The first game in the series called ""Shantae"" came out late in the Game Boy Color's life (2002) and was a superbly animated game for the time. In my opinion it is also the most difficult game in the series so far as the first hour or two before you gain more abilities can be brutal. In this game, Shantae was set out to stop her ever present rival, the pirate called Risky Boots and her horde of Tinkerbats. The physical version of this game is quite rare nowadays. Thankfully, if you own a (New) 2/3DS/XL you can play this game via Virtual Console.The second game ""Risky's Revenge"" came out much later (2010) for the DS/DSi and was a worthy follow up that saw Shantae once again facing off against Risky Boots as the pirate lady sought revenge for the events in the first game. This game is still available for the DS series of portables and a PC version has been released as well, available right here on Steam.The third game came out in 2014 and is called ""Pirate's Curse"". This is the first game in the series to provide some voice acting, but also features a plot where Risky Boots seeks Shantae's help in defeating a foe more dangerous than her. Nevertheless I think this is the best game in the series so far. This game came out on a lot of platforms, including PC. The 3DS version has some nice depth effects as well.----------------Does it mean that Half-Genie Hero is an inferior game? Not at all! From a personal perspective I think Pirate's Curse has a better story and higher stakes (although even that could be argued as there is a lot at stake in HGH too, plot wise). But the gameplay, graphics and music are superb as expected from the experienced team at WayForward as well as the designs of Matt and Erin Bozon (who created Shantae) and the music of my favourite games musician, Jake ""Virt"" Kaufman.That said, in HGH, Shantae is once again out to face off against Risky Boots who seeks to abuse the knowledge she gained during ""Pirate's Curse"".  The controls are good and the storytelling is funny in the right places. Transformation magic returns once more (it was absent in ""Pirate's Curse"") but has been simplified to speed up game play.If you wonder if you should play all games in chronological order...that depends on you! While each game can be played on its own without knowing the earlier stories, there are some small nods here and there to events from previous games. Even so, HGH makes sure you are introduced to each character and immediately know what they are like.There were some problems in the version I played and I expect they will get ironed out after the game is released tomorrow. While not breaking, some powers can be exploited to make sections of the game extremely trivial. If you happen to find such a way, consider challenging yourself!All in all, it took me the listed time as of this review (11.7) hours to finish the game first time through. I had to peruse some youtube videos to find some items I missed, but the game does clue you in . I recommend talking to everyone after each plot event!-----------------TL;DR: Great game, as polished as expected from the creators. Personally I think the story in the previous game was better, but that's my opinion and doesn't detract from the gameplay enjoyment. "

												A very enjoyable little Metroidvania platformer. The art and music are excellent, the character designs are cute and fun, and the gameplay is solid.For those who have never played a Shantae title, the premise is fairly unique: You play a half-genie bellydancing heroine who fights enemies using her magical prehensile hair and magical dances that allow her to transform into a dozen-odd different animals.The game, unlike most previous Shantae titles, is split into distinct levels, which vary between being fairly linear to fairly open-ended, though both sorts allow for a fair amount of exploration and discovery. This division does make getting 100% much easier, as the level select lets you know what's left to find in a given level, so rather than having to hunt through the entire overworld you just have to explore on level, which is rather nice.It's not flawless, the story is largely an afterthought, the jokes can fall flat, and some of the transformations see essentially no use, but the game is definitely fun and very much worth a look.It took me about 7 hours to 100% the Shantae campaign (an additional campaign where you play as her arch-nemesis, Risky Boots, is being worked on), so this isn't going to occupy you for months, but that does make it comparable to Super Metroid for the amount of content, which is fine by me.

												I enjoy the Shantae Series, yet can't say this iteration is a step up. The only thing going for this game is the upgrade in graphics (Completely Objective) and that it continues the story for Shantae the character.The story in this game was weak. It does however give a nod to what of the main characters mentioned before, and they did just that. ( Trying not to spoil the game here).There are far more transformations in the games, which is nice. Say, we have 6 transformations in all, 3 would be base abilities, while the other 3 would be upgrades to those previous. Like a level 1 fireball that shoots 1 fireball to a level 2 fireball that shoots 2. Some transformations are oddly specific and have no other use to them.Dances is what Shantae does, yet she does only one dance for all the transformations. Which was sad to see.... I liked where she had many dance moves (animations) when she would transform.It seems art styles change with each game, and I am a huge fan of the Pirate Curse art the most. It had personality. I would blame transformations for taking up production time on making the conversation art better. Puzzles are nearly nonexistant, or way too easy. The game was fairly easy. I did not have to worry about dying due to lose of hearts, well, neither did I in the last game....There is no map this time, and finding things was easy. Some items made the game too easy. You can turn them off if you think that would present a challenge. Then if thats the case, don't look for items.Sadly, I would have rather played Pirates Curse again for the ingaging characters, side quests, and other such stuff.The good part is that they made it easier for you to travel where you want faster with a travel dance and a whistle to travel from world to world. Save points arent the usual, where you find the guy and choose to save. Each section of a level requires you to make the choice. In case you die or are trying to do a certain achievement this shines. A Little.I still recommend this game. I wished I got wind of the Kickstarter so I could support them. I want them to continue making more Shantae games, but I think they need to look back at Pirates Curse, which I think to be the best of the series.Platforming is really weak. I'm not sure if this game was trying to cater to some group that thought the platforming wasn't important. They even threw in a small castle level with those detestable magic doors that warp you all around.I feel the lack of funds and the over-ambition of making so many transformations has watered down the level design for puzzles and more animations for the characters has made this game not up to par.

												To start off, if Steam would let me I would say I'm between mixed and not into recommending it.It's a good game, but honestly not as good as its predecessors. It opts for linear level design and world design, the entire exploration aspect is gone. But for some reason, the game kept backtracking. As soon as you finish the second level you need to go through the entire first level and kill 30 enemies in one respawn area to progress. If you bought the warp spell you can just do a a bit of one third of the level and warp out, but you have to buy it, and you'll likely instead buy a damage or attack speed upgrade first. It really seems like something you can just do, like select and area of the level from a menu or something along those lines...The game itself controls nicely and has great art, animation, and music, but with lackluster bosses and seemingly bland level design, it really doesn't shine well.The third boss is what did it to me. It's such a boring mess. First of all, it's the worst type of boss, one where you have to wait for it to go through it's silly and long attack pattern before doing one hit to it (you have to hit it four times). It's also a cake walk to dodge the attacks. Personally, one of my favorite parts of side-scrolling platformers tends to be the bosses, so this really was a deal-breaker for me.If you dislike platformers being less linear, I suppose you could play this game.If not, you should rather play Shantae and the Pirates Curse and maybe the other games if you're up to it.This one is just too easy and tedious, and honestly, lacking in good game sense. I was really looking forward to this game and bought it early, but the direction it went in is dissatisfying to say the least. I'll buy it again when it goes on sale, most likely, but for now I'm refunding it.			"

												Shantae: Half-Genie Hero just doesn't live up to the other games in the series in my opinion. It's not a bad game per say but I would only recommend this one for people that have children... the series kept getting easier ever since the first game but this one had a very unsatisfying level of challenge. The challenge came only from instant-death autoscroll segments which leave you more frusterated than satisfied. The combat is a joke in Shantae's latest outing... with the huge stock of food you can hold I never felt threatened by a boss... for the last few bosses I didn't even care about getting hit I just maximized my damage hitting them and healing when needed. Some of the attacks might have been somewhat fun to learn the patterns for but.. it was never necessary. It's nice to see a return of the transformations to Shantae but some of them feel pretty pointless (Mainly the spider form which is only used for a couple parts and essentially replaced later)I really wanted to like this game because the Shantae character and theme of the games are so fun, lighthearted and bouncy... but the gameplay this time around just didn't let that happen.

												I just wanted this game to END.The latest Shantae is the 4th in the series and is a fully crowdfunded game.  The self destructive mayor fires  Shantae (again) and she must solve a series of problems and fetch quests to regain Scuttle Town's favor.This game does a few new things.  First, the game is less like a metroidvania and more like Mega Man X.  The game no longer has a map, and instead has a sereis of levels with nooks and crannies that can only be accessed with new upgrades.This game has the nicest production values of the franchise.  Characters are now fully 3d cel shaded, looking like Guilty Gear Xrd without the deliberate frame rate reduction, so all animations and movement are silky smooth.  The soundtrack is phenomenal, including electronic and funk beats.The game starts off very strong, with wonderful humor, action and boss fights.  But as the game goes long, two things happen.  First, the action is bogged down between fetch quests.  For those who don't know, Shantae always has humorous fetch quests which depend on key items that you will not expect to need, recieve, or give.  In this game they are easily the most numerous.  You will run around in circles checking if your latest upgrade will work in ""that one spot"" you couldn't reach before.  If only you could remember where it was: you have no map!  Second, the difficulty of the game PLUMMETS.  This is easily the lowest difficulty game in the franchise.  In the time I spent running around in circles, I fully upgraded my attack and attack speed.  In the midgame, you will find heart containers like candy, to the point you can ignore enemies and damage to a silly degree.This was the most tiresome and boring Shantae game I played.  Play Momodora or any other intense action game and just youtube the boss fights instead.			"

												If you're looking for a deep story, great levels and a big world, this is not your game. Half-Genie Hero has more in common with Megaman than it does with its previous entries in the Shantae Series, while trying to hold to its original roots, and somewhat failing at it. Where HGH succeeds the most at is in its fidelity. This game is really colourful, the animations are bouncy and lively, it's just very pleasant to look at. The soundtrack is really good too, however, I do find it to sound REALLY flat due to its really high volume. After downloading several soundtracks from the composer, Jake Kaufman, that seems to be an ongoing issue with his masterings. So if the game sounds too loud when you first start it up, it might catch you off guard and I defnitely recommend lowering your volume.When it comes to being a sequel, the game improves a few things from it's closer sibling, Risky's Revenge, is the dancing system and overall powerups. The new system implemented in this one works better as you only have to press the dance button and then choose which transformation you want by pressing a direction. It works well and if you think it's too slow, you can even get a powerup to make the dance faster. In fact, HGH is probably the fastest feeling entry so far thanks to its responsiveness.Probably my personal favorite part of the game when it comes to gameplay are the first four stages... when played linearly. They are quick, action-packed and are quite fun to traverse with fun bosses (Except for the last two...).The first part where game falls apart to me when they want you to backtrack to stages to get specific items. It wouldn't be a huge issue if the stages introduced new things but they just don't. The ''new paths'' are usually one or two rooms, which more often than not, will either be coursed through in less than a minute, or are big and open with nothing in them, just to pad things out. It gets really monotous to since you have to do exactly that, several times in a row to even progress to the next stage.The second part is actualy the final third of the game. The stages feel unfinished, with even less original set pieces, hazards, especially when two key characters are haphazardly placed in the second to last stage, with no introduction. In fact, a lot of characters in HGH are completely forgetable and have barely to no development at all and when the game ends, it really feels unsatisfying. Now if you factor the rather dull design, and combine what is essentially the game breaking transformation, the Harpie, you get a final stage that is insultingly easy. Why? The stage was designed for you to take advantage of a couple of transformations. The Issue? The harpy can fly over the majority of them. There were only two counts where I switched to the monkey. This makes some rather elaborate traps completely useless.The final boss and endings are not much better. First, my game crashed once when I defeated the first phase of the boss. Second, I skipped the cutscene as the fade to black was still on the screen, leaving it black and making the fight impossible (I've encountered several glitches so far, some worse than others). Third, if I am either regular Shantae, Mermaid Shantae or Harpie Shantae, the background of the second phase will never rotate like it should and screw with the movement of the boss' attacks. FOURTH, the final phase has an attack that circles the whole arena, and it makes no sound effects. If it does, I can't hear it. It also blends with all the other assets during the fight due to their colours. FIFTH, the endings are almost identical, regardless if you get the ''best'' or ''regular'' ending. It's  just not satisfying at all and feels slapped together.The final slap in the face to me from this game, is the fact the DLC will have to be paid for non-backers. Considering how barebones the game felt, along with the lackluster two final stages AND the full price of this game, I flatout cannot consider even getting the DLC. I feel like they should have been part of the game ''and the price'' from the very start.If Shantae Half Genie Hero was not forcing mandatory exploration and padding and was more like Megaman, as its stages are clearly focused on being much more linear than the areas from the previous entries of the series, this would be so much better. However, as it stands, and WITHOUT THE DLC AND AT FULL price. I can't really recommend this game unless you're a die hard fan. If you want a significantly better experience, go get Shantae and The Pirate's Curse.If the DLC releases and they have a bundle for the launch price of the game and cut the standalone game's price, then it might be worth checking out. Maybe....			"

												The worst of the three modern Shantae games - by FAR. Please hear me out.The game is way too easy. You quickly become ridiculously overpowered. After less than half through the game I didn't even care about taking damage. You practically never run out of hearts, and if you happen to be close to death you have lots of potions, magic, pickups, and food to restore health. You can turn off the upgrades that you've acquired, but that should NEVER be required to make the game sufficiently challenging. Really bad game design.Edit: People are talking about a hardcore mode. But that doesn't justify that the ""normal"" mode feels like beginner difficulty, especially since the previous games were really hard in their normal mode.The story is very forgettable. The plot progression is very often ridiculous, as the developers couldn't come up with believable ways to acquire key items. It just feels very rushed.The humor isn't at as funny as it was in previous games.Way too many transformations. Some of them are really boring, and some of them are almost never used apart from that one single stage you acquired them at.The charming pixel art is gone. It was one of the things that made the Shantae series stand apart from other platformer games, but now even that is gone.Not really the hardcore metroidvania style from the previous games. Really easy to acess the hidden areas.Very easy boss fights. Very easy platforming. No charming characters. The game is very short.Really bland game. Wish I hadn't bought it.3/10			"

												Shantae's newest outing is a decent game, it looks and sounds great but it's just not worth the 20 Euro price. I managed to finish the game in a few hours. That's really bad, considering that it took me weeks to finish Pirate's Curse. Presumably Risky Mode is coming out at some point but it's going to cost extra (ANOTHER 20 Euros). To make matters worse the game doesn't seem to work with my Joypad and I had to set up Joy2Key in order to play it from Steam. Unforgivable for such a pricey game.Still, I am not asking for my money back. I am a big fan of the developers, and I want them to keep making games.My Advice: If you like Shantae, buy Pirate's Curse instead. It's a far better and more fulfulling game. Or wait for a price reduction/sale.			"

The right kind of funny stupid.Sound: The music matches the visuals, very spot on.Difficulty: The game is very easy, exept for one part with spikes which will leave you frustrated and confused.Repetition: You will aquire new powers and repeat a level with said new power to unlock new areas. This can be done right, but Shantae forces you to do too many times.Level Variety: There are a few short levels. Compared to games like Rayman, this feels very underwhelming in variety.Engine: You need to mess with the compatibility settings of the EXE (Disable DPI scaling) to get it working with high resolution displays.This is a game for the fans of the ""Shantae"" series, everyone else should avoid.

												I enjoyed all previous Shantae titles, but have been signifigantly dissapointed by this entry. The artstyle and writing are top-notch but the difficulty is all over the place. My most notable gripe with it is that dying then reloading your last save does not restore Shantae's health at all. This become the most infuriating during a slide obstacle section in Mermaid Falls, where I ended up going into the section (and saving) with only 1HP making it so touching anything would kill me instantly. With no options to load previous saves, I was left with the option to try and finish it without taking any damage, or to restart my entire save file, and play through the first hour of the game again.As of writing this I have died 45 times on that section (which is ridiculously long by the way) and have since dropped the game, and refunded it. If I had the option to start the stage from the beginning again so I could try to have more HP going into this, I'd likely keep playing because I could fix the problem, but I'm not interested in playing the entire beginning of the game again.If you don't like difficulty and are going into this for it's witty narrative and colorfull artstyle, this game isn't for you.

												Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a game that wastes my time and jerks me around. I have beaten this game to 100% and this is my review:The positives:-Good music, which will get repetitive as you replay levels over and over.-Pretty good visuals.The negatives:-Poorly thought out level design-Terrible controls for several different Shantae transformations.-Monkey Island style wacky nonsensical solutions to puzzles that make no sense.-Awful check point system that makes you replay entire levels/the worst part of a level over and over.-Forces you to constantly replay levels over and over as you unlock new powers which, in the end, does not feel satisfying but instead wastes your time.-Boring boss battles.-Terrible memeatic writing that is forced sounding and fan service feeling in general-Has kick starter âbacker-exclusiveâ content that cannot be bought at all by anyone who didnât get in early on the kick starter. This is anti-consumerism no matter how you try to spin it. This basically says to people who wanted to wait for a finished product and reviews, âyour money is worth less to us than those who backed itâ.  More on this at the bottom of the review.-Very little bang for your buck. I frustratingly played through this game in 8 hours, it is designed to be beaten in 4 hours. This is a 20 dollar game.Details of this filth:I have invented a new term just for this game, which upon reflection can be applied to a lot of bad games.This term is called, âMonkey Island solutionsâ what is a, Monkey Island solution you ask? It is when a game, not just point-n-click adventure games, ask you to perform a series of complicated tasks to do a simple objective but also in which none of the steps nor end result makes sense and cannot be deduced naturally. Some other people in the video game realm might call this, ârub the fish on everythingâ syndrome.Here is an example from this very game: you must get the power, as a mermaid, to shoot bubbles. How do you do this? Well, one of the villagers tells you that only âelderâ sea creatures know this power! Well look at that, in town suddenly is the Grandma Blobfish (which earlier you had to find two tickets for her grandkids to go see a magic carpet ride via killing gator enemies with magic you must grind money for to unlock until they drop âgator stakesâ to give to too villains for a ticket and that was only HALF of that quest).Ahem, the example:""We're gonna need you to get this blobfish a new hat so she can sing you a song and give you the mermaid shooting ability but to do that you must get the hat from a WACKY CHARACTER GUY that tells you to find ANOTHER WACKY CHARACTER GUY but to do that you first need to unlock the Mermaid form (several step subquest), combo into Harpy unlock (several step subquest), and figure out this cryptic clue that actually makes no sense (subquest to get clue)""Do you see how this is a problem, how it is unfun to deal with and why guides are so popular for games today? This game is entirely like this, the whole game.Letâs mention some gameplay; there is a point in this game in which you must control Shantae through a SPIKE MAZE using the WORST CONTROLLING form in the game, the Harpy. The harpy controls like a flappy bird clone but you can move forwards and backwards. She does not stop in midair, she always slightly moves forward which is a problem when this is happening:

See these two blocks? They are rotating around each other, and before them there are a series of three columns that block the entire way from ceiling to floor (the floor also kills you) and you must step in between the middle set of these spike walls as it opens to wait for the next to open; all doing this mind you while the harpy cannot hover in midair so you must constantly tap jump to flap while wiggling back and forth to not die in a space less than an 8th of your screen for a character that takes up 90% of said space you are safe. This section alone is so disgustingly made, so poorly thought out I almost quit the game right then and there; and this is at the very end of the game, right before the big finish. Oh right, for good measure they take you back to the start of the level if you die so ya know, have fun backtracking through the level to get up to the point you died, only to then die again on the very next trap you have no idea is coming.The examples I give above are not single instances, but throughout the entire game. This whole game is a huge mess of poorly thought out choices, obscure and often offensive puzzles, poor controls for multiple transformation forms, and a absolutely terrible check point system that will make you want to quit. Do not buy this game.Why backer exclusive content is anti-consumerism Backer exclusive content is anti-consumerism in pure form.Well fear not, for I shall explain; you see by offering 'backer-exclusive"" content the game devs are tempting you in parting with your money before a finished product is made. They are offering you promises for cash, this is anti-consumer.Pro-consumer is waiting for a finished, final product. If you are offered a chance to wait for a product, to see if you would like it and to experience reviews then you are in the clear and so are the devs. Backer-exclusives can be grouped in with other scummy practices devs/publishers often use. Here is an example:""If you buy this game now, you will get access to X thing! No one else will get access to X thing because they bought it AFTER the game was released."" Can you name that anti-consumer practice? That's right, preorder bonuses! Buy now, get product later! Secure money now for nothing, offer a game that might be as good we promise ;). Sound familiar? In the above sentence replace ""after the game is released"" with ""after the game is funded"". Nice.A quick question to people that will come shilling in because of the bottom of this review: please riddle me this, how did games get made before kick starter?How did a game get produced without the backing of a publisher, triple A or otherwise? How did indie games come into this world without the hand holding of kick starter? Through the blood, sweet, and tears of game devs everywhere. Cave story came to exist and became an excellent game as it was done by a man in his spare time.			"

												Honestly, great game with cute character design, nice graphic and beautiful OST.But, as a action game  newbie, the level design make me mad. The third level with a sand worm is a big nightmare and waste me 2 hours but still cannot beat it. Unfrendly level design is the reason I don't recommand this game if you are a action game newbie.But, still I like the character, so cute.....(That was the reason I bought this game)			"

												WayForward either have not learned from their experience in game design or they're made this game so unfairly difficult to compensate for it's short length and by the numbers progression.Behind all the wimsy character and beautiful animation is a poor excuse for a platforming game, simple platforms made difficult by dodgy movement, sticky controls and a frustrating checkpoint system.I hope WayForward hang their game design coat and move stricktly to animation, because not a single game they made is fun to play.This is the only game the made me ragequit to the point of throwing my controller.

												Pros:+ Great Metroidvania gameplay+ Beautiful graphics and art style+ Lots of fanserviceCons:- Too short- Very weak story- Too pricey- Scummy DLC practices- Too easy- 3 years in development- Too linear- Most transformations serve just one purpose and become useless afterwards.- Dancing breaks the pace of the gameplay. It should have a shorcut to transformations that bypass dancing.Conclusion:Good mediocre game but not worth the initial price. Wait to drop to at least half of it. Do not buy any DLC, show these scummy developers that gamers have standards.			"

												A game with beautiful, energetic aesthetics and unadventurous design.+ Aesthetics in general are sharp, cartoony and juicy. The animations with Wrench are particularly fun.+ Factory stage has a nice narrative progression.+ Stage progression is more arcade-style than metroidvania-style, which is a fun change for the series.+ New-form-containing genie rooms remind me of Rayman (PS1), and make understanding the basic utility of new forms very easy.+ The writing is fun and self-deprecating. Most of the dialogue has great gameplay utility as well, guiding the player with hints (though the bolded text takes some of the fun out of parsing dialogue for the important bits).+ VO is sprinkled throughout the game and contributes to the personality of the characters and dialogue. It seems like a clever (and budget friendly) way to equip our imaginations with a little more material.- The megaman-style disappearing blocks are played out, and a little overused in some of the level designs.- The dance selection screen is colorful, but has an odd timing-element that automates the cycling of menus. More than once I mis-selected as the menu switched at just the wrong time.- Stages tend to introduce a new mechanic, but they don't seem particularly novel so far. This level features something you can climb / hang from (Donkey Kong Country). This level features wind that pushes you (Megaman). This level features...enemy spawners? Levels don't feel surprising after the novelty of new visuals wear off.- The monkey form feels weirdly sticky when climbing on walls. It can feel awkward when I try to climb up over the side of a wall, or transform back into human form. The time lost performing attempting these acts often leads to cheap damage in combat situations.- projectile-wielding enemies tend to shoot from off-screen, which can lead to cheap damage when playing an area for the first time. - The Wilbur worm escape features level design that essentially dooms the player if they proceed up the wrong path. The choice is arbitrary the first time a player sees it, so these deaths are very frustrating.- Game over screen should have more character in a game as colorful as this. Players may see it several times, so why not try some arkham-asylum-style flavor dialogue?- The hitbox of Shantae's human form seems a bit large. Shrinking it a bit within the actual sprite raises the odds for a daring, exciting dodge. Players who get used to the smaller hitbox can use it to make combat faster, more risky, and more showy- Characters often animate during cutscenes and dialog, but without any zoom, this easily goes unnoticed (some dramatic zoom wouldn't seem out of place in a story this goofy).- Monkey form seems to have far more general utility than the crab form.- I wish there was an overarching villain to give the story a visible destination. As it stands, the magnet contraption ties things together a bit, but the player isn't even told how many pieces remain, or what the final design looks like (unless I'm missing something-- perhaps there was a way to look at the blueprints before handing them to uncle).- The liberal use of VO really gives the characters...character, but we don't need Shantae revealing the high-level strategy to each boss phase. It takes away the fun a bit, and most are simple enough to simply not need it.- There seems to be little difference between a fall-death and a game over. The latter should be a more impactful fate than the former, yet the latter typically places the player at the exact same location as the former, but with full health! Often, it is the better option, as being forced to restart an area without having health replenished sometimes sets the player up for quick, highly-probable (and frustrating) failure.- Bosses don't seem to emphasize new abilities much, in the way a Legend-of-Zelda boss would. While LoZ bosses may go overboard with the way they require stage-specific abilities, the bosses here feel a little rote-- all they seem to require is a bit of hair-whipping and jumping, for the most part. Mechanics never really come together, or combine in interesting ways during these fights, and they never really feel exciting as a result.Thank you for your effort on this game, and best of luck moving forward!

Before you read my Review: Im a long time gamer AND played the whole Shantae series. I dont only look at the game and say ""oh look it hasâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ its a good game"", i go into this review with a more, deeper sense. Next to this, i finished it 100% and was one of the original backers from its Kickstarter campaign back in 2013. Just dont be a ""fanboy"" and read it carefully.


Was looking around the city,missed something from the mayor. boom. 100%. done.Â

I waited to long for this...way to long...Shantae HGH was original backed back in 2013 and promissed to be finish in October 2014 - so the original Kickstarter project told. Now we have it Christmas 2016 and its finally there, after 3 years of waiting. Is the game good? Was it worth the wait? That all will i try to explain here in my review.Shantae and the long story shortShantae began her journey back on the GBC but got more fame on the Nindendo DSi systems with her 2nd game ""Risky's Revenge. Both titles were more like Action adventures with (more or less) open worlds, metroidvania-like and a lot room to explore. Since Game nr. 3, ""The Pirates Curse"", The series changed more into a ""stage-like-RPG"" game. Still, the ""stages"" were pretty big and you really had a lot room (""still"") to explore. Half-Genie Hero actually made more a step backward and gave the player only 7 pretty short stages to explore, one of them is the main town. Said that, HGH feels somehow ""smaller"" and even plays that way. the stages have maybe about 3 areas and are not even ""that"" big. At least not so big that HGH has a Map system (so it doesnt has one) unlike other Shantae games. They also are more like ""walk from left to right"" unlike in the Pirates Curse.In terms of music and sounds i can say they really did a good job, i actually like some of the tracks playing in the background. Still, they actually are not better than from the other Shantae games and some others fails to shine, like the song with actual lyrics.For the grafic i can say i actually enjoy them but i have to say, if i looked at the concept art, i really miss some emotions or animations somehow, like Shantaes actually Belly-""dances"" are now just the stereotype ""move the hip from left to right"". No other, cute dances or animations or like.


they should have gone with that- The original dances.Â

Next to this they ported the Stand animation from RR/PC into this game and it looks, honestly, very very awkward. They should have gone with the original stand from the GBC Shantae game - i might understood why they used this ""stand animation"", still it really doesnt fits the artstyle of the game. But as i said already, it feels like the game lacks some animations. a good sample would be here:


RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! DONT FORGET TO SMILE! EMOTIONS! :DÂ 
A Screenshot of Shantae: Half-Genie Hero
By: W.A. the Anum




The characters are suppost to show fear but they dont, no emotions at all.I know, animations ""handdrawn"" like the game already shows is a lot work but thinking about that they had 3 years time(+), and normaly it SHOULD had been done in 2014, it looks a bit ""rushed"" all of a sudden. The only ""effort"" i can sadly see is how ""badly"" they sexualized Shantae and all other characters. The full game feels like, if you dont look only ""its gameplay"", like (nothing personal) some nerd who wants to get laid created a character withâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥that all effort and money went right between the charactersâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Like for real, if you dont belive me, here a timeline:http://www.dmgice.com/revs/images/shantaethroughtheyears.pngAnd if you dont belive me, nearly ever ""good"" looking character is Female, has a very ""obvious"" short looking dress and mostly moves (and ""talks"") that way...and the cherry on top is that THAT also counts for good 90% of the ""monsters"". http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=819664595Female Spiders, Slimegirls and other ""female"", ""boobed"" monster appiers in someway, showing her ""content"" in all their best way. I have no problem, as ""normal Hetero Male Person"", to seeâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥and hips in a video game but it gives a right time and moment....and the right games for that, if you know what i mean. But we are talking about a game from Wayforward...A Backers opinion...Thinking about that this game ""should"" be done in 2014 and its now 2 years to late is a HUGE and long time to wait. At the end, it sure is finally there but the game feels still rushed and somehow, it really misses a bit more ""emotions"" which went only into the (so it seems) ""female breast sizes"". I mean, if they wana make it that obvious that the full game is only aboutâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥and hips, they should make it like namco and bring out a ""nearly naked shantae DLC"" for 5 bucks, really. If i dont look only on the sexualized characters (which is pretty hard since nearly every good character is female and nearly ""half-naked"" somehow...), the game plays really good and nice. Still, it misses the ""charm"" of the older games from the series since its only ""Level based"" and not ""Metroidvania"" World based. Next to this, i finished the game with 100% in about ~7 hours (my screenshot shows more but i also was afk for a moment and forgot the game was running) which feels, next to 3 years of wait which were to long, way to short for the peroid of waiting time i had as backer. I didnt expect a very huge Zelda-like clone adventure but if i look back at, as sample, RR, you had a pretty large world to explore and that actually made a whole lot fun, which i miss in this game. It just feels ""short"" even if i had fun playing it it felt more like a cookie you eat but you want more but you know, this was the last.So is it worth it?If i look at the pricetag for 20â¬, i can recomment it but only if you really want it or youre a hardcore Shantae-fan. It is not a bad game but it lacks of content (right now at least) and feels somehow rushed even after 3 years of pur waiting. Next to this you have this game done in round about ~7 hours (or less) - and that 100%. It looks nice, maybe a bit ""to much"" sexualized. I actually had fun playing it but if you want to try a better Shantae game you should try the Original GBC or risky's revenge, with both great worlds to explore which you will NOT find in this game title, Sadly. Still, it sure is worth playing but as backer im kinda a bit disappointed about that whole 3 years went only intoâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥and hips and not into a better gameplay, longer levels or maybe even a Metroidvaina-Open World...

												Doesn't run properly if refresh rate is set higher than 60Hz. Doesn't appear to run exclusive fullscreen, only borderless window, so can't force a refresh rate change when the game launches. Only way to run properly is to set desktop to 60Hz.Not recommended until Wayforward fix a basic issue than should never have made it to release.			"

												Its ok. As a fan of the series, I was really hyped for this game, but it felt lacking.Pros- Sweet music- Adorable animations- DLC coming soon so thats a good- Hardcore mode for hardcore peopleCons- Drops normal formula for a dissapointing linear approach- No dungeons- Too many transformations, and overpowered items- Story is kinda badAND THE WORST OF ALL- only 1 dance animation?Its good though.

												Somewhat conflicted over this one. Half-Genie Hero is a good game in its own right, but IMO it's a big step down from Pirate's Curse. The transformation dances from the original game and Risky's Revenge are back, but many of them feel shoehorned in and don't serve much purpose outside of getting an item here and there. The level design is much more linear and straightforward compared to the previous entries, and dungeons with maps and keys are completely absent. Even so, there are still plenty of secret items that you can go back and find throughout the levels.The bosses are a lot of fun but also pushovers, it's true that these games have never been particularly difficult to begin with but I think even by the series standards this game stands out as being the least challenging one yet(Hardcore mode update rectifies this). As far as story goes, it still retains the charm and humor from the previous games but there's not really any continuation from Pirate's Curse, as if all the character development and events that occurred never took place. The game acts more like a soft reboot.Despite everything, I still think it's a good and very fun game, I definitely recommend it if you're a fan of the series. Music is top notch, controls are tight, the game looks great and DLC is coming in the near future that'll let you play through 4 additional campaigns as other characters, so that may alleviate some of the issues.

												A joyous and colorful platformer. The cute art style and upbeat soundtrack set a pleasant, playful mood for the game.The jump command is as responsive as can be, which I think is one of the most important things in a platformer. My main complaint in regards to mechanics is that some of the upgrades you can aren't worth the effort. I almost never use the magical attacks. On the positive side, the game is divided into stages, but still has that Metroidvania gimmick of going back to where you've been to unlock upgrades. So if you like the idea of a Metroidvania game but always found running across the giant map to be tedious, this is a good game for you.			"

												EDIT: The hard mode has been unlocked so pretty much ignore anything about me calling the game easy as a whole, because as of right now I haven't played the game on hardThe story is little too dumb and cliche-heavy to actually praise in my book.The gameplay isn't as good as RR or PC comparitively and there's not much to do once you get everything (besides being a goddess because nothing can kill you at that point)Not a bad game overall, and they've made some dlc (Hard mode and probably Risky mode soon) free so that's definitely a plus.It is a fun and charming ride while I played it and using transformations for what they were meant for was satisfying (despite most of the forms not having a use outside of their intended used aside from the monkey which is faster than your normal form and the harpy that lets you skip most of the stages in the game if they aren't closed-roofed). And everything looks really pretty to look atI'm glad this game came out and it is way better of a game than MN9, but it is certainly no Shovel Knight. Still worth your time if you want a charming little game though			"

												A solid 10 hours if you want to get 100% items, take your time, and enjoy the game (that's 2 dollars an hour at full price... totally worth it.) Some of the platforming can be frustrating, but other than that, it is a very well-done game with tight controls, beautiful graphics, and the most adorable 1/2 genie hero you'll ever meet. I wish I helped kickstart it.I just wish that the kickstarter got enough funding for full voice acting, and the animated cut scenes. If they add that as DLC I might consider buying it, to replay with full voice.Below is my QQ rant:Edit: Tassel Town made me hate platformers. I'm 26% complete at this point, and I am starting to remember why I don't play this sort of game. I still recommend it.Edit #2: I collected all the things. They gave me unlimited magic, therefore total invulnerability to any enemy attack. I figured I could just walk through Risky's Hideout and see the story. I was horribly wrong. Instead, they are forcing you to play JOUST while avoiding spiked walls that MOVE and ONE SHOT you. Wayforward, you are making me very sad. Though, I am developing a mastery for the harpy form, and realizing that using HARPY TALON (which I may never unhear now, because she says it so much) stops me in mid-air. I want to cry right now; I've restarted this level over 25 times now, and each time I get a little further, I get one-shotted.Edit #3: Finished the game, had 99% completion. WTF. I had to load the save right before the longâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥boss fight, go back, buy the stupid blobfish whatever dance, then do the longâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥fight again, just to get 100%. Dumb.			"

												This game is another tight, entertaining adveture from wayforward. In this game you play as shantae trasforming into diffrent animals.

												I was one of the people who supported this in its Kickstarter stages, so to say I'm a little biased may be an understatement. And I have to say that this game is excellent. It is a fun metroidvania style game, and if you enjoy platformers, this is the game for you. Funny and fun, this will give you hours of entertainment, and with the DLC coming out, even more. So please support the official release where you can. I'm planning to buy it again to give to my friends, once I'm able to.			"

												Finally!!! My beautiful Shantae is at long last in HD! This has been one of my favorite game series. I am old school and love my 2D action platformers. If any of you enjoy this genre as well then this game is a must. Cartoony graphics are great and soundtrack is awesome. Controls are tight as well making everything great. Great for fans of Mario, Metroid, Castlevania and even Contra and Megaman. Great 2D action and  platforming with light exploration to find hidden areas for items. Extra characters and modes further extends the fun. Story is great and funny too. Highly recommended!			"

												The amazing 4th installment of the Shantae series.PROS:The controls respond exactly how they should.There's so much thought put into the art and animation.The transformation count in this one certainly does not disappoint!Boss fights are fantastic, not too difficult, but require you to pay attention.You make use of all your transformations near the end of the game, which in itself is a massive plus.The ability to turn off gear and abilities from the shop and the ability to use older versions of magic powers.Hero mode and plenty of achievements to hunt for.CONS:It's a bit easier than other shantae games (As well as some transformations making certain segments way too easy to platform through)... but you can switch certain items off to give yourself more of a challenge.It's quite a bit shorter than other shantae games, but there's more content on the way.If you like Metroidvania games and platformers, this is right up your alley.A ton of fun and very hard to put down, and one of my favorite games of this year.It gets a 8.5/10 from me because Squid Baron isn't last boss yet.

												Fun game to play through, controls are tight, attacking feels good. Cast of characters are cute some more memorable than others, overall a joy to play through. The enviroments are quite detailed some of the plot is interesting (and disturbing if you think too much into it). Some puzzles can be fun to solve while others are merely wait until you get X powerup then backtrack, which honestly didn't really fit that well in an arcade style game like this.But this game has a few issues with challenge, there are a couple of parts which are challenging BUT because of 1 hit kill hazards, so it is more of a change the angle of your jump or timing challenge.Spells feel quite useless, only ever needing to use one just because I had to for a quest. Some forms just outright break some of the platforming stages allowing you to just skip entire segments by simply going off screen (Much like with Super Mario World and the Cape).The main meat of the game, the gameplay itself the generic enemies are rather forgetable outside 1 - 2 enemy designs and many enemy types you can easily just ignore and run through if you feel like it. The main offender for this happening is how easy and quick it is to obtain powerups in this game that basically breaks your character. You will find that you are practically invincible after the first stage, once you obtained 2 health powerups and the armor that reduces all damage taken by half.So to put thing short, the game is fun to play but if you are after something that can challenge you this may not be the game for you.

												Highly polished and very fun to play but a little short compared to its predecessors with the ever present metroidvania back tracking.Hoewever some of the transformations seemingly only being there to create an optional achievement and I'm not sure what was even different about the heroic difficulty mode as it didn't feel any harder.This might not have been helped by an infinite money trick unlocking very early in the game.Want more and looking forward to  more content and regardless.

												I feel so glad i finally had a chance to play this. I can definitely recommend it.For those that ask, is it like Pirates Curse? Yes and no.While 1/2 Genie Hero keeps the goofy Characters (friends and foes alike).- I think the major difference to the prequels is: No more ""Zelda like"" Dungeons where you have to go back and forth collecting keys to unlock doors.Instead each world has stories when you visit them. The developers made it a nice touch that almost every world is a bit different when you visit them a second time and the mainstory bypassed them.- The Graphic is a pure collection of ART XD- The Music is good too- The Gameplay is good. Controlls are easy, but in my opionion the game should also have had a hard mode. Its way easier to beat than the former games. Ironically the game seems harder to me in the beginning when you only start with 2 heart containers... later you easily upgrade to half demage and collect like 10 more Heartcountainers. Only in Bossfights you can run into trouble of losing all energy then.- That aside there are lots of items to search for. Stying true to a metroidvania like game you can only reach certain upgrades and items after you got something else at other places.The Main story (including collecting all sidequests items) can be done in around 6 hours of a first playthrough.However, I am certain the game will be longer once the developers publish the promised DLC's.So keep checking from time to time when you played it through.

												Gotta get that right off the bat: I'm one of 18.500+ backers that made this game possible and I'm happy how it turned out.You play as Shantae, a half-genie and sole protector of Scuttle Town, ready to defend it against any threat. She uses her long, purple hair as a weapon, alongside few offensive and defensive spells. Her magical heritage allow her to perform a variety of belly dances that transform her into various forms, each with different uses. For example, she can turn into a crab and a mermaid, but only her crustacean form can snap through tangled vines, while as a water nymph she can swim properly and attack with bubbles.Even though it is a part of a series, you absolutely don't need to play any other Shantae game. All characters from previous installments (plus few new faces) make a return and are properly reintroduced. Plot is once again silly with tongue-in-cheek, self-aware humor sprinkled all over. There are six levels in total, but as you unlock new abilities you can replay them to find numerous hidden collectibles and secrets. This time WayForward went for HD graphics instead of pixel art I dare say it turned out pretty well. All character models are hand drawn, big, colorful and wonderfully animated. They mesh really well with lush, detailed backgrounds.Not everything is shiny though. Sometimes a tool tip or two would be helpful. For example, it took me half of my play through to realize that you can jump directly down through some platforms. There are also few frustrating sections that simply require player to memorize sequences of obstacles by trial and error. That wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't for inconsistent checkpoints. Thankfully you can obtain a special dance to skip sections of a previously completed levels. Levels that try their hardest to hide that they are way too short and  you will be revisiting them many times even if you don't want to get 100% of items. Story is also noticeably weaker compared to previous Pirate's Curse, where Shantae, Risky and each side-character had a story arc.Finishing the game took me around 7 hours and unlocked new game plus mode. There is at least one planned free DLC (for backers) with (supposedly) brand new story. There might be more content coming along the way based on stretch goals, which may or may not turn it into best Shantae game to date.A solid entry in the series, slightly below Pirate's Curse. Recommended.			"

												This game blows me away. The art style is new and absolutely beautiful (just look at the trailer), the mechanics are the same as the previous games but tweaked and improved so it just feels better overall, and the soundtrack has got me unreasonably hyped the entire time. Level design seems to have much more thought put into it, beating Risky's Revenge and of course Pirate's Curse. I really wish I backed this on Kickstarter, but it was already funded by the time I got into the series. Absolutely, 100% worth it. The art and visuals left me extremely impressed, especially.Also, the technical difficulties of the first two games seem to be absent here. (No framerate or resolution problems. Running at 1440p 144hz, settings were autodetected correctly.) It seems to be capped at 60fps, but that's only noticeable when the camera is panning, for the character sprites and UI don't really need it.Make sure not to play this if you haven't first played Risky's Revenge and then Pirate's Curse. They both go for really low prices on sale.+ Art and visuals are amazing+ Same witty humor, which I personally really enjoy+ Mechanics control so well, noticeable improvement over previous games+ THAT SOUNDTRACK.+ Level and boss/fight design is very thought out. This is a very welcome improvement over the previous games, especially Pirate's Curse. I'm impressed, I must say.~ A little fast paced. At times I would like to stop and admire the scenery a bit more.- Can't think of any constructive criticism. I will update if anything jumps out at me.			"

												It's short. I managed to get 100& completion in roughly 6h20m (played the second half of the game in offline mode, if you're wondering why my playtime isn't). While the gameplay is really solid, the art is wonderful and the music is great I don't feel like it really manages to compensate for the short length of the game which makes this a bit hard to recommend.So I'll settle for this: If you enjoy platformers and is looking for a new game to play you'll enjoy this. If you already got stuff to play in your backlog then wait a while with this one.			"

												Finally!The new Shantae game is here and it's amazing! I fell in love with the series! The cute artstyle, solid and fun gameplay and cool soundtrack will bring a smile on your face.Although I love this new one, I have to say that some things feel a little bit off: For example you get a lot of new transformations like spider, bat, etc... sounds cool but you don't have to use them. Especially the Spider, Mouse and Bat don't get a lot of attention. The Harpyie makes many levels very easy to beat.You get money so much faster than in the other titles of the series. The bosses were very easy to beat, almost too easy.Despite all that, it's pure fun and joy. I adore Shantae and I hope this series will never die. Unfortunately I missed the Kickstarter for this one.If you love Jump & Run like Megaman, Mario, Metroid etc... this one is for you! It's not the strongest title in the series (like Pirate Curse which was incredible!) but I absolutely recommend it!			"

												I would give this game a solid 9/10, a great buy for everyone. I think you will be very comfortable with the story even if you have never played a Shantae game before, and it's my favorite game in the series now. The only reason I am not giving it a 10/10 is because I did feel like there were a little too many different forms that Shantae could take on, which felt a little overwhelming at first and cumbersome later. But all of the forms were great and very unique, and Wayforward did a great job at allowing us to quickly and easily switch between all of them. Overall this is an amazing game, and I would recommend it to anyone!			"

												I'm not generally given to reviewing games, as there are others more qualified (or at least willing) to get into the nitty-gritty of such things. That said, if you love gaming in general, and side-scrolling 2.5D platformers in particular, you owe it to yourself to check out this little gem. It's adoreable. It's winky and fun, without being precious about it. The controls are smooth, the action is plentiful and occasionally challenging, and every new location, interaction, or character has something to delight the senses.Perhaps the highest praise I can give this game is that it took me back to my earliest days of gaming on the NES, when all you had to do was press start and immerse yourself in FUN. I know we're not supposed to enjoy things unironically anymore, but I'm having me some fun. You should, too. "

												Caution: While my end result is that I do recommend the game, I do not heavily recommend it like I would with snap-buy titles.I've enjoyed Shantae throughout the years. Pirate's Curse is, to me, the best game of the series and sadly, Half-Genie Hero does not surpass that game's level. It has too many flaws for that.For one, the past games had a sense of exploration. Big worlds which you'd discover all kinds of new things in when going through them later on, metroidvania style. Half-Genie Hero...tries to have that, but the worlds are just so tiny. There's a feeling that there should be more, but there simply isn't.The end-game also has a very strong ""Collect 10 Bear Asses"" feel to it. Just padding to make the game last a bit longer for those who want to get the proper ending. While it is a tradition for Shantae games to do something like that, it never felt as obvious as it does here. Then there's the various forms you can take. Some just feel a bit tacked on, like the Spider form which you need only for one little thing, and is never needed again except for an achievement. The Crab form also feels redundant with the Mermaid form around, with only a very few small things ensuring you must use it.Finally, the game is on the short side. 7.5 hours for 100% completion without actually rushing through the game...it's not horribly short, but I had hoped for longer.Having said that, these aren't huge problems. The gameplay itself is smooth as ever, perhaps even smoother than before. The flow of most of the game is perfect, the enemies are nice and varied, the level design itself, while small, is very well done, so gameplay wise there's nothing really wrong with the game.The graphics are also top notch. A lot of work has gone into the animation and it shows, the game looks fabulous. The music also helps, the ever-present ear worms keep up a great tone.Finally, the absurd and hilarious conversations are, as ever, another highlight of the game. It does refer it's predecessors a fair bit which might be annoying if this is your first Shantae, but even for those people there's plenty of good humor to go around.All in all, I think that this game's biggest problem is the existence of Pirate's Curse. That game set a very high bar that Half-Genie Hero falls just short of. I definitely do not regret the purchase, I had just hoped for a bit more after the kickstarter and the various postponings. The game is technically very well done, it just lacks that bit of punch.7/10.			"

												Shantae is one of my favorite game series of all time. While other reviews will talk about the great level design, the (occasionally) amusing writing, the phenomenal music (thanks to Jake Kaufman). I'd like to talk about the thing I truly love about the shantae series (excluding the original).The game engine in these games is flawless. The greatest crime I feel a platformer can commit in my opinion is have a poor engine. If I ever feel like missing a jump is the game's fault, or some BS pixel perfect jump requirements, then it is a bad platformer. This is never the case in Shantae. Shantae always lands from every jump exactly the way I expect based on the buttons I pressed. If I miss a jump, it is clear and obvious what I did wrong. I timed it wrong for the moving platform, I misjudged the arc, an enemy attack threw me off. I never fight the controls, and I never yell at the screen ""OH THATS BULL, I MADE THAT JUMP"". Hard sections feel challenging, not frustrating.That right there, the silky smooth controls and rock solid engine, are the best part of this game and its predecessors (except the original, lets not talk about the original....)UPDATE:Now that I'm less starry eyed from just finishing the game. I'll give my honest opinion to long time fans of Shantae. The biggest difference in this game is the style of level design. Its less metroidvania, more mega man. This isn't a bad thing, its just different. Levels are less about being labyrinths, and more about combining enemy placement and platforming to create a challenge. To those that prefer the labyrinth style designs, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse remains your best bet. To those that prefer stuff like Mega Man X, this game is perfect. To those that like both, like me, both games are awesome.			"

												Shantae: Half-Genie Hero has a lot of charm and I love the stylization. I really like how you can transform into different animals to get through obstacles from being a monkey climbing walls, to a harpy that can flap flap flap. Its a Average platformer at best, as the game has a lot of backtracking and how the difficulty scale goes from very easy to a super hard, flappy bird like final level. I think that kind of killed the fun for me, (especially that final level.) The game is under 10 hours, even finding all the secrets. I think they could have put a few more levels to help the difficulty scale, maybe make them progressivly harder.			"

												Half-Genie Hero isn't as good as Pirates Curse but its still a great deal of fun and well worth the price. The game goes back to the Risky's Revenge style over Pirate's Curse with a focus on Shantae transforming into various creatures in order to traverse the world, however the developers have said that the promised ""Risky Mode"" will include a move set similar to Pirates Curse on top of future game modes for Sky, Rotty, and Bolo.The overall game plays well, there is quite a bit of creativity in each level and the same kind of humor you would expect from a Shantae game. Transforming does kind of slow down the pace of the game some, but there is upgrades to speed it up and once you get used to each form you'll start to be able to recognize when is the best time to use them. The only negative I really have with the game is its too easy, there are far too many heart containers and too many ways to refill your health, magic would be the balancer here but then there is also upgrades to reduce the amount of magic your spells cost.Still at the end of the day if you like Shantae then you'll like this game: Its a fun game with a good art direction and cute girls, whats not to love?

												It's a really fun game :) The music, animations, and platforming/puzzles will keep ya entertained for a very long time. The difficulty isn't terribly hard, although some of the transformation sidequests can be quite irritating (such as the mouse mazes lol). Overall it's cute, charming, and jovial.

												A couple hours into the game and enjoying it a lot so far. Art style is very clean and cute, and the music is amazing. Gameplay is pretty standard action platforming, with plenty of story sequences and lots of hidden areas and secrets only made accessible if you return the level later after unlocking new powers. A cute and fun casual experience.			"

Half-Genie Hero is Ret-2-GoHalf-Genie hero is the fourth installment in the Shantae series, and each entry manages to impress in new ways. Half-Genie Hero's visuals are its most impressive feature, from the artwork to the animation, its all very good. I liked this game a lot, but I think it does have a few minor shortcomings.Pros +++ Visuals, they're great. The character portraits are nice, the models and sprites fit the style well, and the animations accentuate character personalities+++ Soundtrack, it's very good, each area has a unique track that sets the mood well++ Level Design, the levels are nicely designed, each new ability that is unlocked makes them easier to traverse in some way, as well as unlocking new areas in previous levels, new enemies appear in previous levels after clearing them as well+ Gameplay, transformations add a fresh take on the playstyle of Pirate's Curse, but transforming back and forth between them can sometimes feel tediousCons- Length, as a metroidvania game, short lengths are to be expected and replay value is where play time comes from. However, in comparison to Pirate's Curse I found this game to be shorter without much justification gameplay-wise-- Difficulty, Half-Genie Hero is an easy game. The ability to toggle upgrades helps to add an artifical challenge should it be desired, but for a casual player the base game is hardly challenging, especially compared to Pirate's CurseOverall, Half-Genie hero is an excellent game. I never felt frustrated with it, and that made it a fun experience. Even though it was an easy game, the effort WayForward put into creating and polishing this title was evident. With more content coming next year and a 10% discount on the game, I wholly recommend giving Shantae: Half-Genie Hero your consideration.			"

												This game is very fun with new content, great platforming, and the visuals you got a good game. When you get near the end it feels lacking and the bosses seem like a joke with you finding the little cliche they have in store it puts the games fun factor down and the game feels unfinshed just like the title saying half hero( its half of a game). Like the game is going to be like a long experence quckly rushes the end and leaves you wanting more. I found all the items and 100% the game in 8 hours not even touching one of the other titles it was rather easy. I loved this game with its humor and unique characters but they just showed up and then they were gone. I really wish to see more of the giga mermaid mabay she could of helped you in the end. I would recommend this game if you like the series. With its price it seems not worth it to some but it was a good game and I had fun and thats all that matters.			"

												Cute little platformer with fantastic art, music, and humorous dialogue. On the other side, a lot of the game feels shallow compared to the previous entry in the series. All of the areas are linear with only a single small zone having branching paths or any maze-like structure worth mentioning. Thankfully, there are shortcuts in place to make backtracking nicer as you progress through the game, but at the end of the day it's just a short platformer. Without the upcoming DLC/rewards in place there isn't much in terms of replayability, but overall still an enjoyable game and worth getting if you're into this sort of thing.			"

												Excellent game! The graphics are awesome, with very fluid animations, and the gameplay is great and fun. Unfortunately, the gameplay and mechanics have been simplified a bit (it is more platformer and less metroidvania than previous Shantae games, there are no puzzles or dungeons, and it is much more linear than the previous games). The game has few but long levels, and I think the duration of the game is similar to the previous games; there is a lot of backtracking, but this does not make the game repetitive since you are getting new magic powers all the time, which allow to explore new areas. This is a must-have for all who enjoyed the previous Shantae games.			"

												Shantae: Half Genie Hero is the 4th installment of  developer WayForward's Shantae series and the first to be funded by the fans via Kickstarter. Despite being overlooked and criminally under funded when compared to the likes of the now long forgotten Mighty No 9, Wayforward has once again have shown their true talents as a game developer.HGH is the first Shantae game that's in full HD.  It's also a more linear adventure, although there are secrets and hidden areas to find and discover. There are a total of 6 levels. Each broken into 3 to 4 stages each with a boss waiting at the end of each level. In this new adventure Shantae has more transformations at her disposal that totals up to 12 forms she can use. The animations and the overall look of HGH is possibly the best visualls WayForward has brought to the table with the series. The soundtrack has once again hit another home run thanks to series composer Jake Kaufman and also credit to Shantae's voice actress Christina Vee for lending her talented voice in main theme. Pros:-Beautiful visuals that match with the equally vibrating soundtrack-Shantae's arsinal and transformations is the most varied in the series yet-Each of the 6 levels do well to make use and compliment the way the transfomations are used in certain situations-Gameplay is simple, but does offer some complexity-The 6 levels are varied and offer plenty of action platforming that doesnt get dullCon:-Short playthough that could be completed around 6+ hours on a blind run-4 of the transformations are forgeteble and are hardly used-Certain pickup items can make Shantae go extremely OP-Difficulty is easiest entry out of the entire seriesVerdict: Despite the game's shortcommings, this is still one of the better Shantae titles released being behind The Pirate's Curse. It doesn't change the formula too much, but rather it gives it a bigger, HD paint-job. This is an easy buy, but may want to wait for a sale and/or DLC to come out for additional content.			"

												Although I'd have to say I liked Pirate's Curse a bit more, Half-Genie Hero easily takes second place. The controls are tight, the visuals and music are amazing, and although I initially wasn't keen on the idea of going back to the genie transformations, they're more interesting and useful in this game than they've ever been.My only complaint is that they ditched the dungeons in favour of linear levels, but there's still plenty of exploration, so it's not so bad. Also, it's quite short (as usual), but unlike Risky's Revenge, it feels like a complete package. Definitely pick it up if you're a Shantae fan (though let's face it, you already have), but if you're new to the series, I'd recommend playing Pirate's Curse first.			"

												Shantae: Half-Genie Hero surprised me. Good and original platformers are getting more and more rare. The gameplay is fun and responsive, I got used to the transformations, they add a variety of different ways to play the game. But the pacing does suffer, especially later on, when you get a lot of transformations and have to shuffle through them all. The story is very basic but it is very charming, it gives the game a fun and light feel. The hub world can get annoying because it isn't always clear what you have to do, to move on to the next level, and you have to return to the same levels allot and search for that one thing you need to move on to the next level. It sometimes felt like I played the same level 10 times. I feel like they didn't put in everything they wanted to in the game, either because they didn't have time or some other reason. So they make you play the same thing again and again. And the boss levels are Iâm sad to say too easy and repetitive. Overall though I really enjoyed the level design in Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, even though I got sick of playing the same levels, it has some game design ideas I haven't seen before. And I really like the graphics, it is one of my favorite games this year. But it was a bad year for me, so that doesn't say much. It is still just barely an above average game. Games like, Shovel Knight, Ori and the blind forest and Super meat boy are much better.6 out of 10. It makes me wonder why it took so long to release the game, development issues maybe?			"

												As a Kickstarter I got the game 2 weeks early for being a Backer.I personally enjoy this game, so much that I'm going to also be speedrunning it quite often.But this is a review so I'll give my review.Pros:Beauitfully done animationJake Kauffman comes through again with one of his best soundtracks yetFan Service, Fan Service, Fan Service!Enjoyable StoryAll the enjoyable Shantae gameplay is still thereDLC will have Risky Mode, more costumes and hero modes when released.As a Kickstarter, the DLC will be free for meCons:Short, first time playthrough averages 5-6 hoursUntil DLC comes out, not much replayability aside from Speedrunning/Hero modeHaving compeated with Mighty No. 9 during the kickstarter - It didn't get as much backing, so content is considerably lacking due to it even with the upcoming DLC.More linear, lost quite a bit of the Metroidvania feel and less exploration.Non Kickstarters have to pay for DLCNeutrals:It's easier, which can be a con to some. But after the terror that was Shantae and the Pirates Curse platforming, it was welcoming.Animations are beautiful, but feels like they are missing something.As a speedrunner, the in game time is programmed strangely - Doesn't run in pause(Item) menu/dance menu and will reset to previous time if you die. Casual players won't care about this.Overall:An enjoyable game with great animation and music, though short and lacking content due to competing Kickstarters against the overly popular Mighty No. 9 at the time.I hope the sales of the game will help them get more funding to add more content to the game at a later time. :)I'll still be running it as a Speedrunner, as mentioned above, very very ofter as I enjoyed the game quite a bit.

												DISCLAIMER: I am a backer of this title and paid $55.A project started 4 years ago has come to fruition and I'll be honest, it easily makes my personal game of the year. Playing similar to previous titles like Ducktales Remastered, A Boy and his Blob, and various other titles by the company it shows that Wayforward has not lost it's touch with making platformers. Bright, cheerful and a difficulty that ranges from easy to difficult without being a cackewalk or mind-numbingly difficult. Often compared to Mighty No. 9, Wayforward delivered on something that Comcept failed to do so: a relatively smooth game that has very intuitive gameplay mechanics and stages that put the mind to work as much as the fingers. The bosses, while really large (HUGE in some cases) all have a very capable strategy to beat. To add, while there are cases of a large number of enemies, I never felt at any point where I was forced to take a hit, making untouchable runs a fun challenge. To add, as with most Wayforward titles there is a game clock so speedrunners are going to have fun optimizing this game. The music and voices are superb as always with variations of Jake Kaufman (Wayforwards cheif Maestro) and Cristina Vee's (the voice actor for Shantae amongst others and the lead singer) ""Dance Through the Danger"" interspecced throughout amid an incredible selection of other music.As good as the game is, it is not perfect however. There are two nagging issues. The dances are not as dynamic as the tools from Pirate's curse though the mechanic has been improved from previous iterations, utilizing a radial menu system instead of button presses or timing cues. However there are three panels of four icons that cycle automatically, slowing down the gameplay. This can be sped up with a store purchase but that also has the drawback of accidentally picking the wrong dance. Second, like Ducktales Remastered the game is laid out in a stage format as opposed to a single world format like the original game or Risky's Revenge and each stage has a LOt of stuff to collect, often requiring special hidden dances and abilities. This necessitates a LOT of backtracking in the stages, in some cases being required to progress. Personally, not a huge issue but it can frustrate players. Both of these issues are relatively minor and only impact the game in marginal ways. Overall, another fantastic game from an incredible team who have the support of their fans. People on the fence waiting to know whether it will be any good or not can rest easy knowing that Wayforward can still deliver a fun game with a mix of fast paced gameplay, humorous characters and story, and a bright, colorful world.

												Overall a very fun game with solid controls in which you start out really weak and get exteremly broken by the end of the game...so much so that you feel invinicbile (i dont think i ever died in this game and came the cloest to dying on the first level due to how weak shantae starts out)unlike most games of this genre, when you beat a boss you get a new transformation then usually you have to backtrack through a level you beaten again to find more upgrades (and this isnt optional the game halts and forces you to do this to continue the story and it happens every time)...this may sound like a negative but since you just got a new transfomation and became even stronger, it wont seem like backtracking through a stage and you might find optional upgrades to make the rest of the game even easier...and thats the charm of the game, you really feel the progression of the main character who starts out super weak with very traditional moveset you will see in most platformers then slowly start breaking the mold once you start finding upgrades and start going back to levels that gave you headaches in the past and just watch them get broken apart due to your new abilites.Also you eventually get a warp spells so you can skip unneccary parts of a level to find that 1 upgrade or part you need in a level you already beaten and you can leave the level at anytime you want if you gotten everything you need...it does become super easy at the end when you can go invinicbile at will, fly over the whole stage, and have so many heart containers that theres no way the enemy can kill you but ya you sorta earned that right? though hard work and upgrading yourself...its not a hard game in the slightest but its so much fun when you are so strong at the end of the game and it feels justified with all the time you spent on making shantate stronger...Lastly this game is getting dlc to extend the gameplay later on...and its not just skins...its new playable characters with unique gameplay styles and their own storylines so you have something to look forward too...and this game rewards speedruns so if you thought it was so easy by the end...try going for the achivements, some requiring you to speedrun the game...

												Pretty much the first Shantae game I ever completed and for good reason. This game involves a lot of backtracking, which is the reason I guess fans are disappoint. As a person who usually hates backtracking more than any other video game mechanic, I have to say this is the one of the few games that did it right.Gameplay:Pros-As I tried to imply, I barely know much about Shantae or the gameplay so overall how I can describe this game as the love-child of the Paper Mario series and Donkey Kong Country. As I said, a 'lot' of the game revolves around backtracking, yet it honestly didn't feel at all like a chore. It flows well for this type of game as levels feel brand new or updated once you acquire more power ups and dances. My fear when I purchased this is that the animal dances were going to be used as gimmicks for obstacles and puzzles, but there are several situations where you can get through a level more efficiently than base Shantae.Cons-This game goes from delightfully challenging(while annoying on a few parts) to being way too easy. You'll get multiple hearts and food to keep them full forever later in the game, despite the x9 limit for each food. Combining her hair whip with the spike balls/scimitar magic could pretty much smash virtually every enemy away with ease. In fact, magic is immensely unbalanced in this game. You could literally just only purchase the weapon summoning and barrier magic then still beat the game with ease. The difficulty jump and lack of checkpoints can get annoying at times, if you fall off or run into a spike then 2-3 minutes of platforming is basically gone.Story:How can I describe it? It basically feels like a Saturday morning cartoon. I don't mean that in a negative or positive way. The dialogue feels witty and the characters keep the liveliness of the game going. Even though I found it funny, I actually felt characters taking catastrophic events to lightly to be rather museless about. The main characters seemed a bit cookie cutter, but they were solid through and through. Even though it was mostly Shantae doing the work, you enjoyed the moral support you was giving from your friends. It's hard to go too deep into it without spoiling. The town NPCs felt like characters in the beginning, but then they reverted into mere hint givers. Overall, I did find it awesome how a simple anti-monster Beacon turned into genie corrupting war machine.Music:Overall it was enjoyable to play through the game, but it didn't feel memorable aside from maybe the slide theme. Although, I can't get over Shantae dancing to the town theme.Overall:I give it a 7.5/10. Despite a lot of my nit-pickings(and a couple more I didn't mention without spoiling), there was nothing in this game that was game breaking. The platforming by itself is... decent. What saves the game is the versatile abilities and how you can use them to get through puzzles along with faster methods to defeat enemies. It also could've been 'much' longer, yet seeing how this is a Kickstarter game it's understand they had to use the funds they were given in such a little time.			"

												Overall a very fun game with solid controls in which you start out really weak and get exteremly broken by the end of the game...so much so that you feel invinicbile (i dont think i ever died in this game and came the cloest to dying on the first level due to how weak shantae starts out)unlike most games of this genre, when you beat a boss you get a new transformation then usually you have to backtrack through a level you beaten again to find more upgrades (and this isnt optional the game halts and forces you to do this to continue the story and it happens every time)...this may sound like a negative but since you just got a new transfomation and became even stronger, it wont seem like backtracking through a stage and you might find optional upgrades to make the rest of the game even easier...and thats the charm of the game, you really feel the progression of the main character who starts out super weak with very traditional moveset you will see in most platformers then slowly start breaking the mold once you start finding upgrades and start going back to levels that gave you headaches in the past and just watch them get broken apart due to your new abilites.Also you eventually get a warp spells so you can skip unneccary parts of a level to find that 1 upgrade or part you need in a level you already beaten and you can leave the level at anytime you want if you gotten everything you need...it does become super easy at the end when you can go invinicbile at will, fly over the whole stage, and have so many heart containers that theres no way the enemy can kill you but ya you sorta earned that right? though hard work and upgrading yourself...its not a hard game in the slightest but its so much fun when you are so strong at the end of the game and it feels justified with all the time you spent on making shantate stronger...Lastly this game is getting dlc to extend the gameplay later on...and its not just skins...its new playable characters with unique gameplay styles and their own storylines so you have something to look forward too...and this game rewards speedruns so if you thought it was so easy by the end...try going for the achivements, some requiring you to speedrun the game...

												A decent platformer, but with it has its faultsI was a huge fan of the previous game in the series, and I was very excited to play this, unfortunately some things feel like a step backwards rather than forwards. There, however, are a lot of things to love here: The art is fantastic, and is easily one of the best looking platformers you can play on PC. The music, as composed by the great Jake Kaufman (Shovel Knight/Mighty Switch Force)  is generally top notch, although a few tracks (such as the last two parts of the game) I found very underwhelming. The levels are extremely fun the first time through, they all have fun gimmicks to them that make them stand out among the others, but you will be doing a ton of backtracking to find items, which can feel like a chore, and make the levels feel very small after a while, I know it was done to lengthen the game, but it spreads too thin, and I'd have preferred a 3-4 hour game that stayed fresh than a 7-8 hour game where you constantly comb through the same areas.The boss fights are hit and miss, not horrible for a platform game (a genre not generally known for good bosses, outside of megaman and metroid) but not as challenging or charming as they were in Pirate's curse.The biggest positive of the game by far is the transformations, there are tons of forms Shantae aquires and they all have fun and unique properties that change up the game a lot, and they all look dang cute.I give this game a soft reccomendation, but hope there will be more that feels in line with Pirate's Curse in the upcoming Risky Boots campaign, as it was left feeling pretty dry at the end.Still, one of the better platformers on steam, and for 20 dollars it's not a bad way to kill a few hours.

												This is a fun platformer game which has elements from some fantastic old games like Aladdin, Rocket Knight Adventures and Quackshot but also adds some new things to the mix.The platforming experience is overall fun but the story elements that glue the game together feel tedious; especially the errands in town that are required before moving on...One thing that I think could be massively improved in a patch is the morph screen that appears when you press the Y button on the game pad. When you have multiple pages of morphs it flashes between them in a really awkward way. It's way too fast and disorienting for no good reason. It would be better if there was just a single screen that you can select from; or, if you used LB/RB to change page.All in all this is a top notch game and I would recommend to anybody that enjoys platformers.

												Just a heads up that I am a huge fan of this series and I have followed the development for this title since the beginning, but oh my sweet lord was the wait worth it. A wonderful cast of characters, beautiful, smoothly animated hand-drawn graphics, streamlined gameplay using an array of MAGICAL BELLY DANCING TRANSFORMATIONS and precise, old school platforming goodness. My main nit-pick is that this game can get difficult *cough Mega Man-style dissapearing blocks cough*If you love Metroidvanias, classic platformers, or just a huge amout of cute girls, get this game now.

A Solid PlatformerI've looked forward to this game for a while and it had not failed to deliver. The visuals are a mix of beautifully drawn characters within a colourfully crafted world. The music also doesn't fail to bring you deeper into the world that has a blend of a megaman x/sonic feel to them. Controls are tight and responsive giving you the needed accuracy to navigate some of the hair line dangers. Level design is that of a stage select with some backtracking through previous areas. The only problems I have with that is you would get a power that at some point only serves a single purpose instead of being used multiple times and once certain areas have been completed they feel like they have lost their charm in some way (mermaids and tower).If you are looking for a decent platformer with a decent amount of puzzle solving then this game is for you.

Backtracking is still in, but level selection makes navigation a whole lot easier. The monster girls in this game are to die for. Big plus for the visuals, slight minus for some cringy humor.Good for: Shantae enthusiasts and regular platformer playersBad for: Hardcore platform enthusiasts and lengthy adventure seekers			"

												This is an amazing game and everything I wanted from a platformer! The characters are very charismatic, the mechanics are solid and the script made laugh many times. The design of the stages also really impressed me. I usually don't like games with backtracking, but it was masterfully done in this game. The barriers are not obvious. They're not something you look at and say ""ok, i'll have to come back later"". That is because, as you get new abilities, you start looking at the stages with different eyes, and understanding the possibilities. IMHO, this is a masterclass in game design and the best platformer on steam. Can`t wait for more. 10/10.			"

												Due to character limit, this is a brief review compared to my more detailed one on my website. See it HERE[www.omaralikaj.com]. Here here a lot things I liked about the game, and a few I didn't:PROS:Interesting plot, and sub-plots and missions, plus funny and what-on-earth moments.Transformations, acquired from the messenger, item shop, or snake merchant make a fun gameplay. Unlike Mario, they're essential in clearing certain areas.I like that this game is not too cryptic, but some ways of collecting items were harder than others to figure out.Great soundtracks. Having played the mobile version of ""Lit"", WayForward did it again.Cool audio and sound effects, but some like Shantae ducking, or the centipede making grunt sounds, felt out of place.The graphics feel like an interactive cartoon show. The stages are pretty, and surprisingly interactive.Boss fights are fun and challenging, but, getting heart holders, power-ups, items, and acquiring new forms along the way, I felt like the later ones were easy.CONS:Shantae's story at least is really short. Thankfully, the other stories/DLCs were funded via Kickstarter. The game triggers purchased certain power-ups upon controlling my laptop's volume, as opposed to just pressing ""C"". I avoid blowing up enemies with my flame attack when there are many of them on the screen, so the game won't crash. This happened 3x.No clarification that store-bought items are essential for 100% completion. You get ""Hero Mode"" after beating the game, but it feels unneeded, and only ideal for speedrun or clearing early stages and side missions quicker.The brat the Mayor replaced Shantae with, even when she was genuinely worried, WayForward still showed the same image of her being a snub in the dialogues.And finally, some stages or missions take a long time to get back to, especially the ""Great Escape"", where you can't get hit by a gear during first try only. Thankfully, I got this achievement during my first speedrun.			"

												I backed this game on kickstarter and have no regrets. The gameplay is fast-paced and highly enjoyable. The main mechanic, transforming, is very well executed and a pleasure to use. This is definitely one of those games that makes you feel powerful, jumping around and whipping things to death with hair attacks and shifting smoothly between whatever forms you need for the task at hand. I played with an XBox 360 USB controller and had no issues whatsoever. You can even rebind the buttons if you want, something not every game offers.The game has a cute but fairly light story, which is honestly perfect for it. It is enough to keep you moving without bogging you down or getting in the way of the main feature, which is the excellent gameplay. Pretty much my only issue with the game is one I knew I'd have going in. I do find the female outfits and character designs a bit silly/fanservicey (personal preference here, not an attack). That said, they don't really exploit that in gross ways like some titles do. Something I read on TVTropes seems pretty true, describing the style as 'sexy but not sexualized'. The only exception I found was the first playthrough of the second level Mermaid Factory. I found that level seriously squicky in a variety of ways.  Seriously, girls tied to some kind of assembly line looking thing, being shoved into cans to be sold (as you find out later) as *food*? That's pretty messed up. Thankfully all the disturbing elements are gone when you come back later. And to be fair this series has always had some squicky elements to its humor. I am generally pretty sensitive to this sort of thing, so if you aren't this may not bother you at all. If you are very sensitve, then, be aware. I still definitely reccommend the game, which I feel has a great deal of heart and is well worth it. I have already beat both normal and hero mode, and am looking forward to the extra content that will eventually be released.EDIT: Something I forgot to mention was the soundtrack, which I found highly enjoyable and perfectly suited to the rhythm of the gameplay. It's all instrumental with the exception of the theme song, 'Dance Through the Danger', which plays during the first run of the first level as well as during the ending credits. That song... well, let's just say that three days after playing it was still getting stuck in my head. xD			"

												1/2 Genie Hero looks amazing, the music is top-notch, catchy, and every stage has its own identity. Like a typical Metroid-vania game, there's a good amount of backtracking to be done, but the game helps you by giving a checklist of sorts so you know there are secrets to find in each stage. Having played all the Shantae games previously, this one is a welcome addition to the series and one I will replay multiple times. I haven't even played the full game yet and I highly recommend those who haven't played the Shantae series at all should go back and try them all out :D			"

												This game is worth the 20$ I spent. I'm a Huge fan of the new visuals. Shantae's model is adorable...well all the female characters are adorable both their models and illustrations. It's so clean, crisp, and very colorful. With this new style, details like facial expression are very easy to see on these new models. Every character looks amazing. The characters/items really standout from the background. So it doesn't matter if you are playing this on a teeny tiny screen or your 55"" screen in the family room, it's going to look great. The game ran smoothly.Everything Shantae does looks good. Same goes for enemies. There were some hiccups, not like lag or anything but some blinks of color in spots of the screen. This could be fault with something in the game or something on my end.The levels were well designed. Many of them seem to be designed for several ways of navigation up until end in the event you miss some transformation or moves hidden along the way. On the topic of transformations. I enjoyed all but one, the one I'd have to say it is nothing more than a joke. I found the levels to be moderately difficult and some small spots kind of hard. Part of me wishes most was hard but at the same time given the number of times I treked back and forth in levels, I think perhaps moderate is for the best. If you are into time trials be it just finishing as fast as possible, getting all unlocks, or going for 100%(buying all shop items) There levels are large enough that they take a good amount of memorization and creativity to navigate them as quickly/efficiently as possible.This game also rewards those have keen eyes for finding things in the levels/taking the time to get them. I found the Mermaid level to be my favorite level. Lots of jumps, its really big. Really pretty and cute. Spoiler, don't read unless you played game  So sad that all the girls are gone after beating the boss, the level loses much of its charm, it would of been nice to have Mermaids/village girls in the background overseeing those croc guys on the hooks instead of the girlsThe last game's levels were bigger and everything was conencted. There was a lot more exploring. I really liked that bout the last game. I could care less for it all being connected but I really love big levels that can be explored because it really makes you feel like you found stuff rather than it just being inevitable that you'd come across it. I feel like Shantae's amazing hairproducts overshadowed the offensive spells, fire and electricity a bit. I would wager that if there were no basic atk upgrades that the fire and lightning spells would feel very relevant. In contrast to the shield and pike(swirling DPS) which can be used with your basic atks. Nonetheless its good to have variety. xD I almost never found out what they were because the last game stuff like that were consumables rather than learned abilities lol.I ended up getting all of the acheivements for this game. I beat it 3 times. 1st playthrough was 7hrs long 100%. The 2nd was 3hrs20min long, 100%, while the 3rd was 2hrs 14min 88%. The game was really enjoyable. I did leave wanting more. i felt that it was a bit short. Honestly I think whether it was a legit 20hr+ game or not, I'd still be left wanting. I'm looking forward to Risky's DLC which gives her, her very own campaign and unique abilities. So I will definitely be playing that whenever it comes out.Unfortunately I wasn't a backer because it ended by the time I even learned of this game. Seeing some of the other stretch goals really makes me pray this game does well and perhaps does some of them.Playing as Rottytops, Sky, or Bolo all with their own unique moves sounds amazing. A new chapter (who doesn't love more playable content.) Lastly animated cutscenes that are fully voice....................*drools*   Realistically I hope for the chapter and characters the most.The stretch goals that were not met I'd definitely pay for if they were DLC. So my only 2 real complaints are these.1 I already covered, I wish the game was longer.2 I wish some of the transformations we gained had more time to shine with much larger parts of the levels dedicated to them. Some of them were pretty neglected. The underwater ones, flying, and most definitely the spider.*3 need more Mermaids.All in all this a great game that I would recommend getting. I hope it does well and that they support it in the future.I've been stepping away from larger companies/AAA and been playing more games from smaller studios and I have been very happy with that choice.

												I'm a big fan of this series. I love the art, the writing, and the gameplay, and while I don't think this lives up to the standard that Pirate's Curse set, I enjoyed it a lot.BUT.Whoever designed the final sequence has a lot to answer for. Instant death autoscroller, with no checkpoints, and requiring you to jump with little time onto moving hooks would be brutal enough, but having those hooks randomly become unusable  is simply unacceptable. I failed the final autoscroller multiple times because of the two available hooks to jump to, BOTH decided to be unusable. The game literally created an unwinnable situation and forced me to start over.I feel similarily bitter about the extended flappy bird sequence in the final level as well.I really would have enjoyed more of the core gameplay than these low polish and frustrating minigame sections.

												I'd like to start off saying that i have never played any Shantae games before, though im definitely going to now!all in all, this IS a fun game, but in my 7 hours of gameplay, ive gotten every acheivement except for the speedruns, which will pose zero threat since the game is just... too simple. ou can basically floor through every level and avoid any enemy except for the bosses, which only take about a minute to figure out the patterns and kill anyways.the magic abilities are basically useless until the end of the game where you become a literal invisible goddess OR have a bubble of swords killing everything for you.being a platformer, i wasnt reaaly expecting more than a 6 or 7 hours game time, but i figured it would take that long just to initially beat the game ya know? not 7 hours of goofing off and collecting everything along the way without really trying and still getting 100%.on the plus sides though, even being short, i absolutely adore the artstyle and music in the game! the world really comes to life! and you dont really need to know anything about the story prior to playing (though that does give some detachment from the characters.)i say again, i DO recommend this game! its cheap, its fun, it kept me entertained, just not quite as fulfilling as i'd hope.

												A very fun game with beautiful art, incredily smooth animation, good music, charming characters and silly sense of humour. Shantae games are always an enjoyable experience, and Half-Genie Hero is no exception. To make things even better, the game will still get more updates, giving us extra characters to play with unique abilities.My one complaint is that the game is too easy, and it's possible to collect an item that gives you unlimited magic, which downright breaks the game. However, we are given the option of deactivating these items, which is nice, as it helps keeping the game more challenging.The story is a bit ot a let-down as well in two senses: 1- it doesn't really follow the pllot of Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, and 2- the missions don't feel like part of a bigger adventure, IMO. They feel like episodic quests only slightly connected to each other.Still, the game is really fun to play and the animation is gorgeous! If you're looking for a light-hearted plataforming adventure with great visuals and delightful characters, this is the game for you!			"

												The only reason someone wouldn't like this game is if they can't appreciate the level design of repeadtedly going back into each world to find other treasures. Although it admittedly is a bit repetitive, the devs deserve props for the design of their game: each world is aesthetically pleasing and full of awesome surprises and great music. If you don't mind that, however, you're in for a real treat: 1/2 Genie Hero has the best soundtrack in the series (Jake Kaufman, who did Necrodancer and Shovvel Knight, produced a very catchy and groovy OST, the best graphics (the HD is gorgeous and runs around 60 fps consistently), and great gameplay and writing, arguably better than the others in the series.

												Shantae: Half-Genie Hero surprised me. Good and original platformers are getting more and more rare. The gameplay is fun and responsive, I got used to the transformations, they add a variety of different ways to play the game. But the pacing does suffer, especially later on, when you get a lot of transformations and have to shuffle through them all. The story is very basic but it is very charming, it gives the game a fun and light feel. The hub world can get annoying because it isn't always clear what you have to do, to move on to the next level, and you have to return to the same levels allot and search for that one thing you need to move on to the next level. It sometimes felt like I played the same level 10 times. I feel like they didn't put in everything they wanted to in the game, either because they didn't have time or some other reason. So they make you play the same thing again and again. And the boss levels are Iâm sad to say too easy and repetitive. Overall though I really enjoyed the level design in Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, even though I got sick of playing the same levels, it has some game design ideas I haven't seen before. And I really like the graphics, it is one of my favorite games this year. But it was a bad year for me, so that doesn't say much. It is still just barely an above average game. Games like, Shovel Knight, Ori and the blind forest and Super meat boy are much better.6 out of 10. It makes me wonder why it took so long to release the game, development issues maybe?			"

												As a Kickstarter I got the game 2 weeks early for being a Backer.I personally enjoy this game, so much that I'm going to also be speedrunning it quite often.But this is a review so I'll give my review.Pros:Beauitfully done animationJake Kauffman comes through again with one of his best soundtracks yetFan Service, Fan Service, Fan Service!Enjoyable StoryAll the enjoyable Shantae gameplay is still thereDLC will have Risky Mode, more costumes and hero modes when released.As a Kickstarter, the DLC will be free for meCons:Short, first time playthrough averages 5-6 hoursUntil DLC comes out, not much replayability aside from Speedrunning/Hero modeHaving compeated with Mighty No. 9 during the kickstarter - It didn't get as much backing, so content is considerably lacking due to it even with the upcoming DLC.More linear, lost quite a bit of the Metroidvania feel and less exploration.Non Kickstarters have to pay for DLCNeutrals:It's easier, which can be a con to some. But after the terror that was Shantae and the Pirates Curse platforming, it was welcoming.Animations are beautiful, but feels like they are missing something.As a speedrunner, the in game time is programmed strangely - Doesn't run in pause(Item) menu/dance menu and will reset to previous time if you die. Casual players won't care about this.Overall:An enjoyable game with great animation and music, though short and lacking content due to competing Kickstarters against the overly popular Mighty No. 9 at the time.I hope the sales of the game will help them get more funding to add more content to the game at a later time. :)I'll still be running it as a Speedrunner, as mentioned above, very very ofter as I enjoyed the game quite a bit.

												DISCLAIMER: I am a backer of this title and paid $55.A project started 4 years ago has come to fruition and I'll be honest, it easily makes my personal game of the year. Playing similar to previous titles like Ducktales Remastered, A Boy and his Blob, and various other titles by the company it shows that Wayforward has not lost it's touch with making platformers. Bright, cheerful and a difficulty that ranges from easy to difficult without being a cackewalk or mind-numbingly difficult. Often compared to Mighty No. 9, Wayforward delivered on something that Comcept failed to do so: a relatively smooth game that has very intuitive gameplay mechanics and stages that put the mind to work as much as the fingers. The bosses, while really large (HUGE in some cases) all have a very capable strategy to beat. To add, while there are cases of a large number of enemies, I never felt at any point where I was forced to take a hit, making untouchable runs a fun challenge. To add, as with most Wayforward titles there is a game clock so speedrunners are going to have fun optimizing this game. The music and voices are superb as always with variations of Jake Kaufman (Wayforwards cheif Maestro) and Cristina Vee's (the voice actor for Shantae amongst others and the lead singer) ""Dance Through the Danger"" interspecced throughout amid an incredible selection of other music.As good as the game is, it is not perfect however. There are two nagging issues. The dances are not as dynamic as the tools from Pirate's curse though the mechanic has been improved from previous iterations, utilizing a radial menu system instead of button presses or timing cues. However there are three panels of four icons that cycle automatically, slowing down the gameplay. This can be sped up with a store purchase but that also has the drawback of accidentally picking the wrong dance. Second, like Ducktales Remastered the game is laid out in a stage format as opposed to a single world format like the original game or Risky's Revenge and each stage has a LOt of stuff to collect, often requiring special hidden dances and abilities. This necessitates a LOT of backtracking in the stages, in some cases being required to progress. Personally, not a huge issue but it can frustrate players. Both of these issues are relatively minor and only impact the game in marginal ways. Overall, another fantastic game from an incredible team who have the support of their fans. People on the fence waiting to know whether it will be any good or not can rest easy knowing that Wayforward can still deliver a fun game with a mix of fast paced gameplay, humorous characters and story, and a bright, colorful world.

												It's good. It's not the pinnacle of outstanding platforming like, I dunno, Mario, but it's still a very solid game with good jokes interwoven with it, much like the rest of the series. Ultimately the whole adventure is maybe six to eight hours long.There are some downsides, though; it's plainly obvious some content was abandoned during development. A lot of various abilities to pick up over the game or even series staples like the destructible blocks only serve to, straight up, get one thing before becoming useless again. This one thing could actually be plot demanded or just a health upgrade. It's very strange in that regard; time was spent on giving Shantae a spider form, yet it's used for A Puzzle and then never so much as useful again.			"

												Another great entry in the Shantae series. Characters are still funny as ever and the world keeps that charming atmosphere. Back to the classic gameplay using transformations to traverse obstacles that the series used before Pirate's Curse which is nice to see as an old fan. I look forward to the campaigns they are releasing in the future like the Risky story mode which will use the pirate gear from the last game and the story mode for Bolo, Sky and Rottytops whose new abilities should be interesting.Another big plus for the game is the music which once again is done by the great Jake Kaufman and once again is amazing.All in all Wayforward really did a good job taking the Shantae formula off of handhelds. If you have enjoyed previous Shantae games you'll love this one too.			"

												Half-Genie Hero isn't as good as Pirates Curse but its still a great deal of fun and well worth the price. The game goes back to the Risky's Revenge style over Pirate's Curse with a focus on Shantae transforming into various creatures in order to traverse the world, however the developers have said that the promised ""Risky Mode"" will include a move set similar to Pirates Curse on top of future game modes for Sky, Rotty, and Bolo.The overall game plays well, there is quite a bit of creativity in each level and the same kind of humor you would expect from a Shantae game. Transforming does kind of slow down the pace of the game some, but there is upgrades to speed it up and once you get used to each form you'll start to be able to recognize when is the best time to use them. The only negative I really have with the game is its too easy, there are far too many heart containers and too many ways to refill your health, magic would be the balancer here but then there is also upgrades to reduce the amount of magic your spells cost.Still at the end of the day if you like Shantae then you'll like this game: Its a fun game with a good art direction and cute girls, whats not to love?

												It's short. I managed to get 100& completion in roughly 6h20m (played the second half of the game in offline mode, if you're wondering why my playtime isn't). While the gameplay is really solid, the art is wonderful and the music is great I don't feel like it really manages to compensate for the short length of the game which makes this a bit hard to recommend.So I'll settle for this: If you enjoy platformers and is looking for a new game to play you'll enjoy this. If you already got stuff to play in your backlog then wait a while with this one.			"

												This game is very fun with new content, great platforming, and the visuals you got a good game. When you get near the end it feels lacking and the bosses seem like a joke with you finding the little cliche they have in store it puts the games fun factor down and the game feels unfinshed just like the title saying half hero( its half of a game). Like the game is going to be like a long experence quckly rushes the end and leaves you wanting more. I found all the items and 100% the game in 8 hours not even touching one of the other titles it was rather easy. I loved this game with its humor and unique characters but they just showed up and then they were gone. I really wish to see more of the giga mermaid mabay she could of helped you in the end. I would recommend this game if you like the series. With its price it seems not worth it to some but it was a good game and I had fun and thats all that matters.			"

												I enjoyed this game a great deal.  For me...Pros: Good platform jumping game play. (Somewhat challenging at times but always fun.)Smooth controls. (Every death was my own fault and I never felt I was fighting against the controls.)Excellent art style/graphics that felt vibrant and immersive. (The world that I saw seemed deep and detailed.) Enjoyable/Whimsical characters and a tongue in cheek story line. (It IS silly but it has an infectious cheerfulness to it.)Very good music throughout the game.  (Some of the stages have really decent scores.)Cons:Short.  (I milked as much as I could out of my first time and only got to about 9 hours. Others will do that in half.)Easy Bosses.  (Although creative and fun they are not going to be much challenge to seasoned players.)Few Stages. (Couple this with ""Short"" above but the world itself is crying out for places for Shantae to visit.)Summary:  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a good 2D platformer.  I enjoyed it very much and had a smile on my face while I played it.  And for its price I'd say its worth it.			"

												I backed this game on kickstarter and have no regrets. The gameplay is fast-paced and highly enjoyable. The main mechanic, transforming, is very well executed and a pleasure to use. This is definitely one of those games that makes you feel powerful, jumping around and whipping things to death with hair attacks and shifting smoothly between whatever forms you need for the task at hand. I played with an XBox 360 USB controller and had no issues whatsoever. You can even rebind the buttons if you want, something not every game offers.The game has a cute but fairly light story, which is honestly perfect for it. It is enough to keep you moving without bogging you down or getting in the way of the main feature, which is the excellent gameplay. Pretty much my only issue with the game is one I knew I'd have going in. I do find the female outfits and character designs a bit silly/fanservicey (personal preference here, not an attack). That said, they don't really exploit that in gross ways like some titles do. Something I read on TVTropes seems pretty true, describing the style as 'sexy but not sexualized'. The only exception I found was the first playthrough of the second level Mermaid Factory. I found that level seriously squicky in a variety of ways.  Seriously, girls tied to some kind of assembly line looking thing, being shoved into cans to be sold (as you find out later) as *food*? That's pretty messed up. Thankfully all the disturbing elements are gone when you come back later. And to be fair this series has always had some squicky elements to its humor. I am generally pretty sensitive to this sort of thing, so if you aren't this may not bother you at all. If you are very sensitve, then, be aware. I still definitely reccommend the game, which I feel has a great deal of heart and is well worth it. I have already beat both normal and hero mode, and am looking forward to the extra content that will eventually be released.EDIT: Something I forgot to mention was the soundtrack, which I found highly enjoyable and perfectly suited to the rhythm of the gameplay. It's all instrumental with the exception of the theme song, 'Dance Through the Danger', which plays during the first run of the first level as well as during the ending credits. That song... well, let's just say that three days after playing it was still getting stuck in my head. xD			"

												The first couple of hours of Half-Genie Hero are really good, but there are problems which become apparent as the game goes on. Pirate's Curse is my all time favourite platforming game, so I concede that I may be judging this game more critically due to the high bar its predecessor set. For the sake of simple formatting, I'll make a pros/ cons list. Pros The OST is really fun and varied - there are some funky, catchy songs mixed in here.  For the most part, the animation is great, especially on Shantae herself. Most of the animations have a certain bounce to them, which compliments the music. The controls feel tight and responsive.  Being able to transform into a bunch of 'Shantae-ified' objects and creatures is really cool. It's certainly swooped in and stolen Momodora 4's '2016's Best Game With A Transforming Anime Girl' award.  The general tone of the game, in terms of presentation and writing, are really light-hearted and upbeat. The game has this sex-positive vibe without taking things too far, and I personally enjoy the sense of humour in the writing (e.g. fourth wall breaking). Cons The level design isn't very intricate. It's too often just a straight shot from left to right, with a few little extras to find here and there. In comparison, Pirate's Curse's levels felt more Metroidvania-ish in design, looping around or reusing rooms in interesting ways.  There's a lack of variety. Since transformations are this game's core mechanic, it's basically just a series of platforming challenges with slightly different rules introduced throughout (e.g. 'you can swim now', 'you can climb walls now'). Again, comparing to Pirate's Curse, those out-the-blue levels, where it turns into a runner, stealth or puzzle game, are almost non-existent.  The game's way too easy, and I'm not a person who usually cares or complains about challenge. There's just such an abundance of healing items, and enemies do so little damage. There came a point where I wasn't really engaging with boss fights, but instead just standing there, whipping constantly, because that's all I had to do to win. Once you have Shantae's hair fully upgraded, bikini armour and a few heart containers, enemies may as well not exist.   Some of the transformations feel redundent (and I'm not including the ones which are redundant by design, for comedy). For example, (avoiding spoilers) I feel the first two transformations assigned to D-Up could easily have been combined to be one form. Transforming is a cool mechanic, but with so many, it slows the pace of the game down. I feel as though dropping some forms in favour of fleshing out some other's movesets would've helped the pacing of the game.  The backtracking feels like padding. I don't recall feeling this way about Pirate's Curse, so I'm not sure if there's just more fetch-quests here, or if the level design is part of the reason for this feeling.  The world-building is weaker than past games. The hub area, Scuttle Town, though more refined in terms of utility, feels more restricted and shallow.  There aren't any real narrative stakes. The episodic nature does work, but there isn't really anything tying it all together (unlike Pirate's Curse, with both Risky's and the Ammo Baron's plotlines). I was hoping the new town genie would play a larger role, but that narrative thread ends way too early.  I feel bad for writing so many negative opinions about the game. Again, I think I'm biased towards being critical because I hold Pirate's Curse really highly. I appreciate that Half-Genie Hero tried something a little different, rather than just rehashing the last game. It's obvious that I'd recommend Pirate's Curse above this game, but I honestly think it comes down to preference. Overall, it's still a fun platformer with an upbeat atmosphere and some compelling gameplay mechanics.			"

												The sole reason I reinstalled Steam and it was worth it. Great quality platforming game. Every movements and actions are fun and enjoyable. Also visually satisfying, pleasure to hear the music and voice acting (though it's pretty rare). Recommend for anyone who loves megaman but was disappointed by that s***y mighty something... (silly I mean)			"

												I really enjoyed Shantae and the Pirates Curse but this game seems to be a total bore compared to it.Do not get me wrong, it's well made. But I'ven't seen as much hand holding ina game as this. You have a spell that shields you from almost everything, and then you have a spell that heals you completely. On top of that, if you go around and collect all the keys to unlock the concept art gallery you'll get an item that gives you unlimited magic! Why so much hand holding? The Final boss is a joke by the way, regardless if the game has 2 endings (I think squid baron was harder) I like the art of the game, it's not pixel art it's stylized and it works nicely. The voice acting is pretty much ... the same (wish there was more) There are some very tedious sliding levels, while the first one is ok, the second one is ok, I thought the last one was pushing it. Not in terms of skill level but rather how long it was, I ended up basically memorizing it to completion. And backtracking is another thing, there's virtually no reward for finding items in this game because you buy an item to make your hair do more damage. You buy a spell to completely heal you. You buy this, you buy that. The items that you find are usually worthless. The spider form is only useful in like 2 areas so why does it even have an attack? On top of all of this the game lacks the comedy aspect that was delivered in The pirates curse. It's just so bland I found myself just trying to complete it as fast as possible. I'm only recommending because I still liked the game, it's just a slight dissapointment to the shantae franchise.			"

												The dialog in this game is pretty funny, and everything about it screams nostalgia. The form switching is quick and easy and doesn't hinder you if you like to play at a fast pace. I can see speed runners spending a lot of time with this one.			"

												Every since I heard they were developing this game, I've been so excited to play it. When it finally came out, I bought it right away and jumped in. Such fun gameplay and it feels so much more smooth than it's prequels. The soundtrack is on point and one of my favourite parts about the game along with the art style.I'm looking forward to playing Risky's campaign when it comes out. I cannot reccomend this game more!			"

												This is an amazing game and everything I wanted from a platformer! The characters are very charismatic, the mechanics are solid and the script made laugh many times. The design of the stages also really impressed me. I usually don't like games with backtracking, but it was masterfully done in this game. The barriers are not obvious. They're not something you look at and say ""ok, i'll have to come back later"". That is because, as you get new abilities, you start looking at the stages with different eyes, and understanding the possibilities. IMHO, this is a masterclass in game design and the best platformer on steam. Can`t wait for more. 10/10.			"

												Were you disapointed by Mighty Number 9?  Well look no further then Shantae: Half-Genie Hero for an example of how both kick starters and platformers can be done well.  I didn't much care for the original Shantae, and thought Risky's Revenge was only just okay.  I did love Pirate's Curse, but when I heard this Shantae was going back more to its roots with the dance transformations I admit to having been concerned.  I was also worried about the art style, which looked much more cartoony then the previous games, as well as all the 3d elements which felt unnecessary in a 2d platformer.I'm VERY happy to say all my fears were unfounded.  This game is FANTASTIC.  You can really tell these developers are learning from each of their releases, with each one taking the best of the previous games, dropping the bits that no one cared for, and then just further expanding and refining everything people liked.  S:HGH has the speed and creativity of Pirates curse, while making the transformations finally into something fun, something I looked forward to getting.  The music is as fantastic as ever, while the art, while admittedly more cartoony, looks incredible and really feels like it fits.  Even the 3d is used in just the right proportions such that it actually feels like it adds instead of takes away from the experience.Wayforward has officially gone from a little developer I wanted to see succeed, to one whose legitimately earned my trust and support going forward through top notch quality content that.  If you like platformers at ALL, you owe it to yourself to give this game a chance.  If you didn't like Pirates Curse, I'm not sure this game will change your mind, but if you felt the original and Risky's Revenge were over hyped, I strongly urge you to give this one a chance.			"

												This game is worth the 20$ I spent. I'm a Huge fan of the new visuals. Shantae's model is adorable...well all the female characters are adorable both their models and illustrations. It's so clean, crisp, and very colorful. With this new style, details like facial expression are very easy to see on these new models. Every character looks amazing. The characters/items really standout from the background. So it doesn't matter if you are playing this on a teeny tiny screen or your 55"" screen in the family room, it's going to look great. The game ran smoothly.Everything Shantae does looks good. Same goes for enemies. There were some hiccups, not like lag or anything but some blinks of color in spots of the screen. This could be fault with something in the game or something on my end.The levels were well designed. Many of them seem to be designed for several ways of navigation up until end in the event you miss some transformation or moves hidden along the way. On the topic of transformations. I enjoyed all but one, the one I'd have to say it is nothing more than a joke. I found the levels to be moderately difficult and some small spots kind of hard. Part of me wishes most was hard but at the same time given the number of times I treked back and forth in levels, I think perhaps moderate is for the best. If you are into time trials be it just finishing as fast as possible, getting all unlocks, or going for 100%(buying all shop items) There levels are large enough that they take a good amount of memorization and creativity to navigate them as quickly/efficiently as possible.This game also rewards those have keen eyes for finding things in the levels/taking the time to get them. I found the Mermaid level to be my favorite level. Lots of jumps, its really big. Really pretty and cute. Spoiler, don't read unless you played game  So sad that all the girls are gone after beating the boss, the level loses much of its charm, it would of been nice to have Mermaids/village girls in the background overseeing those croc guys on the hooks instead of the girlsThe last game's levels were bigger and everything was conencted. There was a lot more exploring. I really liked that bout the last game. I could care less for it all being connected but I really love big levels that can be explored because it really makes you feel like you found stuff rather than it just being inevitable that you'd come across it. I feel like Shantae's amazing hairproducts overshadowed the offensive spells, fire and electricity a bit. I would wager that if there were no basic atk upgrades that the fire and lightning spells would feel very relevant. In contrast to the shield and pike(swirling DPS) which can be used with your basic atks. Nonetheless its good to have variety. xD I almost never found out what they were because the last game stuff like that were consumables rather than learned abilities lol.I ended up getting all of the acheivements for this game. I beat it 3 times. 1st playthrough was 7hrs long 100%. The 2nd was 3hrs20min long, 100%, while the 3rd was 2hrs 14min 88%. The game was really enjoyable. I did leave wanting more. i felt that it was a bit short. Honestly I think whether it was a legit 20hr+ game or not, I'd still be left wanting. I'm looking forward to Risky's DLC which gives her, her very own campaign and unique abilities. So I will definitely be playing that whenever it comes out.Unfortunately I wasn't a backer because it ended by the time I even learned of this game. Seeing some of the other stretch goals really makes me pray this game does well and perhaps does some of them.Playing as Rottytops, Sky, or Bolo all with their own unique moves sounds amazing. A new chapter (who doesn't love more playable content.) Lastly animated cutscenes that are fully voice....................*drools*   Realistically I hope for the chapter and characters the most.The stretch goals that were not met I'd definitely pay for if they were DLC. So my only 2 real complaints are these.1 I already covered, I wish the game was longer.2 I wish some of the transformations we gained had more time to shine with much larger parts of the levels dedicated to them. Some of them were pretty neglected. The underwater ones, flying, and most definitely the spider.*3 need more Mermaids.All in all this a great game that I would recommend getting. I hope it does well and that they support it in the future.I've been stepping away from larger companies/AAA and been playing more games from smaller studios and I have been very happy with that choice.

												Straight-forward and fun.Some people may find the title lacking in the exploration department, but that does not mean this game is unenjoyable.Far from it, the pacing is well executed and there's always something to do immediately in short bursts after a main mission, such as seeking a hidden object or extra heart container or key item.Grab it when you can, have a solid 6 hours playthrough.You won't be disappointed.Well, I guess you can be disappointed if a game is ""too short"" for you.

												I totally enjoyed Shantae: Half-Henie Hero!  I played through it three times for around 20 hours to complete all achievements, and I would love to play more.Pros:+ fun platforming+ metroidvania character development and backtracking+ fantastic music+ fun, light-hearted story+ ""Roy age 24"" fan artThe only difficulty spike I ran into was fairly early in the game when I had low health; otherwise, I found the game to have just enough challenge to force me to learn patterns and enemy behaviors, but not so tough that I got frustrated.I highly recommend this game!

												If you want to play this game because of the Metroidvania style of the previous games in the series, prepare to be disappointed. But not in a bad way, by any means. This game is something else rather, more of a cross between Megaman X  and old-school Castlevania.Areas are broken up into fairly linear levels that must be re-played when you unlock more abilities in order to explore various branching paths previously unavailable to you on the first run. However, you're never forced to play any stage from beginning to end more than once, as you can get the ability to warp between all 3 parts of level and also drop out of the level at any time, keeping whatever new items you've grabbed. While it sounds a bit tedious to backtrack, the aforementioned warping plus the added mobility of your new transformation abilities really cut down on the time it takes to backtrack.The story plays out like a day in the life of Shantae, with all the offbeat humor and cute babes intact from the rest of the series. It's nothing revolutionary, but it makes a lot of shout outs for longtime fans of the series, in addition to serving as a great introduction to the world of sequin land for those who haven't played Shantae before.Overall, it's a fun game with loads of speedrunning potential. It would be apt to compare it to something like a theme park ride. A rather long wait for an ultimately short experience, but with theming and entertainment so good, I can't help but want to go again sometime later. Speaking of which, I'm looking forward to the upcoming DLC for Risky mode + Sky/Bolo/Rotty mode, which should further add replayability to this joyride of a game.			"

												Shantae's first HD adventure is a stunning game to look at and listen to, and for a solid 90% of the game it's a blast to play.  However it's pretty short, and there are some BAD difficulty spikes towards the end.  Still, if you have some money to blow and aren't against shorter games, Half-Genie Hero is still a great way to spend an afternoon or two.Pros/Cons+Outstanding visuals+Killer OST+Writing is very funny at times+Lots of great set pieces+Best looking 2D bosses I've seen in years-Rough difficulty spikes towards the end-Backtracking isn't as fun as it was in Pirate's Curse-Some of the transformations you get are underused-One of the transformations you are forced to use frequently controls terribly-Pretty short and no real reason to replay except for achievements			"

												WayForward did a good job working out this game.  In comparison to previous titles in the Shantae series, this one has the least ""clunkiness"" feel to it.  The game feels better streamlined.I will also say, the game will feel easy.   Once you are decently equipped with pick-ups and upgrades, the game and boss fights do get easier.  This game is built around the same premises that keeps Super Metroid in the spotlight.  Super Metroid has good replayability and is as challenging as you make it.  Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, all the same.  This game is as challenging as you make it.  If you don't want the last fights too easy, don't collect everything or put everything to full use.  Find your own challenges.The story is great and worth reading through, even though you can skip through it for a speed run.  I find the story is well balanced and fun.All being said, previous games had a Metroidvania feel.  This game is more like the Mega Man X series where you replay levels to pick up items hidden in each level.I fully recommend playing this game and the other 2 Shantae games available on Steam.  The original game is Shantae for the Game Boy Color, and WayForward has not ported or remastered it for a modern console or PC.  And this game is also the 4th game in the series, not a reboot.			"

												A stellar game that it's backers should feel proud to have supported.Shantae: Half Genie Hero excels in just about every category. The level design is superb, the music is fantastic, the visuals are gorgeous, and the characters are likable. Add those with one of the most unique and well-designed protagonists in gaming, and you get one of the finest games of the year. Unlike the previous installments, Shantae travels via map rather than a connected overworld. Keep this in mind if you were expecting more of a Metroidvania style game. Each area of the map counts as a chapter, with each chapter having a seperate plot, making it somewhat akin to Kirby Super Star. Assuming the player is a completionist, the game shold take roughly around 6-8 hours. Some may feel this is too short, but for me personally, I think it's fair for it's price. I do wish, however, that Risky Boot's story was availabe at purchase, and that Hero Mode gave the player access to ALL of Shantae's transformations and transformation attacks. Other than that, I find it hard to find any notable criticisms with the game itself. What I think this game really did well at was achieving it's own identity. For me, it didn't feel like ""a Mega Man game"" or ""a Metroidvania"" game. It felt like a SHANTAE game, which is something that Risky's Revenge and The Pirate's Curse, as good as those games are, felt like they were lacking in my opinion.Buy this game. It's great.			"

												This game is amazing. The art style is fairly unique, the level design is fresh, and the backtracking system is great, with previous stages changing scenery to add a new twist on the stage coming back to it. It is very fluid to change forms from the monkey to the elephant, and there is a new relic system where the transformations get secondary abilities that suit different playstyles. The music. I mean, THE MUSIC is so good, with upbeat tracks that will make you hum and won't let you stop. If you are a platforming fan, please consider buying this game (this is how a kickstarter game should be).			"

												Just bought and finished the basic game in about 6 and a half hours, Merry Christmas to me. It was the $18 price tag for the release special, but it would be $20 normally. I would recommend trying to find it on sale if you can.It was pretty good. I had a lot of fun playing it and I'm glad to be adding it to my Shantae collection. It's a little bit expensive for the length, but I think it will be much more worth the price when all of the rest of the Kickstarter-promised features get added in. Like I said, I recommend it on sale and mostly to fans of Shantae.If you own previous Shantae games, you should probably get it. If you haven't played a Shantae game before, I recommend you get Shantae and the Pirate's Curse much more.Warning: My review perspective will involve a lot of comparisons to Risky's Revenge (RR) and the Pirate's Curse (TPC) since I played all three this year.It also has a lot of gripes and may come off as slightly negative.Gameplay:The main way it deviates from the previous two Shantae games is that the levels are much more linear. Each level is divided into 2 or 3 separated sections that you have to sift through to get the collectables. It's much closer to TPC's island levels than RR's single connected overworld. No more dungeons, which is a little disappointing because I really like the previous games' dungeon designs. I think it completely loses its status as Metroidvania, even though TPC wasn't very Metroidvania. But that's fine.I felt that the platforming suffered. Shantae runs slightly too slow and jumps slightly too short to be satisfying. Platforming only felt good in monkey form. And unfortunately, transforming from human to monkey repeatedly was not great. It was much more jarring compared to RR's dance transforms because it requires more complicated inputs and briefly pauses the game. The platforming with Risky's items in Pirate's Curse can't be outdone.The dance system felt sort of ""crowdfundy"" with a bunch of transformations thrown in just because they could. However the transformations were generally really fun to use once you got used to it, even if some were a bit too niche. My favorites were the monkey and crab mechanics.Combat was solid. The character hitboxes and attacking animations were super smooth and fluid. The max attack speed upgrade surpassed my xbox button pressing abilities, which is kind of absurd.  It also added the spellcasting system back from RR which is fun, but pretty much optional for most of the game. Upgrades allow you to become completely overpowered very quickly.Boss designs were pretty good, all had pretty cool designs and unique mechanics. However, I did not have very much fun with the final boss, or the final level design in general.The overall difficulty is pretty low. It was the easiest of the three Shantae games I played.Story:I think it was almost a soft reboot?The story was okay. I felt like it was clearly ""crowdfundy,"" meaning it was kind of garbled to fit a desired checklist. I had no idea what my main storyline motivation was for the first 80% of the game and I had to get invested in these little villain-of-the-week episodic stuff. But the episodic stuff was fun and amusing, so I was able to roll with it, even though some of the subplots weren't fleshed out enough. Shantae has never been known for its gripping story line, but I didn't think it was as good as the last two games.Characters:As with every Shantae game, the characters are super appealing. They are as endearing, flirty, and ridiculous as I expect out of Wayforward. The dialogue writing is clever and funny. My one big gripe is that all of the Sequin Town NPCs are just there to bombard you with hints for progression, which feels wrong. Also, some of the great characters don't get a long enough exposure because the story is so scattered.Music:Virt's work is godtier. No exeptions. I downloaded the OST (free on his Bandcamp!) immediately.Artstyle:The art is great overall. The character and world designs are top notch, and together with the music it makes a very pretty package. Sometimes the 2-D/3-D mix is a little jarring.			"

												Being a long time fan of Wayforward, I was thrilled to finally play ""Shantae and the pirate's curse"" on the Wii U back a few years ago. I've always enjoyed their use of 2d and superb animation. When I see Wayforward listed as the developer I know I've got a good looking retro game coming my way. Then I heard the new one was going to be done in 3d using cell shading. I got very worried....but Wayforward managed to keep their mojo while moving into the third dimension.We have been given a beautiful game, with drop jaw graphics...wow that mermaid boss. It also plays well, very responsive. Also still in tact is all the charm and silliness. Cute in jokes from previous games show up, a knod to long time fans. Unfortunately it is kinda short, I think shorter than Pirates curse. There is some replay value though, the collect-a-thon is always present, and the game offers treats for those who run perfect sequences.But if you love the other games, you will like this one.			"

												I'll keep this brief. The newest game in the Shantae series is a sure winner. Wayforward has outdone themselves in many ways with this game.The visuals are fantastic. They're clean, crisp and colorful, and the animations are really smooth for virtually every character onscreen.The audio is amazing. The compositions by Jake Kaufman are perfect to get you in the proper mood for the level and the challenge ahead. Sound effects are well done and avoid being annoying. What little voice acting is here is well done and makes me wish the voice acting stretch goal was met.Controls are spot on. Rest assured that if you get hit by an enemy or if you fall off a cliff, it's 99.9% your fault and not the controls acting up. Playing on a keyboard is alright, but a bit annoying, so I recommend using a controller for this game.The game structure is different from previous Shantae games, as it is level-based instead of metroidvania style. This allows for stronger platforming, but somehow makes the unavoidable backtracking a bit more annoying that previous entries.Using Shantae's abilites is way smoother and faster than in past games. No longer is it a chore to, for example, transform into a monkey, climb a wall, transform back into Shantae to fight an enemy, transform back into a monkey to climb more walls, then back to Shantae, then to an elephant to break a wall, then back to Shantae. The various upgrades and special powers also make the gameplay varied and more fun for all.Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is more platformer than metroidvania. It loses on fun exploration, but gains better platforming challenges. It doesn't feel as cohesive as Pirate's Curse, and the individual stories don't get enough time to develop, but it's charming to see these new, individual sides of the world. Maybe in a future game we will see a better story, but as a whole package, I found it completely satisfying.My score: 8/10			"

												This game is really great for hardcore gamers and casual alike! If you like Mega Man or Metriod then this game is for you. The visuals are really good to its like your playing an anime. And one of my favorite features is that is great for 100% completioners like myself! Overall I give this game a 9.5/10 or 10/10! "

												Like always, I enjoyed the writing and quirky story behind Shantae series from Wayforward. I played Shantae games for the comedy and how the characters developed around them. (better to play the previous series if you never played Shantae series before)However on this 1/2 genie sequel, I found that a bit of everything kind of washed out a bit. Still the graphic is excellent (even though I experience diagonal screen tear in my laptop) but it's undeniable that the game is beautiful and the animations are smooth.But for some reason, I felt that this time, the game ends too early (unlike the the pirate curse) and story even though still full with funny memorable moments but it felt too short and suddenly before you know it the game is already ended. The gameplay is also a bit too easy this time with a very easy puzzle and easy bosses... (especially if you go for 100% completion)But still overall, even though this is not the best of the Shantae series for me (so far the best is still the Pirate Curse IMHO), the game is still highly enjoyable nonetheless.Hopefully next time, Wayforward can come out with a better Shantae game series with longer story, challenging puzzle, platformer and bosses but with the same charming aesthetic of 1/2 genie hero. :)			"

												Overall a very enjoyable side scroller. HD Graphics are very good and a lot more enjoyable than I expected going in.  Light on story but great mechanics/solid gameplay. It seems to have lost a bit of the exploration that the older versions seemed to have in my opinion though, opting for more of an arcade stage game than a continuous world like the others. To me that was disappointing, but whether that matters to you may just be personal preference.  It is a short game, as in 15 hours I have played through twice. Once with 99 percent completion and once with 100 percent. Low replay value in my mind, but definitely another good Shantae game from Wayforward.			"

												Coming from a guy who has played, beat and loved Pirates Curse aswell as Risky's Revenge I can say without a doubt this is one of the very best indie series i have every had the pleasure of playing. With all of the additions that they have made from previous titles in the series, Great visual effects, and the comedy that still has me laughting everytime I boot up Half-Genie Hero. All I can say is Thank you WayForward for giving us this great series and I am looking forward to the Risky DLC in the future.			"

												This game is worth the 20$ I spent. I'm a Huge fan of the new visuals. Shantae's model is adorable...well all the female characters are adorable both their models and illustrations. It's so clean, crisp, and very colorful. With this new style, details like facial expression are very easy to see on these new models. Every character looks amazing. The characters/items really standout from the background. So it doesn't matter if you are playing this on a teeny tiny screen or your 55"" screen in the family room, it's going to look great. The game ran smoothly.Everything Shantae does looks good. Same goes for enemies. There were some hiccups, not like lag or anything but some blinks of color in spots of the screen. This could be fault with something in the game or something on my end.The levels were well designed. Many of them seem to be designed for several ways of navigation up until end in the event you miss some transformation or moves hidden along the way. On the topic of transformations. I enjoyed all but one, the one I'd have to say it is nothing more than a joke. I found the levels to be moderately difficult and some small spots kind of hard. Part of me wishes most was hard but at the same time given the number of times I treked back and forth in levels, I think perhaps moderate is for the best. If you are into time trials be it just finishing as fast as possible, getting all unlocks, or going for 100%(buying all shop items) There levels are large enough that they take a good amount of memorization and creativity to navigate them as quickly/efficiently as possible.This game also rewards those have keen eyes for finding things in the levels/taking the time to get them. I found the Mermaid level to be my favorite level. Lots of jumps, its really big. Really pretty and cute. Spoiler, don't read unless you played game  So sad that all the girls are gone after beating the boss, the level loses much of its charm, it would of been nice to have Mermaids/village girls in the background overseeing those croc guys on the hooks instead of the girlsThe last game's levels were bigger and everything was conencted. There was a lot more exploring. I really liked that bout the last game. I could care less for it all being connected but I really love big levels that can be explored because it really makes you feel like you found stuff rather than it just being inevitable that you'd come across it. I feel like Shantae's amazing hairproducts overshadowed the offensive spells, fire and electricity a bit. I would wager that if there were no basic atk upgrades that the fire and lightning spells would feel very relevant. In contrast to the shield and pike(swirling DPS) which can be used with your basic atks. Nonetheless its good to have variety. xD I almost never found out what they were because the last game stuff like that were consumables rather than learned abilities lol.I ended up getting all of the acheivements for this game. I beat it 3 times. 1st playthrough was 7hrs long 100%. The 2nd was 3hrs20min long, 100%, while the 3rd was 2hrs 14min 88%. The game was really enjoyable. I did leave wanting more. i felt that it was a bit short. Honestly I think whether it was a legit 20hr+ game or not, I'd still be left wanting. I'm looking forward to Risky's DLC which gives her, her very own campaign and unique abilities. So I will definitely be playing that whenever it comes out.Unfortunately I wasn't a backer because it ended by the time I even learned of this game. Seeing some of the other stretch goals really makes me pray this game does well and perhaps does some of them.Playing as Rottytops, Sky, or Bolo all with their own unique moves sounds amazing. A new chapter (who doesn't love more playable content.) Lastly animated cutscenes that are fully voice....................*drools*   Realistically I hope for the chapter and characters the most.The stretch goals that were not met I'd definitely pay for if they were DLC. So my only 2 real complaints are these.1 I already covered, I wish the game was longer.2 I wish some of the transformations we gained had more time to shine with much larger parts of the levels dedicated to them. Some of them were pretty neglected. The underwater ones, flying, and most definitely the spider.*3 need more Mermaids.All in all this a great game that I would recommend getting. I hope it does well and that they support it in the future.I've been stepping away from larger companies/AAA and been playing more games from smaller studios and I have been very happy with that choice.

												Caution: While my end result is that I do recommend the game, I do not heavily recommend it like I would with snap-buy titles.I've enjoyed Shantae throughout the years. Pirate's Curse is, to me, the best game of the series and sadly, Half-Genie Hero does not surpass that game's level. It has too many flaws for that.For one, the past games had a sense of exploration. Big worlds which you'd discover all kinds of new things in when going through them later on, metroidvania style. Half-Genie Hero...tries to have that, but the worlds are just so tiny. There's a feeling that there should be more, but there simply isn't.The end-game also has a very strong ""Collect 10 Bear Asses"" feel to it. Just padding to make the game last a bit longer for those who want to get the proper ending. While it is a tradition for Shantae games to do something like that, it never felt as obvious as it does here. Then there's the various forms you can take. Some just feel a bit tacked on, like the Spider form which you need only for one little thing, and is never needed again except for an achievement. The Crab form also feels redundant with the Mermaid form around, with only a very few small things ensuring you must use it.Finally, the game is on the short side. 7.5 hours for 100% completion without actually rushing through the game...it's not horribly short, but I had hoped for longer.Having said that, these aren't huge problems. The gameplay itself is smooth as ever, perhaps even smoother than before. The flow of most of the game is perfect, the enemies are nice and varied, the level design itself, while small, is very well done, so gameplay wise there's nothing really wrong with the game.The graphics are also top notch. A lot of work has gone into the animation and it shows, the game looks fabulous. The music also helps, the ever-present ear worms keep up a great tone.Finally, the absurd and hilarious conversations are, as ever, another highlight of the game. It does refer it's predecessors a fair bit which might be annoying if this is your first Shantae, but even for those people there's plenty of good humor to go around.All in all, I think that this game's biggest problem is the existence of Pirate's Curse. That game set a very high bar that Half-Genie Hero falls just short of. I definitely do not regret the purchase, I had just hoped for a bit more after the kickstarter and the various postponings. The game is technically very well done, it just lacks that bit of punch.7/10.			"

												I would say this game is overall very good. It was a tough task to follow up the Pirates Curse, and I didn't expect a masterpiece.First of all, the music and graphics are simply great. The trailer gives you a pretty good impression of what this was going to be in that regard and I'm really loving it. The gameplay feels smoother overall than previous entries and they improved on the transformations, making the process less time consuming.That said, the transformations are my first big negative. We get a mix of old and new, but really they  break the flow of the game. That's an issue previous games had already, but it feels a lot more pronounced in this one. If you want to move efficiently through levels you will change forms a lot, and that can be a bit annoying at times. Not terrible, but I would say the older games handled this better, probably because this one has more transformations, and quite a few aren't really that useful.Similarly the backtracking feels worse in this one, probably because you only have 5 leveles plus Risky's Hideout. Going back to the same level, with minor changes when you enter the 2nd time, over and over just doesn't feel satisfying. Even worse every level basically consists of 2 main screens with secrets dispersed in between them plus a boss battle.The biggest issue for me is that everything feels so segmented. The stories of the bosses don't really have anything to do with the main plot, the levels, due to the select screen, feel just like that: levels and not a connected world. I just feel like they could have done a lot better by connecting the villains and give us pointless connection roads. Yes they take more time and can be annoying, but they make the gameworld feel connected.The levels themselves are absolutely great. They just feel well designed and fun to play, if you weren't forced to play them quite as often (if you want to get 100% of course). The bosses are also very creative, and some kind of boss rush at the end would have been really fun.Overall, I would certainly recommend this game to anyone who likes fun platformers. It's a little too easy for my tastes and could be better, but it's fun and that's what matters the most.			"

												Shantae: Half-Genie Hero has a lot of charm and I love the stylization. I really like how you can transform into different animals to get through obstacles from being a monkey climbing walls, to a harpy that can flap flap flap. Its a Average platformer at best, as the game has a lot of backtracking and how the difficulty scale goes from very easy to a super hard, flappy bird like final level. I think that kind of killed the fun for me, (especially that final level.) The game is under 10 hours, even finding all the secrets. I think they could have put a few more levels to help the difficulty scale, maybe make them progressivly harder.			"

The levels are gigantic, and secrets are not too difficult to find if you put in the effort.

												This game is a great step forward for the series, and the previous entry was already pretty good. The new semi-3D graphics look awesome and are put to great use. Shantae gets a lot of forms and they all feel more organic and useful than they did in Risky's Revenge (probably thanks to the level design). Zelda-dungeons have been replaced with more megaman-style linear levels, which you could go either way on; my feeling is that the levels are much more fun and tightly-paced, and they have much better setpieces.There is a lot of mandatory backtracking, but it's not any worse than the previous games (especially if you get the warp dance). Usually by the time it wants you to return to a level a few new enemies have been added you have new forms to find hidden items in it.The only criticism I can think of is that the story is kinda all-over-the-place. Instead of pursuing an overarching ""gather X plot coupons"" goal you jump back and forth between unrelated plotlines that each last one level, while occasionally fetching an item for your uncle's machine from a previous level. But it still has fun characters and cute dialog, so it's ok.			"

												WayForward comes through with another great game in the Shantae series.Pros:The game is quite gorgeos, with great levels, characters and bosses.The bosses are all very unique and each one has a gimmick Great soundtrack, found myself liking every song in every stageLots of power ups. You'll be grabbing dances, and relics and upgrading said relics.Lots of secrets to unlock in the different levels.Cons:Wish there were a few more levels to this gameA lot of backtracking. Since there are parts of a level you won't have access until you pick up a certain item later on, you'll have to keep going back to different levels repeatedly. But with the Warp Dance, you can at least skip to the different acts once you've cleared the level.A bit of grinding. To get EVERYTHING in the shop, you'll have to do a bit of grinding.Overall: 4/5 stars. Easy recommendation especially for 20 dollars. Instead of wasting that money on a pizza that you will just poop out later, buy Shantae 1/2 Genei Hero.			"

												I saw the first trailer for this game approximately one year ago, long after the kickstarter campaign had finished.I deeply regret not having been a part of crowdfunding this amazing game.As a gamer well into my 30s, I absolutely adore retro-style platformers; they inspire memories of sitting around the couch with friends trying to get past the Gutsman level in Megaman. Truth be told, I hand't been this excited or looking forward to a game like it since the release of Ori and the Blind Forest.I was blown away by the fluid, gorgeous hand-drawn animation style, the music was upbeat and perky, and the gameplay made for a classic metroidvania approach that never felt repetitive. My only quip with the game is I felt it was a little too short (given its approximate 7-hour initial runthrough), feeling it could have expanded so much more, but overall a very fun experience.If you're having second doubts about buying this game, don't. It's very much worth the price tag, delivering every promise it every made during its funding and then some.I can only hope there will be more Shantae games in the forseeable future.Cheers.			"

This game is funny, colourful, well animated and just plays great. I don't have many complaints but I personally prefer being able to freely move around scuttle town like in the old games and the mane bad guys are the same as the other games exept one. (I mean the villains not the boss fights) but any complaints I could possibly come up with pale in comparison to just how good this game plays and how lovable the characters are.			"

In particular, I would like to see future DLC or an update give her more dance animations, like in previous games. I'm glad this got kickstarted, and I especially look forward to the DLC that lets you play the other characters, which was a reached goal in the kickstarter campaign.			"

 Shantae 1/2 genie hero is a very enjoyable game with a wonderful art style, which in my opinion should be the standard for 2-D platformers from now on, and with a phenomaonal spund track with wonderul characters to boot. Sadly tough the game. for me, is not without its problems. Shantae's story is nothing to write home about with some humorous writing, ill give it that, but sadly not much more. The story is weak and uninteresting apart from some cool characters and nostalgia from the older shantae games. The game is also not the best platformer I have played. Alll tough the games has great controls and shantae is wonderfuly animated. The game can not stand on itself by just having good controls. The game suffers from some wierd level deisgn issues and som incredibly frustrating boss patters. that does not mean shantae is however quite easy for a platforming game. The game gives you so much to work with that you should never feel the game is too hard to finish. It is a great beginner entry tough for the series and bring people easily into the series. Its a great starting point. But with all its flaws I still recommend shantae based on both the astethic and simply that it is not that bad of a game. the biggest issue to me is the content available at its current price (06. january 2017) The game is quite expensive for what it gets but may be worth its asking price later with DLC or extra content. Maybe wait for a price drop.Shantae 1/2 genie hero is great example of a kickstarter project becoming a good product. Not a perfect game but good enough.  7/10  "

												Beautiful animations and gorgeous designs, this is definitely one of the prettiest 2.5D sidescrollers I've seen in a while. Visually, this game, is so vibrant and joyous to watch, it simply leaves you feeling good.The music is also nice and simple, having a sort of retro feel to it without the exclussive use of 8-bit samples. It feels very Early-Sonic-ish at some points, wich is high praise considering that the early Sonic games had nice, catchy and energetic tunes for each level to give emphasis to the rapid action.The game controls very much like most 2D platformers, the controls are fast and responsive and after only a few minutes they will feel like second nature. This game also adds a bit of variety with transformations, meaning that as you progress through the game you will gain the ability to transform into a variety of cratures with different abilities, but I won't spoil too much about that. This mechanic adds to the value of each level, as when you return to them with your new transformation abilities, after you played for a while, you will be able to explore more areas that you couldn't before.Now, the game in total is not all that long, in fact if you are really into it and don't do much of exploring around each level, you could easily get to the end in the same day you downloaded it. As mentioned before, bacause of the transformations, you will have to do a lot of backtracking, which it can get tedious if you are not into this sort of thing, but discovering little secrets in each level can feel so rewarding at times.Overall, it's a pleasant little game that I highly recomend to people who want a nice platforming expireince, amazing visuals and simple story that doesn't take forever to finish. It just makes me wonder; if the team had a bigger budget (the game was crowd-funded) and maybe more time, what more could have they accomplished.			"

												Full diclosure: I was a Kickstarter backer for this game.  After playing it, I feel like I got my money's worth.Wayforward has a good track record with 2-D platforming games (the other one I have played is Ducktales Remastered).  Half-Genie Hero is a fun, bright, easy-to-pickup game that I recommend to fans of platforming games.  The development team put a lot of effort into ensuring that this was a well-executed, polished, product. Pros: Easy-to-play, fun platforming, interesting special moves/transformations, varied/interesting stages, great soundtrack.  Accessible challenge level that doesn't ever feel unfair - no ""cheap deaths."" Cons:  Sometimes too easy - there is a relic/magic combination that makes the final boss trivial, but you have to do all the legwork to get everything and then realize the combination.  Other thoughts:  I recommend using a controller (my Logitech F310 worked perfectly).			"

It's great for casual players of the metroidvania genre but if you're looking for something more hardcore look elsewhere, this game is a fun casual romp.			"

												First of all great sound track and controls are responsive. The game play is simple and sweet. It took me about 8 hours to beat and thats with running around finding most of the hidden items and forms. The protagonist and all her forms are cute and its fun to see there little animations but some of the forms dont get any really use. Any way fun game to binge on.			"

												Very great graphic, soundtrack, gameplay, and story. Shantae is packed in an entertaining style, funny and new excitement stuffs. If you like platforming, metroidvania style, item collecting, secrets, Shantae will grant your wish on them! No matter whether you are a beginner or not, you'll have some fun!Soundtrack is awesome, will amuse you to the maximum stage!			"

												It's short. I managed to get 100& completion in roughly 6h20m (played the second half of the game in offline mode, if you're wondering why my playtime isn't). While the gameplay is really solid, the art is wonderful and the music is great I don't feel like it really manages to compensate for the short length of the game which makes this a bit hard to recommend.So I'll settle for this: If you enjoy platformers and is looking for a new game to play you'll enjoy this. If you already got stuff to play in your backlog then wait a while with this one.			"

												A stellar game that it's backers should feel proud to have supported.Shantae: Half Genie Hero excels in just about every category. The level design is superb, the music is fantastic, the visuals are gorgeous, and the characters are likable. Add those with one of the most unique and well-designed protagonists in gaming, and you get one of the finest games of the year. Unlike the previous installments, Shantae travels via map rather than a connected overworld. Keep this in mind if you were expecting more of a Metroidvania style game. Each area of the map counts as a chapter, with each chapter having a seperate plot, making it somewhat akin to Kirby Super Star. Assuming the player is a completionist, the game shold take roughly around 6-8 hours. Some may feel this is too short, but for me personally, I think it's fair for it's price. I do wish, however, that Risky Boot's story was availabe at purchase, and that Hero Mode gave the player access to ALL of Shantae's transformations and transformation attacks. Other than that, I find it hard to find any notable criticisms with the game itself. What I think this game really did well at was achieving it's own identity. For me, it didn't feel like ""a Mega Man game"" or ""a Metroidvania"" game. It felt like a SHANTAE game, which is something that Risky's Revenge and The Pirate's Curse, as good as those games are, felt like they were lacking in my opinion.Buy this game. It's great.			"

												It's fun and good. Developers made prefect transition from pixelated graphics to 3D background mixed with cute and colorful 2D characters. Gameplay is solid and rewarding. I love new mechanics implemented in fourth shantae game (its a shame that some of them have only five minuts to shine or only one location then they are useful). I had lots of laughs and great time with this game.However... almost everythink about the story is weak or makes no sense at all. Great example is the way you get ""Light shard"" (look it up if you want since I dont want to include heavy spoilers here). Main story seems great in concept but it seems like devs didnt knew how to support this plot and it is a big waste in my opinion. For example the trapdoor in workshop from the every beginning of the game is never mentioned secound time.Story in previes game ""Shantae and The Pirate curse"" made perfect sense and was done masterfuly. This is nowhere close to it. Even final boss had 2 different fights before, verion when you didnt collected all ""key"" items and when you callected them all. Here the only difference in final boss is minnor colour change.For every newcomer into the world of Shantae I highly recommend first playing previes game and then if you liked it play this one.For everyone that already knows and love Shantae I can recommend this game even if it is not the best story wise it has great gameplay and funny ""shantae styled"" jokes which we always love.I give it:9/10 in graphics8/10 in music7/10 in gameplay4/10 in story10/10 in Shantae as a character :)			"

												Disclaimer-  I backed Shantae:  Half-Genie Hero all the way back in 2013 (gez it's been that long).I'm glad to see Shantae's first HD adventure turn out well. Also great to see a good finished product from a Kickstarter game after other disasters which will remain unnamed in this review.Pros:* Gorgeous design. Great art in the scenery and character sprits. Well composed music and good dialog. The end product is very polished.* Solid platforming gameplay. Really reminds me of the SNES/Genesis golden era of platforming.Cons:* A bit on the short side. ~7-8 hours to complete. Possibly under 3 hours on replays. This includes two chapters added after hitting Kickstarter goals. I stutter to think what the end product would have looked like if those goals weren't hit.* Like past Shantae games, it has a lot of backtracking in it, espcailly if you want to get 100%.* Can't help but feel a tad pervy while playing it.

												What a polished game. It's as simple as that. The graphics are like minature art galleries overlaid and animated with fluitity like niargra falls, the music is inspired, and the gameplay is genuinely fun. But despite that praise, there are some problems with it. There are some akward set pieces, like the sliding sections and the whole of the hypno barons mansion, and with the back tracking one has to do, some places start to get dull as you aproch them in the same way every time, and a lot of the secret sections are just plain dull. I got my game time's worth, but I'd rather the aprochable jorney have had more weight than the collectables. Ultimately, though, this game is a solid good time, where all the good make what little bad there is nearly obsolite.			"

												 Shante Half Genie Hero is absolutely a fun and amazing game. From its great sound track to the puzzles for hidden items. This game really made my time playing it super fun and exciting. The more I played the more fun the puzzles became in each level. The use of transformations was fun and made you think on how you can use them in interesting ways. The sound track was exciting and right in the beginning the first song to come on gave me chills and excitement and I knew I was going to have a great time. The artwork and eye pleasing to look at. Even if Wayforward went away from the bit style the art was new and refreshing I would definitely recommended anyone who wants to play an old style feel game with modern looks.Pros: Super fun levels.Cool and unique transformationsGreat SoundtrackGreat ArtworkCons:Some bosses werenât as challenging as the levels to get thereWish there was more use for certain transformations other than the main ones Overall an amazing game and I would love to see more and definitely back the (if any) future Shante titles Wayforward would like to take on. I donât usually do reviews for games but for my first review Iâm glad it was for Shante Half Genie Hero. Absolutely loved it and want more. "

												Were you disapointed by Mighty Number 9?  Well look no further then Shantae: Half-Genie Hero for an example of how both kick starters and platformers can be done well.  I didn't much care for the original Shantae, and thought Risky's Revenge was only just okay.  I did love Pirate's Curse, but when I heard this Shantae was going back more to its roots with the dance transformations I admit to having been concerned.  I was also worried about the art style, which looked much more cartoony then the previous games, as well as all the 3d elements which felt unnecessary in a 2d platformer.I'm VERY happy to say all my fears were unfounded.  This game is FANTASTIC.  You can really tell these developers are learning from each of their releases, with each one taking the best of the previous games, dropping the bits that no one cared for, and then just further expanding and refining everything people liked.  S:HGH has the speed and creativity of Pirates curse, while making the transformations finally into something fun, something I looked forward to getting.  The music is as fantastic as ever, while the art, while admittedly more cartoony, looks incredible and really feels like it fits.  Even the 3d is used in just the right proportions such that it actually feels like it adds instead of takes away from the experience.Wayforward has officially gone from a little developer I wanted to see succeed, to one whose legitimately earned my trust and support going forward through top notch quality content that.  If you like platformers at ALL, you owe it to yourself to give this game a chance.  If you didn't like Pirates Curse, I'm not sure this game will change your mind, but if you felt the original and Risky's Revenge were over hyped, I strongly urge you to give this one a chance.			"

												Shante: Half-Genie Hero is a good game but it has flaws that kind of ruin the game. But before we talk about those, let's talk about what the game did right first.Disclaimer: While I have only have played through the main story, these are what I like and dislike about the game.PROS:1. The level design. The game is a fairly challenging platformer with some Metroidvania elements added into mix that will keep you on your toes while looking for secrets in stages with it's megaman levels of precise platforming.2. The story. The story revolves around half human and half genie hero Shante helping her uncle build a machine called the Dynamo that will help protect her hometown, but while she is helping her uncle the barons and monsters in the land keep stirring trouble, and it's her job to travel across the land while meeting some very colorful charaters and put a stop to their evil plans.3. The Transformation dances. One of the main gameplay points is Shante's transformation dances, these dances allow her to transform into a multitude of creatures and animals that give specific abilites from swiming underwater with the mermaid to climbing on walls with the monkey and to taking it to the skies with the harpy.4.The bosses. I won't go into much detail on them, but the bosses in the game are very fun and creative, they also provide a unique challenge that make the game more interesting.Now that we covered the pros lets now go over the cons.CONS:1. The game is too short. While the game has good level design and fun bosses, there are only 6 stages in the entire game. Eventough each stage is composed of 4 segments, the game is very short. (It only took me about 8 hours to beat it.)2. 100%ing the game. Do want to know why it took me 8 hours to beat the game? Because I spent most of those 8 hours looking and grinding for all the items and equipment in the game. One of my personal gripes with Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is that completing the game is such a hassle. If you want to complete the game you will have to a METRICâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥TON OF BACKTRACKING since some of the items and stages requrire you to go back to a pevious stage and get a certain power or item(s) to progress. While the warp dance and having a guide to help you will give you less of a headache you still have to backtrack alot.Oh yeah, if you want to get all the achivements in the game, you have to speedrun all theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥3. The Bat and Harpy transformation dances. Do you want to know how to beat half of the game? Go up to a high place and transform into one of these two free passes with wings, The bat and harpy allow you to fly, in a PLATFORMER. While you get the harpy late in the game, the bat transformation is the worst of the two since you can fly horizontal for as long as you want and you can get it in the 2nd stage!Anyway while Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a fun and challenging game with a few issues. I would recommend it to anyone. But I highly recommend the you play it causaly if you don't to deal with the headache of completing the game.			"

												(Edited since the addition of hardcore mode)TL;DR: Good game, but a step back from the previous title. Initially downvoted because of lack of content, and even now I feel like the base game only barely meets the $20 asking price, especially since there will be paid DLC in the future (unless you were a backer in which case it's all free). If you're looking to get into the franchise, I would VERY strongly recommend Pirate's curse instead, or even Risky's Revenge: Director's Cut since Pirate's Curse is a continuation of that story.PROS:-Platforming is fluid and satisfying.-Absolutely amazing soundtrack. Less tracks here than PC, but what is here is golden. My only critique is that the first run of the first level had vocals which I found distracting, but that same track is also played during the credits which is perfectly fine.-Transformations are more fluid than previous games, and there are many more of them.-New art style isn't bad (chibi isn't really my thing personally, I prefer pixel sprites and Inti Creates' art style from Pirate's Curse).-Humorous dialogue. I laughed out loud on multiple occasions.CONS:-Easily my biggest issue is the switch from the metroidvania playstyle. There are no dungeons, no save stations and no open world. HGH plays more like a Megaman game. You have stages divided up into a few areas that give you a save option between them. Stages can be replayed from the beginning to collect upgrades/items previously unattainable, and later on you get the ability to warp ahead to the next area of a stage if what you're looking for is in that area, but there is no backtracking to the previous area in a stage. If you miss something in the previous area you have to restart the entire stage (warp is handy here).-Overall less content than PC, as stated before.-Story is severely lacking. Rather than an overarching plot, HGH consists of several mini-plots, none of which are very interesting.IMO, the game feels like less effort went into building the game and instead that effort went into creating new assets and engine. Probably the reason Pirate's Curse was so awesome was because it reused so many assets from Risky's Revenge, and so much more effort was able to go into the game itself. If so, then I can only hope that the next game turns out to be at least as successful as PC was by reusing assets from HGH.Also, I would absolutely LOVE to see the return of Inti Creates artwork for the next game.

												To start this off since the new update I wanted to say I loved this game even before Hardcore mode came out. I beat it on both normal and Hero mode. The level, item, character design are amazing. The transformations are great and they lay the puzzles out pretty well. But the problem is that I breezed through the game, it was way too easy! But now that Hardcore mode has come out it feels hard and I can actually die to minions now! Before Hardcore mode I only ever died to environmental hazards. I never died to Bosses either.I never really do reviews but I feel like this game deserves it, because even if it was easy it was just that enjoyable. If you have never played the newest installment in the series and are thinking of buying it. Definitely! But if you do and want an actual challenge then go for Hardcore mode right off the bat. I'm not sure if you can go for Hardcore mode right off the bat without beating it once but I really hope you can.			"

												This game was very fun and challenging to play through. Pirate's Curse did feel more difficult in many ways and even though it was fun it felt very different from the other Shantae games since she lost her powers. Half Genie Hero makes the levels feel more fun even if it means some things are slightly easier. You can get overpowered by unlocking the last item in the game which makes the final boss overly easy however the traps that requires Falcon in the final level still makes it a good challenge to beat either way. If anyone has enough guts to do hard mode they basically make the final item that overpowers you useless even if you do bother getting it making the final level much more challenging.			"

												A fantastically well crafted game that is the definition of smooth. Platforming feels nice, killing enemies is fun, and all the animations/visuals flow like melted butter. My only real problem with it is that it gets easier as it goes on (provided you increase your max health and get the bikini armour) and it ends up being very easy to tank damage and just spam attack bosses. However, it makes up for it all with an amazing visual design, smooth gameplay and personality.8/10 - cute girls and jumping is fun			"

												Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is in no way a bad game. It has much of what made the previous Shantae games great, like its fluid animations, great visuals, silly story and amazing music. The gameplay feels fantastic and responsive aswell. But despite the game's numerous positives, one can't help but feel a little disappointed. The metroidvania style world building and levels in the previous titles have been cut for ""chapters"". A chapter consists of several linear stages (go right. for the most part) and side scrollers. There are secrets spread throughout each chapter. Some you can get right away, while others you'll need a certain skill to get to. This forces you to backtrack and revisit chapters, and is a small substitution for the metroidvania styled secrets. This however doesn't make the exploration that enjoyable, as you're forced to run through the stages quite a few times to get everything. There is a dance you can get in the game called ""Warp Dance"", that lets you skip a previously completed stage. This helps getting to a correct stage faster, if you know there is an unacquired secret there. But you will still always start at the very beginning of a stage, so you'll always have to run through the beginning each time you want to visit the area.Another minor disappointment is the absence of a few animations that exists in the game's previous titles. Some examples are the various dance animations, a proper dodge animation, and an idle ""hurt"" animation. Even though they seem minor, and not too important. It all adds up, and more fluid animations helps the atmosphere of the game greatly. However, this doesn't change the fact that the game has quite a few animations already, and of very great quality.One can't help but feel that the game is missing something when coming from Shantae and the Pirate's Curse. There are many small things that if added, would add that little extra bit of polish and quality, and it would help out the game immensely. There are even concept art within the game that shows that there was so much more planned for the game, but for whatever reason was scrapped. If it is because of the lack of money or time isn't easy to tell, but it could also be because of the promises they have to deliver because of the kickstarter.These are however minor flaws. Half-Genie hero is very enjoyable for what it offers. The game oozes ""Shantae"" from the very beginning, and is a treat for every fan of the series. If there is one thing WayForward doesn't get (too) wrong, it's the Shantae titles. And one can tell that they really care about this series.Here's to a successful Risky dlc campaign, and future Shantae titles, because this series is absolutely splendid.			"

												Let me just say it first: yes! The game is pretty good.However, when you played Pirates Curse before, then may not expect a direct sequel to that. I mean, yeah, Storywise it is the continuation of the Shantae francise, but when it comes to gameplay, it's kinda more like Riskys Revenge and the first game on the GBC.And even then it is quite frankly less of a Metroidvania then before. There are no Dungeons anymore for example. Instead you got regular levels who seems more linear at the first sight, and play suprisingly more like the old Mega Man games, with focus of challenging levels with plenty of obstacles to avoid instead of the open nature with a lot of exploration what Shantae used to be (yeah, the old Games had also a lot of tricky platforming, but in this game there are way more bottomless pits and instant death Spikes like in Mega Man as I already mentioned).However, when you unlock more and more transformations (and there are a lot of them, much more then in the old titles) and revisit old areas, which the game forces you on a repeatedly routine, then you realise that there are more and more open areas hidden inside of these levels where you can find new Items and upgrades and such. And because you can buy a move which can warp you through revisited levels and later even unlock a transformation with that you can fly and skip hard platforming, backtracking isn't even that much of a problem anymore. However, there is no more Map that help you to orient, but too be honest, it isn't needed, since the levels are still quite linear.So yeah, the gameplay rocks, but sadly, the Story doesn't. Instead of a fully fletched Story, we got more like a Saturday Morning Cartoon approach with small stories that surround every level and a tiny, tiny main plot that got it's focus at the end of the game, and is pretty predictable to be honest. It's not bad, but kinda dissapointing since Pirates Curse felt more massive beause it was one big story (and the Story in that game was really good!). But that aside: It is really a good game, the second best in the series too be honest. and while I had my problems with the Story,  the gameplay, the really excellent humor and awesome Soundtrack made me forgive this one particular flaw. If you are a Shantae fan: buy this game! If this is you are a newcomer to the francise, hmmm, try Pirates curse first, or even Riskys Revenge so you can tell if you like this Gameplaystyle. But at the end it is indeed a good game!			"

												 Shante Half Genie Hero is absolutely a fun and amazing game. From its great sound track to the puzzles for hidden items. This game really made my time playing it super fun and exciting. The more I played the more fun the puzzles became in each level. The use of transformations was fun and made you think on how you can use them in interesting ways. The sound track was exciting and right in the beginning the first song to come on gave me chills and excitement and I knew I was going to have a great time. The artwork and eye pleasing to look at. Even if Wayforward went away from the bit style the art was new and refreshing I would definitely recommended anyone who wants to play an old style feel game with modern looks.Pros: Super fun levels.Cool and unique transformationsGreat SoundtrackGreat ArtworkCons:Some bosses werenât as challenging as the levels to get thereWish there was more use for certain transformations other than the main ones Overall an amazing game and I would love to see more and definitely back the (if any) future Shante titles Wayforward would like to take on. I donât usually do reviews for games but for my first review Iâm glad it was for Shante Half Genie Hero. Absolutely loved it and want more. "

												After getting all the acheivements (which is fairly easy) I felt a review was needed.Having not played any platformers for a while I found the shantae series on steam and 1st bought Pirate's Curse since it was on sale to see if I liked the series which was a quick yes. I then proceeded to buy this one and had an amazing time playing it. The art is fantastic, the characters are memorable, and gameplay is smooth making combat flow really well. Some of the things you can get are op and eventually you figure out you can bypass some levels with certain dances. There are not a whole lot of levels and they are pretty linear and require some backtracking, doesn't bother me but to some this may be the reason not to buy the game.The only downside really is how short it is.Here are some times I got with playing:1st playthrough (100% eventually): A little more than 6 hours 100% Speedrun: 3 hours 34 minutesSpeedrun (74% and hero mode): 2 hours 5 minutesThe good news is they plan on making dlc so I'll just be waiting for that.Overall a very solid game 9/10Depending on how good the dlc is this may go up			"

Even though that this game was short, it was still a good experience. Half Genie Hero reminds me of a new, better version of Earthworm Jim. If you like playing older, platforming games with good music, this is the right pick for you. This kickstarter was put to great use.			"

												My recommendation for Shantae: 1/2 Genie Hero comes with a caveat, the game might not be worth the price. That's not to say that it feels incomplete. It's just short.Seriously, that is the only problem I have with the game. (Barring some frustration with the ""harpy form"" controls.) That issue forces me to encourage you to buy it, but preferably on sale. This game has excellent production value in all departments, and considering it is an indie game produced through crowd funding, it is easily a paragon of the medium. I think, however, the high production value hurt the product. There likely was enough money to make it look, sound, and play amazingly; but those funds couldn't be stretched to make the game longer, to justify the price, that they need to charge to make their money back. It is a catch-22, and it sucks.Then again you might buy it and think it as worth twenty bucks. I don't know how you feel this is just my opinion. Hopefully they'll make some free dlc, like Yacht Club Games did with Shovel Knight, and it will be enough to make it all worth it. I guess I was just lucky to buy this game during the winter sale.

												Excellent game! The graphics are awesome, with very fluid animations, and the gameplay is great and fun. Unfortunately, the gameplay and mechanics have been simplified a bit (it is more platformer and less metroidvania than previous Shantae games, there are no puzzles or dungeons, and it is much more linear than the previous games). The game has few but long levels, and I think the duration of the game is similar to the previous games; there is a lot of backtracking, but this does not make the game repetitive since you are getting new magic powers all the time, which allow to explore new areas. This is a must-have for all who enjoyed the previous Shantae games.			"

												Shantae is one of my favorite game series of all time. While other reviews will talk about the great level design, the (occasionally) amusing writing, the phenomenal music (thanks to Jake Kaufman). I'd like to talk about the thing I truly love about the shantae series (excluding the original).The game engine in these games is flawless. The greatest crime I feel a platformer can commit in my opinion is have a poor engine. If I ever feel like missing a jump is the game's fault, or some BS pixel perfect jump requirements, then it is a bad platformer. This is never the case in Shantae. Shantae always lands from every jump exactly the way I expect based on the buttons I pressed. If I miss a jump, it is clear and obvious what I did wrong. I timed it wrong for the moving platform, I misjudged the arc, an enemy attack threw me off. I never fight the controls, and I never yell at the screen ""OH THATS BULL, I MADE THAT JUMP"". Hard sections feel challenging, not frustrating.That right there, the silky smooth controls and rock solid engine, are the best part of this game and its predecessors (except the original, lets not talk about the original....)UPDATE:Now that I'm less starry eyed from just finishing the game. I'll give my honest opinion to long time fans of Shantae. The biggest difference in this game is the style of level design. Its less metroidvania, more mega man. This isn't a bad thing, its just different. Levels are less about being labyrinths, and more about combining enemy placement and platforming to create a challenge. To those that prefer the labyrinth style designs, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse remains your best bet. To those that prefer stuff like Mega Man X, this game is perfect. To those that like both, like me, both games are awesome.			"

												Shantae: Half-Genie Hero surprised me. Good and original platformers are getting more and more rare. The gameplay is fun and responsive, I got used to the transformations, they add a variety of different ways to play the game. But the pacing does suffer, especially later on, when you get a lot of transformations and have to shuffle through them all. The story is very basic but it is very charming, it gives the game a fun and light feel. The hub world can get annoying because it isn't always clear what you have to do, to move on to the next level, and you have to return to the same levels allot and search for that one thing you need to move on to the next level. It sometimes felt like I played the same level 10 times. I feel like they didn't put in everything they wanted to in the game, either because they didn't have time or some other reason. So they make you play the same thing again and again. And the boss levels are Iâm sad to say too easy and repetitive. Overall though I really enjoyed the level design in Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, even though I got sick of playing the same levels, it has some game design ideas I haven't seen before. And I really like the graphics, it is one of my favorite games this year. But it was a bad year for me, so that doesn't say much. It is still just barely an above average game. Games like, Shovel Knight, Ori and the blind forest and Super meat boy are much better.6 out of 10. It makes me wonder why it took so long to release the game, development issues maybe?			"

												As a Kickstarter I got the game 2 weeks early for being a Backer.I personally enjoy this game, so much that I'm going to also be speedrunning it quite often.But this is a review so I'll give my review.Pros:Beauitfully done animationJake Kauffman comes through again with one of his best soundtracks yetFan Service, Fan Service, Fan Service!Enjoyable StoryAll the enjoyable Shantae gameplay is still thereDLC will have Risky Mode, more costumes and hero modes when released.As a Kickstarter, the DLC will be free for meCons:Short, first time playthrough averages 5-6 hoursUntil DLC comes out, not much replayability aside from Speedrunning/Hero modeHaving compeated with Mighty No. 9 during the kickstarter - It didn't get as much backing, so content is considerably lacking due to it even with the upcoming DLC.More linear, lost quite a bit of the Metroidvania feel and less exploration.Non Kickstarters have to pay for DLCNeutrals:It's easier, which can be a con to some. But after the terror that was Shantae and the Pirates Curse platforming, it was welcoming.Animations are beautiful, but feels like they are missing something.As a speedrunner, the in game time is programmed strangely - Doesn't run in pause(Item) menu/dance menu and will reset to previous time if you die. Casual players won't care about this.Overall:An enjoyable game with great animation and music, though short and lacking content due to competing Kickstarters against the overly popular Mighty No. 9 at the time.I hope the sales of the game will help them get more funding to add more content to the game at a later time. :)I'll still be running it as a Speedrunner, as mentioned above, very very ofter as I enjoyed the game quite a bit.

												DISCLAIMER: I am a backer of this title and paid $55.A project started 4 years ago has come to fruition and I'll be honest, it easily makes my personal game of the year. Playing similar to previous titles like Ducktales Remastered, A Boy and his Blob, and various other titles by the company it shows that Wayforward has not lost it's touch with making platformers. Bright, cheerful and a difficulty that ranges from easy to difficult without being a cackewalk or mind-numbingly difficult. Often compared to Mighty No. 9, Wayforward delivered on something that Comcept failed to do so: a relatively smooth game that has very intuitive gameplay mechanics and stages that put the mind to work as much as the fingers. The bosses, while really large (HUGE in some cases) all have a very capable strategy to beat. To add, while there are cases of a large number of enemies, I never felt at any point where I was forced to take a hit, making untouchable runs a fun challenge. To add, as with most Wayforward titles there is a game clock so speedrunners are going to have fun optimizing this game. The music and voices are superb as always with variations of Jake Kaufman (Wayforwards cheif Maestro) and Cristina Vee's (the voice actor for Shantae amongst others and the lead singer) ""Dance Through the Danger"" interspecced throughout amid an incredible selection of other music.As good as the game is, it is not perfect however. There are two nagging issues. The dances are not as dynamic as the tools from Pirate's curse though the mechanic has been improved from previous iterations, utilizing a radial menu system instead of button presses or timing cues. However there are three panels of four icons that cycle automatically, slowing down the gameplay. This can be sped up with a store purchase but that also has the drawback of accidentally picking the wrong dance. Second, like Ducktales Remastered the game is laid out in a stage format as opposed to a single world format like the original game or Risky's Revenge and each stage has a LOt of stuff to collect, often requiring special hidden dances and abilities. This necessitates a LOT of backtracking in the stages, in some cases being required to progress. Personally, not a huge issue but it can frustrate players. Both of these issues are relatively minor and only impact the game in marginal ways. Overall, another fantastic game from an incredible team who have the support of their fans. People on the fence waiting to know whether it will be any good or not can rest easy knowing that Wayforward can still deliver a fun game with a mix of fast paced gameplay, humorous characters and story, and a bright, colorful world.

The gameplay is addicting and fluent, when I finished my first playthrough, I immediatly wanted to start another.There are some downsides however, the game felt shorter than both Riskys Revenge and Pirates Curse though there is DLC incoming with a new full campaign so once that is available I feel it will be more than worth the asking price.I also felt the game was way to easy, you are given an insane amount of hearts I feel even half the amount would of been better.

												Half Genie Hero is another excellent Shantae game.  I've played Risky's Revenge and Pirate's Curse as well and each game has it's own strengths and weaknesses despite them being similar overall.  I've enjoyed my time with each game enough that I'm not sure I could even rank them. It should suffice to say that Half Genie hero was not a disappointment for me, but I can't say it stands head and shoulders above the other games either.First up, the game looks fantastic, maybe not quite up to par with something like Ori and Blind Forest, but it has a crisp cartoon style that's appealing and is definitely one of the best (if not *the* best) implementations of 2D sprites on 3D backgrounds I've ever seen in terms of making the two look like they belong together.The music is also great.  It conveys the feeling of upbeat chiptunes from platformers of old while still using a modern full (synthesized) orchestration.The game is still basically a Metroidvania, just with discrete levels instead of a contiguous world.  The animal transformations (which weren't in Pirate's Curse) make a return and are a welcome sight.  The level of challenge is still pretty light, with the exception of two sections in the last level which can get a tad frustrating, but aren't too bad.The one downside - the game is a little content light. There are only 5 main levels and then an ending level.  The game is structured so that you will need revist those 5 levels multiple times as you get new powers.  There's a scripted dependency where you'll get a power in one level that lets you explore a singe new area of another level, where you'll find an item which unlocks the next power in a different level and so on, at some point wrapping back around to letting you explore the next hidden area in the original level.  I.e. this isn't a game where playing through all the levels once gets you all the powers you need to unlock everything and then you can just go back to the levels one more time, getting all hidden items in one shot.That said, the game is very generous at giving you tools to warp around levels quickly and you can quit out of a level as soon as you get an item or powerup without losing it.  So despite the need to revisit the same levels, they do actually allow you to eliminate much of the tedium of retreading old ground.I was still quite satisfied with the amount of play time and the game overall for the price, but if there was just a little more unique meat on those bones, I think this would easily be the best Shantae game.

												This game is a worthy successor to Pirate's Curse. Everything about it is perfectly rounded and well finished.The controls are tight, speedrun tight. Default button mapping is perfect with an xbox controller, and has rumble feedbackIf you like visuals, you're in it for a treat: every sprite is beautifully hand drawm, and scenery is in 3D with plenty of details. The animations, as always a strong point of the Shantae series, are buttery smooth. Nearly every character and object in the game is carefully animated! This game really comes to life on screen. It was made for 1080p, but with anti-aliasing, plays at 1440p very well.The soundtrack, again as is the case with previous installements of the series, is a gift for your eartubes! Lively bouncy catchy music will keep you immersed in Sequin Land for as long as you play, you might even want to spin the soundtrack every once in a while! It is THAT good.As for the story i beleive that is where i will take off an egg; it is a shame they did not continue with the turn of events that were set up un the Pirate's Curse. In fact, i feel like the storyline did not get as much care as ther other aspects of the game. Quick point on dialog: humor? 4th barrier? Massive check!!GamePlay wise, is is a traditional platformer with a twist: Shantae transforms into various creatures and you will need that power to get through, there are even mini-gauntlets targeted at some of those forms. It has some very imaginative platforming elements as well. Boss fights are super fun.A personal note here, i found the game to be a bit too easy and a bit on the short side. BUT Wayforward are at work at the time of writing and there weresome neato DLC announcements. Too bad i missed the kickstarter.			"

												Being someone who is rather well acquainted with the Series The newest entry in to the Shantae series is a mixed bag for me because although the game does a Huge effort in making the transition from its art style personally it doesn't try to deviate from its main roots at all which in a given is not a bad thing.My personal [+] about the gameThe music as ever is so well tuned to meet the levels atmosphere.The Shantae i grew up loving, with a wide range of character personality's and adventures to be had.The presentation making itself well known from the jump of sprite animations.Combat easy to Grasp and plenty to do clocking out the main story just under 7 hours.Now the [-] about the gameThe back Tracking of the Game is such a pain during the story as it always has you going back to the same world about 10 times in order to get set item to progress in one way or another and return to the main hub.The Game's Hint system in the Spa doesn't help as its always saying things you may have already done.A somewhat predictable ending to the story which i wish they had added some sort of twist to throw me off my scent.In all though This game was pretty well recieved by me and Yes i would recommend it especially if you are a fan of the series or enjoy the games play styleNow its time to go listen to the Ost because it really is something special to me [Mermaid falls in particular]			"

												Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is an indie 2D Metroidvania platformer and the fourth installment in the series.HGH boasts an enormous visual upgrade compared to its handheld predecessors, with smooth, fluid sprites popping against gorgeous 3D backgrounds. The sprites are lovingly animated and move with a bubbling energy, often, seemingly, in rhythm with the background music.  The game is a joy to the eyes and the ears, with an aesthetic integrity that's rare in indie titles.These visuals compliment the story and characters of HGH. Shantae is surrounded by barely threatening antagonists and frequently obstructive friends, all of whom are charming and fun. Lacking a central antagonist for much of the narrative, the game is presented as a series of tangential episodes strung together by a vague goal, an undefined threat, and a series of humorous contrivances. As refreshing as this approach is, it often makes the game feel directionless. Further, whereas the previous installment gave Shantae a foil in the form of Risky Boots, HGH only casually touches upon the protagonist's relationship with her friends and enemies, making her feel unmoored in the setting.As a platformer HGH gives a solid performance. Shantae controls with precision and grace in a world that makes her limitations clear; players won't struggle against false impressions of what obstacles Shantae is and isn't capable of surmounting. Puzzles are solved by transforming into various animal and monster shapes that are unlocked over the course of the game, most often at the expense of offensive capabilities. Combat is a fairly bare-bones affair, with Shantae being limited to a melee attack that's supplemented by underwhelming mana-dependent spells.HGH is paced like a mad dash, with the game throwing power-ups and new abilities at players faster than they can find a use for them. Indeed, Shantae has a wide assortment of tools with too few obstacles to apply them to, and many of her more interesting powers go underused or are rendered superfluous by later acquisitions. Complicating this problem is all the backtracking that's required of a Metroidvania title; revisiting the game's small handful of areas quickly feels like padding, and makes replaying from the beginning feel unlikely. On the other hand, the dizzying volume of options available to Shantae by the end of the game will undoubtedly delight many players; for all of its backtracking, the sense of progress and growth is palpable.While not without its flaws, it's difficult to not recommend HGH. The game is clearly a labor of love, with an emphasis on color and energy that's uncommon in today's industry.			"

												I have been a fan of Shantae since Pirate's Curse, and Pirate's Curse is one of my favorite games of 2014. A new Shantae was very excited for me that the moment it went on sale and I had money I bought it and, long story short, I loved it. Now it's not as big as Pirate's Curse and 1/2 Genie Hero doesn't have dungeons like the last game but I still love 1/2 Genie Hero.   Let us start with the graphics... amazing. No joke, this is what HD sprites should look like, not just high color pixels. What made me like the graphics especially was the fact that the character portraits look like the models. Pirate's Curse had portraits similar to this game but the sprites were pixels, it created a discord between what the gameplay says characters look like and what the portraits and promo art says the characters look like.   The gameplay, on base level, is mostly the same as the previous game but with the added bonus of not having the well implemented pirate gear and replacing it with the well implemented animal transformations. The most useful to me was the monkey because of it's speed and jumping ability. Despite my previous statement on the animal transformations, there are many ways to cheat. Case in point, the bat. It is so easy and tempting to jump to the highest place on a horizontal scroll and transform into the bat and fly over every thing. Also the Harpie kinda makes the monkey and bat useless.   And now some quick thoughts on small points. The music is amazing in 1/2 Genie Hero, I recommend that you go get the soundtrack from Jake Kaufman's bandcamp page, seriously you don't have to play the game to like the soundtrack. Next, the story, it's okay. SomeCallMeJohnny put it best, it's more like a series of microstories with a big plot at the end.  I hope you found this review helpful and be kind this is my first review. Thank You!			"

												Until recently I had no idea that this series even existed, but I am very glad that I discovered it.This game gives me the same vibe as the Mega Man X series (which I adore), and is definitely a game I can see myself returning to in the future. It is a great platformer with several hidden areas to explore and interesting power-ups and alternate forms for the main character to obtain.The music is great, and  the animations and the level designs are stunning. The characters could be a bit more fleshed out, but this is probably just an issue of me not having played the previous installments yet. "

												I have played other Shantae games and this is my fave. From its art style to its platforming, it just feels better over all then the previous entres. It is slightly less difficult but that is a strength in this case, as it makes the game more engaging without becomming overly frustrating.Plus, everyone is so peky and dances all the time, it has such an energetic vibe to it.Mnus some backtracking, I loved every bit of it.If you miss platformers and want a game that remembers what fun feels like, this is a great option.

												Shantae is back and just as loveable as ever. For old fans this game caters to them with many references to the privious titles while at the same time bringing something different that both old and new fans may enjoy. Characters are back both good and bad while still introducing new people to the roster.Much like Pirate's Curse the levels are selectable however they are less maze like than any of the predecessors and you'll be glad when searching for the various secrets you can simply warp from one area to another.I must say though that if you know what your doing this game is short, however at this moment of time more game modes are promised to be released in future. Giving more replayablity to make the purchase seem worth it.All in all I say the game is worth it, a solid platformer with a lot of charm and appeal as well as solid varied mechanics. Runs on pretty much any high tech toaster system so I say give it a try.			"

												I'll keep this brief. The newest game in the Shantae series is a sure winner. Wayforward has outdone themselves in many ways with this game.The visuals are fantastic. They're clean, crisp and colorful, and the animations are really smooth for virtually every character onscreen.The audio is amazing. The compositions by Jake Kaufman are perfect to get you in the proper mood for the level and the challenge ahead. Sound effects are well done and avoid being annoying. What little voice acting is here is well done and makes me wish the voice acting stretch goal was met.Controls are spot on. Rest assured that if you get hit by an enemy or if you fall off a cliff, it's 99.9% your fault and not the controls acting up. Playing on a keyboard is alright, but a bit annoying, so I recommend using a controller for this game.The game structure is different from previous Shantae games, as it is level-based instead of metroidvania style. This allows for stronger platforming, but somehow makes the unavoidable backtracking a bit more annoying that previous entries.Using Shantae's abilites is way smoother and faster than in past games. No longer is it a chore to, for example, transform into a monkey, climb a wall, transform back into Shantae to fight an enemy, transform back into a monkey to climb more walls, then back to Shantae, then to an elephant to break a wall, then back to Shantae. The various upgrades and special powers also make the gameplay varied and more fun for all.Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is more platformer than metroidvania. It loses on fun exploration, but gains better platforming challenges. It doesn't feel as cohesive as Pirate's Curse, and the individual stories don't get enough time to develop, but it's charming to see these new, individual sides of the world. Maybe in a future game we will see a better story, but as a whole package, I found it completely satisfying.My score: 8/10			"

												Note: Playtime isn't displayed correctly, because I've played on a different system for the most part. Actual total playtime is just shy of 10 hours as of now.------------------------------Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a short but very sweet platformer with some nicely integrated Metroidvania elements and interesting character upgrades and skills. Level design is very good for the most part of the game, the soundtrack features some very nicely remixed versions from some of the previous games and is generally fitting for the fast-paced style of the game. Character design is especially nice, with some pretty funny and light-hearted dialogues, deceptively cute drawings and brilliant animations. Just seeing the characters bob to the beat of the rhythm is truly heartwarming.The platforming itself feels good and responsive at all times and integrates the skills the game has to offer nicely.The difficulty starts off a tad on the challenging side, but actually gets progressively easier as Shantae gets more upgrades, up to the point where she's outright overpowered and some skills that pretty much break the game (talkin' about you, secret-key-bonus. ;P). Thankfully all the upgrades are fully optional and can be switched off in the menu at all times. Some transformations make platforming in some levels a little too easy in my opinion though.It took me almost 10 hours for 100% completion, but I took it pretty slowly. If you know what you're doing you can certainly beat it much faster. The game does offer a certain replay value, although it might not be enough for everyone to make them want to replay right away.The only real downside is that, compared to it's predecessor ""Shantae and the Pirate's Curse"", Half-Genie Hero feels a little more shallow, with less dialogues and a little less of the series' refreshing whacky humor. And even though most of the levels are extremely well designed, I really miss the dungeons of the previous game that had to be beaten at the end of a level.Still, if you're looking for a light-hearted, nicely paced platformer, I'd say you can't really go wrong here for the ~20â¬ this game costs. I for my part have had a lot of fun with this and will certainly keep a eye out for possible DLCs or additional content.You've made it this far. Thanks for reading my review. ;)			"

If you like platformers/metroidvanias/casual games, you'll almost certainly enjoy it a lot, but the price tag might be a bit high for the amount of content there is.			"

												So much fun!Not as much a Metroidvania as Pirate's Curse but still some of that element because of the way you unlock new animal forms. The forms give you the means to uncover secrets in previously completed levels.For those worried about length:My first play through was around 12 hours because I took my time and collected everything and returned to levels multiple times. I could have done it faster but I was enjoying the game and I wasn't in a rush. I talked to every character I could, looked at all of the unlocked art in the gallery, etc.My second play through I started in Hero mode with most of the animal forms unlocked and I completed the game in about 3 1/2 hours. I still went through and collected all of the items during this run so I could have done it faster but speed wasn't my goal.Essentially, depending on what type of player you are, the game can be very short or plenty long.I had a blast playing through it and even after two complete passes I'm contemplating a third run focused on speed.Highly recommended!

												While Shantae: Half Genie Hero is short compared to other titles in the series and streamlines mechanics, I easily found myself having a lot more fun playing this game than the previous titles.I know it's a point of debate, but I liked the ""level"" aspect, due to the fact that there is still a degree of ""metroidvania"" in there. As noted in other reviews, your powers will let you discover secrets in levels. Maybe I'm just easily impressed, but many of them blew my mind. Mouse in Mermaid Falls has you thinking in a whole new way.Also, while the game is short, remember that due to Kickstarter goals, we'll be able to play as other characters in their own story. For now, there's only Shantae, but if these stories are made correctly I'm sure they'll make up for the short main story. "

												Never played a Shantae game before. Now I gotta go back and play them all!A very witty metroidvania that plays out like a PS1 era platformer. Best comparison I can make is Klonoa. But with RPG elements, excellent dialogue and great music, and a lot of potential for replay.			"

												All I knew about this series was that Shantae looked really cute. I was right about that, but also. This game is really, really cool. I had plenty of fun and it was a really pleasant experience. I haven't played a Shantae game before, but I think I might give the other games a chance some day.			"

												Kickstarted and loving it.It took a while to come out.I knew about the previous ones and liked them. 1/2 Genie blows them out of the water. Beautiful graphics, quirky characters, plenty of fun gameplay and a beautiful level of polish.			"

												(Edited since the addition of hardcore mode)TL;DR: Good game, but a step back from the previous title. Initially downvoted because of lack of content, and even now I feel like the base game only barely meets the $20 asking price, especially since there will be paid DLC in the future (unless you were a backer in which case it's all free). If you're looking to get into the franchise, I would VERY strongly recommend Pirate's curse instead, or even Risky's Revenge: Director's Cut since Pirate's Curse is a continuation of that story.PROS:-Platforming is fluid and satisfying.-Absolutely amazing soundtrack. Less tracks here than PC, but what is here is golden. My only critique is that the first run of the first level had vocals which I found distracting, but that same track is also played during the credits which is perfectly fine.-Transformations are more fluid than previous games, and there are many more of them.-New art style isn't bad (chibi isn't really my thing personally, I prefer pixel sprites and Inti Creates' art style from Pirate's Curse).-Humorous dialogue. I laughed out loud on multiple occasions.CONS:-Easily my biggest issue is the switch from the metroidvania playstyle. There are no dungeons, no save stations and no open world. HGH plays more like a Megaman game. You have stages divided up into a few areas that give you a save option between them. Stages can be replayed from the beginning to collect upgrades/items previously unattainable, and later on you get the ability to warp ahead to the next area of a stage if what you're looking for is in that area, but there is no backtracking to the previous area in a stage. If you miss something in the previous area you have to restart the entire stage (warp is handy here).-Overall less content than PC, as stated before.-Story is severely lacking. Rather than an overarching plot, HGH consists of several mini-plots, none of which are very interesting.IMO, the game feels like less effort went into building the game and instead that effort went into creating new assets and engine. Probably the reason Pirate's Curse was so awesome was because it reused so many assets from Risky's Revenge, and so much more effort was able to go into the game itself. If so, then I can only hope that the next game turns out to be at least as successful as PC was by reusing assets from HGH.Also, I would absolutely LOVE to see the return of Inti Creates artwork for the next game.

												The latest, and second-best, entry into the Shantae series. A competent platformer full of fun characters, humor, and music along with an absolutely adorable art style, I can definitely recommend Half-Genie Hero, along with the rest of the series... especially Pirate's Curse.The gameplay is a level-based platformer with some seemingly token Metroidvania aspects, but continues the Shantae series's trend of moving away from a ""true"" Metroidvania style. Instead of complex levels as seen in previous titles, levels are now standard left-to-right platforming stages where you move through 2-3 areas and end with a boss. Metroidvania aspects come in when you have to repeat levels with new lock-and-key transformations (and unlockable powers for them) to find 'hidden' areas to collect collectibles for various NPCs or new abilities. This leads to the gameplay ""loop"" of doing a few new levels, getting to a plot roadblock, and backtracking to solve it.The world of Shantae does, however, make up its merely good-but-not-great gameplay. It's hard to not have fun in the colorful world filled with its genuinely likeable characters, humor, and music. As a entry-point into the series, you meet most, if not all, of the series's cast of characters and the humor isn't too reliant on referential in-jokes.Perhaps the most disappointing thing I can say about the game was the fact it was a Kickstarter game with more ideas than they hit stretch goals for, and it shows. Some characters are introduced and summarily dealt with in an incredibly unsatisfying manner, especially with a late-game *lack* of boss battle that can only be truly described as a ""blue ballsing most foul"" when it's presented and solved in the span of one cutscene.In the end, I can still recommend Half-Genie Hero and would recommend you try Pirate's Curse if you enjoy the world, which is the best part of every game in the series.

												There was a considerably more notorious Kickstarter project released in 2016 with a much higher budget than Shantae: Half-Genie Hero. The contrast in quality could not be more stark. WayForward cannot possibly please everyone but if I had backed this (and I wish I had), I would have been very happy with the result. Fans of the series will not need my recommendation but anyone even remotely interested in platformers will get plenty of enjoyment out of this and thereâs more on the way so you should play.From an original review at Heroes of Play[heroesofplay.blog] "

												This game was very fun and challenging to play through. Pirate's Curse did feel more difficult in many ways and even though it was fun it felt very different from the other Shantae games since she lost her powers. Half Genie Hero makes the levels feel more fun even if it means some things are slightly easier. You can get overpowered by unlocking the last item in the game which makes the final boss overly easy however the traps that requires Falcon in the final level still makes it a good challenge to beat either way. If anyone has enough guts to do hard mode they basically make the final item that overpowers you useless even if you do bother getting it making the final level much more challenging.			"

												To start this off since the new update I wanted to say I loved this game even before Hardcore mode came out. I beat it on both normal and Hero mode. The level, item, character design are amazing. The transformations are great and they lay the puzzles out pretty well. But the problem is that I breezed through the game, it was way too easy! But now that Hardcore mode has come out it feels hard and I can actually die to minions now! Before Hardcore mode I only ever died to environmental hazards. I never died to Bosses either.I never really do reviews but I feel like this game deserves it, because even if it was easy it was just that enjoyable. If you have never played the newest installment in the series and are thinking of buying it. Definitely! But if you do and want an actual challenge then go for Hardcore mode right off the bat. I'm not sure if you can go for Hardcore mode right off the bat without beating it once but I really hope you can.			"

												Though it's a bit on the short side and has a few design hiccups, Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a lovingly constructed platformer with a smooth curve of progression and exploration, not to mention its beautiful artwork and catchy soundtrack.

												Just finished my 100% playthrough and i must say this game is almost as good as Shantae and the Pirates Curse or maybe even better...i don't know.I like the soundtrack and all the animations are very cute just like the transformations.Also you have to run around and search every corner of the world to find all items and this may make you cry like an animefan on prom night.

												As fun as the previous Shantae games but now in HD and the transformations are back. This time it's more based on linear levels that you'll have to go back to once you aquire new transformations rather than the metroidvania-style dungeons from the previous games. The only downsides to this game is that it is shorter than previous games and there is almost no story to the game.			"

												Half Genie WaifuThe best waifu.But seriously though this is a great game. A charming artstyle with beautiful and bright HD graphics, fun level design, and tight platforming controls make this a must-buy for any fan of the 2D platforming genre. The mechanics of your genie powers, the great music, and Shantae's cheery personality itself makes this an amazing game in my opinion. If you like the idea of playing a head-strong, spunky girl who transforms into animals as she saves the day, then this is the game for you.This is more of a Megaman style of platforming than a Metroidvania, this means the levels are going to feel alot more linear at first. The real exploration comes from after you get your animal abilities, where the extra means of movement allow you to explore the untouched nooks and crannies  of the levels you previously cleared.The cons I can think of are:backtracking to find every item in every stage may get repetitive. However this is entirely optional unless you either want to do the little bit of extra work to get the good ending or just 100% complete the game.This game is also probably the easiest game in the Shantae series. Shop items might as well be given to you with how cheap they are, barely any real threats in terms of enemies, and thinking creatively will sometimes let you use your animal transformations to completely bypass entire sections of the game.  Edit:The new introduction of hardcore ups the difficulty on a grand scale. More enemies, different enemy placement, more damage, and new boss attacks make for a much more exhilerating experience.However.Even with its faults, I stil llove the game. It is an excellent edition to the series and a pretty good step forward.Personally I loved the story, but heads up, its episodic like a Saturday morning cartoon. *SPOILERS* There is no Big Evil threatening to destroy the entire planet that requires an epic adventure. Instead Shantae has to deal with a bunch of smaller threats and go on smaller adventures one at a time. It's less of ""This is one of the most important days in this character's life"" and more of a ""This the stuff this young lady has to deal with sometimes.""Using internet guides at the late part of the game, I was able to 100% the main default story within a total of about 7 hours. Its a short game, but it was fun enough that I'm going to be revisiting this story plenty more times. I also need to mention that there is going to be alot of DLC coming out in the future of writing this review. Costume swaps for Shantae, and extra story modes where you play as some of the side characters are all underway. As a fan of the series, I am very excited to see some of the other characters get some time in the spotlight.			"

												Shantae Half Genie Hero is a visually stunning game and a great start for new players of the series.As a veteran player of the series playing all 3 of the previous Shantae games, the game really goes back to its roots with the animal transformation to overcome obstacles.  I really love the animation and art of this game. I'm hoping Risky mode will play similar to Shantae and the Pirate's Curse and look forward to all the future DLC. Game is short and straight foward can be easily completed under 2 hours if your trying to speed run it about 4 to 100%. First time play through for 100% can range from 7- 11 hours. This is simple platforming done right. Wayfoward have perfected the tight controls and have continued to use it. The Soundtrack is epic, Jake Kaufman is on point!Now then for my complaints:1) I wish Shantae would have kept her GBC dance mechanic with the different pose animations. It was very Zelda OOT ish would have been great to just press the 2-4 key commands correctly to activate your desired trasformation.2) Fighting moves! Also wish it stayed in!3) The Real ""Harpy Talon"" I miss one shotting monsters ingame !4)Squid Smith - For obvious reasons <3Overall this game to me is a 9/10, it could have used more content on release! But seing as 800k couldn't get us the full voice acting and the anime cut scenes i can't give i that perfect 11/10 it deserves. Maybe it can be added after all the sales for DLC? Hehe GG Wayfoward PS. Still waiting for my Shantae merchandize! I'm looking at my wall and it could use more squid baron!			"

												Shante: Half-Genie Hero is a good game but it has flaws that kind of ruin the game. But before we talk about those, let's talk about what the game did right first.Disclaimer: While I have only have played through the main story, these are what I like and dislike about the game.PROS:1. The level design. The game is a fairly challenging platformer with some Metroidvania elements added into mix that will keep you on your toes while looking for secrets in stages with it's megaman levels of precise platforming.2. The story. The story revolves around half human and half genie hero Shante helping her uncle build a machine called the Dynamo that will help protect her hometown, but while she is helping her uncle the barons and monsters in the land keep stirring trouble, and it's her job to travel across the land while meeting some very colorful charaters and put a stop to their evil plans.3. The Transformation dances. One of the main gameplay points is Shante's transformation dances, these dances allow her to transform into a multitude of creatures and animals that give specific abilites from swiming underwater with the mermaid to climbing on walls with the monkey and to taking it to the skies with the harpy.4.The bosses. I won't go into much detail on them, but the bosses in the game are very fun and creative, they also provide a unique challenge that make the game more interesting.Now that we covered the pros lets now go over the cons.CONS:1. The game is too short. While the game has good level design and fun bosses, there are only 6 stages in the entire game. Eventough each stage is composed of 4 segments, the game is very short. (It only took me about 8 hours to beat it.)2. 100%ing the game. Do want to know why it took me 8 hours to beat the game? Because I spent most of those 8 hours looking and grinding for all the items and equipment in the game. One of my personal gripes with Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is that completing the game is such a hassle. If you want to complete the game you will have to a METRICâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥TON OF BACKTRACKING since some of the items and stages requrire you to go back to a pevious stage and get a certain power or item(s) to progress. While the warp dance and having a guide to help you will give you less of a headache you still have to backtrack alot.Oh yeah, if you want to get all the achivements in the game, you have to speedrun all theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥3. The Bat and Harpy transformation dances. Do you want to know how to beat half of the game? Go up to a high place and transform into one of these two free passes with wings, The bat and harpy allow you to fly, in a PLATFORMER. While you get the harpy late in the game, the bat transformation is the worst of the two since you can fly horizontal for as long as you want and you can get it in the 2nd stage!Anyway while Shantae: Half-Genie Hero is a fun and challenging game with a few issues. I would recommend it to anyone. But I highly recommend the you play it causaly if you don't to deal with the headache of completing the game.			"

												Nothing too long here, just as fantastic as the previous games with core improvements. Better music, butter animations, gorgeous revamped art style.If you want a really cool, funny, old school game with loads of charm made by a company that gives an F then you could do a whole lot worse.Even at full price it's a steal.
