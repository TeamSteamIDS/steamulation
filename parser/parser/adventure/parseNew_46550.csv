												Post Mortem is an Adventure game from the French maker Microids. They’ve been in the Adventure game business since 1985. Post Mortem was released around 2002 and is the prequel to the Still Life series but, it is rather dated now. After looking through the other reviews of this game, I see a few people have had some problems running this game. I have a Windows 7 64bit Gaming Machine and everything runs fine. Yea, I know, why am I using a Gaming Machine for an Adventure game? I have plenty of great games but, there comes a time when I get tired of killing zombies and such. I like Adventure games and I have about 15 of them. Post Mortem is nothing special. The graphics and sound are typical for that time period. It has a great story line as you play a PI in this Murder Mystery. It’s a little different from the other Adventure games that I’ve played in the past. There’s not a whole lot of searching and collecting objects, you mostly interview suspects, extract clues and try to put the pieces together to solve the crime. I recommend you Save your game before any conversation because if you ask the wrong questions, you may miss out on some of the vital clues. There are also several different ways to end the game. Post Mortem has some interesting puzzles throughout the game. There are a few towards the end that are quite challenging. If you get stuck, a true adventurer will put the game down for a while and think about it but, you can also look for a Walkthrough, there are several on the Internet. A word of warning, you cannot toggle between the game and the Walkthrough without the game crashing. And for the love of God, don’t sit there and play the game with the Walkthrough in front of you, I mean, what’s the point? I saw in one of the reviews that a player completed the game in so many minutes. Sit back and enjoy the game, live it. On a scale of 1 – 10, I give the game a 4.5. I recommend the game only to true adventurers. Catch the game on sale like I did at Christmas 2013 on Steam. I bought the Still Life series, Post Mortem, and Scratches real cheap, and I’m glad to have added them all to my collection.			"

												This is a decent adventure game.  At first, you will be turned-off by the dated graphics and no video resolution options.  OK, I cut them some slack cause its a 2002 release.  What drew me over was the game's storyline.  Here, you play as a Private Investigator and hired to solve a Murder Mystery. I get to use my detective skills, in a manner of speaking, and try to solve a crime.  In order to catch the murder suspect, you have to arrange the questions you pick in order to extract more vital clues.  If you don't choose carefully and just choose randomly, your conversation might end up making no sense at all or even awkward.There are puzzles here and there, too few and far in between.  The hard ones of course are placed in the end and you might even end-up looking through walkthroughs.There are several shocking cinematic cutscenes in this game.  Some of them are a little too morbid too describe here, like in a ""I.S.I.S."" kind of way.This game made me a fan of adventure games even more.  I really appreciate game developers who offer great mystery games for us to solve and crack.  I am running the game on Windows 7 64 bit and it runs well.  However, do not press Alt-Tab because it will crash your game.  I forgot to save my progress at one time, and press Alt-Tab, as a result I have to interview the same characters all over again.  So, if you want to run other pragrams save your game first.By the way, according to other reviews, there are 3 endings to this game.  I only managed to crack 2 of 3 endings at present.  I only recommend this game to those who really like adventure games and can look beyond the mediocre graphics.  If you are, then I suggest you put down your weapons like guns, swords, bow and arrows, or what have you, and try this game for a change.			"

												This is the zeroth entry in the Still Life series and is an interesting if at times buggy adventure game with a few slow moments but the puzzles, story and atmosphere really make up for all that, well worth playing if you're an adventure game fan looking for something a bit different (Victorian era France anyone?)!

												Movement isn't perfect, but workable. Multiple endings make the game interesting to play a few times, but there are difficulties in finding a walkthrough for my specific playthrough if I get stuck. The way to choose your responses is not ideal, I like to see all of my options at once, and choose one from there, this method of tabs leads me to accidentally say things, changing my intended storyline. The graphics arent perfect, but the story overrides that. Drawing the sketch of the suspect is difficult, some things are too vague to finish the sketch. There have been multiple places I have not been able to complete things that the walkthroughs have instructed me to complete, but I have mostly moved on without those. Overall it's a good game, with critical flaws			"

												I bought this game to bring back a childhood memory, used to watch my friend play it, we would try to solve stuff together. I agree comments regarding user interface, it is not the best. However it works and that's better than a buggy interface. I've encountered crashes when I tried to Alt+TAB the game every time. There was also a small bug with documents. I'd recommend this to people who like point and click adventures, it may not be appealing to other players though. The story is not bad at all. I found alchemy puzzle to be very hard but not impossible. A nice detail is how the game shapes according to your decisions, even if it's really slight change, better than nothing.			"

												The characters are all interesting and you can become easily consumed with trying to understand what is happening. Unfortunately, I noticed who was doing the crimes in five minutes. Then you become stuck with making sure you do everything in order or some actions will disappear completely leaving me to start a new game. Plenty of bugs in the game. More bugs outside of the game especially with trying to use it on windows 8; before starting the game it had an error saying something about a 3D also once you minimize the game it kept crashing. Thankfully since the game is extremely short, constantly starting over wasn't bad. I probably have a bunch of hours on this game from walking away from it to snack and watch t.v. lol. You can probably finish the game in an hour. Once I reached the end, it felt dry and very unsatisfying. So i tried to go back and do different things in the game but it was pointless.Overall the game was interesting but you can definitely save yourself money and time because it is just not worth it.

												Yes, this game is 14 years old, taking on a genre that was already starting to get outdated. I have an addiction to point and click games and have learned to accept clunky gameplay, frustrating puzzles, confusing stories, and comparatively poor graphics. But every point and click game I've played until PM had some modicum of immersion, atmospheric details, charm. Even the dime a dozen Nancy Drew games had lively cheesy voice acting.Post Mortem is not all bad - a few neat integrations of puzzles and mature themes that are present, but understated. But overall, undercooked branching storyline, poor inventory interface, even poorer dialogue and narrative organization, overall bugginess and uninspired voiceacting dragged this game to the depths of tepidness. No attachment to the characters, not enough attempt at atmosphere, and unsatisfying puzzles. Still Life 1 is still the best in the series, Still Life 2 was at least interesting to play. They developed the elements that PM introduced, but did not bother to follow through on.			"

												Before playing this game I did some research in the reviews and went into it with very low expectations. I found myself enjoying the game a bit more than I thought I would have, though I do strongly reccomend using a walkthrough while playing otherwise you'll just end up frustrated and confused most of the time. The graphics are bad, but not nearly as bad as I thought they would be, the voice acting could have been better, but it is certainly not the worst I've experienced ( Here's looking at you A New Beginning), there is some slow parts, but the ambiance is really nice and I don't regret that I bought it, even if it was on sale for dirt cheap and in a package deal. I hear the two sequels are much better installments so I look forward to more polished logical game with those.			"

												Post Mortem is nice, but sometimes the game mechanics are flawed.I had some fun with this murder mystery game. The story is compelling and really interesting. I also liked the art design, even though the graphics are of course outdated. However, I believe the graphics are still good enough.The sound, music and English voice acting is quite good, though sometimes characters mumble slightly.A very positive aspect is that you can choose different dialogue options and make progress in various ways, and this really influences what happens.The reason why I would give a rating of only 70 % are the sometimes odd game mechanics. For example, some puzzles are very hard and one is especially annoying because you have to use exactly the right combination even if others seem very reasonable as well. So I had to consult a walkthrough several times. By the way, the walkthrough in the Steam folder of the game is a joke: you can only find pictures of the puzzles but no detailed explanations about most of them.All in all, if you like point and click adventures with a good story and nice characters, you can give it a try, especially when it is on sale.

Posted: January 11, 2016
												So....I've poured about 5 hours of my life into this game, so far. I rather enjoyed the interface, the way the environments are presented, and the voice actors are pretty good. Getting lured in by a good old fashioned murder mystery was pretty much all I needed to want to try it out, and I suggest the same to anyone that wants something different from a hidden gem of a mystery game.HOWEVER.For anyone that wants to play it, you should totally read a FAQ walkthru for the part where you try to break into the crime scene at the Hotel Orphee. There are actually two methods for getting in there, but at the time when i was playing, I thought I was supposed to use a lockpick. Should you use this lockpick on the door to the hotel room, you literally will not be able to beat the game.Now then. To the game designers, what the hell do you have to say for yourselves? You do know that gamers are generally not very understanding of spiteful game design that leads to a dead end, right? Even Dagger of Amon Ra would at least let you see an ending where your character gets gunned down in her bed, if you made a certain mistake during your investigation. But here, I don't even get the small gratification of having at least won and seen a bad ending, I'm just plain stuck. That's kind of a sign of lazy, incompetant game design. As it stands, this game gets a failing grade, but if you can post here and provide an intelligent explanation of why you thought this was a good idea, I MIGHT cut you some slack and reverse my recommendation.

Posted: August 6, 2014
												First off... reason that I do not recommend this game comes from the fact that:- this is an old game which means it's not compatible with Windows 7 64bit.You can make it run, by changing settings on exe to run as admin, also you can choose compatibility mode (Win NT was ok).But to be able to recommend I would have to be certain that any player will be able to make those adjustments, and that you will be able to bear other issues (like random freezing on loading game, or crashing after ALT-TAB to check walkthrough, because you will need it, trust me)Now, I'll review this game, from perspective of story and play mechanics and puzzle quality.STORY:Story is intriguing but could be better. If you were a fan of Still Life, then you probably could neglect all issues (technical and gameplay wise) that you will find here. What I found to be most annoying was that conversations and results in some cases depended on your answers and questions, and in some cases it did not matter. For that reason I was not sure, how important is right selection of answers. Also, in some cases I was able to talk with NPC of things that I still have not discovered which effectively ruined the story line and suprise moments. Try not going ahead of yourself. Make sure you collect all evidence before talking with people as it will effect what they give you back storywise, so you could miss some important parts. Make saves before talking with NPCs so you can revert if you make mistake.PUZZLES:I needed walkthrough in 2-3 points, where I simply could not determine what puzzle is about. Story is too thin and there's just not enough clues to help you ""connect the dots"". At one point there are 3 puzzles in same room. And I haven't had a clue why was I doing any of them, and how are clues in the room connected to this 3 puzzles. Text that was supposed to help me with one, was just to abstract even to be sure to what that relates. Ability to do things ahead of story adds up to the confusion.GAMEPLAY:Discovering items is extremely easy unless they are hidden. You can usually spot items from the first time you enter the scene. Although if something is on shelf, you should examine shelves thoroughly as you might miss something. To be able to examine something you have to ""stand in right perspective"". For example, you want to make a closer look on something, it will not work, unless if you're in right spot, and there's one odd spot close to game end. Also, when examining some things, you will have trouble figuring out that there's additional to examine, because nothing points out you should look more closely. This is poorly done. Should be covered in story so you at least know why are you doing something. Through whole game, you will never combine items, so don't bother.Important tip! There are 3 alternative game endings. The end game results, depend on your previous actions, one of them being if you succeded to clear certain suspect in jail from guilt, did you provide ALL evidence. Don't talk with inspector unless you have everything ready. Save before talk, and make inspector to interogate that suspect again. If he does, you succeeded, this leads you to ending #2 and #3. You can later revert to save, not clear suspect of guilt and go for possible endings #1 and #2. Endings also depend on last conversation.			"

												I had heard good things about Still Life and when I went to buy it I found it was part of a trilogy so I started here. However I am not impressed with this first instalment.For a start there are technical issues with this game. The game’s resolution is hard coded, low and in 4:3 aspect ratio (and for some reason Nvidia defaults to screwing up the aspect radio and stretching the display). If your game loses focus for any reason it crashes. This happens all to easily when you are playing in a window or have multiple monitors as the controls to look around are to move the mouse to the edge of the screen but there is nothing to stop your cursor moving out of the game. Further more I had issues where the game would periodically just lose focus for no apparent reason.The game itself is excruciatingly slow. Every other point and click game I can think of off the top of my head has fixed camera angles so you can easily see what is in each location. This however is displayed in the first person and you don’t have full free movement you just click to the next predetermined location you can move to. This means you have to click to take a step look round with the slow camera controls then take the next step. It also has lots of pointless dead dead ends and elongated corridors to waste more of your time. Even disregarding this the story is so slow; after the initial exposition nothing much happens for ages. The first chapter of the game is basically mundane police work of taking witness statements and establishing a description of a suspect. There were some plot developments in the latter part of the game but I was too bored by that point to be paying much attention.The user interface is really not intuitive either. For example it is not clear how to give items to people. The lock pick puzzle gives you no hint of what to do, you have to click about randomly till you figure out what the puzzle is before you can solve it. The worst moment for me was the fresco puzzle, the game makes it clear that you need to use a candle on the fresco but won’t let you do that until you have found some seemingly unrelated item which unlocks another dialogue option which in turn unlocks the puzzle actually working.This game also has one of my personal point and click bugbears and that is things that change at locations seemingly unrelated to the player’s actions. On a couple of occasions new items appeared at locations I had already visited without any logical link to anything I had done. This really annoys me as once you know the game does this each time you get stuck you have to go and revisit every location to ensure nothing new has appeared unnecessarily dragging out the game.I really hope this game is not indicative of the quality of the sequels.

												This game was a decent point-and-click, with some pretty hard puzzles. I ended up having to resort to a walkthrough, and still was confused at some parts.  Pros: Interesting story line, voice acting was pretty good, puzzles were difficult enough to keep interestCons: Clunky graphics and gameplay, music can get annoying (random snipets of 1920's rag tunes every 30 sec or so), depending on which dialogue options you choose, you can unknowlingly end up making things harder for yourself later on in the game (something I dislike in adventure games), and the stupid painting-and-candle puzzle made me want to poke my eyes out.

												Post Mortem was badly recieved when it first was puplished, at least in some gaming magazines in germany.Truth is, the game isn't as bad as they said back then.But you have to note, it has some bugs which might lessen the joy for the game, some of them can be game breaking and you have to get a workaround for those bugs. Some might be caused by our Windows OPs 7 or 8, some might be caused by corrupt save game files, others might inherently be caused by faulty coding. If those occur, sometimes you might be able to catch the game again with a restart of a saved game.I don't need to tell about the story, do I? Let's say it's a murder mystery adventure. Though you will quite early see who is the murderer - at least if you are accustomed to that kind of games.			"

One point that needs to be noted is that this is NOT a horror game nor is it meant to be scary it is supposed to be a Mystery Thriller (even if the identity of the killer is pretty obvious about an hour or so into the game).

												I like it... for the way I played it. Until bugs.Despite not being terribly attracted to horror games, I was impressed enough with Syberia to want to see another set of games by the same group, and I decided to start with the ""prequel"". I sincerely hope the others are better as games, honestly.Based on the other reviews, I have been pretty much treating this like a more interactive version of a graphic novel; rather than pixel-hunt and flail around in the dialogue trees, I grabbed a guide almost from the start. The small amount of play I did without it, combined with my memory of the beautiful but hard-for-the-wrong-reasons Syberia games, have me very certain that I would not have enjoyed it as much if the plot was delayed by my having to figure out which items matter, which of many logical solutions the game is actually trying for, what odd result will be achieved by certain (non-reversable) dialogue options, etc.The graphics are okay, but the majority of the scenery is designed as trompe l'oiel; flat images that (when seen from the right angle) look 3D.  The problem being that even though you can only stand in certain places in each room/area, they didn't re-render the flat scenery, so depending on where you are standing, the graphics can look either very realistic, or like you have stepped into a surrealist painting.  A few key structures in rooms are immune to this, as are any people or objects  you will need to interact with.  It's not game-breaking, but especially combined with a play style that encourages you to look closely at everything, it is very noticeable.  Especially when the scenery includes people.Despite that, I was enjoying my more-interactive-graphic-novel until I hit a bug where certain (important) documents I had picked up weren't actually readable. :-(  I found there is a thread from a couple of months ago in the Discussions about someone else having the same problem. Until I can solve that, I will definitely not be playing this game any further (as not getting all the story makes this entirely pointless for me), and likely won't be playing the Still Life games, since I really would like to finish the prequel before I play the rest of the series.So, for the moment, it would be a bit sadistic of me to recommend the game.  If you are okay with the risk of game-breaking bugs and spending a lot of flail time, go for it; the parts of the game that work are interesting and well-done.  If not, skip this one for a while, until you see posts indicating that the major bugs have been updated out of existence. :shrug:			"

												In my Steam library chock full of adventure games, from a strictly gaming standpoint, Post Mortem is probably the worst of the bunch.  Despite, it has some strengths that should be commended.  The horror story is strong and the graphics, while dated, do much to support the atmosphere.  The exploration feels paced and open ended enough to give a real sense of private eye work; I found myself going back to talk to NPCs with new information and going back to locations for clues/objects I must have missed.   This repetition, while perhaps a turnoff to some, helped the immersion in my playthrough.Unforntunately, these assets don't come close to warranting a recommendation.  The aforementioned strong plot is hampered with unconvincing voice acting, mediocre dialogue (perhaps due to translation from the original French), and atrocious dialogue trees that give the player conversational options too early and too late to make any sense.  The inventory interface is convoluted; sometimes objects can be used directly with the environment, othertimes they can only be used when you click on the environment first, and other times still you need to talk to an NPC for them to come into play.   What's worse,  there's no classic adventure game ""Nah, I don't want to do that,"" when you try an unfruitful combination which quickly frustrates.I only recommend Post Mortem for an academic understanding into what Microids did far better in their Syberia and Still Life titles.

												Imagine if the creative genius, Tommy Wiseau, decided to make his own game. The outcome would be something similar to Post Mortem, yet perhaps slightly more unintentionally entertaining. Two words: Knights Templar. Yes, exciting, another point-and-click adventure game centred around the Knights Templar, sorcery, and eternal life! As if that conspiracy♥♥♥♥♥♥wasn't milked nearly enough during the '90s and early '00s.Since there are almost no positive aspects to this game I will do my best to mention the most negative of the negatives:• The voice actors can't decide if their accents should be French (with the game being set in Paris), or Dutch, or Swedish, or Arabic, or North American. They're absolutely horrendous and they lack any semblance of enthusiasm. It makes Post Mortem an incredibly droning and boring experience. It's so bad that some accents actually change half way through a conversation.• The conversation panel is oddly arranged. Where most point-and-clicks present their dialogue choices as a list, with every choice in full view, instead you have them separated into tabs here. It's incredibly tedious to read through. Luckily the game automatically chooses the most appropriate tab in order to progress the discussion if you can't be bothered reading through the other many choices.• The lip syncing to the actor's voices is strangely hilarious. Instead of animating the jaw moving in time with speech, the lips seems to do most of the work. They vibrate and tremble, as if they're flapping in the wind.• The story is extremely disjointed and redundant. Every character you meet repeats the same things multiple times, not only what they've said one sentence ago but also what other characters have mentioned in previous conversation. It's tough to sit and listen to these completely one-dimensional characters, whose voices hold about as much personality as Kristen Stewart's face holds expression.• The puzzles are lacking and tend to be quite vague as they go overboard when introduced. The inventory system is a complete cluster♥♥♥♥. You will only be shown around five items at a time, requiring you to scroll horizontally to the next necessary item, one by one. This becomes quite daunting and frustratingly confusing once you've acquired more than a dozen items, as most of them share similar icons and are not sorted in any particular order. There is no option to examine items either, so you play a sort of Russian roulette; clicking on items in order to discover if their contents can be viewed.• The biggest issue is the amount of times the game has crashed and locked up on me. Remember when Windows or Internet Explorer would lock up and you could paint pictures with the mouse, as the pointer repeatedly imprinted itself on your screen? Yeah, that♥♥♥♥♥♥happens a lot in this game. You also can't alt-tab, otherwise the game will force close on you, so if there's a program running in the background that minimises Post Mortem you will lose all your progress. I actually can't legitimately exit the game without going through the whole ""Post Mortem has stopped responding"" thing...I honestly have no idea how Post Mortem's Metacritic score is so high. I have no idea how it still receives such critical acclaim. To paraphrase Michael Scott from the television show The Office: if I had a computer, with powers of space-time control, and I found the original source code for Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing, Superman 64, and Post Mortem, I would completely wipe Post Mortem from existence twice.

												I'm gonna go with an anti-recommendation. This is a Microïds adventure game (that should tell you many things) in a pre-rendered first-person, weird panoramic perspective and some human characters superimposed in realtime polygons. They look hilariously awful. What struck me was that for the puzzles, there're sometimes multiple solutions, which seem sometimes to get randomized. That's pretty great, but as with Microïds often, some of the puzzles are pretty much trial and error based and there is one of those police mug shot drawing puzzles where you are given clues and have to get the face absolutely right to proceed. Ugh. Also, the dialogue trees and the protagonist's important diary-keeping journal both glitched badly on my playthrough. It's a bit of a mess, really. It's cool that this game's the prequel to Still Life, though, considering how much more conventional SL is.			"

												I gave up on this rather quickly (after about an hour anf a half), though not without reason.First off, I love 'film noir' style point-and-click games, so I had good hopes for 'Post Mortem'. Though the rather generic plot is to be expected ('femme fatale' at the door asking you to solve a murder...), it is the game mechanics that ruined it for me. The bulk of it consists of conversations with NCP's, and you navigate with the familiar 'dialogue trees'. Aside from having different topics to choose from, you can also select the manner of speaking (charming, curious, direct, et cetera). Sadly, picking the wrong options will bring about an abrupt end to the conversation. Since the game gives you little to no clues on how to engage with the characters, this is a problem. Whereas succes is unsatisfying, failure is downright frustrating, and the game will punish you harshly with a dead end if you're not careful.The graphics are nothing special, but that's forgivable in this genre. Voice acting is decent (I played the game in French).			"

												If you are into detective stories and occult, this adventure game is really a good one. It requires a brain and expects quite a lot from the player. It's nice not to be considered an idiot by a game for a change. It has a good atmosphere too. Very, very nice and creepy. The story telling is quite rich and requires to pay attention. On the other hand, the user interface could have been better. Character interaction is also a weakness of this game and it isn't entirely bug free either. Many nice puzzles, one of them excessively frustrating though. Overall, for the money spent I had a hell lot of fun. And I felt like just having finished reading a novel afterwards. Good stuff.			"

												There is some good stuff in this game, but unfortunately I cannot recommend it.The story has interesting elements, and some of the characters are very interesting too. The game is old, so it doesn't look fantastic, but artistically speaking it is ok and rather atmospheric.The problem lies in the puzzle and dialogue structure. In relation to the puzzles, if you miss one hidden object, you are stuck. And some puzzles are extremely illogical (e.g. a puzzle with two dial wheels where one wheel is not being used at all). But the even bigger problem is the dialogue: Most conversations simply don't make any sense. Some times you can ask people about things they still haven't mentioned. Other times it would be logical to ask them a relevant question, but you can't. And some times you are stuck with saying something that doesn't make any sense at all; e.g. blaiming right in the middle of a very friendly conversation. And it goes both ways. For instance a hotel manager might end up getting angry and banning you from the hotel. But the next time you meet him, he's friendly and you are free to ask questions and to enter the hotel. The next time you meet him he'll ask you to leave once again. The dialogue structure is simply awful and it wrecks the game. You end up just clicking some random statement because all the options are equally meaningless.Sad, because the game had some potential when it comes to atmosphere and some story elements and characters.

												This sounded like a good game..... there had been a murder, and you are recruited as a private detective to investigate.  However, the game is impossible to get anywhere.  It is a fairly simple interface, look around a room and click on the various clues or people to talk to.  The problem is, you have to do specific tasks in a specific order, and no suggestion as to what tasks or what order to do them in!  So most of the time you are left wandering around going from place to place, hoping to find something you missed clicking on the first time.  When talking to people, you have a choice of what to say to them, but if you don't say the right things in the right order, they won't help you or give you what you need to progress in the game, and whats more, you don't know when you have done or said something wrong or in the wrong order as the game does not say!  Another instance there was a lock to pick, and I managed to get a lock picking set.  However, there were many numerous different combinations to try the picks to open the door - choosing the right combination was like winning the lottery, it was pure luck that you chose the right pick combination!  Not a good game when you don't have a clue what to do in the game!			"

												I found the parts of this game I could get through dull and unsatisfying. The dialog felt long winded and though the story had a few interesting creepy moments there were just to few for me; I just didn't  feel immersed or pulled in at all.I found myself frustrated often and unsatisfied with the results once past the trouble spot to the point where it (for me) wasn't even worth playing anymore once  I managed to get irreparably stuck in the second fresco puzzle by opening the sketchpad to rearrange the symbols before finding the last one; which after and hour and a half of VERY slowly going over and over the entire fresco with the candle I gave up trying to find.  I estimate I got through about half the game at that point.			"

												Purchased the Still Life collection and was very happy with Still Life. Post Mortem on the other hand has seemd to outlived it's playability on modern systems. I have Windows 8.1 64 bit and straight from install it will not work. First you run into an error stating something about incompatable 3D hardware. So you search the internet to find a compatability fix for that, then you try to run it and aprox. 30% of the time you may get an image with the other 70% getting audio only and a screwed up desktop when you try to exit. when it does run the controls are klunky and the mouse look is terrible. Some games, even good ones in their time, are better off on the midden heap then to be sold to people for entertainment. This one offers more stresses then entertainment value. Skip it and just get the Still Life pair. You will never know the pita you missed.			"

Still Life 1 & 2 were ok but this is older than they are ... and it has not aged well:- tiny screen size, not adjustable- unskippable talk scenes- dire graphicsThere may be many more problems but I gave up after the first scene.  Is that being unfair to the game ?  Possibly but I don't have the time or patience to slog through something like this.  Go back to 2002 and it might have been mildly diverting but it just doesn't stand up today.			"

												Tedious with little interaction is the best way I can describe this. Point-and-Click adventure games are a guilty pleasure of mine so I'm no stranger to the concept however this game tested even my patience.On a side note, since it's a dated title it may not run well with certain hardware/software confgurations. There are workarounds, to be sure but it's noteworthy that Meridian4 tech support failed to respond after multiple help requests over the course of an entire month. Personally I will not be delivering any more funds into their pockets on principle alone.			"

												I'll start off by saying that I can't believe I used 9 hours of my life playing this.As someone who likes both detective stories and point&click-games, I delved into the story with optimism, which soon changed into frustration and downright annoyance. By the end of the game I was hoping for the characters to shut up with their dialogue already so I can get the hell out.To make it simple, here's a little list:- The whole atmosphere of the game was bleak, dull and unappealing. Even the cutscenes, which were meant to be dynamic, only managed to make me feel like playing tetris to get any action.- I don't know which accent half the cast were trying to pull, but it surely wasn't french.- Subtitles not recommended for grammar nazis. You'd have a burnout before the end of the first conversation.- The dialogue is really repetitive, and there's no development between the conversation you just had and the remaining dialogue options. It's like having to remind a goldfish with a 10 sec memory that someone had just died.... after they told you about it themselves.- The resolution was stuck on HIDEOUS, alt + tab crashes the game and you're most probably going to encounter some peculiar species of bugs that should and hopefully are now enxtinct in more modern games.So what did I like about it?First game where I actually got to use the good old newspaper/key-on-lock-method. In all seriousness, if you want a good murder mystery point&click, get Cognition instead.			"
