												It's a well know fact that dogs are man's best friend. A lesser know one is they're also pals with strange sack doll people, who don't take so kindly to having their pet kidnapped by demanding aliens. But what are friends for besides rescuing each other from extra terrestrial life, while dooming the planet in the process, and thus Gomo sets off on a mission to steal a powerful crystal and save his canine buddy from the slimy captive. Unfortunately he isn't able to save his game as well.Daedalic's Gomo is a much smaller game than the developer is used to, and this emphasis on accessible, simplified mechanics envelops the whole of the 1-2 hour experience. I'm fairly forgiving of short games, but in this case the lack of content and interactivity is rather shocking. Significant portions of the game amount to little more than cutscenes, with ""gameplay"" effectively revolving around clicking the right of the screen to keep things moving. When you do come across a puzzle, it's so basic and quick to solve that it almost feels insulting and a waste of time, forcing you to momentarily slow down and wait for animations to unfold before progressing to the next equally tedious moment.Gomo isn't a hopelessly bad game, in fact numerous parts are rather charming and enjoyable to watch, but it's design is painfully shallow and ultimately, entirely forgettable. The significant lack of interactivity leaves it in an awkward position feeling more like an extended animated short than an actual game, but the few entertaining moments are not at all enough to carry the experience by itself, which ends before you even realize it's started or has any chance of becoming more than a dismissible novelty.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												For some reason I had low expectations of this game, but it pleasantly surprised me. At first glance this game gave me a “Samorost” meets “Machinarium” kind of feel. Machinarium in sense of the art style and even character design, but Samorost in terms of length and quality (Free web game/demo kind of feeling).Despite the first impression I got from it, I got a lot more time out of it then I was expecting and did actually enjoy it. I thought it was going to be a 20 minute kind of game, but I managed just over 80 minutes on this. Which I don’t think is too bad.In terms of story, point and click games don’t usually lack. I’m not saying this game lacks story, it’s just a lot simpler than most point and click games I have played. The general story to this game is that your dog has been kidnapped by aliens and you have to get him back by finding and trading a crystal with the aliens. It’s nothing too special of a story but it was simple and it worked. This is one of those games that leave out dialog all together and just use simple sound effects and noises. The sound quality itself isn’t that great and I’m not too much of a fan of that whole approach although some games can make it work. This game is somewhere down the middle for me. In terms of using spoken sound effects and noises for people talking, I can usually stand that. But using the same kind of mouth noises and sound effects for more general things like walking or to emphasis gestures kind of annoys me. I’m not sure why, maybe just the sheer childlikeness of it?Luckily for me, this game is charming in other ways. So much so that it didn’t really bother me.The art style is nice. It’s cute, and it definitely adds to the charm of the game. Throughout the game there are background noises/animations that did make me smile to myself a few times. In terms of puzzles this game is very basic. The puzzles are pretty easy but the game itself is still fun despite that. All things mentioned so far, I think it’s important to mention now that maybe this game is better aimed at younger audiences. Although I did enjoy it, it’s very simple in many ways so if you are looking for a challenge and a time sinker, this isn’t likely it. All in all I liked it. It was a fun way to kill a bit of time. If you are a fan of the point and click genre and are looking for something else, maybe give this a go. TL;DR : Fun, light-hearted, little point and click game maybe aimed at younger audiences. It’s charming, cute and a fun way to kill an hour or two.  "

												You know those copyright evading knock-off toys? Like that toy robot your grandpa bought for you than can pretzel its way into a truck cab and is called Optimally Prime Transporter? This game was okay. It is certainly entertaining enough to keep you engaged for the 60-90 minutes it takes to complete.But it still feels like Machinarium. A lot. Only difference is that someone took all the creativity and charm of Machinarium, and replaced it with an antropormorphic condom that makes you wish you were playing Machinarium instead.			"

												I bought this for my kid and it was a good buy.I read a few other reviews and people seem to complain about the slow pace, lack of action and the puzzles being too simple. Well that may be so if you are a hardcore gamer. But for a 6 years old child the puzzles were just right (I had to help with a couple but mostly he could figure everything out himself). The aesthetics of the game are nice, there is nothing that wouldn't be ok for PG rating and the character himself was found to be cute. So I recommend it if you have a kid or if you like casual games of this sort (point-and-click puzzler with nice hand drawn aesthetics).If you're looking for an action packed game, I don't know what you're even doing here :)			"

												A simple find-the-clicky-spot type of adventure. Aliens have stolen the dog of the protagonist, who looks like a middle-aged sackboy. A bunch of totally random shenanigans follow. Nothing really makes sense or coalesces into a rational narrative, but neither is anything really that funny, quirky or zany. It's just weird for the sake of being weird.Gomo feels like an animation showcase: Most of the time you're waiting for a lengthy non-interactive walking/climbing sequence to complete so that you can start looking for the next hotspot. Surprisingly mind-numbing gameplay for a game categorized as a puzzler. The only thing that puzzles my mind is what were the designers smoking when they decided this poor man's Samorost was something they wanted to do?			"

												I found this game incredibly tedious. The little animations of the main character were cute, the first couple times.

It's a cute premise, but the game itself was rather boring. =/			"

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/gomo-game-review/Gomo, a point-and-click adventure about a journey to get a best friend back. I have not played a proper point-and-click game in a while, but this was quite a treat.Gomo is a small game, and I mean that story-wise and resolution-wise. The game does not run at widescreen, which was fairly annoying. I would have liked to see the game running at 1080p. Gomo is like a lot of other point-and-click games. It consists of a variety of primitive puzzles, some being stupidly easy, with some others taking a bit more time. These puzzle elements made the game a bit more enjoyable in a gameplay sense and I enjoyed them.There's not much else to the game, it is a point-and-click adventure after all. There's a little exploration to it and the game contains no violence. You don't even need to be literate to play the game, it's very simplistic. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it'll just be more appealing to those looking for a nice, short game.The game conveys a nice story without the use of language. It's quite neat actually. The story is incredibly generic, but the way it is conveyed makes it much more powerful. Gomo is searching for his best friend, who was taken from him. He'll end up going far beyond what players would expect in order to get his best friend back. The game's art style was lovely, as was the music. The music was very atmospheric and immersive, when combined with the backgrounds and art displayed throughout Gomo's adventure.Overall, Gomo is a short, but nice adventure that appeals to point-and-click fans with little time on their hands. It combines a charming story with great music and art into one small, enjoyable package. I recommend Gomo for any point-and-click fans.

												6.2/10 - How far would you travel to find your best friend?Another solid Daedalic offering; if not shorter than most! Completing the campaign took my only about an hour, so I personally wouldn't fork out the entire price tag.You are Gomo, a burlap sack of sorts who must travel the world in search of his best friend. You literally will go to the moon and back in your search of this majestic, dreamlike world. The character does move quite slowly, but since the world is so well crafted I didn't mind. The puzzles are quite easy and require some simple solutions, but they will not indicate if you are successful or not which can cause you to waste a little time before moving on. I found that the simple overlooked solution is generally the right one. Worth $2.99; it’s good but only 1 hour in length. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												Gomo looks and feels like a cheap knock-off of Machinarium. Even the amorphous character kind of resembles the nice robot in Machinarium. The soundtrack seems to be copied from Rock of Ages.The problem with Gomo is that although it had every elements to be a nice game, but the developers failed to make it more interactive, to make it fun. Most of the time the player is (un)patiently waiting for the character to move or finish doing something. The first 20 minutes of the game requires interaction from the played for less than 30 seconds. Watching grass grow is more interactive than playing Gomo.This is one of those games that I am gald I didn't have to pay full price for, and I must confess that after all the card drops the game was immediatly uninstalled. I don't recommend this game unless it is free. Otherwise, forget it.			"

												THIS MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS!I was very excited to purchase and play this game, but was incredibly disappointed by the end. It only has about six easy puzzles to figure out and a boring storyline. You learn nothing about Gomo except for the fact that he lost his dog. You don't know what he is exactly, why everything is underground, why these aliens took his dog in the first place, why you randomly travel back into time to nuke a town (the only humurous and non-irritating part of the game to me), why above ground is like a farm type of area...the unanswered questions really are endless. He moves very slowly with every movement which is irritating and the sound effects are absolutely horrible. All of the sound effects literally sounded like the creators made them with their mouths. For example, when Gomo falls, it sounds like a literal whistle noise someone is making. I would suggest not this gameto anyone. It was a complete waste of time and money. Oh and one more thing, the ending credits are very strange. And it's not even a funny strange really; just a super weird ""this game just made me mad and now I have to deal with what the creators think is humorous"" strange.			"

												Gomo.. oh Gomo.. you little sack of.. umm, stuffing?The first 5 Minutes of the Game didn't really capture me. Gomo moves rather slowly, with slow animations. I just thought I was going to be in for a grind to push through. Afterwards though, I started to enjoy the ""internal giggle"" moments that Gomo has to offer.In the Steam Store Page it states; - Surreal journey packed with challenging puzzles.- Creative puzzle design.I found the Puzzles neither challenging, nor creative. They are the basics that you will see in many Point and Click Games.However, that doesn't at all change the fact that I enjoyed Gomo for it's short enjoyment. It was well made, and humorous. Do I think it's worth Full Price? Nope. It's best bought during a Sale.Genre- Point and ClickGame Elements- PuzzleAverage Playthrough- 1 HourLiked- Cutely strange Character- Nice Art- Some funny momentsDisliked- Far to simple			"

												Decent wordless sci-fi puzzle adventure.Gomo's cute. It's a little over an hour long, and you guide Gomo through various casual puzzle levels, mostly operating some machinery, as he (she? it?) sets out to get the stolen pet back. There's not really any dialogue, and your inventory only has 3 slots (which go unused most of the time), so you can see it's not much of a point&click adventure in the traditional sense, but it operates as if it was one, and the art certainly conveys the feeling that we're moving in a weird and alien world. Windowed, it is 800x600; fullscreen, slightly larger (1030x800 ?) with black borders added.For its length, the regular price seems a bit steep, but the game has been bundled a few times and goes on deep sales regularly, so it is quite possible to buy this game for a price that is more reasonable. If you manage that, it's certainly a pleasant way to while away an hour.Get it on sale.			"

												Pretty fun game for what it is. Gomo is really cute and does a lot of adorable things and the game is difficult enough to keep you playing but not so hard you quit. However sometimes it does get way to easy and it can be pretty tedious. Plus the lack of a story is a bit lame and I wish I could learn more about the world. And it is waaaay too short for almost $10 dollars. If it's on sale it's worth the buy but it's definitely got it's kinks.			"

Its enjoyable to watch, and you get small satisfactions as you solve the puzzles.  They're not Silent Hill 3 Hard mode, or anything near but it provides a good segway into what happens next.It's got a great sense of humor and the music is utterly fantastic.  The background events spice up the screens and keep your attention.It's not for everyone as some may find the lack of clearly defined story annoying, or seeing it as too simple.  I think overall it's a great game and I do recommend it to anyone who likes stylish and fun games that don't require a lot of time or effort dedicated.I would absolutely love to try more games from the developer.

Short version: 82%Short but oh so sweet, Gomo is a wordless room-by-room point-and-click/puzzle adventure game that may end before the 90 minute mark, but those 90 minutes are guaranteed to be memorable and fun.Long version:There is a very small sub-genre among point ‘n’ click games which relies solely on visuals: no narration, no dialogues, everything is told in pictures. It is a great artistic challenge for the designers, since everything has to be told by actions and facial expressions; plus it opens up possibilities to include a plethora of details that would probably go unnoticed otherwise. In Gomo’s case these are small (or sometimes large) visual gags that are littered all over in every scene.The gameplay follows a room by room design, where you have to interact with scene elements and sometimes collect and use items to get to the other end of the screen. There are also a few more conventional puzzles here and there, but even with those Gomo is little more than an interactive cartoon. For adults at least. For small children it may act as a good educational software to teach common problem solving.Like most similar games, Gomo is short, 60 to 90 minutes long. But even at full price it costs about as much as a movie ticket, providing at least as much fun as a film would.			"

												Gomo is really not a bad game.  It has some charming parts and lacks the frustration that a lot of point & click titles insert into their puzzles to artifically increase their game length.  On the bad side though, the game is short...really short...as in you can complete it in about an hour or so short.  Also, while charming, the game just isn't engaging.  You aren't going to be super interested in the story or the gameplay.  This game is great for younger gamers or perhaps a real casual fan of point & clicks...for the majority of other gamers though you can consider Gomo a ""nono"" for being worth a purchase.			"

												This game is a very short but cute and fun point and click adventure. If you don't have much time to spare and would like to complete an entire point and click adventure game, this is the perfect game. If you enjoyed Machinarium, you will enjoy this one too. Please keep in mind that it is very short, unlike Machinarium which takes like 20-24 hours to complete. This game only takes about 1-2 hours to complete and the puzzles are not very challenging at all. Otherwise, the graphics are cute and the gameplay is fun. I definitely recommend this game, especially if it is on sale. :)			"

YouTube™ Video: GOMO Preview (Steam/PC) 

			Views: 44		

			In this video, we show a preview of the upcoming game ‘Gomo’ for Steam/PC. Video was Recorded and Voiced by The Hidden Levels one and only Mirage.		

 Gomo is a very basic point-and-click game where players take control of a lone, sack-boy who abruptly wakes up from a frightful nightmare to discover the absence of his best friend/dog. He is then charged with the dutiful task of retrieving a sought after relic for the perpetrators of the dognapping as an equivalent exchange for his companion.      Visually, the game has intriguing, monochromatic, hand-drawn environments along with rooms and characters oversimplified in design. While venturing and trekking through each level, little events play out to entertain the player while having no necessary connection to the actual plot.  Controls are entirely devoted to the mouse, making the protagonist move, observe and gather up key items which is then stored in one of three inventory slots. The animation of the character tends to feel deliberate and, at many moments, appears to take too much time to execute; however, the quirky mannerism of the protagonist makes up for it as you can’t help but smile at his awkward demeanor.   Throughout the exploration of the game, players will encounter puzzles which aren’t created with much complexity. The challenges seem too simple and it was felt at times like they could solve themselves. There’s no means of direct dialogue but just the sound of the creepy, overly husky grunts from the main character and high, incoherent murmurs from the antagonist. GOMO is definitely a relaxing game because of its slow pace which is a nice change after a long stressful day. Only downfall is that it’s far too easy but still an enjoyment. :)			"

												It's decent but its way too short. This game is reminicent of free games already on steam so you shouldn't waste your time. It's fun and has some cute puzzles but there just isn't enough content there. although I did come real close to finishing a Daedilic game without using a walkthrough. No such luck. The game is much to short and I feel like I wasted 50 cents buying it. This game is just not good enough to be worth money.			"

TL;DR: Gomo is a short but sweet little adventure game, offering adorable graphics coupled with a silly story and very low puzzle difficulty. Best suited to younger gamers.Full Review: Gomo is a sweet little point-and-click adventure in which you control Gomo, a cuddly lil' dude who gets his pet dog stolen by a mean old alien overlord! The only chance of return for our poached pooch is a mysterious red crystal (naturally imbued with mystical powers of course), which our alien overlord is actually very happy to swapsies with us. So off we embark, on a quest to find this crystal thingy by any bizarre means necessary.Now while ""by any bizarre means necessary"" includes zipping down garbage chutes, out-smarting security robots and firing atomic warheads across alternate dimensions, Gomo's gameplay is actually highly linear, and the solution for how you're supposed to do all these crazy things is usually pretty straightforward. You also have just three inventory slots for objects (which are rarely used), and each ""scene"" will only offer one or two puzzles to solve - most of which you'll understand as soon as you see them. So I get the impression that Gomo is probably aimed at younger players, and reckon the last reviewer's description of it as an ""interactive animation"" has it spot on.I am personally a big fan of point-and-clicks, so I was happy enough playing through to the end and really enjoyed Gomo's silly humour. However, after a while I started to get frustrated with the character's movement. You often have to click multiple times simply to get Gomo to cross the scene, as he needs to be in precisely the right place for you to perform certain interactions. Because of this you're often left confused as to where your character should be standing simply to progress to the next area, even though you know exactly what to do. However I doubt children would be put off by this.All in all? If you see this game on sale and have a younger gamer or two to entertain, maybe pick it up for a rainy day. Otherwise I personally feel there are far better ""low difficulty"" point-and-click titles on Steam on the moment, such as Detective Grimoire, Broken Age, Samorost and so many others.			"

 This game is actually quite funny and unique. I bought in for like 0,50 € in a sale and I would have paid more. But not 4,99 €. That is way too much for only about 1,5 hours till the end of the game (rest of the playtime is for cards).Most of all I liked the character gomo  (some kind of living bag?!), the unique drawing style, the music and the funny animations and small jokes. What I didn't like is that the game is very very short and most of the puzzles are ridiculously easy On the other side there are one or two totally unsolvable puzzles. I didn't like either, that you don't really have a story and problems that you have to solve, but you're just running around and doing stuff.All in all I liked this game, but with this great character and cool style it could have been a milestone of the recent adventure history! Sadly there is way too much missing for that...

												When I downloaded this game, I was hoping for something like Machinarium, which I enjoyed a whole bunch, but instead I got a poorly drawn boring wannabe of an adventure game. Puzzles are simplistic, and instead of being puzzling they are actually just frustrating. Much of the content is redundant, such as having a door and a button right next to that door to open that door. All this does is make the game more frustrating. The little cutscenes and animations are meant to be cute but instead they are annoying, they detract from the flow of the game, making the game a stuttering experience. One might argue that they are meant to be an eye candy, but it will take a whole lot more than just a few annoying instances of so-called ""eye candy"" to make this game look good. Overall, the metacritic score (currently 50) is a very accurate description of this game. Nothing to love but nothing to really hate. It is incredibly mediocre and definitely not worth the full asking price. I will enjoy deleting it from my computer after I am finished with it.			"

												Gomo is more an interractive movie than a game. You interract by clicking stuff such as direction to take, items to take/use so can you can slowly advance in your quest. The story is very short, like 1h but you can unlock bonus content during the quest by doing certain things. I have succeded to unlock 1 bonus of 3 and i am not planning to try it, sorry. I got this game from a cheap bundle but i would not recommend to buy for the full price of 8$. On the other side, Gomo is a cute and funny character! :)			"

												A decent little game, Gomo doesn't take too long to complete. It would probably be good for kids, but if you're an older gamer getting this game in a bundle or on sale is probably the way to go. So with that said, here are some pros and cons.PROS- Art style is quaint but unique and will probably age well because of that.- The idle animations in the foreground and background are entertaining enough.- Puzzles weren't too challenging but not necessarily hand-outs.- Does have bonus levels.- The mechanics are easy enough to get a handle on.CONS- The animations of the main character, though cute, may sometimes try your patience.- The story, simple though it is, is short and thus so is the game.- The differences between the bonus levels are cosmetic for the most part.- Just a pet peeve for me, the inventory automatically threw stuff out instead of letting the player figure out when an object was obselete. Probably not a con for most.- Not very replayable. You'll proabably do all you'll ever do on the first play-thru.So, all in all, it'll only take an hour or so to complete. I almost didn't recommend this game, but, all things considered, for what was offered you get pretty much what you might expect. And it's not like the game wasn't entertaining in its own rights, just don't expect to be playing it hours on end.			"

												Daedalic has a very high standard for point-and-click adventure games but Gomo is very rare exception to this rule as it doesn't really live up to the Daedalic name. The puzzles are easy and all of your solutions are usually found within one frame from which it is also impossible to backtrack. The story doesn't exactly wow you either and the game is overall very short (I completed it in 81 minutes). All of these factors could only lead to a failing grade otherwise, but it is obvious that Gomo is marketed at young children aged 10 or under. It's a wonderful beginner game and if you can get Gomo bundled along with other games or at a very low price (under €5), then it's definitely worth a shot.			"

The ending and credits sequence especially.Would recommend, but for less than the asking price.			"

												After reading the reviews of this game, I waffled about picking it up, but I really wanted to give it a chance.  I love point and click adventures, I'm a fan of anything with aliens as a major plot device, and I really liked the art style.  Unfortunately, I can only halfheartedly recommend this game after experiencing it. The major problem I have with the game is the pacing.  For such a short game, you spend a great deal of time waiting.  There are unskippable cutscenes that are too long for the information they convey, and your character's action animations are incredibly slow.  The animation itself is cute and well-drawn, but it shouldn’t take longer to pick up an object and put it in your inventory than it does to walk to where you need to use that object and solve the puzzle.  Additionally, the game initially gives you a sense of urgency with a countdown timer, making it appear like you have to rush, and then the game immediately and frustratingly takes away your control - the very next screen, your character starts playing around with random stuff in the scenery, wasting time.  Five minutes later, though, it doesn't even matter anymore because they seemingly throw the entire timer plot point out the window.  Speaking of plot, nothing really made sense in this game.  Sure, you are questing after your kidnapped dog, who you can only free by recovering some sort of glowing crystal that the aliens want, but everything beyond that falls into the ""because we felt like it"" category (especially that WC scene).  Randomness is not necessarily a bad thing - there are some cute sight gags, and some of the crazy content is downright fun - just don't expect a coherent narrative.  The item-based puzzles in this game are actually pretty straightforward, though.  Pick up a thing, walk a few inches, use thing.  Not too complicated.  The only aspect that might throw you off is the interface.  Each screen is programmed to act like an aggregate of smaller areas instead of a whole, so you will need to click on an excessive amount of movement arrows to access all of the individual sections.  Additionally, aside from light switches, the swirly ""interactable item here"" icon will usually only appear if you are within arm’s reach of the object.  Gameplay would have been greatly improved with the ability to smoothly walk across the screen, and with all of the interactables showing an indication on hover.  The game contains a handful of mini-game puzzles that range from mildly interesting to exceedingly frustrating.  I actually had to look one up because I could tell that the colours were significant, but the puzzle as a whole was not intuitive.Another frustrating puzzle was the bonus content.  There are three unlockable bonus features to uncover over the course of the game.  Once you find the trigger in-game, the new content is permanently available from the main menu.  One of the keys is pretty obvious, but I found the other two to be easily overlooked.  I actually played through the game three separate times before I found them all; however, I didn't feel the payoff was worth it because they are basically three versions of the same thing.I played through with ""easy mode"" turned off, since most people said the game was not challenging enough.  I found out the only actual difference between the difficulty settings is that puzzle solution targets are not highlighted in hard mode.  This factoid is never explained within the game.  Overall, I liked the game's art aesthetic and atmosphere.  Some of the humor was funny, there were a lot of amusing background details, and the main character was endearing.  I also liked many of the locations, and the puzzles were pretty decent for a short casual game.  I still can't give this game high marks, though, because of the annoying mini-games, the clunky interface, the repetitious bonus content, and the consistently inconsistent pacing.  I rate this game a 5.5/10.			"

												The artwork is fresh and quite funny; this game is a visual and audio treat! A perfect game for young kids (3-8 years old) or folks new to gaming.  The point-and-click makes it easy to figure out what to do, and the toughest part about the puzzles is figuring out what aspects of the landscape are actually usable. The story line is basic; don't look for any deep meaning here. When played in one sitting, the mechanics and puzzles can feel a little boring, so I'd recommend this for your hangover days. It's a really nice Sunday morning game, and the credits are quite soothing. Not for folks looking for high action, and it may be too slow or simple for really experienced players.			"

												Basically a cute, short animation that you simply set into motion. Very little effort on your part is necessary. There are puzzles and a couple of the solutions are kind of obscure, but there is a minimum of interaction (indeed, there is a minimum of content herein, but you can tell that it was made with love, if that means anything to you (not a charged statement, by the way, just a simple statement xD )). Good for a simple diversion. Do not expect too much at all. I recommend this game if you're a kid from the nineties that still enjoys those cartoons from your youth. Gomo has that sort of vibe to it (if not a little more juvenile); also, it is a tad like Salad Fingers (er actually Hubert Cumberdale), if the intent of Salad Fingers was to entertain kids, not crush souls.

It is a pretty short game but it was so cute and funny, I cannot imagine why it would have so many bad reviews, other than from people who perhaps just don't like this type of game.

												While playing this I was trying to decide whether or not the game is intentionally this terrible; if it is intentionally this much like a cheap Machinarium but with a child friendly difficulty level. The ""puzzles"" just don't cut it and surprisingly for a Daedalic game - which always have puzzles that are so convoluted there's no way you can solve them all without a walkthrough, this game was too easy. I'm glad I got this game at 90% off because frankly, it wasn't even worth the £0.39 I spent on it. It's so desperately trying to be a typical Amanita game without any narration or awkward voice acting (Daedalic's favorite thing if you didn't know) but the whole game suffers in return. So let's see, is there anything good about this game? Uhh I guess the music is alright. Still not worth £0.39 though.			"

												I was not impressed with this game. The character doesn't talk, so there is no help if you get stuck, the puzzles seem completely unrelated to the plot - why am I crushing rocks while my dog is missing? Nothing is particularly challenging, but it is convoluted and illigical. I could get over all of that though. It is the game mechanics that made me quit. The character's ambling slow movements drove me crazy from the very first click. Then, I discovered that clickables are only clickable if you are next to them, so i had to do three clicks to walk, waiting on the slow character, just to see if anything on the screen was clickable, and there doesn't seem to be a hot spot indicator. I found myself using a walkthrough almost immediately because I didn't have the patience to walk back and forth across the screen repeatedly. I won't be finishing this game. There is nothing fun about it.3/10			"

It's just not worth eight dollars.  Maybe $3.99, but not eight.  It's short, and the game almost plays itself at points.  There's a part in the begining where you bother a guy watching TV.  There's no player interaction, just Gomo messing with some guy.  It adds nothing to the plot or playability.   I would call this Gamer's First Point and Click.There are some really nice background events, however.  Bugs creep, guys sled, Little Red and the Wolf have a lightsaber battle and ride off into the sunset...  it is a visually attractive game.  With a bit of tweeking this could be a great game.

												Gomo is an enjoyable game, there's no doubt about that. The characters are charming, the environments are well made, and the music is stellar, often surprising me with its exceptional quality. However, the game suffers from two fatal flaws: its length, and its difficulty. The puzzles of the game are quite simple, clearly being geared towards a younger audience. The average gamer, however, can complete them very easily. This is a major contributing factor to how short the game is; it can be beaten in about an hour with relative ease. There are games that supply much more entertainment for eight dollars, so don't consider this one unless you have small children and/or the game is on sale.			"

												Well well well... I'm very disappointed.Even though it takes only about an hour to finish Gomo, it is more than enough to get bored. The character takes AGES to move around and to pick/use items, which is fine the first few times because animations are cute and everything, but then it's just irritating. There are about only 5 or 6 puzzles in the whole game and they couldn't be easier (and I even made sure to uncheck the default ""easy mode"" option). No fun at all.Also, there's no plot or narrative whatsoever, just a bunch of non-sense randomness. Again, it's funny and cute the first couple times, but then it gets old REAL quick.			"

												This is a difficult one to review as the game is very charming and well made.My complaint with it is that it's way too short and far too easy. All in all it's more like watching a cartoon than playing a game.But the game gets you smiling very often by using it's special type of humour, like when ... uhum ... i don't wanna spoil you here.After all you get some replay value though, because there are three bonus games that are hidden in the game itself. During my first playthrough I only achieved the last one. And from that the only thing I can say you should definitely not await the bonus games to be any less hillarious than the main game.Somehow this game achieves to take itself and the genre absolutely not serious in a way few games do so one could call it almost art. And the style of the graphics even underline this. It's made with love and you can feel it the whole game long ... well ... at least as long as it will last ...I think you should get it on discount.			"

												Gomo Review - This and more available at http://www.electric-banana.co.uk/culture/best-games/gomo/What’s this?Gomo is a short and sweet point & click game, with a quirky, 2D Tim Burton feel. The debut game from Slovakian developers ‘Fishcow Studios’, Gomo is a great steading to start on, and shows the talent that could come from ‘Fishcow Studios’ in the future.And what’s it like?The fun and challenging game follows the sack-boy styled character Gomo on his search for his beloved dog, Dingo, who has been cruelly kidnapped by an alien. By completing puzzles and fixing all manner of machines, you must navigate Gomo to a crystal, the ransom for his sack-dog.The game itself is interesting, and caters to all levels of puzzle-solvers, with an “easy” mode for those who could easily end up throwing their PC across the room otherwise. There is a good mixture of object-based puzzles, as well as simple point and click elements. Some of the puzzles take longer than would be hoped to even figure out what is needed to be done, and there are even some that you have to just fiddle with until they work – despite this, Gomo is largely a creative and exciting game.Travelling through many different locations, the background is always amusing. From satirical army posters in the testing bunkers, to a stick man reaching the top of a mountain, then sliding back down. In-keeping with the quirky-traveller style of Gomo’s character, his body has a back zip to solve the omnipresent problem for all game characters: what happens when you pick up more things than you can hold? The whole style of the game has a very hand-drawn and honest indie feel to it, but the story and gameplay are as refined as you would find in any major puzzle game.To some audiences, the non-verbal style of that game may be increasingly annoying, as being stuck on the same puzzle for five minutes makes the music a little grating. But, the satisfaction of finally understanding a puzzle makes it worth the struggle.What’s the final verdict?Despite being a quick play-through, Gomo challenges and amuses, with an endearing design, traditionally repetitive music, as well as some humorous “WTF” moments to be had in alternate dimensions. ‘Fishcow Studios’ have created a game for all levels of puzzle-solving gamers on the quest for a sack’s best friend.Words by Louise Egan4/5			"

												I would consider this more of an interactive cartoon than an actual game, even as far as point-and-clicks go, which I'm a big fan of.  There is no challenge to the game and the only redeeming quality is the humerous interactions the character has with the environment and the surroudings itself as well as the attractive artwork.  I beat the whole ""game"" in about an hour and spent a few minutes on the tedious, identical bonus minigames.  If you feel the need to check this one out I HIGHLY recommend getting it on sale.  A big sale.  Like next-to-free cheap.			"

												Extremeley short (one hour and a half!) and very easy. However it's very fun and creative! People compare it to Machinarium but IMO it's way better because it got what Machinarium lacks: common sense, logic, fun and a big cuteness factor. Every tiny detail is well done and even the backgrounds are fun to watch with all the silly sketches going on. I didn't like Machinarium because of its emptiness design - which however perfectly suited the robots world - but Gomo managed to make me come back to logic puzzles games. I love the graphics, very Game & Watch style: pure and sleek, the lightning is very good, music is a bit obnoxious but it goes well with the game's humor. I'm fine with the game length since I grabbed it on sale for 0.70€ :)TLDR: cute, fun and refreshing! Go for it when it's on sale!			"

												Why has this game an easy option?It's unnesecary, the game is already to easy.You don't really have to think, the solution is always in the same screen, with to or tree exceptions. But then the solution is in the next screen.You can't compare this game to other dedalc adventures, there you actually have to think or search for items.You can finish this game in around 80 minutes.If you could skip cutscenes or the animations when you pick something up or do something, then it would last 5 to 10 minutes.Because it's so short i played it again for the bonus games and that was just a waiste of time.The bonus games are just tree different of whak a mole type games.Im shure you will never play them.It's kinda sad, this game could be great game, but it's to easy and the sory is just meh....If you really whant to try it, wait for a good sale deal, at least 75 -80% off.

												Albeit simplistic and easy to play, Gomo is a fun little point-and-click adventure game. The strongest point is definitely the sound design, but the artwork and animation require a worthy mention. The story is fairly basic, but cute nonetheless, while the setting and the atmosphere are nicely constructed. There are enough puzzles to keep you busy every  once in a while, but the difficulty is very low for all of them. The game's strongest point is definitely not working your intellect.Unfortunately the game is very short as it will probably take an adventure enthusiast about 90-120 minutes of uninterrupted play time to completem counting the time to admire the drawings and also catch a few easter eggs and cameos in the background. The difficulty is very low for an adventure game and even though it will not provide high levels of intellectual stimulatios, it does make up for the visual and audio elements and the overall atmosphere created.The game starts by default in easy mode which can be turned off in the settings, but this only removes the hints for certain item actions so it's not going to add much to the difficulty. I found the lack of separate volume controls for the music and the fx quite annoying as the music tends to be very loud compared to the folly and effects. Running this game on my native 1440*900 with full screen enabled rendered the active window of the game surrounded by black borders meaning the game has a fixed resolution and will not scale at all. This might prove irritating for anything above 720p and I can't even imagine how it might look on 24"" or 27"" screens.In conclusion, if you want a fast, easy and fun point-and-click with basic puzzles, great sound, good artwork and a nice atmosphere check Gomo out, but make sure to get it on sale, as the 7.99 EUR they charge for it over in Europe is pretty high compared to what it has to offer.I'll give it a 6.5/10			"

												I just played this, and my verdict is basically ""Yes, if it's on sale."" It's only $5 at full price anyway, but it's really short (took me less than an hour and a half from start to finish) and there's not a lot to it. The main impression I got was that they wanted to make a cartoon but for some reason they were forced to make video game instead. It's fairly whimsical and things don't really happen for any particular reason, but the puzzles are easy enough that that's not frustrating. There are a couple of sliding tile puzzles that don't really fit the style of the other puzzles in the game, but they're not randomised or anything so you can just use a walkthrough (which I did).It reminded me a lot of Journey of a Roach, only not as good. The protagonist does speak, but rarely, and the dialogue is not important. Mostly you just press buttons and see what happens and then move on to the next screen. I was briefly stuck in a couple of places just because I couldn't work out what I was supposed to achieve, but most of the time there's not even really a puzzle, you just find the thing to click on. Sometimes you'll have to use an item from your inventory, but they're almost all one-use and given to you right where you'll need them. It's not a challenging game, there's not much story and very little characterisation, but the animation is nice and it doesn't take long to get through.			"

												Albeit simplistic and easy to play, Gomo is a fun little point-and-click adventure game. The strongest point is definitely the sound design, but the artwork and animation require a worthy mention. The story is fairly basic, but cute nonetheless, while the setting and the atmosphere are nicely constructed. There are enough puzzles to keep you busy every  once in a while, but the difficulty is very low for all of them. The game's strongest point is definitely not working your intellect.Unfortunately the game is very short as it will probably take an adventure enthusiast about 90-120 minutes of uninterrupted play time to completem counting the time to admire the drawings and also catch a few easter eggs and cameos in the background. The difficulty is very low for an adventure game and even though it will not provide high levels of intellectual stimulatios, it does make up for the visual and audio elements and the overall atmosphere created.The game starts by default in easy mode which can be turned off in the settings, but this only removes the hints for certain item actions so it's not going to add much to the difficulty. I found the lack of separate volume controls for the music and the fx quite annoying as the music tends to be very loud compared to the folly and effects. Running this game on my native 1440*900 with full screen enabled rendered the active window of the game surrounded by black borders meaning the game has a fixed resolution and will not scale at all.

												An insultingly short and uninteresting point-and-click. There are only a handful of unoriginal puzzles, and the rest is just clicking through slowly.The graphics and animation are cute, though a bit rough. As others have pointed out, the style is a very obvious ripoff of that of Machinarium and Botanicula, which are both infinitely better games.I did enjoy some of the little jokes happening in the background, almost like easter eggs: at one point you see the Big Bad Wolf attacking Red Riding Hood and she responds by pulling out a lightsaber and then riding the wolf. The ending credits are also fun -- though it's a bit sad to see how many people worked on what appears to be a game made by a single art student for a final school project.			"

												An inexplicably stunning showcase of developer free will and recursive division method puzzle coding that bellows an unmistakeable, courageous cry into the fierce altercation of defining what constitutes a ""game"".Gomo, with an undeviating knack for atroit storytelling, remains the most stunning audio-visual I have encountered since availing myself to Steam. Interlaying plot and mechnical substance are the bread and butter of this concrete dissemination into the indie platform, an infrastructure which has gone from strength to strength since its establishment. Before any other function, Fishcow Studio's ""Gomo"" remains in force a splendid narrative. An intimate character study, the effervescent relationship of political attitudes between a hound and its proprietor, and an irreplaceably joyful reunion that flourishes as the last flicker of hopefulness to overcome the oppression and destitutions of an extraterrestrial invasion all faithfully describe the title, each as naturalistically error-free as the genetics of the standard isometric-hexoctahedral diamond. Ergo, Gomo's only shortcoming seems to reflect upon its unforgivingly dense attitude. Can Michelangelo's ""The Battle of the Centaurs"" be sincerely appreciated and understood in a matter of meer  hours as an effortlessly-elementary, offduty joe-boy? Is Nadir Alfonso's ""Spoki"" best appreciated on the scanty centimeters of one's consumer display? The answer is implied in its impossibility—but these are affairs of thought deemed innesential to the practicality of my review. Ergo, the influential aspects of Gomo's achievements frequently lie in its nearly imperceivable array of substance and meaning. While primarily a mounmentally grand application of effective component-driven recounter of chronicles, short and imperative, again and again, Gomo holds upstandingly well as a puzzle piece, both from the trenchant creaks of the drawing board and in practice. Decadent, yet unforgivingly minimal and hollow, new-age strategies towards Pascal and Assembly-based game programming create an interwoven pattern of familiar convictions and challenging endeavors that ultimately cast a stronger framework for the heart-warming, carefree broth that is Gomo. Principally, Gomo has expunged my prevailing interests and expectations, relaying the roads of my heart and brain with an indispensable appreciation for first-rate programming, graphical optimization, and fundamentally genius storytelling through the puzzle genre. All in all, I am left to promulgate the simple fact, that behind all of its never-ending intricacies and undulating passion for a cunning yet discrete product, Gomo is, quintessentially, a game.			"

												Gomo is a nonsensical (in every sense of the word) point-and-click puzzler that takes about 90-120 minutes to complete. The puzzle difficulty varies from pretty easy to a little bit of thought, nothing too hard and not necessarily any that are walkthrough-worthy. I would say it's pretty kid-friendly too as there is virtually no violence, basic humor and little reading or speech. Also, there is very little exploration. Overall just a short and simple game. I would say pick it up on special or in a bundle, would be my recommendation, and it's a nice game if you've got an hour or two to spare.			"

												Ok, I got this game expecting something like Machinarium, which I enjoyed immensely. Well, I was hugely disappointed. Here is why:Absence of the story:There is none. The supposed story is that you have to save your dog. However, after the first minute of the game until the last minute of the game, nothing makes sense. Even after finishing the game and reading some walkthroughs to see if I missed something, I still do not understand why things were happening. The entire game can be viewed basically as a collection of random puzzles stitched together by a loose thread. Laughably simplistic puzzles:Did I say puzzles? Sorry for misleading you, but there are no puzzles in this game. Everything is straightforward. Unless you are 5 year old or braindead, it should not take you more than an hour to finish the entire game. I finished this game in 118 minutes, and I am quite bad at puzzle games.Point and click:There is only one puzzle in this game. It is figuring out what is clickable and what is not. Earlier, I said it should take around 1 hour to finish the game. Well, half of that time you will spend trying to figure out what part of the scene you can interact with. This is the only puzzle in the game, and very annoying one.As a conclusion, avoid this game even if someone offers it to you for free.Instead, try Machinarium or Botanicula.			"

												At first, playing Gomo reminded me of Machinarium and Botanicula, two very well designed and fun ""new school"" adventure games. Unfortuantely, the resembleance with those two games faded away pretty quickly. First off, the puzzles in Gomo are so much easier that they're barely fun at all. This ""bore"" is ampified by the fact that the puzzle mechanics are the same in more than 50% of the puzzles. Furthermore, all puzzles in Gomo are entirely episodic. That means: one screen = one puzzle (with very little exception). That just doesn't fly nowadays anymore. Especially considering that for a price of currently 8 € you get much more elaborate games that will provide you with more hours of fun (Gomo took me less than two hours to complete!).Putting all this together, I gotta say that Gomo was not worth the price. I'd be willing to pay around 2 or 3 € for a game of that size and difficulty. I do give credit however for the graphics which I liked and the funniest feet I ever saw in a video game ;)			"

Its honestly quite underatted and the bad reviews judge this game on its lenght so im gonna point out everything that i liked and disliked in this game. The game looks great and has a cute art style which i simply love. The puzzles are simple and are quite easy to figure out. The game also has a charming charecters designs that are a joy to look at and the game in itself is a blast to play through. The game also has some issues. The game is incredibly short clocking in at an hour. Some minor glitches but thats pretty much it. Overall Gomo is a great point and click adventure game that i suggest you check out if youre a fan of adventure games. I give Gomo a 7.5/10			"

												This game reaks with Machinarium-esque graphics, and it's obvious that something here was done intentionally. Nevertheless, this puzzle adventure is charming. Despite being an almost character-less sack-...thing, Gomo is really appealing, not only because of his looks, but his akward actions and grunts, seriously this thing took a dump when I had him inspect a toilet. So what is this game's plot? Pretty simple, some alien mook stole Gomo's dog and he got so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off he decided it's mandatory for him to ignore every obstacle in his path and rescue his canine pal. And this is where the gameplay comes in, and for a puzzle game this is actually waaay too easy. I'm myself not a puzzle enthusiast but atleast when I play a decent one I can scratch my head when solving the tasks the game gives me. Here, you have the most obvious puzzles ever. Even free flash games have harder brain-twisters than this specimen. But you know what, above that all the reason I give this a thumbs up is, well, the charm. I can't help but not resist helping Gomo, he's way too, shall we say, cute. And it's ridicoulous, because had this game looked different this would be an instant ""no"". Buy it if you want a short adventure that will surely warm your heart, but watch out for that price, 7€ is seriously way too demanding.			"

												I was hoping for some kind of twist in the ending to make up for gameplay, I was disapointed. I thought I turned off easymode, and the game was still stupidly easy. You don't have to think in this game at all, which I think is a cornerstone of all adventure point-and-click games. There were a few puzzles, I think 3 in total, none requireing much thought, they were typical puzzles, nothing new or unique. Just a very typical, generic, run of the mill Adventure point and click with a story that can be completed in under an hour, boring puzzles, and no thought process required to complete the game. :(			"

It's rediculously cute, like maybe the cutest game ever. The mouse in the tunnel, for example. And there seems to be no end to the unique animations.Right from the start, I turned off the ""easy mode"" - whatever that is - in the options.  I'm not good at these games but I'd rather attempt a challenge than spoil the game by making it too easySo far I'm doing good.

												Give me a neutral rating button for the love of godI don't recommend this game at full price but it's an entertaining bit of filler if you get it in one of Daedalic's bundles on sale. It took me 85 minutes to play the whole thing, including finding one of three bonus minigames (which you play from the main menu, not from within the game itself).It's a very simple game, both in terms of story -- transmitted without any real dialogue -- and the puzzle difficulty itself, so it's a relaxing little thing for an evening when you don't want to be taxed mentally. I found the art charming and Gomo's :/ face weirdly expressive, and the game got a few laughs out of me, so I don't regret giving it some time tonight. ...Now I guess I just have to leave it running long enough for three cards to drop.

												Gomo is a cute little game, however you must have no expectations if you want to enjoy it. The game has some nice artwork but is very short, unpolished and easy: painfully unchallenging. Do NOT buy it full price.			"

												Not a lot of game play (took about 1 hr), it's a point and click that you have to be very precise about where you click.  Graphics were nice, puzzles too easy.  Not bad for a buck but I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												Overall an enjoyable game but not something I'd usually pay money for (so glad it was on sale for like $1). It's basically about the same and play type of several free online flash games I've played. Not sure who decided this was good enough that people would pay for it but given the choice to go back I wouldn't buy it again. Also make sure you note down and/or take a picture of the clue from the WC on the toliet paper; at least for me when I went to play through a second time (missed a bonus, not that I should've cared since all 3 are pretty much the same thing) it wouldn't give me the clue again.

												A short but sweet, relaxing little adventure game with pretty graphics, catchy music, and some giggle-worthy jokes. Since you can (almost) always only work with what's currently on the screen, the puzzles aren't very hard and I didn't find myself stuck on anything for more than a couple of minutes at any point, so this is a nice game to play from start to finish in one sitting if you feel like saving the world real quick.

First playthrough time: 1 hourMajor Pros:Adorable art style with unique animations for the character while moving through every scene and around every obstacleEffective wordless storytellingMinor Pros:Hidden unlockable mini games are pretty funGame has a good sense of humorMajor Cons:Only an hour longPuzzles were occasionally too abstract and it wasn't clear what the goal wasMinor Cons:Story was at times overly ridiculousI found the game very cute, but not very challenging. Most puzzles spanned only a screen or two and didn’t require very many interactions to solve once you knew what the goal was. The story was also pretty ridiculous, but at points ridiculously adorable and the game had a good sense of humor (at one point little red riding hood is fighting the wolf with a light saber in the background). My main complaint was that the game was so short. It took me an hour to complete the story and although there are hidden mini-games to find and unlock that are accessible from the main menu, they didn’t increase the time I got out of the game all that much. Overall I thought the game was very cute and fun but was too short to make an impact.			"

												It's very pretty, but that's about all there is nice to say about this game. Under no circumstances was this worth what I paid for it. The puzzles are bland and generally amount to nothing more than clicking on everything clickable on the screen. A few of the puzzles use items picked up on previous screens, but not many. All in all, I was able to be the entire game in less than 2 hours. If the tediously long animations were sped up slightly, I suspect that this game would take less than half an hour to complete. I suppose this was a cheaper way to spend my time than a movie, though.TL;DR of this: if you want to be reminded of how good the Neverhood was without a game nearly as good as the Neverhood, buy this game.

												I was hoping for some kind of twist in the ending to make up for gameplay, I was disapointed. I thought I turned off easymode, and the game was still stupidly easy. You don't have to think in this game at all, which I think is a cornerstone of all adventure point-and-click games. There were a few puzzles, I think 3 in total, none requireing much thought, they were typical puzzles, nothing new or unique. Just a very typical, generic, run of the mill Adventure point and click with a story that can be completed in under an hour, boring puzzles, and no thought process required to complete the game. :(			"

												Uh-oh. Honestly, I feel VERY cheated for this. I only spent 0.79€ on game, but I feel really cheated.Why not try? The game is .... Fun... Kind of... Well, cute graphics and character, but this is just another point&click game you can find ALL over the internet for FREE. I wouldn't mind if this was a F2P game. Also, I was SHOCKED when I saw the original price. 8€ for a regular point&click game found ALL over the web, for FREE? I'm not saying it isn't ... Fun ... But honestly, it's such a rip off. These games can be found ALL over the web, and again, for FREE. What I really don't mind, is that there's also bonus content. I can't get pass the code door with WC, cause some alien voice keeps telling me (I think that's what he says): Insert coin. All the good in game is, nice sketchy graphics, cute and ""fun"" game, and 3 trading card drops. Accoring to ALL the bad things, this game is rated by me:3/10. No, I don't reccomend it, sadly. I would if it was free.			"

My nephew says that this game is a challenge for him, but for any person that have played before any adventure, Gomo could be a little basic.

												Gomo is a bit weird and cute in its weirdness, so the graphic makes up for a lot. Yet the interesting and beautiful surroundings cannot make up for a game that has the most linear gameplay I have ever experienced. It is just not much of a competition for any gamer who has played adventures before. One or two of the puzzles had me thinking, but mostly because I couldn't quite make out I could interact with something. Most of the time the competition was trying not too think in a too complicated way, schooled by adventures where every puzzle needs to be solved in more than just one screen.It is not all bad. As I said the surroundings are beautiful and you can see that a lot of love went into the game. Gomo is cute and I really wanted to help him... or her. The game definitely has its moments.			"

It's a cute little game with some puzzles and interesting locales and settings with very nice style. You'll go underground into a mining facility, through odd farms, and to the moon, all the while interacting with futuristic contraptions hanging around. However, I would expect a game of this length to go for 1-2 dollars at most. I don't really have anything to complain about, other than that it has a fixed resolution that is rather small, and the length is very short compared to its price. The game itself is enjoyable.			"

												The game's progress is rather slow because the movements of the character ""Gomo"" are also slow. Every time he picks up an item he just has to put it in his back (not backpack, IN his back) even though you might need the same item in a second. I played the game again just to unlock the bonus minigames but it was just a waste of time as all three are slight variations of a ""whack-a-mole"" game. Overall the game is okay, but in my opinion it's the type of game you'd rather give to a 10 year old to keep them busy for a couple of hours.			"

												A short but sweet, relaxing little adventure game with pretty graphics, catchy music, and some giggle-worthy jokes. Since you can (almost) always only work with what's currently on the screen, the puzzles aren't very hard and I didn't find myself stuck on anything for more than a couple of minutes at any point, so this is a nice game to play from start to finish in one sitting if you feel like saving the world real quick.

												A fun little game, entertaining and full of character. The art is something I never would have expected to see in a game, and I loved it. The quality and style did not change, the puzzles are fun and require you to think, but not enough to be frustratingAll in all, a sweet game that I enjoy playing, and will definitely do so again in the future			"

												谜题很简单，游戏时长很短，但是动画部分还有点意思。打折时候也就几块钱，玩上一个来小时也算可以接受。The puzzles are quite easy, the game course is as short as a little more than one hour, but the animation part is fun with the strange hero. So it is worth the price when discounted.			"
