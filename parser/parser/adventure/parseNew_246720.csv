												Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!""Wayward Manor,"" huh? Let me start this out by saying I LOVE Neil Gaiman. ""American Gods,"" ""Coraline,"" and the ""The Sandman"" series... he easily makes my list of greatest living authors. So imagine my excitement and surprise that one of my heroes was collaborating on a video game! Wow, jeez, shucks! And it's a ghost/haunted house puzzler? AND the art direction/creative flourish looks like the ""Coraline"" film adaptation made a baby with a Tim Burton flick? Sign me up! Are you as excited as young, naive, several-weeks-ago me? Are you waiting eagerly for my opinion, clutching your loved one(s) close- perhaps too tightly?Surprise! It's pretty bad!No, this is not the hero we were looking for. This isn't a ""Coraline""/Tim Burton baby... this is some Frankenstein's monster gone terribly wrong; gurgling, wide-eyed, pleading for the sweet release of a merciful death. Then your gun jams. Where to begin? It looks bad. Like ""Psychonauts"" - not only in style (which is good!) but in the year it was released: 2006 (which is bad!). Jagged, ugly, archaic-looking. The characters are stylized and interesting looking; but good God almighty are they ugly. The environments are ugly, the furniture and clutter filling each room is ugly, the traps are ugly... when you complete a level the items that occupy it spin and swirl about; but they clip right through the level which is not only hideous, but also an unfortunate oversight.""But what about the puzzles,"" you're likely crying out, tears streaming down your bewildered, makeup-smudged face. ""Surely they aren't also hot♥♥♥♥♥♥"" GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF, FIRST OFF. YOU ARE COVERED IN SNOT AND IT IS UNBECOMING. Anyway, the puzzles? The puzzles are simple and amount to clicking a bust or coat hanger, causing your haunting target to wander over curiously. Then you drop a bottle on their head or open a window and cause a breeze to blow a convenient barrel of dynamite towards them (I miss old-timey America. What happened to my old-timey America that never existed?). Rinse and repeat until you have enough green skulls. Then you click on a giant, green skull, the furniture clips through the level, and your target bolts out the area door. Now you're on to the next level. ""But what about the story? This is Neil Gaiman we're talking about!"" DAMN IT, I KNOW. BELIEVE ME. I DO. This is simply not Gaiman quality. A sentient mansion seeks the aid of a recently freed ghost to clear the current, living, jerk occupants out. To its detriment the story takes a backseat to the setting.Neil also does some excellent, albeit brief, narration....That's it, that's all I've got for you.Wait! One last thing. I might be wrong, but at the moment I can't get past Chapter Three, Part Two. The game refuses to let me progress. There have been a few times I've had to quit - for whatever reason when I complete a level the game doesn't recognize this, and no matter how much I click on the skull to progress it floats there until I quit out and retry. I've retried Chapter Three, Part Two about five times now. Seems like that's my stop.This is NOT good. This is bad. Simple, repetitive puzzles? Check. UGLY? Check. Decidedly not fun to play? Big checkaroo. Possibly broken? Checkz. I can't recommend this despite my love of all things Neil. Got 10, 15 bucks burning a hole in your pocket? Buy one of his books. They're pretty amazing. This though? This is a heaping, generous bowl of cat food. Is it edible? Sure. Do you want to eat it? Are you a fookin' prawn or something?			"

												After reading some reviews, I was wary.  I could understand some of the points others were making and I went into the game worried about gameplay, graphics, and story; but I pleasently surprised.There were a few bugs here and there, but it looks like the developer is taking care of them as they find them.  This would explain not encountering some of the bugs others had previously mentioned.  As time goes on, I am sure there will be little to none to speak of.The graphics, although not up to the quality of some of the larger titles, has character and style.  It was actually an enjoyable break from the drab color-palatte of larger games.  And since this game is tagged as both indie and casual, I am to take into assumption that it isn't meant to rival a heavy-budgetted game and just live up to what it wants to be; fun.  Intent aside, the rooms are fun and visually enjoyable, the characaters are amusing to watch, and the resolution seemed fine for whatever screen I played on.The gameplay was simple, a point and click combination puzzle game that didn't have me frustrated by level 2 by some overly-complicated design.  Even further in, the difficulty was raised, but feasable.  The complexity came into the 'secret scares' which would be the achievements for this game.The story felt a bit loose, but the quick cutscenes between the worlds as well as blurbs from stuffed animals/gargoyles/tutorial-like house narration helped keep you tethered to the story and who was involved.  I didn't feel like it was a visual narration of one of Neil's books, which I can only assume others felt dissapointed by.  All in all, the focus was more on the fun gameplay than bogging the player down with too much story.As a over-all whole, I enjoyed the game.  I even spent time trying to get all the secret scares, some of which took me a while to get, and some yet elude me.TL;DR : It's a fun casual puzzle game with some character with a bonus of Neil Gaiman's narration.

												I am one of those ""more than 3000 fans"" who backed this game when it was first announced. I've read all the books by Neil Gaiman, and I own most of them. He has been one of my top ten authors for nearly 20 years. Of course I backed this game.I played for 38 minutes, then I couldn't take anymore. The gameplay is mindnumbing. The puzzles are repetetive. Maybe the story is really good? I have no idea. When I gave up, it was still just a bunch of cryptic flavour that will probably be really meaningful and engaging in the end when it all comes together, but doesn't make much sense until then.After I gave up I vaccuumed my whole house. It was a more fun.			"

												I wasn't impressed with this game from The Odd Gentleman and Neil Gaiman. It seems to me if you're going to make a game with Neil Gaiman, you want to take advantage of Neil Gaiman's story-telling and character-creating expertise. A puzzle style game, which is what they made with Wayward Manor, is not a good vehicle for a great story and characters, in my opinion. I was hoping Wayward Manor was going to be more like an adventure game, where plot and character would have an opportunity to shine. Based on this game, I'm fearful of what The Odd Gentlemen are going to do to the classic King's Quest series. Their website says they ""strive to become masters of the short form gaming experience."" Short form? Is that another way of describing mobile gaming?			"

												Wow this is terrible. I am such a huge Neil Gaiman fan that even when I read other reviews marking this as terrible I bought it anyway. I'm not sure what happened here. How did they make such an insufferable game? I made it through exactly 17 painful minutes of repeatedly clicking on the same highlighted ghostable items in a room listening to the same annoying sound effects over and over in order to slowly fill up a scare bar made of skulls so that it would beat that level before utterly giving up on this game. I wish steam had a refund policy. This could have been a sandwich or a terry pratchett novel. I wasted this $10. Don't do like I did. You could just open a screenshot of the game, put on a halloween music playlist, and click on one spot of the image for 10 minutes and imagine yourself to have beat that level instead of playing this game. It would be as interesting and less annoying.			"

												A lot of people seem to not like this game. I'm not exactly sure why. I like it. Neil Gaiman does an excellent job with the short narrations. And the entire concept of an old house calling on a ghost to haunt the current annoying residents out is in no way a new concept but it is done well here.  The artwork is interesting. You won't see much like it. Now some are really hating it because they just can't seem to get why everything is so...well ugly. However, I see that it is all based on Victorian style cartooning, (please go look up Alice in Wonderland and look at the original artwork by John Tenniel, you'll see exactly what I'm referring to.) So its not supposed to look pretty by todays standards, its supposed to look the way it does and I find that its quite charming.  The puzzles; if your an adult or near adult then I imagine this game will be rather easy and will just become tedious to you. If however, you have children or if you are a child then the puzzles will be challenging but not too much so.  Now the Music, at first the music isn't the worst thing in the world but yes it does become very very irritating. The sound effects are very repetitve and will make you want to shut off the sound. At least they did with me.  Lastly, the bugs, yes there are some serious bugs. One is that the objects sometimes don't interact with the enviroment like they are supposed to. Sometimes the items at the end of the level when they are all flying around the room will indeed go through each other or through the walls. And yes sometimes the game will in a sense freeze up because the people wont run out of the room but rather just run around the room trying to get out and you will have to restart the level.  As it stands currently I'd give it 3 out of 5 stars. If they fixed some of the bugs, then maybe would consider raising it to a 4 out of 5.			"

												I was really excited to play this on release but was extremely disappointed. I didn't realize you would be stuck in one room at a time per level trying to scare people by knocking down an item. I thought maybe you would get free roam throughout the house. I would not recommend this to anyone.			"

												The good: Occasionally challenging puzzles, particularly if you're an achievement hunter. Cute art style and some fun bits of narration. The bad: Controls are clunky. Music and sound effects get very repetitive. Some of the achievements appear to be broken. Game got a bit grind-y feeling by the end. While the art style/direction was cool, the execution is poor.General info: I became interested in Wayward Manor (like many, I suspect) because Neil Gaiman was attached to the project. His writing gives a few fun moments and snide comments, but it definitely gets pushed to the rear in favor of the gameplay, such as it is. When I heard Gaiman was helping with this game, I assumed it would be heavy on the narrative with thrills and chills; this definitely seems like a children's game. The whole thing is just very simplistic. I really, really wanted to like this game, but I'm just not feeling it. This game had a lot of potential and I can't help but think they wasted it. Overall: Probably wouldn't recommend this unless you're some kind of Neil Gaiman completionist.System Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7			"

As I'm writing this, I'm only through the first chapter, but I can say this with certainty:Wayward Manor has an interesting story, cute characters, and a unique direction of art.

												Wayward Manor is a puzzle game, where you play as a ghost of sorts and try to chase the inhabitants out of their gothic manor.It is also very much a mobile style game: you need to get six ""scares"" per level, and you get more options to interact with the room as you scare the person or persons more times.Each level also has three optional objectives to get.There is therefore replay value if you want a perfect run. The characters each have a distinct personality which makes them unique, and what ties the individual levels together is a short story written for this game by none other than Neil Gaiman.As for the graphical style: it is based on drawings from the Victorian age, such as used in the original publications of Alice in Wonderland. This means superdeformed yet ""cute"".The game is easy to get through, but can be really challenging if you want to perfect it.It's not a perfect game, I encountered a few minor glitches, but none of those really detract from playing. But my overall experience is a very positive one.			"

												Wayward Manor has a certain charm, and some quirky humour. There is a lot of competition in the mobile style puzzle genre, and it holds up moderately well.You will be performing the same tasks repeatedly, but there is variation in how you accomplish them.My main niggles are that the camera angles aren't always ideal, and the rather limited voice overs. It advertises with narration by Neil Gaiman, but this is only during very short cutscenes. The main game has no voice overs at all.For a mobile game that would be iffy, but on pc this just feels rather lackluster.All in all I would say this is worth picking up, but perhaps only during a sale. This game might also make more sense on mobile/tablet, so you might want to wait for that release instead.			"

												Horrible game. I backed it up on Kickstarter and it was a huge disappointment and they're selling it for more than it's actually worth. Neil Gaiman backed it up because it really looked promising on Kickstarter. I expected better from them. The bugs, sounds effects, and game design itself reminds me of the horrible ROM games of the 1990's but Barbie did a better job of entertaining me.

			Neil Gaiman's WayWard Manor has launched! Time to review it! Click Here To Subscribe  http://bit.ly/19ksM1a Full Review  http://bit.ly/waywardmanor Get the Game ...		

The  game was released, I dived in with high expectations. I loaded it up, and found that it only supported a maximum resolution of 1920x1080, not an issue it's still HD. The narration starts and I fill with joy as I listen to Neil Gaiman narrate the plot while characters are shown on screen. The game certainly has a rather funky art style. It instantly reminded me of newspaper comics strips that made fun of politicians with their eccentric facial features.I started off with a really good impression of the game, sure the graphics looked dated. The art style and music suited it somehow and it seemed fine. The puzzles start off slow and get more complex, but sadly there is no free roaming as a ghost. You're limited to a single room at a time for your ghostly deeds of frightening the denizens out of their abode.Then, things went south rather quickly. I experienced a bug that locked the level, unable to knock over a vital bottle. No problem I say, I'll just reload the level, and sure enough it works and I continue my spectral adventure.More bugs, and more, items clipping, clicks not registering and then...then dreaded chapter 3, part 2 where the game refuses to continue after spooking everyone. Five retries later and I was still stuck, not to worry I'll quickly email the developers. Sure enough they respond in kind and have patched the level. I can still not continue. Sadly once again the same happens, this time the puzzle items are broken and you're unable to catch a drunk patriarch dancing to scare him. Several tries and the same issue.Sadly due to limited gameplay with many puzzles just reusing the same items over and over again; broken puzzles, and game breaking glitches galore I cannot recommend the game. My first impression video is in direct contrast to what I have come to realise the game is like upon playing it to near completion. ( I cannot finish it due to the puzzle bugs)The writing, although good, is also not to the level one has come to expect of the Author, leaving you wanting more.The games needs more polish, better gameplay, and much more depth sadly. It's shame, as Wayward Manor had so much potential, although it seems Neil despite being a brilliant author does not know how to make a game. I hope that in the future he will make a second attempt and that everyone gets what they want: a successful and good game.			"

As a long time fan, it sucks to feel this way, but I'm seriously disapointed that he would endorse/cooperatively release this garbage that's calling itself a game... The story is terrible if there is one at all, the click to activate controls are super buggy and unresponsive, and most importantly its not at all fun... I'm sorry, but the 10 bucks I paid in the kickstarter is probably $9.75 more than it was worth to me to see how a Neil Gaiman game turned out.			"

												Like other Neil Gaiman fans, I was excited to hear he was taking his story-telling talents to a new medium with this game. I was personally not disappointed. All I expected was that I'd like it. I'd learned that you can't expect much other than good story-telling from Neil; he mixes it all up too much. Between Neverwhere, Sandman, American Gods, Anansi Boys, Coraline, his picture books, Fortunately the Milk, the Graveyard Book and The Ocean at the End of the Lane (all of which I have read or seen), no two are alike. While I think it would be great to have more to the game, especially a longer story, I was pleased with Neil's work. I would love to see this as an illustrated novella of sorts. That being said, I do have certain expectations about games, though keep in mind, this is from a very casual game-player. I expect them to run. I expect them to work. I expect a finished and released game to be complete and fully-functional. I expect them to entertain. I expect them to be worth the money. I expect them to be worth my time. It worked for me and all (I don't think I had any bugs, but I could be wrong), but I also expect narration to be coupled with text, particularly if audio is unavailable or undesirable (even if it is the wonderful Mr. Gaiman narrating). And I expect some sort of tutorial, even if it can be disabled, and there was none. I think an option to return to the menu between levels or chapters could be added; I had no idea I was almost done until the plot twist came. Do keep in mind: a patch/update was released within a day of initial release, so any issues may have been fixed. The designers made some slight adjustments, too (i.e., there wasn't the magnifying glass when you couldn't click things before).In all, I liked the game. I did not have ideas about what it would look like or what it would be about (save for the pre-release description), so on this I had no disappointments. Nor was I disappointed by the story, though as I said I wish there was more. The puzzles could mostly be solved multiple ways, which means you can play them differently several different times, and people who are great at these types of puzzles and those with less experience can all enjoy. Some were more challenging than others, but mostly, this is a casual puzzle-solving story. The background art was nice, though the moving pieces were rather square and jagged, as some others have complained (I don't put as much emphasis on graphics as most people seem to). The music had a nice haunting (but not quite scary) tone, which was pretty cool, too.Bottom line: It was a cute, casual puzzle game, and I wish there was more. Also, make up your own mind about it. Was it worth my time? Yes. Was it worth my money? I'm not sure, based on the length, depth, etc., but I don't mind supporting a favorite author and an indie company.			"

												FULL REVIEW HERE: http://noisecannon.com/2014/07/15/wayward-manor-pc/For a game that had an extra year to be released by dark humoured author Neil Gaiman and Los Angeles developers The Odd Gentlemen, Wayward Manor is unfortunately disappointing. The story is fun enough: you take on the role of a recently released ghost who needs to spook the living inhabitants of Wayward Manor to make them leave, with the Manor itself guiding you through the point and click style levels to take back the house.Each level takes you to a different part of the house with a different member of the unwelcome family to frighten, with hints on how best to scare them provided by pets and animals hiding in the rafters. The ghostly ability to move objects and manipulate the characters is a great aspect of the game, and with the changing of rooms and people it is an aspect that does not get repetitive or simple. Timing the rattling of suits of armour or the scurrying of a rat provides a sense of strategy to the game, along with the ability to combine objects for some spooky fun.The plot of Wayward Manor is an interesting one, written by Coraline and The Graveyard Book author Neil Gaiman, with the ambience of the game taking the same direction as the surreal and innovative film Coraline. As you take back Wayward Manor you uncover pieces to the puzzle of your death, making the levels all the more interesting to replay and discover every detail and objective.The graphics are one of the main downsides to Wayward Manor. In a gaming world which focusses on high quality landscapes and frames per second, Wayward Manor looks as though it was made at the time of Playstation 2 level graphics, the boxy objects and poorly stretched textures leaving much to be desired by modern gaming’s visual standards.When completing a level by scaring the inhabitants enough that they are ready to run out the door screaming the objects in the room swirl in a ghostly tornado, however when the objects swirl half out of the building the effect is sorely dampened, and may leave you wondering what the extra year of development was spent doing. Sadly this is not where the glitchiness ends, with poorly placed clouds of smoke to represent cartoon like scuffles and levels often prone to freezing, the otherwise enjoyable gameplay loses a lot of its finesse and impact.Wayward Manor has a lot to offer in terms of story and the tactical use of the environment, but the meagre aesthetics and poor coding (at the time of writing) lead to glitching and freezing of the levels, ruining the experience and quality of the game. This lack of attention making one of the levels impassable due to glitching all Wayward Manor has going for it is the story and its author’s notability. With an hour’s worth of decent gameplay at the most, it seems the ghost of Wayward Manor will scare off any hopeful gamers who patiently waited over a year to play this broken, lazy game.			"

												I had a very fun charming afternoon with this game.  Not sure what all the fuss is about or what people were expecting.  But I found it to be a very enjoyable experience.  Some of those secret scares are really challenging and rewarding.  Also had no bug issues in the latest build.			"

												My expectations (and reasons for them) going into this game:1) a great story - because of Gaiman's involvement2) good soundtrack - from the sample song ""Swinging Spirits"" due to being a backer3) decent gameplay - I didn't care much about the game mechanics; mostly here for reason #1What I got so far:1) Not much story at all - There's nothing drawing me into the game at all. Two chapters in and all I discovered were that I am a ghost, the houst is talking to me and has a deep dislike to the inhabitants, and I am chasing them out for some reason. The majority of the story are in the exposition between chapters. During the actual gameplay, there's maybe a bit of character background.The story stops during the gameplay and picks up when the chapter ends, which makes the flow very choppy.2) repetitive music - I heard maybe four short tunes total so far. That's if they played correctly. Occassionally the music will glitch out and I'm left with the clock's ticktock background. The maid also has an irritating volume increase to her music when  she cleans the cobwebs or block the mouse holes. 3) decent mechanics - The puzzles are a bit repetitive, but each character has their own stage set and what will scare them. Some puzzles need good timing, and most of the achievements require a bit of thinking. So far I'm not impressed with this game at all. Perhaps later on the story will pick up and the tunes will vary, but my hopes are not high. When I finish the game, I'll update this review.			"

I'll try and keep this as spoiler-free as I can. Some of it might not make sense as I am very tired at the time of writing.Well, this is disappointing.As an idea, it sounds pretty cool. You get to be a ghost in a manor, manipulating objects to scare people. And it's written by Neil Gaiman! It has to be at least okay, right? Unfortunately, no. I've played the game for, admittedly, not a very long time. But the short time I did have with it, before closing it from boredom, was not really enjoyable at all.Let's start with the basics. Wayward Manor's intro features Neil Gaiman giving me a somewhat lackluster reading of the talking Manor's thoughts and feelings about life. Gaiman doesn't sound like he's trying to play the part of the Manor here; if anything it's what I imagine a tired father reading aloud to his children, who aren't really paying attention, sounds like. The words themselves are perfectly fine. The delivery isn't.Onto the gameplay. One word that comes to mind is bland. Another is repetetive. As a ghost you can manipulate objects in each stage to get a scare out of the characters in said stage. You start off being able to manipulate only precariously placed bottles of poison (I'm talking balanced on rafters and swinging from ropes). I understand that scaring people with these makes you more powerful in the room, able to play with more items. What I don't really get is why only some bottles are available to you at the start; it seems arbitrary and just ""because we said so."" to me. As the stages progress you get access to more of the objects, which sounds great. I think the problem is that you can still only interact with one thing at once, leaving combo potential almost out of the window. There are a few things set up in the stage that combo together but apart from those select few things, you're just left clicking on objects and hoping that the characters in the room will react in the way you want them to. It would be brilliant if you could move items around, using your own creativity to set up a big scare. But, no. All you can do is click things until you find two objects that interact with each other.An example of above is a stage early on in the game. One character is walking around a room, cleaning it. Pretty much the only thing that you can do is make a rat run around. So it just becomes this tedium of making the character move to a different spot in the level, making the rat run out in front of them, rinse and repeat.Now, I'm not really one to harp on about graphics in a game. But I will say this; Wayward Manor is not beautiful by any means. The character models are weird and sometimes glitch out or just walk through each other like they are the real ghosts here. A boy was meant to be hiding from a maid, but several times the boy ran out, stood inside the maid, and ran away. In the settings menu the only graphical option there is is to change the resolution. Not a huge problem but some antialiasing couldn't have gone amiss. I like Neil Gaiman. I like puzzle games. What I do not like is slow, boring, repetetive and simple puzzles with, honestly, some very un-Gaiman-quality writing. I was looking forward to this game, and I am very disappointed.			"

												I'd love to recommend this, being a big Neil Gaiman fan, as well as a gothic comedy/horror fan, but this just doesn't do Neil justice. The plotting is there, and the idea is great but it feels like a mobile click-fest you can just snore through. I think Neil would've been better colaborating with Double Fine or Ron Gilbert. There's an ufortunate 'cheapness' that whiffs off this game in several areas. Example: A butler walking around lighting candles with an animated flame,  which are clearly already lit with a static flame graphic.I was honestly expecting more. I thought we were going to have a house to explore, as the enemies ran from room to room of their own accord in various combinations. This is like the 3G mobile version of what the game should've been. Sad for Neil, sad I backed it.			"

												I didn't pre-order this game because I'm a Neil Gaiman fan, but because I really liked another game by The Odd Gentleman (The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom).That being said, there isn't much writing or dialogue in the game and the plot doesn't really seem like it's going to knock anybody's socks off.  The gameplay is (so far) just a series of fairly simple and repetitive puzzles that are solved by clicking on various objects that glow to let you know you can interact with them. The art style, music, and what little writing there is create a nice Haunted Mansion-ish atmosphere, but the graphics leave something to be desired. The lack of detail and simple animations take a lot of the fun out of scaring people, which is the central (only?) mechanic of the game.			"

												Extremely sloppy execution, puzzles pitched with a complexity such that a 6 year old could easily overcome them, mind-numbingly repetitive gameplay and sound design, with tiny, tiny slivers of Gaiman -  which are of course lovely, but so scant as to scarcely ease the humdrummery. An unforgivable wasted opportunity.			"

												Good story, Neil Gaiman's writing is always a pleasure. As for the game the puzzels were to easy, the soundtrack was repetitive, and the objects you click on were either to close together (making you click one rather then the other) or not sensitive enough (ending up clicking on it several times). If I were a child I would probably have enjoyed this game more and found it more challenging but as an adult it was fairly boring. I would maybe recommend this for someone with a 10 year old.			"

												As a big Neil Gaiman fan, I was eager to try this game. What could go wrong, I said to myself the day we bought the Steam key. I didn't realise that the author of Coraline and The Graveyard Book could be involved in such a broken, easy, repetitive game!I played this for an hour and completed three chapters out of five, I sat through the same levels and did the same thing for one hour. ONE HOUR! That is enough to drive someone mad. 3/10.			"

												I kickstarted this for Neil Gaiman. Suffered through the levels to hear his voice at the cut scenes, but am entierly underwhelmed. Levels must be restarted once all options are exhausted. More an exercise in clicking the items in the right order than solving a puzzle. Music is good. Might have just written a short story set to the spooky music rather than make us wait for a sub par game. Dissapointing.			"

												I've been reading some bad reviews of this game, I think written by people who expected something different from what they got. It's a relatively short but cute, enjoyable point-and-click puzzle game. You play a ghost, who can make items in his house move in order to scare the residents. By clicking the items in the right combinations and at the right times, you are able to construct elaborate scares that will eventually cause your unwelcome houseguests to leave. The puzzles are rarely that difficult, but they can be tricky if you don't use a little imagination. I especially enjoyed harassing the old man with a crossbow, making him shoot arrows into people's butts and set things on fire.  It has an intro from Neil Gaiman and the art direction looks like something he would design, but don't buy this game solely on the Neil Gaiman name. Buy it if you like a clever family-friendly, puzzle game with some replay value and a unique art style.			"

												Normally I devour the works of Neil Gaiman like an Osedax worm devouring a whale carcass; but this game was a huge disappointment to me. The story seems like it could have  been really interesting...such a shame that it was completely eclipsed by the soul-crushing monotony of the gameplay. So much repetitive clicking. I appreciated the tone of the game - very ooky-spooky and therefore right up my alley. Overall I think I'd have preferred that Gaiman  stuck to his wheelhouse and wrote this as a novella, graphic novel or similar.			"

The character designs are pretty fun, and there is the occasional fun moment the first time you play one of your tricks.. but after that there is nothing unexpected. Here's the things you may click, click them at the right time, level over.If you want to see this concept done right, get Ghost Trick. You can hop into all sorts of objects and the puzzles always unravel in quirky, unexpected ways. It is a joy to play and very clever. Wayward Manor doesn't come close to it. Sorry guys.			"

												Very, very bad indeed. I can't even recommend it if you see it going cheap, because it will still cost you time. It is poorly conceived and shabbily constructed. I should not have backed this.The gameplay is extremely simple and unrewarding - you just click items to briefly ""haunt"" them, and some items can be turned between two angles to reflect projectiles while some can be slid across the floor in response to gusts of air. I'm making that sound better than it is. It's extremely dreary, and there are much better games to be had for free on flash sites. You will not have any kind of fun or excitement here.On the technical side, there is only one graphical option, and that's your screen resolution. There is no controller support, no language option. The graphics are astonishingly badly modelled, animated and textured, although you only see the models up close in the cut scenes. The music's quite charming the first time you hear it, but you're going to hear the same music and flourishes in the same order over and over again, and it won't seem very appealing then.			"

												Despite having completed it, I can't tell you what this game is about. I had no idea what I was doing and just clicked random stuff for three hours, trying to find a pattern. In some ways it was similar to The Amazing Maze (Das Verrueckte Labyrinth) or pool/billard, maybe. It probably sounded like a fabulous idea on paper. You push items, and they either move to a new place, or push each other, or nothing happens. Was there a strategy that I was meant to use, apart from random clicking? I will never know.If I were a child, the painfully distorted character models would give me nightmares. Being an adult, I had nightmares because each level was a kafka-esque loop of slightly delayed sprite movement and repetitive audio. I wanted to like this game, Neil Gaiman being involved and all, but I cannot recommend it.			"

YouTube™ Video: Wayward Manor Review 

			Views: 699		

			Cosmic reviews indie puzzle game Wayward Manor developed by The Odd Gentlemen and Neil Gaiman, published by Moon Shark. On Steam here - http://store.steampowered.com/app/246720/ Twitter -...		

Hello I'm Cosmic and welcome to indie puzzle title Wayward Manor developed by the odd gentlemen who are well known for their début title The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom. The story of Wayward Manor comes from best selling author Neil Gaiman and is published by moon shark..Set in a 1920's Victorian Gothic estate, Wayward Manor places you in the role of a recently awoken ghost. The house itself is a sentient being voiced by Gaiman himself who tells to you about how horrific it's new occupants are and how you are now tasked with scaring them away as quickly and spookily as possible.In terms of gameplay, Wayward Manor comprises of levels. There's five levels per chapter and five chapters in all. The sad thing is as puzzle game's go Wayward Manor just doesn't hit the mark in any respect. Levels are too easier and can barely even be described as puzzles. All you end up doing is clicking the various objects in the room at the right time to scare which ever family member is in the room. The more scares you accumulate, the more clickable objects become available to you. The major issue with Wayward Manor is inherent in it's game design. Any good puzzler across the board whether indie or not has one major game design element in common, the progression of mechanics. The whole point of puzzlers is to take a mechanic and as the game progresses, add too it. Introduce new elements to that mechanic, introduce new difficulty. Sadly Wayward simply doesn't and the entire game is little more than a pointless point and click seemingly unsure of what it wants to be.One thing that irks me in particular is that in a game about haunting the inhabitants of a maision. The utter lack of interactivity and dare I say creativity in terms of the gameplay shocks me most. As I ghost I want to be able to do more that shake a suit of armor just by clicking it. The entire game feels like a poor iOS title rather than a indie PC game.On top of its lacking and ultimately repetitive gameplay, Wayward sadly suffers in the graphical department too. I was expecting more from both The Odd Gentlemen and Neil Gaiman in this regard. Both the visuals and soundtrack lack any real depth, there's no soul in the games characters, no atmosphere in the soundtrack. Graphically the game also suffers from an array of bugs and glaring oversights which just simply cannot be forgiven. One such oversight is at the completion of the level when you click the final skull and all the furniture begins to spin around the room, everything just clips right through the wall. It really does destroy what little immersion the game actually produces.Sadly the biggest disappointment for me was Wayward Manor's story. I thought with Neil Gaiman on-board at the very least there would have been a good story, after all this is the author that brought us things like Coraline. However like the rest of the game, the story is just lacking in every respect. There's no depth, no character, no life to it thus ultimately it's just bland and disappointing. The whole story feels like it is tacked on to give purpose to the endless clicking of objects.Overall Wayward Manor as an idea had tons of potential but in practice as a indie game, simply did not amount to any of it. The whole game oozes rushed, underdeveloped ideas and mechanics. Its easy difficulty and lack of content combined with a weak, soulless story leaves me with an utter feeling of disappointment.			"

												Given how much I was looking forward to this puzzle game featuring Neil Gaiman before I started playing, the amount of disappointment I felt when on two separate playthroughs I needed to quit because bugs prevented me from continuing on from levels that I had already completed saddened me greatly. The puzzles are challenging but fun overall and the characters are pretty neat. The world building is generally pretty nifty but the game is so filled with problems that prevent me from completing it that I cannot in good faith recommend it unless it is one day patched (which seems unlikely at this point).
