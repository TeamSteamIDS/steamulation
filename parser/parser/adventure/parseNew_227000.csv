												I found out about this game a couple days ago on the RPG Codex. I'm not a big fan of adventure games but I've played a few and enjoyed them greatly such as The Longest Journey and Syberia. I am, however, a big fan of good storytelling and in that aspect this game gets a perfect score. One can tell that a lot of love and attention to detail went into making this game: beautiful environments and wonderful music that fits and creates great atmosphere. There are different ways you can go about solving the puzzles. The main character is really interesting, the different themes are well developed and there are no clear good and evil cliches. The game is very reminescent of Planescape: Torment in terms of themes, music, atmosphere, and interesting character and sidekicks. I highly recommend this game, very very beautiful, you will be touched especially at the end. Perfect score 10/10			"

												Maybe it's a bit of a bold statement but I think Primordia is a memorable game, so much so that I'm writing this review to recommend it.I'm a story guy and this game delivers it in spades both at a macro level (the main story arch) and micro level (the single scenes). It does suffer a bit from the puzzle adventure syndrome, that is, it's not always clear how to solve a problem with the stuff you have, even when you have everything that's needed. I know this is to be expected in a way but it still bothers me.The old nerd in me suspected some of the details revealed in the final scenes right from the start but the game was compelling enough to just draw me in the atmospheric setting and make me concentrate on what was happening at a certain point. Hard to say the same about most games I've tried.The music may be a bit repetitive in the long run but it really adds to the mood, it fits perfectly. So much so that I actually noticed, appreciated and left it on: in other games I usually have it on low volume or off entirely.The graphics are retro, but in a good way. A shiny AAA engine would only marginally enhance the game. Some may even think that this old school style is actually better/more suited to this kind of game, can't say they are completely wrong.Again, highly recommended, best game I've played in a long while.

												I haven't played a point & click adventure game for a long time now (my last game was the second ""Broken Sword"" game, which came out in 1997). I wanted to remember my childhood experience with such games, so I chose this game to do it with. It's a good game for its genre. I enjoyed the world, characters and story the game offered. It was quite entertaining. Solving the puzzles felt good and the story (though not character driven) evolved in a way that made sense. There was only one major flaw in the game - a puzzle that required the player to know a different language! If you don't know that language, then be prepared to look it up ... so if you plan to play this game without cheating (like my plan was), then be prepared to be disappointed (or as in my case outraged) with this puzzle. Good luck with trying to have a good time with the game after that puzzle ...

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Primordia is a point-and-click adventure game developed by Wormwood Studios and made available on Steam through the Greenlight system.  It features a fully voice-acted cast with a retro graphical art style that pays homage to the classical age of gaming.PLOT (No Spoilers):The story of Primordia takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where machines have taken over the world after the human race fought itself into extinction.  You follow the adventures of a self-aware android named Horatio Nullbuilt and his companion Crispin Horatiobuilt both residing inside a crashed ship called 'The UNNIIC'.  When a mysterious and powerful robot steals their power source, both Horatio and Crispin embark on a quest to seek out a new power source which eventually leads them to the mechanical city of Metropol.PROS:+ Good Retro Art Style+ Great character writing and developments+ Good story with an interesting back-story+ Atmospheric environment and world design+ Consequence-based choices that can affect the final outcome of the story+ Fully voice-acted characters+ Healthy game time of at least 6-8 hours depending on how quickly the player solves the puzzles+ Steam cloud supportCONS:- No 'HD' or Widescreen Support, in which the game opts instead for a pitiful 320x200 resolution which, frankly speaking, makes my eyes hurt.- The game has a fetish for the color brown- Puzzles are sometimes irritatingly difficult- Does not expand much on the back-story which, in my opinion, is far more interesting than the main story- The game's humor is a hit and missCONCLUSION:GREAT POINT-AND-CLICK EXPERIENCE.  I Green-lit this game when it showed up in my Queue because I was very interested in its concept, setting, and back-story, and once it was released I purchased it and found a fun and absorbing point-and-click game with homage to the classical style of the genre. WORTH IT?Overall, Primordia is a great point-and-click adventure game that provides at least 6-8 hours’ worth of game time. In addition, for only $10 (or your regional equivalent), it is definitely worth a look especially if you're a fan of the genre.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Digging through Wadjet Eye catalogue is a pleasure every time, so when I finally found the time to try Primordia out, I wasn't expecting any less than a great adventure. But wow, I wasn't expecting it to be that great, either.Obviously, most of the reviewers around here have already described the game much better than a non-native English speaker ever could, though it never hurts to praise a masterpiece. And as with any other masterpiece, it doesn't seem necessary to break it down to individual components and discuss whether the mechanics lack gunplay. The only thing that matters here is the feeling, what it's like to live through the story of Primordia.You know when you're close to finishing a book so good you almost don't want to read the last few pages? It's as if a significant part of your life is about to be taken, and you try to savor every single word there's left. Oh boy, I still remember the devastation I felt as a kid when 'Pippi Longstocking' ended. (don't judge me, I love that book) A horrible yet extremely satisfying moment of experiencing something beautiful and important. And it's exactly what a quality adventure game should be – a book you will never forget.Primordia bears this very feeling in its core logic. Its world, consisting of rust and despair, might not be of the attractive kind, but the minute you dive into it, you'll have enough reasons to stay. It is surprisingly smart, detailed, vivid and, even less expectedly, highly amusing thanks to the characters populating it. Despite the depressing tones, the amount of intelligent humour makes it one of the most likeable worlds in the recent adventure games history.No wonder leaving it is incredibly hard. I found myself thinking, ""This is not enough! Why would you end it so soon? I want more!"" and loading random saves to listen to random dialogues once again. But while Primordia surely is a short experience, I doubt making it longer would've made any difference. You just can't have enough of worlds like this one. Primordia is indeed a hidden gem of the genre. Well, not really hidden anymore, but it definitely is something that deserves more attention. Every piece of attention you can afford, to be precise.Thank you, Mark. I'm sorry it took me so long to play it. <3			"

												Primordia is a point and click adventure where you start off as Horatio, a robot that desperately tries to get back his power source, along with his faithful sidekick. You inevitably end up in Metropol, the city of light, where you discover its history and remember your past. Personally, I find the story more interesting than anything wadget eye has had to offer so far (better than the blackwell series and gemini rue imho) and it is the main reason I recommend this game.+ Interesting dialogues and story+ Funny sidekick+ Graphic style is old but pretty+ Multiple endings- Humor can be a bit silly at times- Low resolution			"

												Primordia is a game set in a world where ‘Man’ has mysteriously disappeared from the world. Man, also known as ‘The perfect machine’ were the builders from which sentient robots sprang into ‘life’. You play Horatio, a humanoid robot searching for his power core which was stolen by a ‘big robot with claws that shoots lasers’. You have a companion along the way, Crispin. He’s a cocky little robot, full of witty banter and useful advice (although, that advice can be hard to coax out of the little guy at times).But I digress, back to the story. All I can say is, ‘Wow’. Ok, so it starts a little slow, but once you start learning about you character and his past the game really opens up. Playing as ‘Horatio Nullbuilt V.5’, your character has four versions of prior history of which the data has become fragmented and corrupted. You’ll meet robots along the way that seem to know you, but you haven’t much recollection of them! On top of the world that you are set exploring, this story mechanic really draws you in and makes you hungry for more. I remember thinking that if this game was a book, I’d read the hell out of it! It’d be one of those books that you can’t put down despite having to work early the next day! And in truth, I couldn’t put this game down. Thanks Wormwood Studios, my daughter finally gets to sleep, and instead of capitalising on this moment of rest that I could be having, I decide to turn on my PC and play a little more Primordia!The music and sounds effects really help to bring this game to life. The background music can be haunting at times, and other times it can be so subtle to lift the mood of a scene that you hardly notice it has changed. The voices of the many robots that populate the world have a slight tinny, and sometimes electronic sound to them, each different from the last. Being how it’s set in a world of robots, Wormwood Studios could have simply hired the same vocal artist and applied filters to his/her voice, but they haven’t gone this route thankfully. Every robot you meet oozes personality, and the voice acting is top notch, adding real character and a human touch to these robots that were, at least in the past, touched by humanity.Despite all the things that make Primordia such a wonderful game, there are a couple of things that bugged me whilst playing through it. The first thing is the heads up display, or HUD for short. The HUD is located at the top of the screen, and when you drag your mouse up to the top it will pop down, allowing access to the various menu’s and inventory. Sometimes it can get in the way though, as it’s not located at the upper most pixel, and sometimes when you are on the lookout for that next pick-up, or you want to exit to another area, the HUD can slide down, thus breaking the immersion ever so slightly. It’s not a deal breaker by any means, but it can be a slight annoyance at times.The second thing that got to me the whole time was the graphics. Don’t get me wrong here, I absolutely adore the art style. This game looks great, my problem is that it could have looked amazing. This game isn’t HD, you can set the resolution higher, but you then have to apply a filter to smooth out the jaggies as the game wasn’t designed to run at high resolutions! This results in the image being a little washed out when you play full screen. This wouldn’t be as noticeable on a smaller monitor, but on my 22” screen it was a slight issue.Gripes aside, Primordia is a polished and lively world with a great story that compels you to finish the game. Clocking in at around 4-5 hours, it’s a journey so full of history and lore that you can’t help but be fascinated by it, the world they have created is really captivating. The central character and his companion guide you through this gritty world, and even though Crispin can be a little on the sarcastic side, you become attached to all you companions, and enemies.

												Primordia, a point and click adventure game that has quite good story with challenging puzzles. More or less like The Cat Lady... the good and the bad. To sum it up:Pros:- Great/Mature story- Multiple endings- Challenging puzzles... to the point I required help from walkthrough *ahem*- Funny dialogues- Great voice actors- Decent price pointBad:- Weak graphic engine, seriously. I even had a Developer helped me to get the game up and running.- Art isn't up to my standard.- A bit short game (approx 5 hours), but for 2.5 USD when discounted/on sale (or bundled), well... I guess  can't be helped.The gameplay is just another point and click adventure. You pick up one object, deliver it to one character, get another item to unlock another area... rinse and repeat. You also are required to pay attention to hints collected. Not so much new invention in this aspect.Story, well, I can't say much without spoiling anything, but the story is interesting enough. In fact, I wouldn't have completed the game had the story been bad. It's like, again, The Cat Lady - light story in the beginning and developing slowly until the finale.Soundtrack is so-so, not that good but not that bad. Voice actors, however, are top notch. They really portray the characters well. Oh yes, don't forget about hilarious exchanges between Horatio and Chrispin throughout the game. More often than not I laughed on many occasions thanks to that funny Chrispin. Overall, Wormwood Studios, I think, have a success creating a good game for us all. Moreover, they are willing to interact and listen to their playerbase as well: see  here. I wish them luck with their future projects, too bad it won't be Primordia 2 (as has been said by the Developer himself).Recommended game.			"

												Primordia is a classic point and click adventure game, with gameplay reminiscent of Zork, King's Quest, or Monkey Island. You will gather, combine, and use items found throughout the world to solve problems, and you will be asked to solve the occasional riddle.You take on the role of Horatio Nullbuilt, a robot who lives in the wasteland, salvaging parts to repair a derelict flying ship. The game begins when a strange robot cuts his way into the side of your ship, shoots you, and steals your vital power core. Without a power source to recharge your body you will surely die, so you and your companion (a floating, armless sidekick named Crispin Horatiobuilt) set out to recover your core, or at least to find a suitable replacement.The game is divided into two major parts: first, you wander the wasteland searching for a power core, then eventually you leave the wasteland for a second location. Once you transition to the second area, you will no longer be able to access the wasteland portion of the game. Along the way, you will meet many strange robots, unravel mysteries about your world and your own past, and uncover a sinister plot.Storytelling is Primordia's greatest strength. Once the narrative picks up (beginning about halfway through the wasteland section), the story really engages the player. The cast of characters (most of which are found in the game's second area) are surprisingly well realized. Each has a distinct personality and a clear motivation. Your relationships with each of them feel genuine, and even your enemies feel well rounded.The game's setting and art style combine with the well realized characters to create a compelling sense of place. Despite the low resolution environments and sprites, Primordia's world feels bigger than the screen it plays out on. Stellar voice acting and a droning ambient soundtrack put the finishing touches on a beautifully desolate world.For all its strengths, though, Primordia's downfall is the gameplay. In the 80s and early 90s, point and click adventures were among the best represented genres in PC gaming. Since the rise of 3D graphics and the emergence of new styles of adventure game, they have retreated to the niche and indie markets. My memories of those old adventure games are pleasant, and it takes a game like Primordia to clear the fogged lenses of time. Simply put, even the best made adventure games tend to have puzzles whose solution only seemed apparent to the designer. And Primordia is far from the best made adventure game.The first issue is that puzzles in Primordia often have nonsensical solutions, or worse, do not permit you to use the most obvious solution. One puzzle early on asked me to plug a pair of ventilation ducts. The first I plugged easily with a piece of scrap cut from a nearby structure, but despite there being three more identical pieces of scrap to cut from, the game would not permit me to do so, and instead demanded I locate an unrelated item that did not seem to fit (according to the visual representations in the game). And these logical disconnects are such frequent occurrances, you will soon find yourself simply trying to use every item in your inventory on each puzzle in the hope that a solution will present itself.The second issue is the way the game arbitrarily cuts you off from certain areas, objectives, and even major plot threads. It is even possible to lock yourself out of ""winning"" the game (you can still complete the game and achieve one of the ""bad"" endings) through a blindly made choice in the first 30 minutes of play.Lastly (and this is a small complaint), the inclusion of achievements seems to undermine the freedom built into the game's choices. When there are three ways to resolve a puzzle, but one awards an achievement, there is a real sense that there is a ""right way"" to play, stifling any sense of freedom the system might have otherwise provided.These serious and frankly unforgivable design flaws sour what might have been an excellent game. Die hard point and click adventure fans will probably push right through, but if you are an average modern gamer with fond memories of classic adventure games, prepare to be reminded of all the bad mechanics that made those games such a frustrating experience.

												I judge puzzle adventure games by a single rule:Every puzzle in the game must be solvable within the game's own universe without requiring more than a grasp of English. No trips to Google to check bible passages or pop culture references.And that's it. That's why Primordia's difficulty is well-earned and satisfying to figure out on your own. That's all I need to know about a point-n-click, and that's what you should need as well (but okay fine, the writing is also absolutely hilarious and full of personality).			"

												a very solid point and click adventure that doesnt hold your hand, but also at least gives you Crispin so you arent ever lost on the way.the music ranges from desolate to haunting and gives a full sense of a dying world and sounds like its from shortly after the 16bit era.the visuals are very unique and asymmetrical. bringing the beauty of a more organic design to it's cast of robotic wonders.and the cast themselves are very animated, and unique. they all gives a very distinct feeling. some come across as zealotus misionaries, others as military wardware given life, and theres even a bit of robotic love thrown in there to blur the line between emotion and robotics.very happy with this game.

												A beautifully pixel-rendered adventure game with a surprisingly deep and almost haunting plot that leaves you pondering well after completion. Players will experience nostalgia as they are transported back to the glory days of point and click adventure games with Primordia's art style, environments, atmosphere, script, voice acting, music, and puzzles. Additionally, the ingenious inclusion of multiple endings and Steam achievements create replay value (seldom seen in this genre) and the main character (Horatio) is wonderfully voiced by none other than Bastion's Logan Cunningham. I highly recommend this game to any and all adventure game fans.			"

												Really enjoyed Primordia overall. Play time 8hrs.Things i liked:- Good story, with cool characters.- Excellent polylogues.- Jokes.- Sense of progression.- ""I am waiting"", ""A simple model.""Somethings i found annoying were:- I wasn't always able to discern clickable objects (objects that had a hover-over text component) which hindered my progress. (MOST ANNOYING)- I couldn't always tell when story paths were diverging, though this more subtle style of nuance might be a aesthetic feature.- Some puzzles required an excessively broad associative horizon, which didn't always match real world thinking (according to me).

Posted: July 28, 2014
												So first things first, i did not finish this game. I liked it, but there came a time when i said enough was enough. I gave up on the game not because it's broken, no because the stories bad, and not because it's a bad game. I stopped because i couldn't stand some design choices made by the developer. If you don't have a problem with some of the issues i have with this game, then it might be a better game then i let on.This game is good, the stories a bit so-so (i am not a sci-fi fan, so this may not be the case for you), but there is a depth to the world that makes exploration satisfying. For an adventure game (and a sci-fi), it's not bad. Adventure games are usually sold based on their stroy, or their atmosphere and world; this one falls squarely with the interesting world brand of adventure games. It takes a serious stance to its story, so if you wanted another monkey island-ish adventure game, keep looking. The visuals are solid, and what humor there is (mainly in the form of referenceses, such as the crowbar) isn't very satisfying, but it's harmless. Where the game lost me is its choice on puzzle design. There comes a time when you have to do some tasks, like convince 2 robots to stop arguing. The problem i have with it is they don't give you the information for long, so you either have to write it down or memorize it. Only after writing it down can you try to solve the riddle. It's a bit backwards, where you have to work around outdated, missing, or omited mechanics to get to the puzzle before you've even had a chance to ponder it. There is a device that records important pieces of information, but what it deems as important can be hit or miss sometimes (such as the robot diologue riddles, where the riddles aren't written down). The game also does a very poor job of giving hints if your stuck. This problem, and a few others, are indicitive of the genre. One such problem is having puzzles where you have to guess at what the developer wanted you to use to progress. An example would be ruining soup in some adventure game, where you have mud, shoe polish, and a rat. Only one will ruin the soup, despite all of them being viable in a realist sense. In the end, this is an adventure game, so replayability is already low. I'd rather not waste my time reruning the same diologue trees over and over, which is what i found i had to do for the robot riddle puzzles. If I couldn't write fast enough (cus memorizing the jargen and name drops was not easy), i would have to guess and restart. There are i believe 5 riddles or so, so having to restart from the 4th on can be annoying to say the least. At this point, the game felt more like work then fun, so i gave up on it. I didn't want to put in that much effort for what i felt was not enough in return. You are expected to bring a lot to the table to get through the game. Good memory, write stuff down, and replay the same section over if you experiment. You will find that trying to force your way through diologue puzzles is very time consuming. If you get stuck and fall back on this, you might feel inticed to cheat (as i was). When i feel like i have to resort to a walkthrough to make progress, the game begins to feels like a chore. It's not fun when you have to use a walkthrough for an adventure game, because relying on it really takes you out of the world. Personally, i call it quits at that point, as i did hereTo reiterate, this is not a bad game. It's a game with a vision that i fell outside of. If you played a lot of old-school adventure games, or you're a sci-fi fan, you might find a lot to like. If you find you didn't like older adventure games (or Daedelic's brand of adventure games, like The Dark Eye or Memoria), or you gravitate towards newer games like the Telltale brand of adventure games, this game may not be to you're liking.If an old-school sci-fi adventure game with some of the problems of older games, as well a bit unforgiving approach to game design (in that you will solve problems for yourself, without more help then the developer deems nessassary) sound good to you, then this might be a game you will enjoy.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If anyone should wonder why the developer of the game commented on this review (i was very suprised about it, personally), it's because he questioned some of my reasons for quiting, as well as questioning why i would post a review of a game i played so little of. After being initially♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ i thought a lot about the review and realized how many assuptions i had taken as fact. I heavily edited the review after i thought about it, namely because the initial review didn't convey what i wanted it to; this game was not for me, for the reasons listed above, but it might be the game for you depending on your tastes. The developer didn't harrass me (though initially i thought he had), and i am changing this review because i feel like it. Mark was a decent guy, and he responded more calmly and professionally then i thought he would. I made the changes i did because i was initially wrong, the developer earned my respect, and i had gone back over the review and found it unsatisfactory. If you think this makes my review less reliable, then so be it. You have been informed.			"

												'Primordia' had a story so good, I had to come back and play it again to see some of the other endings. Many of the most thought-provoking events make references to issues that have kept me awake before. It's interesting to experience a game that has me thinking about it for a time after the ending credits.There are some audio issues after using Steam's overlay UI, but the game's pretty polished aside from that glitch. The puzzles are good, but the world is a little empty. However, the animated characters are entertaining and keep things interesting. The artwork and voiceover work is also amazing.If you want a good story that's told with a classic style point-and-click adventure game, then this is it.			"

												Among the many things that make Primordia great are:+ fantastic, gripping storyline, taking you on an adventure through a dieing world+ unique art style and music that will highjack your imagination+ great voice acting - hey, Logan Cunningham is here!+ humor, and lots of it + characters you really care about+ puzzles that will make you think+ you don't have to worry that you will be stuck at some point (Crispin will give you a hint if needed)+ commentary and blooper tracks added as an option+ many possible endings - it's all up to you+ developers that really care about the users and will help you out with the game if there is any issue.    Come on, how cool is that?The only thing I think can be annoying is that it runs as 640x400. You can set it as a full-screen, but still - if you aren't a pixel fan, this can bug you. As for me - I hardly even noticed this, since the game itself sucked me in instantaneously. Quite frankly, I think I'm in love. "

												What an amazing game! If you are a point & click adventure lover, like myself, you'll feel good with this game. :DIf you are not into adventure games, but appreciates good stories and atmospheres, you'll like it also.It reminds me of Beneath A Steel Sky, another amazing cyberpunk adventure, but Primordia is darker.  Worth mentioning: - Awesome atmosphere (what can I say? Mysterious cyberpunk raining scenarios are awesome... Hey Gemini Rue!) - Very good story - Challenging puzzles (but resisted walkthroughs, I have a trauma regarding The Dig... :( The last and only I ""cheated"") - Nice background arts - Good voice acting (like all Wadjet Eye games, I must say)			"

												A fun point & click adventure developed by Wormwood Studios. This is their only commercial release to date but they did do two games for Indie Speed Run 2013 called Like a Raisin in the Sun and Salt. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where all the humans are gone and you play a robot named Horatio Nullbuilt.  You have a broken down ship that you live in and another robot breaks in shoots you and steals your power core. Now you are on a mission to get it back.Gameplay:	It plays just like a typical point & click adventure game. Finding objects to use and figure out puzzles to progress further in the game. Puzzles were a little challenging for me but were fun to figure out. They require some logic and can have multiple ways to figure them out. Choices you make in the game can change things later in the game. If you’ve played other adventure games then you’ll have no trouble playing this.Story:	It kept me interested and curious to dig deeper. It all starts out over a power core but there’s a deeper secret you can uncover if you make the right choices in the game. Great supporting cast which brought some comedy to the game. I really enjoyed the banter from Crispin your little sidekick throughout the game. There’s also seven different endings to the story if you care to see them all.Visuals & Sound:	It has retro style graphics with some great looking hand drawn rooms. They did a great job of showing you a dark and grim world. An easy to use interface, and great voice acting. You can also change it to text only if you are one who just wants to read it all.Overall:	Primordia was a fun and enjoyable game. The story was a little slow in the beginning but picks up a little ways in. I laughed at times and even felt a little sad at times. It’s well worth playing if you enjoy point & click adventure games or a good story and it won’t take you to long to beat.			"

												This game is inspired.  If you like realistic sci-fi stories then buy this.  Primordia is thought-provoking and engrossing from start to finish.  So few games can build up hype and then exceed your expectations, but for me Primordia did.  This game starts with great art and characters, then weaves a deep world full of inspired lore, and closes with some encounters that left me marveling at the game's writing.  Without spoiling anything, I was not expecting the dialogue in the antagonist encounter to be that effective and it completely caught me off-guard.My only complaint is that there were one or two places where click-able objects weren't clear enough.  The actual puzzles all make sense and they range from simple crafting to serious lateral thinking.  Also I suppose the game would have benefitted from a few additional animations for some of the weightier plot moments, but that's forgiveable.Can't recommend this game enough.			"

												Primordia doesn’t have the best start. During the first 20 minutes I was pushing myself to continue based only on the positive reputation of the title. I’m glad I stuck with it, because when it gets going it’s an admirable game. The world and the story has as much rigorous thought and attention put to it as you could ever demand of a title. My only problem with the game (apart from the slow start) is the puzzles. I don’t mind slow paced games, or solving puzzles. But there’s something with the point-and-click form that makes me lose patience faster than 3d puzzle games like Portal or Antichamber. There’s always walkthroughs to help out players like me, but I don’t like going that route. There’s puzzles in Primordia where I have no idea how I would have ever solved them, like in my entire life, without looking up the solution. I want to see what happens next in the story, that’s my primary interest in these titles. But the designers thought otherwise, and because they thought this was a good idea, I’m not going to think ill of anyone who likes the puzzles. It’s just not for me. And I guess it’s “not really a problem” because faqs exist. But I wish there was something else that could be done with this type of game. Of all the point-and-click games I’ve played there’s only a couple where I haven’t hit a wall because of pixel hunting. Those moments always make me wonder what the point is.Despite that rambling second paragraph I would absolutely recommend Primordia to anyone who likes the look of it. It’s superb sci-fi, of the kind that’s not just rare in games, but rare anywhere. It treats its characters and the world with intelligence and respect. What made the first 20 minutes a bit dull was that I couldn't tell how ambitious it was going to be with the setting. I mean I've seen a ton of stories start out like this with lonely scavengers in the desert. But when it started dropping hints about what the game would really be about it made me increasingly excited. It takes a serious stab at exploring what life as a machine in a world run by machines would be like. What their religions and laws could be. Echoes of their human ancestors, now adapted for their style of thinking. And it does this without any attempt at dumbing it down for a wide audience. A gutsy thing to do, and it works.			"

												Primordia is quite good overall. Among its best assets are its strong sense of style and its audio.  Both the music and the voice acting are excellent.  The graphics are on the pixelated side, but totally serviceable. In fact, they, along with the overall feel of the game, harken back strongly to the old classic Beneath a Steel Sky.  The puzzles are pretty well done, with most in the mid-range of difficulty. There's really not much to complain about, and this game is an easy buy for any adventure gamer.			"

												Great story, post-apocalyptic setting. Humanity mysteriously vanished. Only robots remain.You as ''Horatio'' and your friend ''Crispin'' wander around the wastes and the new city to unravel what it hides.It's a classical adventure game. One of the best ones I ever played and a pleasant surprise to see it have so much content and replay value, albeit some repetitivness in the level design by the end of the game, as you mainly have to run around in circles for some puzzles.You do have your friend who can offer you hints, but some of them are vague which is a slight issue compared to the general narrative message. Play this if 90's ""Point & Clicks"" are your passion.A big thank you to the developers for the ambient soundtrack and to ""The Vintage Feeling"" for generously gifting this game to me.			"

												Although Primordia is a game small in scope in several ways, it manages to insinuate a world so much bigger and personalitites so much deeper than it can actually describe. Our main character Horatio is pragmatic and taciturn, in contrast to his cheerful companion, the little floating robot Crispin; But these are only the main characters; throughout the game you meet numerous different robots with distinct personalities and little by little you learn more about the city of Metropol, and how it became what it is. The game mechanics are your old-school adventure game point-and-click, as well as the retro-style graphics. If you find the pixely look of the game distasteful, rest assured, it has all the pixels it needs to convey the worn-down world you explore. The puzzles vary in difficulty, but if you find yourself stuck, you can ask Crispin for hints. Throughout most of the game I found the difficulty quite suitable. Also, certain dialogue outcomes will affect the game- there are multiple endings to this story!What makes Primordia worth playing, and what makes it stand out from other games that are also worth playing, is its extraordinary world-building and story-telling. Through simple means it manages to be engaging and touching and pokes at my curiosity for story- one that I choose the ending for. A playthrough is about 6 hours.			"

Primordia might be the single best point & click game in existence. It is a classic point & click adventure game set a in post-apocalyptic world with stunning and handcrafted pixel art, outstanding narration and one of the most atmospheric soundtracks you will ever encounter.Graphics: Each place you visit during the game offers very well-drawn and thematic pixel art with a good animation quality. More importantly, everything offers a feel of authenticity, which keeps you immersed in this post-apocalyptic sci-fi world.Sound, Music & Voice: The soundeffects are very decent for a point & click game. What really outshines all else are the soundtrack and the narration. The soundtrack is the most immersive and fitting I've ever encountered in this genre. It has around 40 (!) different tracks, which is very rare to see for such a game. The narration of the two main characters is very well done and their lines vary between fitting, serene and often amusing. In fact, it was so well done that I had to listen to the hints despite having solved a puzzle, just to hear all they had to say!Gameplay & Story: You control two robot companions, stranded in a post-apocalyptic world, where man has perished and become a myth. Your task is to solve different puzzles in the typical point & click style. Your goal is to repair your broken down ship and leave this world. You will visit different locations within the gameworld to find objects and solve puzzles which consist in many cases of applying one or two items to a certain location. Many of the puzzles are challenging but fair. Only for a few I had to go 'pixel hunting' and click everything on the screen to find what I was looking for. Should you have trouble solving a puzzle, your trusty robot companion at your side will always have a few hints for you ready!The world is incredibly well built and the story kept me glued to the screen until I reached one of the many endings after around 12 hours.Funfactor: I enjoyed this game more than any other point & click adventure game I have ever played. In my opinion it even outshines the well praised Machinarium. Minor gripes were some technical issue while trying to launch the game for the first time.Verdict: MUST BUY! Amazing world, story, pixel art, narration and soundtrack. If you have not played this game yet, it is my personal favourite point & click of all times. A must to play!			"

												Almost since the decline of professional adventure games, fans have been making their own games.  These have varied wildly in quality, but in more recent years indie studios such as Wadjet Eye Games have managed to churn out charming retro games with regularity.  They generally strike the right balance in difficulty, the hand-painted art is often beautiful, and the stories are often interesting.  These games are not for everyone, of course, as games of this sort may seem ""dated"" or slow to modern gamersTo me, Primordia exemplifies the best aspects of most retro adventure games, with wonderful graphics (again, in a low res way that some appreciate more than others) and classic point and click exploration.  Primordia, however, distances itself from its peers through superior story, characters, and story structure.  The basic premise is an interesting one, and game designer and writer Mark Yohalem develops that premise expertly and meticulously.  The world unfolds naturally as you join Horatio and Crispin on their adventure.  The themes are more complex and nuanced than what you will see in most games.  The puzzles feel true to the world rather than thrown in just because you have to have them.This is, in my opinion, the best game published by Wadjet Eye, and one of the best adventure games in recent memory.  If you're interested in going out on a limb and try an adventure game, consider trying this one.  If you're already a fan of retro games or thoughtful sci-fi, this is a no-brainer.			"

The puzzles is most of the time very manageable without becoming menial or to hard.One of those rare games that you think about 2 weeks after you have finished it and even now months later I still think about this game's world from time to time. It doesn't tell you everything, but will let you figure out things about the world yourself. I've read other reviews stating that the story in never told which is nothing but nonsense. This game will tell you a story about a series of well defined characters but will leave large parts of the world unexplained but with enough hints to give you a good ground to figure the rest out your self. This is not a weakness but a strength. Leaving mysteries makes a world grow and leaves place for the players imagination.			"

												A downbeat trod through a world where robots scramble to survive amongst the ruins of decaying, forgotten human world. Primordia has all the charm, class and witt of old point-and-click games and none of their problems and is a delightful story in a game that doesn't hold your hand. All in all, a short point-and-click adventure game with puzzle elements and some philosophical nods.Highlights* Some very cool little puzzles add a little bit of depth and side objective. One puzzle, for example, has you exploring an encyclopaedia style database of information via an information kiosk to try and unlock information pertaining to the current objective, and is a nice side-step distraction* Incredibly good game design, nothing is over or under designed and it takes all the good elements of old point-and-click games and none of the problems* Fantastic sound assets, voice acting and soundtrackMistakesFinding mistakes and problems with this game is difficult, though there are some minor and non specific design mistakes.* It can be finicky trying to find solutions to progress at times which can impact the pace of the story* The graphics are arguably too low-res or dark. For me, that adds to the appealRecommendationsPrimordia is listed at £6.99/9,99€/$9.99 which is fair for it's 6 hour+ story. There's also a short demo available for free[www.wormwoodstudios.com].GOG offers a copy of the soundtrack, a MAC version and some other small extras at a cheaper price and may be a better choice for some.* There are a number of interesting cutscenes and small story elements to discover, most of which are married with Achievements* Everyone who enjoys Primordia should take a few minutes to check out Wormwood Studios' other IP which includes 3 games; Like a Raisin in the Sun, Salt and Beacon, and a number of short stories, all of which are available for free from Wormwood Studios, hosted on The Escapist[www.wormwoodstudios.com].* Primordia has several possible endings "

There is enough content to enjoy.The puzzles are not very hard, but also not completely obvious. The art style is robust but very good!The voice acting is falwless. And The game is filled with (mostly sarcastic) humor. Humor is difficult to do right, but I assure you this game is done just right!You can tell work and love was put into this game. It wasn't made in one day, so to say.The storyline progresses as you progress in the game, keeping the game even more interesting. I find the story original and interesting. Not predictable, but once you progress it makes sens. A good storyline!The game will make you laugh, it will show you beutiful places, it will spark you imagination... It's just worth buying!

												Primordia is a beautifully crafted science fiction adventure game in the spirit of Lucas Arts' The Dig. The melancholic mystery of the lovingly rendered post-apocalyptic setting is off-set by often light-hearted dialogue and cleverly ironic story elements (Freud's ego, id and superego populate an enormous defunct robot's skull at one point). The gameplay is deceptively simple, but my actions and choices had consequences, as I learned on my second play-through, which surprised and thrilled me. Like The Dig, Primordia's adventure game format ultimately serves as a vehicle to tell a subtle and poignant sci-fi fable. I highly recommend this game.7.5 / 10			"

												Primordia is a great example of what ""point and click"" game should be. I liked it from the beginning and to the end - it didn`t dissapoint me. I enjoyed it`s plot - the postapocalyptic world ravaged from past war. The mankind vanished and robots are only survivors. The game is about a fate of one of those robots - Horatio and his loyal sidekick Crispin. It all begins when an unknown robot steals UNIIC`s power core. Without it, it is a matter of time before our heroes will ran out of energy in the middle of the desert. And so it`s do or die. The journey to the Metropol ""City of glass and light"" begins.While playing this game player will meet both new friends and enemies, uncover mysteries of Metropol`s city and Horatio`s past, listen to funny and well made actor dialogues, solve many puzzles. If you like ""point and click"" games or just good games then you will definetely like Primordia.			"

												First let me start off by saying that the reason I have not written a review for this masterpiece sooner is simply because I didnt feel like I could do it justice. I still dont feel like I can do that, but I will take a shot. It is easily my favourite point and click, I love everything about it, from the artwork to the story to the voice acting. The only thing I wish they would improve on is the fact that they are not going to make any more content in Primordia's universe. This game truely is a gem though, and for its price even more so I would say that if you love story games, or want to try one, Primordia is one of the best choices out there. Sorry for the crap review.			"

												One of the best indie games released in 2012 and a treat for fans of the adventure genre. Everything, from the captivating plot to the beautiful graphics, is excellently done. The Puzzles offer a lot of variety, the soundtrack is fitting, the voice-acting outstanding, the characters are likable and the exceptionally well-written dialogue couldn't have been better.			"

												When I saw this game, it has some interesting feels on it and when I found out it is like those old school point and click games, I ecided to get this one since I didn't play one of those for long time, most were some kids game or other, but this one has nice apocalyptic mood on it and I love it's visual style.The controls are simple, just point and click, getting into inventory is simple as moving my mouse up to see it and if I ever feel lost what to do next, I just need to ask someone what they would do.This game also feature the multiple endings, but I don't know yet how much there is since I did play for couple of hours.If my review is pretty confusing, I don't blame you.When I review MY reviews, I'm thinking myself: ""What was I talking about""So I put some pros, neutrals and cons with reasons on this game.PROS+ Art styleIt has nice pixel art style like those old school point and click games and I like the designs of the characters and others+ Voice actingLike any other point and click games (or any games) they have voice acting and they sound pretty good or even well done in my opinion, especially Crispin being sarcastic and mostly paranoid about like giant cannibal robot.+ Good sidekickLike I said about Crispin, I like his charming punchlines and sarcastic nature.He also is reliable on certain area where you need get something or get somewhere, he even give some ideas what to do next+ PuzzlesWho doesn't like puzzles, not you?Then why did you pick this game, if you don't like puzzles?Anyway, this game mostly puzzle on certain parts where you have to either combine, poke with it, ask or anything else and this game is not like you can get stuck forever, you just need to think about what would you do or first gather info and then figure it out or ask Crispin what would he do on that, not like he straightforward tells you, but suggest something.+RobotsIt's about robotsNEUTRALS= StoryThis game has that simple story, I wont spoil anything else, but the beginning, you are Horatio who is trying to rebuild the crashed ship to fly with it, but then some big unknown floating robot comes to ship, shoots you and steal your power core, after that you woke up and decided to do something about it.Welp, I'm not usually care about the story, but it is huge part of this game, but I don't usually follow it or even ""know"" does story make good sense, so that's why I put it as neutral because... I'm terrible to review the story part.= glitchs and bugsthere are some minor bugs and glitch on this game, but it's not severe or annoying, it's just there and it wont stop you to continue to play this game, just some quick freezing that you almost don't notice all the time and other rare glitches.CONS- Games lengthI do admit, it does make the game longer since you have to figure out the puzzles, but when you finish the game on first time, you just know almost all of it and you can just blow this game maybe almost under of hour, unless you think there is still something missing in it.CONCLUSIONI really like this game, too bad it is short, but it did took me over 5 hour to pass it first time and it is pretty addicting since I did played nonstop from 22:00 PM to 4:30 AM.It has only one cons in my opinion and that is not even a huge problem and I think this game pretty great since art style is beautiful and progression interesting on it.In other words, this game is worth for your attention if you like point and click games.Welp, that's all for now.Doktor Greenman, logging out.

												Amazing game,Haven't played point & click adventures in years, and it was such a refreshing experience - some subtle improvements like auto note-taking and instant travel instead of endless walking back and forth.. but the game really shines in it's writing and mood, set by lovely hand-drawn graphics.Taking place in a not so distant future, you play a robot trying to recover a power core that was taken from you. I think my only real gripe with the game was that it was just a bit too short but you should definateley give it a try, experience the world created, and talk with some unique characters.			"

												Primordia is one of the best written and smartest games I played, from dialogue, to puns and wits. The puzzles are fun and not extremely challenging, and the story evolves nicely. The themes covered are conscience, myth and history, making analogies about their relationship with their creators.  This was the most interesting part of the game, the writer knew how to use this to make me think about my relationship with the world around me, how limited a being can be by its own ""programming"" and how someone's right is not a general right. A very philosophical game to play, and one of the best from Wadjet Eye.			"

But the game surprised me really good with it's intelligent puzzles and challenges as well as hidden easter eggs. All dialouges, characters and the alternative endings really make it worthwhile and I'll cheerish the time I had playing Primordia.It's not a game for everyone, but you'll love it if you're into puzzle or point-and-click games.

												.     The last point and click game I finished was DOTT. (That's Day of the Tentacle for all you young'ins out there.) So when I picked up this game I wasn't particularly expecting it to engage my interest beyond a mild Sci-Fi fascination..     From the first 10 minutes of playing I discovered an involving Sci-Fi story. This, compounded with the nostalgic, low resolution graphics, fired my imagination. Now I am eager to learn what lies in store for the main protagonist and his delightfully snarky side-kick..     I recommend this game for those of you with large imaginations and a penchant for dystopian Sci-Fi worlds.			"

												Between the dunes of a once fertile planet lies a broken vessel, which purpose has been lost to time. Within the hull lives Horatio Nullbuilt and his companion Crispin. They make use of what they can salvage from the dust-covered wrecks of the wasteland, trying to survive on their own in a dying world. The loss of their energy source will lead them from the solitude of their home and to the city of Metropol. A pearl of the wasteland and a beacon of energy, filled with robots like them. There machines trade, live and prosper as their creators once did, the Humans, which long ago walked the once green earth. Although a game about automatons and their emotionless struggle, Primordia convey emotions of the opposite nature. The game feels timeless in the sense that it deals with our eternal pursuit for purpose.  It stays relevant by exploring our theoretical future in which we have spoiled the earth that gives us food, shelter and life. In a time where we are constantly bombarded with filtered happiness from social media, Primordia reflect our inner feelings of loneliness and solitude. It may seem that this game is a homage to the old point and click-era of the 90s, it is not, it stands tall own its own.			"

												I really enjoyed this point 'n click! It had a rich and immersive story, and very decent puzzles that were logical and challenging. The art was really cool, if just a little bit void of color. But taking place in a post apocalyptic era usually does that. The characters were diverse and unique and very relatable. The comic relief wasn't too annoying. And he gave actual helpful hints if you get stuck. Also, the voice acting was actually really well done! Not neeeearly as cheesey as some other ones out there. The story, though, is what really held me. Its got an awesome spin on robot society and what they would ""believe."" It also has multiple endings and multiple ways to solve puzzles, so good replay value. And if you like achievements, it's an easy 100%. You can tell a lot of love went into making this... It's not one you will soon forget!			"

												In all honesty, if you don't like point and click games you should still pick up this one. This was my first point and click game, and I absolutely fell in love with it. The story is very intriguing, the voice acting is top notch, and the setting and atmosphere are very immersive.The only warning I'd give is the challenging puzzles to solve. Some are straight forward and easy, others can make you pull your hair out. Don't let that dissuade you from the game though, the story and the world are very much worth the effort. Give Primordia a shot, you won't regret it. If you are still uncertain about shelling out the full cost, wish list it and nab it when it hits a sale. A must have point and click adventure!			"

												This is a game that was on my wishlist for a while. My primary interest was the visual style, which reminded me somewhat of Machinarium, a lovely adventure puzzler I played a few years back. Primordia is more a traditional adventure game however and I wasn't prepared for how fully it sucked me in once I began playing.It all begins with a robot named Horatio ... Horatio Nullbuilt v. 5 to be precise. Horatio has a problem, the power core to his fixer-upper airship the UNNIIC has just been stolen by a badass bruiser bot and without it, he and his floating companion Crispin will die a slow death out in the dunes, unable to recharge their batteries or get anywhere that they can do so in time. Thus begins this rather unassuming, but ultimately rather epic point-and-click adventure game.My few problems with Primordia are the same I have with most retro-style adventure games, those being the combination of low res graphics and archaic systems making it difficult to know what is clickable and what is not. Playing ""hunt the pixel"" along with environments filled with ""flavor"" clickables, meant I missed a few crucial objects here and there, leading to a bit of frustration. Other than that however, the puzzles of Primordia are mostly logical, with only a few moments of ""how was I supposed to know that?"" or where a lack of full understanding of all that Horatio and Crispin together could do kept me confused.The story and world building in Primordia more than make up for any shortcomings however. Set in a world populated only by robots, where ""Man"" is nothing more than a myth for all but a few devoted ""Humanists"", Primordia frames the typical post-apocalyptic dystopia in a fresh light. While at times predictable, the interactions between characters makes even a conclusion you've already jumped to a joy to behold. The dialog in Primordia oozes with personality, especially between the stoic Horatio and the sardonic Crispin. While oft-times broadly drawn, getting to know the denizens of the world of Primordia is half the fun, especially learning the quirks of their robotic society. There is plenty of lore to uncover as well throughout the game, fleshing out the periphery of the world and ultimately contributing to the main story in interesting ways.By the time all is said and done, you'll have explored a rich world in Primordia, made choices that actually matter, and experienced one of several endings, some of which are locked by key decisions earlier in the game. On sale or not, I cannot recommend Primordia enough to adventure game fans.			"

												""Until we realize that things might not be we cannot realize that things are"" a great poet once said.I have to admit that I didn't fully enjoy Primordia on my recently finished first playthrough (there will be more) - it started excellent so the further into the story I got, the more I was waiting for it to disappoint me. But it didn't. It's somewhat ironic, that game so ""retro"" - from it's visual form, through mechanics, to themes - feels so fresh. After playing so many contemporary adventure and semi-adventure games it's nice to see that there are people who don't see stories just as shiny boxes filled with emotions. Instead of killing some characters who got a lot of screen time to make viewer shed a tear and considering job well done, Primordia focuses on building an atmosphere, allowing emotions to occur naturally, and, what is recently rare in storytelling, tells a story. Rather than having a bunch of characters hoping from place to place pushed by expendable plot, the game has a topic which it wills to explore.I might say, that Primordia is philosophical, that it's meditating upon metaphysical themes, but we may not quite understand each other, since the meaning of word ""philosophical"" has devalued. The game isn't trying to make some ""social commentary"" or present a political concept, but it asks fundamental questions, questions that, one may say, are ancient. But, as a (great) poet once said, only weighty ideals live long enough to be called ancient.Every element of Primoridia harmonizes with each other. Unique and rich world isn't original only for originality's sake - a wasteland world where robot's seek their raison d'être, a city ideologically based on vague and hollow Progress, a court where the judge has two advisers - justice and mercy, the Gospel of Man which was given to robots by their creators... Primordia becomes more like a biblical parable than a typical belletristic story.The meaning of life, the wonder of existence, presence of evil in the world, relationship between creation and creator, between robots and man, between man and God - Primordia not only mentions these themes, but also discusses them. It reminds us why people used to tell each other stories. It was because they had something to say.			"

												I'm not giving a thumbs down because I out and out dislike the game - I'm not not entirely sure if it's worth the trailer hype and full price purchase given the shortcomings. Feels like a spiritual successor of sorts to Beneath A Steel Sky, something I'm surprised more people didn't pick up on. Visually it all works and the music pleasantly chugs along - Along with some humour from Horatio and Crispin.Here's the problem though; Just as the game allows you to get more comfortable and eager to explore the story more, it stops becoming fun. The middle section of the game has some painful 'swap this for that' puzzle sequences that become a chore, and you are only driven to continue because of the story, and trust me, you will be looking at a walkthrough at some point, some of the puzzles are too obtuse.It also ends far too soon - overall only having 2 main environments in the whole game is not that satisfying at all, and what could have been quite atmospheric starts to feel a little brownwashed. The character development was never built up long enough for me to feel any emotional connections with the characters, and there were some uninspired and cliched plot turns. Beneath A Steel Sky never varied too much in environment either but at least it stayed enjoyable right to the end. There are multiple paths in the game to take which will lead to different endings - but it really depends on whether you enjoyed the first run to want to do this, and I'm not entirely sure if I want to play this game again for a while. Shame there's no windowed mode either, can appreciate the Lucasarts style resolution/graphics decision but couldn't easily leave the window or tweak anything.I'm not saying it's a bad game, trust me, it isn't - I would just suggest you wait for it to go on sale, as there's a chance you could be disappointed like I was.

												I purchased Primordia during the 2014 winter sale on Steam. So, I spent an approximate total of three dollars on this game. Knowing what I know now I would buy this game at full price. Now, I know it looks like an older game, I envision this being playable on an older system, such as the original Playstation, but the graphics are a part of the feel, part of that grainy worn out look and environment. The story back drop is extremely enticing and will make you want to do some playable digging to find out more about the story and the characters. The puzzles are not as easy as they look and decision making trees offer differing outcomes to the story. As an added plus you get to know and love these characters and in some small way emotionally invest in them within a relatively short time. You’ll laugh at their jokes, good and bad, and you’ll care whether or not they succeed in their endeavors. Overall Primordia offers a very, very good post apocalyptic science fiction experience in a point/click format. Totally worth checking out!!b(^_^)dMichelle "

												Based only on Primordia and Resonance, I'm on board with Wadjet Eye games being the new king of the old school point and click adventure.  Their games have felt the most like the Sierra and Lucasarts adventures I grew up on - strong puzzles, interesting characters, and a goofy sense of humor.  Primordia is shorter than I expected, but it has a surprisingly deep and engrossing story - and I love the art style.  The puzzles are actually pretty tough, but if you pay attention to the dialogue there are always hints.  So, be prepared to try every dialogue option and every combination of inventory items, and keep a pen and paper handy.  Also, save often.  There are multiple ways to solve puzzles and some of those lock you out of endings/achievements.  I have a habit of reading walkthroughs for areas after I have completed them because I like to make sure I got everything.  So I had to replay a few areas to get everything in ""one"" playthrough.

												Primordia is one of the best adventure games I played in years. The writing is superb, the voice acting is surprisingly good, the setting is very interesting, there are both easy and challenging puzzles and several endings. I read some complaints about the low resolution but I played in fullscreen on a 24'' monitor and had no issues.Cons? Nothing really, except I wish it would have been longer with more locations to explore! (that Metro map) But alas, there's so much an indie developer can do as a first project, and Wormwood Studios exceeded all my expectations.If you enjoyed the old LucasArts and Sierra adventures you should definitely play Primordia, it's the best adventure in Wadget Eye Games catalog.

												I liked this game. I really did, which is a rare occasion for me in this genre.I'm the kind of person who usually buys huge batches of cheap new indies and revamps of old adventure games, starts point-and-clickers excited but leaves them even before half-way, bored of the theme, disillusioned by the lack of immersion, redundant puzzles and all. Somehow it all gets diluted into a non-engaging mess. But this was not the case with Primordia; I played it through twice, once genuinely without any help, and then second time with a walkthrough / achievement guide to see what I had missed. I loved the dystopian atmosphere. The writing was excellent, as well as the characters. The graphics were surprisingly fitting - somehow the artists filled just the right amount of atmospheric detail in ""cinematics"", and the gameplay was fluent enough. Puzzles did involve every once in a while some actual thinking and not just random inventory combo-womboing, and once I even took pen and paper to solve a key puzzle. I must commend that the narration for Horatio, Crispin, as well some other key characters (without spoilers) were excellently done, which played a huge part on why the game was so immersive for me.On the down-side, some of the puzzles were kinda redundant pixel searching, as one might expect. Luckily the hint system was just on the correct level for a guy like me, who doesn't like hunting for pixels for eternities, and might dismiss an ""obvious"" clue every here and then. I never felt stuck, and I always had a sense of progression in my first playthrough. Without spoiling too much, there isn't that much of difference in the endings or how your choices end up as consequences, but second playthrough (with a walkthrough) did reveal more of the lore and modest alternatives that I had missed. I must also admit that dystopia/sci-fi as a genre is probably my favorite (1984, Brave New World, Neuromancer, you name it), so I am biased to liking this game.Overall, I can highly recommend this excellent adventure-novel to anybody that can overcome the barrier of point-and-click, and instead enjoy a ride of well fitting retro graphics, excellent narrative, good writing, and a neatly packaged ~4-6h adventure in a single playthrough - all for a very modest price.

												As somebody who would normally avoid point & clicks, I can safely say that Primordia is a treasure of a game and definitely worth playing regardless of your view towards the point & click genre.Heartfelt, funny and engaging. I wish I had a personal Crispin.			"

												I've never been an extremely huge fan of point-and-click puzzle games, but Primordia caught my attention, initially due to the attractive art style and the story teaser. So I gave it a try, and was blown away by how much I absolutely enjoyed it. It's your standard point-and-click; you collect items, open your inventory, and can combine items or use them on characters or objects in the world to progress. So there's little to mess up when it comes to controls, and Primordia succeeds there. The game is set some ambiguous number of years in the future. The world is inhabited by robots, no sign of organic life anywhere. You play as Horatio Nullbuilt, a robot designed to build and repair. While aboard your ship, the Uniic, you are attacked by a strange robot and stripped of your ship's power core. Left without transportation and limited power keeping you running, you are left with no other option but to wander out into the world, trying to track down a power source, or as a last resort, enter the city of Metropol, ""the city of glass and light."" Not much is known about Metropol, other than there is supposedly unlimited power for everyone. Still, Horatio has his reserves about entering the city; despite his logic-driven robot nature, he doesn't trust the place.As I mentioned, the art style was much of what first intrigued me, and it's prevalent throughout the game. It's designed to look very old-school and pixelated, but the amount of detail that can be projected by so few pixels is astounding, not to mention the general apocalyptic dystopian feel it gives off, which as a fan of Fallout, I enjoyed all too much. Overall this was one of those games that gave me that feel of reading a really good book; I'd sit down and play and not want to put it down until I found out what happened next. The only problems I had were a few vague or confusing puzzles, in which I had to resort to the old ""try everything with everything on everything"" play method common to point-and-click games. Aside from that, the game offers multiple endings, some far more underwhelming than others, which left me feeling a tad unsatisfied. Still, the game was extremely enjoyable, and one of the few games that I'd almost like to forget playing so I could enjoy it all over again.			"

												Primordia is one of the best adventure games I played in years. The writing is superb, the voice acting is surprisingly good, the setting is very interesting, there are both easy and challenging puzzles and several endings. I read some complaints about the low resolution but I played in fullscreen on a 24'' monitor and had no issues.Cons? Nothing really, except I wish it would have been longer with more locations to explore! (that Metro map) But alas, there's so much an indie developer can do as a first project, and Wormwood Studios exceeded all my expectations.If you enjoyed the old LucasArts and Sierra adventures you should definitely play Primordia, it's the best adventure in Wadget Eye Games catalog.

												This game is a masterpiece. At the time of this review, I just finished my first playthrough. I refused to use wiki, and this game made a fool out of me. All of my friends died and I ultimately was outsmarted. Going into my next playthrough, I know of several things I will do differently, hopefully to get a better outcome. I am possessed with the desire to outsmart metromind and beat the system. My advice to anyone who plays this game is to be patient and try to solve problems without looking up the walkthrough. The solutions do make sense, but sometimes it takes a while to figure it out. Don't be afraid to sleep on it and think about it. In conclusion, Primordia is a work of art that allows you to be completely lost in time. If this game had come out in the 90's, we would all be playing primordia 4 right now. If for some reason I lost my ownership of this game, I would buy it again, and pay full price for it.			"

												Had some problems with getting the mouse to function (at all) on my windows 10 rig but the Dev's are really nice and encouraging and was able to find a solution.  For anyone interested in order to get the game to run I simply had to alter the properties on Primordia.exe - under the compatibility tab tick the boxes 'reduced colour mode' (16bit), 'run in 640x480' and 'run as administrator'.  After doing that the game runs fine.So the game itselfAn old school style point and click adventure with some very interesting charcters, settings and concepts.  The dialogue is quite well written even if the jokes do on occasion fall a bit flat. Very much enjoyed my time exploring this little world and trying to figure out the puzzles.Its only downfall in my opinion is that it seemed rather short - given the setting and the plot setup I was expecting more content but what is here is still very good.8/10 - best of the genre I have played in a long time			"

												I bought this game for $2 or something when it was on sale a long time ago, and finally got around to playing it. First of all: I don't typically enjoy point-and-click games. I haven't played very many of them, and I usually get frustrated with the puzzles and either look up a guide (which kind of defeats the point) or quit. I LOVED Primordia. Maybe it scratched the right itch at the right time, but I enjoyed every second of this game. The puzzles are challenging, but not frustrating (the only times that I had to look something up were just because I didn't realize I could scroll down on my data pack, for example, or that I could interact with an object in a certain way. For everything else, Crispin's hints were more than enough). It's gorgeous and thought-provoking. The voice acting was excellent and really brought all of the characters to life. The world is endlessly interesting. Looking at the achievements after my first playthrough, it also seems that there is a great deal to discover that I missed my first time around, which is good, because in my desire to experience more of this world I will probably play through it at least one more time. A lot of reviews have commented on it feeling a bit short, and I'm tempted to agree. The second half of the game in particular feels a bit rushed, but it seems to have more to do with there being lots of questions to answer, and they all get answered in a shotgun blast at once that seems to detract from the feeling of discovery that permiates the rest of the game. However, if the only bad thing I have to say about a game is ""I wanted more..."" is it really a bad thing after all?Primordia is very literary. It's a game about the preservation of individuality within an increasingly communist society. It's about one's ""design,"" and whether or not it's possible to act against it. It's about friendship, religion, creation, preservation, degeneration, and hope.Do yourself a favor and play this game.			"

												I'm a little late on this one but I just felt the need to leave a review on it.I grew up playing point&click adventure games, and I played pretty much all of the 90's classics, so unfortunatly nowadays it can be quite hard for me to find a game that keeps up with the expectations I have for this kind of games but I can tell you that Primordia is on par with the best games of this genre. It's a blast of joy and nostalgia to play a title like this that makes me feel like a kid again exploring a new awesome unknown world.Primordia has a Beneath a Steel Sky vibe to it that instantly got me hooked, but even if you didn't play any of the older point&click titles Primordia would be a great place to start because it's so damn charming!The story of the game is engaging and well-written, the soundtrack and voice-acting is great, the characters are memorable and make you feel attached to them.The game puzzles are not too hard but they offer a good challenge, although this may vary from person to person depending on the experience you have with this genre.The only downside I can think of is that the game is a bit short but the multiple endings and achievements give Primordia a good degree of replayabilty that other games lack.This game is a MUST-PLAY, and I just want to thank Wormwood Studios and Wadjet Eye Games for this amazing experience.

												One of the best point & click games I've had the pleasure of playing. Despite the 'outdated' graphical appearance, the art was top-notch, as was the overall feel and atmosphere. But what really seperates fantastic point & click games from the mediocre ones, is the writing and the quality of the dialogue and plot in Primordia is absolutely stunning. Characters were also very likeable, in part due to the great voice acting. Planescape: Torment is a major inspiration here; the initial hook of the story, Crispin/Morte, emphasis on the past, it's all here. Much like Torment, Primordia is filled with sad moments, funny moments, philosophical themes and one hell of a cathartic ending (at least the one I got).Puzzles were decent and quite logical, although at times the game had too many red herrings going on, which made some puzzles a bit difficult for me. Still, only in one puzzle I had to go to a walkthrough and check it out. All in all, a very solid old school adventure game with insanely good story, one that I am unlikely to ever forget.			"

												7/10(I recommend this game ONLY if it is on sale)Backgrounds full of rich details, as a subtle score carries you from scene to scene, each character I met was -interesting- and -entertaining-...ohh Primordia... you welcomed me kindly and at times I was deeply impressed with you. However, your on point dialogue and voice acting is what really convinced of the adventure.  If only other dynamics of the game followed suit.  The story is very engaging but the ending left me a bit bored with it all.  The ""action"" scenes are almost comical and felt clumsy.  There were a few too many puzzles that demanded too much or required pixel hunting.  Also, there were too many key moments, the moments of the adventure that I was most excited for, that fell flat.  There were blemishes in the walking animation that I think could be easily fixed.  In the end it leaves me disappointed but memories of conversations between the lead characters, Horatio and Crispin, make me smile and feel it was all worth while.  I can easily imagine myself listening to the two of their voices participating in a radio show adventure.I salute Wormwood Studios in their first creation and have high hopes for their next.			"

												An absolutely beautiful and unique adventure game.  You're absolutely garanteed to get sucked into the very rich and compelling world, the characters are memorable and I got super attached to them.  Plus, there's Logan Cunningham.  'Nuff said.			"

												I won't go into too much detail because I played this game years ago, but I recently saw it in my library and thought it deserved a review. There are few negative things to say so I'll start there.CONSStarting with the only downsides I can think of, it was bothersome finding the right settings so the game would scale perfectly and look sharp on an HD display, but it worked fine once that was taken care of. Gameplay is somewhat akin to classic point and click with character displacement handled like any old 2D RPG, but it sometimes isn't clear which items are to be interacted with, or even whether it is possible. This was sometimes annoying but can be considered inherent to the game genre.It's too short. Don't get me wrong, the length of the game is appropriate but the mood and story are so enticing by the end you'll definitely be left wanting more.PROSThe art. I'll come out with a bit of an unpopular opinion by saying gameplay is not a good reason to buy this game. Its geatest asset is without a question the art. Not only is the style 100% distinctive from anything I've seen before, the devs actually pulled it off perfectly. While it resembles moody postapocalyptic or cyberpunk art commonly seen in high-res online, the low pixel count makes it particularly impressive. Combining intricate convoluted shapes with pixel-art is just something I didn't think was possible until playing Primordia. The dark and brown color tones used and occasional neon accents really set the atmosphere as a surrealist cyberpunk universe. I can't stress enough there is nothing else like this.On top of the visual aspects, the soundtrack is just great. Maybe I wouldn't listen to the ambient sounds on their own but they really do a great job of accenting both the story and environment.Last comes the story. Oh boy. Not only was I surprised at every turn by a creative plot, but the character development is the cherry on the cake. Whoever wrote the story really knows how to blend humor, mystery, and tragedy in a story that never left me bored (except when I got stuck desperately looking for some object to interact with).I won't oversimplify by rating this game with a number, but I'll say this:Since I was about eight years old not a single day has gone by without me reading a novel. I have watched thousands of movies, played literally hudreds of games, and amidst all the classics, the worldwide hits, the big budget productions, all the various forms of entertainment, this comes out easily as one of the favorite stories of my lifetime. If you can sit through a few tedious puzzles and don't mind spending half an hour looking for items in a pile of trash, then I recommend this game wholeheartedly. Hell, even if you hate the gameplay it's affordable enough that you can buy it just to appreciate the art and ambience.			"

												Started playing it this evening, and finished it in one go. It's rather short, but definitely encourages replaying it for different endings, and I fully intend to do that. The story is engaging, and there is a lot of backstory to uncover. ----Pros:- Story- World-building- Multiple ways to solve a problem- Encouragement to replay it.Cons:- Short :(- Very little in terms of journalTips: write down EVERY number you see.

												I should've written a review for this game a long time ago. To be short, I believe this game is more than worth the price and provides enough to be recommended to veterans of the genre and people unfamiliar with point-and-clicks alike. Without further ado, let's dive into it.Story""Man built us to build, Crispin."" -Horatio Nullbuilt, version 5.The world of Primordia is one of the most original sci-fi settings I've seen in video games thus far. Humanity is long gone and the almost uninhabitable Earth is populated with robots built by other robots. Very few, if any, remember who humans were. Some worship ""Man, the All-Builder"" in their memory, others believe they were just a myth. Power is scarce in the wasteland and those who still function must do what they can to survive. The nature of the world is shown very well and sets an unforgettable mood for the whole adventure.""All of this for a b'soding power core!"" -Horatio Nullbuilt, version 5.The plot starts simply: you, Horatio Nullbuilt, lose the power core of your ship to a mysterious intruder. Facing certain death from slowly running out of power, you pursue the thief and get involved in mysteries far beyond your understanding. The adventure is quite interesting and, while the plot twists are somewhat predictable and the mystery isn't too hard to solve, the tension and tone of the game keep you on your toes, wanting to explore the mysteries of insane ancient robots, Man himself, and a city of glass and light whose promises of free power seem just too good to be true.""Why is everyone we meet crazy?"" -Crispin Horatiobuilt, version 1The characters are by far the most interesting part of the story. Despite being robots, pretty much all of them are relatable and believable. From our sarcastic sidekick Crispin and a devout Humanist preacher named Ever-Faithful to a pair of upper-class robots trying to settle a legal dispute and a warbot who encrypted his own logic to deal with the horrors of the war, the cast is diverse to say the least. There were a few who I've found to be a bit bland and one-sided (Clarity and the main villain for example), but those were few and far between.Gameplay""Are you really trying to build us an energy sensor from a bunch of garbage?""""Crispin, I built you from a bunch of garbage.""""From spare parts, boss! Spare parts!""-Crispin and HoratioThe gameplay is standard for the genre: pick up stuff, combine stuff, use stuff to solve puzzles. In addition to that, when you can't reach something yourself or simply need some help, you can use your floating companion Crispin, who also acts as the game's hint system. Perhaps the biggest strength of the game here is that the puzzles integrate well into the story. The hints make sense as actual conversation, the solutions are usually as straight-forward and practical as possible, and the characters react adequately during these situations. There were only one or two cases of ""pixel hunting"" in the whole game so that is a big plus as well.Presentation""Look at all those lights! It's amazing boss!""""It's trouble. Trust me.""""Sweet, sweet trouble.""-Crispin and HoratioThe world and the characters are both beautifully crafted. There are many games these days that use pixel art, but Primordia took it as a challenge rather than a cop out. The game is simply gorgeous. The only negative thing I can say about its look is that the characters have very few sprite animations and the reuse becomes noticeable in a few scripted events. The music is similarly amazing. I still remember the track that plays when you read the Gospel of Man. Finally, the voice acting. In case you haven't noticed from the trailer, the voice of Horatio Nullbuilt is Logan Cunningham, the main voice actor in Transistor and Bastion. His work is as top notch as it is in those games and the other VAs are quite good as well. All in all, presentation is one of the game's strongest points, perhaps even more so than the story.Possible negatives""It jes needs a little fixin' up, tyro."" -L.S.- The game is quite short. Depending on how much you explore and how quick you are with the puzzles, it will most likely take you between 6 and 10 hours to complete.- There are some technical difficulties. The game forces you to a pretty low resolution due to the engine limitations and alt-tabbing can cause voice over to break. Also some of the achievements may be bugged. A few people reported not getting achievements when they should, I on the other hand got a final achievement while still missing two very important parts of the ending.- You can solve a few of the puzzles in a multitude of ways, but these ""choices"" may have long-lasting consequences that are not properly telegraphed.- Most puzzles are logical but a few are still obscure. For example, the game never tells you that something inside your inventory can be disassembled.ConclusionAll in all, Primordia is a great game with a fantastic story and amazing presentation. The not too difficult gameplay might leave a few veterans of the genre slightly disappointed, but it makes the game accessible for people not usually interested in point-and-clicks as well, and the story more than makes up for it anyway. While the game is short, the price is very generous and I'd say Primordia uses the play time it does have very well. This one is a definite recommendation from me.""Farewell, farewell, linger not for my sake. Your mission is calling! The city awaits!"" -P. "

Great world-design and history, intriguing characters, the interactions between the main character and side-kick are genuinely funny, fantastic puzzles, and I really enjoy the fact that the game uses branching logic - I need to replay at some point because I know I missed both achievements and alternative storylines.

The storyline is extremely captivating and offers a pretty different look at religion despite being a sci-fi game through and through.I highly suggest not reading any spoilers!

As the story unfolds you will notice various of old philosophical questions being touched. Lots of witty jokes too ^ ^Also, Horatio is voiced by Logan Cunningham.☢ .			"

												""Line up the toy soldiers, two hundred abreast. The bravest of brave, the best of the best. Wind up the toy soldiers to march on their way. The city is fallen, no reason to stay. Two hundred abreast, my sisters and brothers. Now only three left, forget all the others."" Primordia is a point and click adventure game that more than rivals titles like ""I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream, Machinarium, Botanicula, etc."" It takes place in a post human world, where advanced AI have claimed what is left of the wasteland that is the planet. The voice acting in this game is top notch, incorporating even the talents of Logan Cunningham. The characterization of the entire cast though, hinges on the environment they are thrust in. And how each sentience has chosen to deal with their circumstances. The game itself is quite serious in tone and changes in severity depending on which ending you achieve. Though there are many breaks from this dark nature when Horatio and Crispin interact with one another, often ending in clever word play or sarcastic optimism. It's something I hope they continue with a sequel or a run off featuring different characters. This is the type of game that would make a wonderful animation on the silver screen.			"

The actors are awesome, pairing Logan Cunningham (The Narrarator from Bastion) with Abe Goldfarb (Joey Mallone from The Blackwell series). Their relationship is fun to watch and their banter is hilarious. This game is very amusing but gives one a lot to think about.

												Primordia is a beautiful looking game with a great atmosphere and characters you can get attached to, its a point and click, so you'll be combining your inventory for hours on end, but the story is great. My only gripe is that in some of the puzzles you may think you have a logical solution, but its not the actual solution which is a much more abstract one. The way to deal with this isn't directly searching for the closest walkthrough (albiet a few really hard puzzles) because crispin (your sidekick almost) has pretty helpful hints, and is even used to solve some of the puzzles. overall if you can ignore the low res and occasional weird puzzle it's a very stellar game.story 9/10gameplay 7/10*in my opinion			"

 Nice robo-adventure  I enjoyed this game a lot, even though I'm not a big fan of adventure games. Why:•	Primordia is a very ‘hospitable’ game. As mentioned before, I rarely play such a games but here I felt like at home. For comparison – I tried to play Monkey Island Series and quickly got frustrated.•	Retro stylization is very neat, gives you a feeling of good old times.•	Sense of humour is great.•	Characters in this game are really deep, easy to remember.Perfect game? There are some cons:•	 It’s a short game. 5h for first playthrough, 2-3 for second.•	Achievement concerning information kiosk is rubbish. ?•	Well, for an adventure noob like me some actions very unobvious.I’d rate it a 8/10, but closer to 9 than 7.

It doesn't make it too easy for you but the solutions to most things can be figured out after a bit of trial and error.

												Primordia is a great point and click game.  PROS:+Great world and story.+Multiple ways to complete puzzles and different endings give replay value.+Sountrack fits perfectly.+Good voice acting (with the main character voiced by the guy from bastion).+Arstyle is nice.+Doesn't overstay its welcome.  CONS:-Some pixelhunting.			"

												Primordia's robot driven post-apocalyptic setting is a great twist on your standard post-war stories. Even though the characters in the game are robots they retain many human properties that makes them quite relatable. To add to this, their human traits are merged with some very interesting quirks based on what purposes they were coded for. This makes almost every character you meet really interesting and memorable, and also drives a lot humor in the game. In particular, the bond between the playable character Horatio and his creation and best friend Crispin is consistently entertaining thoughtout the whole game. It's not just the setting that's great though, the writing and story in general is fantastic, and the voice acting is amazing.The gameplay draws really well from the setting too. Scavenging for spare parts and pieceing machines together might feel pretty familiar to anyone who has played an adventure game before, but because of the setting and design of the game all of this feels really organic and fluid. It helps that there are core items in the game aren't simply used once and then thrown away, but instead you are gathering an array of tools (Your friend Crispin being one of them!) that you will keep reusing throughout the whole game. There is still the odd puzzle that had solutions I wouldn't have thought of and got me turning to a guide, but I would put this down to my own impatience rather than design faults of the game. I never really took the time to think things out completely as I was too compelled to move forward with the story!Long story short, I would strongly recommend this game. The only negative thing I can think of is that I had a couple of very minor technical issues that were resolved easily. If you have any interest in point-and-click adventures or story-driven games in general I wouldn't hesitate to pick this one up.			"

												I am in love with Primordia! I found this game randomly and I am soo glad I did! Beautiful environment/sprites, engaging story, and classic point-and-click gameplay done right. This game is truly a work of art! I think this game gets the point-and-click puzzle/adventure aspect right in a way that many of these types of games fall short - the puzzle solving logic is straight forward and makes sense. You won't get left scratching your head, unable to move forward because of a vague goal or illogical item use to solve puzzles. Very enjoyable to play through and though I haven't finished the game just yet I can see the replay value being high considering there are multiple endings.BONUS - The Primordia world is enhanced through the game's website: http://www.primordiagame.com/A prequel story: http://www.primordiagame.com/fallen_complete.pdfAnd an audiobook version can be listened to here: https://www.youtube.com/user/WormwoodStudiosInc/videosI honestly don't have anything bad to say about this game. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys post-apocalyptic or dystopian tales set in a futuristic/sci-fi world with themes focusing on Robots, and retro style point-and-click puzzle games where story is the highlight of the game.

												This game looks like something that came out of an old computer. But that retro look is kinda refreshing. As of July 2016, i had to manually turn my second screen off in windows for the game to start. Also, the windowed mode doesn't seem to be resizable. The story is compelling enough to play until the end. But, you can probably finish this game in a weekend. I would give it 3 star out of 5.			"

												Primordia is a point and click adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world strewn with pieces of machinery.  You play as Horatio Nullbuild, who has a rather peaceful existence ruined when a powerful robot steals the power source of his ship.  Horatio and his companion Crispin leave their home and head for the city of glass and light - Metropol.  Here, you will uncover secrets of your past and gain a better understanding of humans who previously walked there.Primordia does not reinvent the genre, it is a sci fi adventure game that offers a dark and meaningful story - something lost in some modern point and click games.  The game provides excellent atmosphere, a rich script, solid puzzles and an art style that is really captivating.  It is the sort of game that tries to restore the classic point and click genre and I believe it has truly nailed it.  It feels like the 90's, but shows that with careful animations, voice acting and intricate details, that 'modern' resolutions and graphics are not always necessary.I wanted to find out more and had to see the different endings, take different paths and look for more information online.  The only fault would be that it is perhaps too short, especially if you are used to classic adventure games.  Some puzzles were pretty difficult and there were a few moments of ""That doesn't make much sense"", though that's something I always expect from these games.It is not really going to interest people who don't play point and click games.  It is for people who miss games like The Dig, Beneath a Steel Sky and maybe even the classic Fallout games (in terms of atmosphere).  It has replay value, great soundtrack, top storytelling and is certainly difficult enough to stump you in a few places.  Highly recommended.			"

												The first thing you will probably notice about Primordia is that it is a beautiful game. The graphics are pixellated, but not in the sense often used by amateur indie designers as an obvious cost-cutting measure. This is pixel art at its finest: lovingly crafted details in every background and most characters show that the game's artist took their work extremely seriously. That effort paid off in spades.The second thing you will probably notice about Primordia is that almost everything about it is bleak. This is not the post-apocalyptic world of Fallout, where things have gone to hell but black comedy keeps things from getting too dark. There is humor in the game, but it works in spite of the world being broken, not because of it. Humanity is extinct, its robotic creations and their creations in turn forming what qualifies for society in Primordia's shattered world. Energy is life, and power is running out.The third thing you will notice is that often the game works in a far more logical way than others in its genre might lead you to expect. Early on you see a lantern on a high shelf your character cannot reach. The solution? Ask your hovering robot sidekick to push it down. There are a lot of moments like that in Primordia, where logic prevails over the typical adventure game ""must be as drunk as the original designer to comprehend"" school of puzzles. That said, there are still moments where you may not figure out on your own. I had to look things up at least a couple times in my playthrough to advance. Not everyone will, and I would discourage players from reading up except as a last resort. The puzzles make up a huge chunk of the game. If they are not your thing, I would say the game is still worth playing with a guide for the atmosphere alone.			"

												Primordia is a good game. Hard to get through at times due to the fact that it is very challenging. If you’re looking for something that looks pretty and “next-gen” look elsewhere. Personally I adore the art style but others may not appreciate the graphics as much. The story is fast paced if not held back by trying to figure things out. I used a walkthrough and found it could be played through in 4 hours. A complete sci-fi romp, it will remind you of Darkseed, I Have No Mouth, and other point and click adventures of the good old days. The voice acting was sharp and the music was amazingly well done. Wonderfully polished game that was fun to play, this is for sure worth a buy. 8/10			"

												Primordia is the third Wadjet Eye P&C adventure I finished. I liked the other two (Gemini Rue; Resonance) for their mature stories, so it is only natural that I would like Primordia as well. But what a nice surprise to say that this game is even better!Resonance tried cool stuff with the character switching, but I found it confusing at times. I was stuck multiple times in Gemini Rue (which obviously could be me being stupid) and think that the game sometimes had no direction to push the player to.Primordia is just a pleasant ride from start to finish. Some of the code puzzles are a bit hard, but never frustrating. The story is just great. I loved the dark and gloomy tones and the sarcastic MC. Set in a dying world the game throws all kind of grey moral choices at the player.Preach the Gospel of Man, fellow robots!			"

												After a total 11 hours of playing, I've finished Primordia. As a point-and-click the gameplay is mainly based on puzzles and some basic crafting, but its steampunk atmosphere, its hughely charismatic characters and its deep and thought-provoking messages are the strongest part in the game.In general, Primordia creates a powerful discourse about justice, law, charity, industry and energy, community and knowledge, energy and history. Most importantly, about logic and free will. As a player, you are brought to wander in an environment that is partially an echo of men's life, partially an odd representation of robotic life, where to the decay of humanity is counterposed the need for energy of the last city on earth. Every knowledge is lost in the dust, and Metropol, the city where the two protagonists will find themselves in, is a ghost city whose only side still provided with energy is a long road. I will be haunted by its finale for a while, also because of its powerful credit OST. It leaves its scars, but worth, worth playing. "

												For those who grew up on the point and click adventure games of old (Monkey Island, Full Throttle, et cetera), they aren't dead - you just need to know where to look. To those who haven't, point and clicks are largely narrative-driven games based upon exploration and puzzles - and this game has all three in spades. Intriuging setting? Done. Tough, but (almost always) fair, puzzles? Done. A compelling narrative? Oh yeah. This game has all of two downsides - first, that clues are sprinkled into the dialogue, but there isn't a way to reexamine or replay it, so sometimes you're left guessing. Second, the game is short - but this is more of a nitpick than anything, because its actual length belies the completeness which the game concludes with. Ultimately, this is a great work by a talented team, and the only real reason you wouldn't like it is because you don't like point and click adventures.			"

												This game has an excellent story and a unique and interesting setting filled with charmingly colorful characters.  It is thoughtful and meaningful, and addresses some serious theological and philosophical points, while remaining mysterious and exciting (most of the time).  However, I found the gameplay to be very lacking, in a number of ways.  I'm now going to complain about all the things I need to complain about, but do please recall that I actually enjoyed this game :)The puzzles in this game were difficult, and not in a good way.  While many of them had ""cool"" solutions - which would be awesome in a movie, for example - they were often not cleanly solvable, in the sense that they were the only plausible solution and made everything ""make sense"" when you figured it out.  For me, a lot of the reason I want to play a puzzle game is for that awesome feeling of everything coming together when I figure it out.  This is not the sort of game that does that for me.  Here's a few of the problems that I saw:1. Trying to create a clever solution rather than a good puzzle.  The solutions to puzzles are often the sort of zany solutions that are fun to watch heroes think of in movies, but not reasonable to force the player to think of.  In other words, they don't feel like THE solution, just A solution (and yet in the confines of the game, they are THE solution).2. Tooooo many items.  Unlike a lot of games, in Primordia you almost never get an item taken out of your inventory when you are done using it.  By the end of the game, I have so much stuff in my inventory that the task of getting through a locked door has dozens of reasonable-sounding solutions - crowbar, plasma torch, signal transmitter to pick the lock, etc, etc - but only one of them is right (and it's probably none of the standard things I've learned how to do throughout the game, because that would be to easy).3. Generic, reusable items.  This is one of my pet peeves in puzzle games.  When you have a generic item like a hammer, there's a trillion and five ways that the player can think of to use this item.  Even if the game designer could think of all of those, allowing those solutions would make many of their puzzles too easy.  Anyway, this game is full of generic items that you use again and again throughout the game (but are never allowed to use when you think of it).4. Confusing items.  I had a whole bunch of electronic gadgets and doodads that it took me a long time to figure out how they worked - a signal transmitter, a decryption device, a memory reader, etc.  All of these could be used only in very specific circumstances (i.e. as far as I can tell, the memory reader can only be used to access memories from a severed robot head - which you encounter in this game a lot more than you would think!), but this information is never explicitly told to you (I never really figured out what the rules for the decryption device were).5. Just too much going on at once.  The game is basically divided into two parts.  During each part, you slowly unlock more areas, and then can travel freely between all areas that you have unlocked during that part, which by the end of each part results in a huge environment in which to look for a small number of remains tasks.The end result of all of this was that I played the game with a walkthrough constantly ready.  And I do not regret it :)  Most of the things I had to get help on (""most"" because I started getting lazy near the end), I think I would have felt frustrated rather than satisfied if I took the time to solve myself.The interface is unfathomably archaic and unintuitive.  For example, the process of using an item - one of the most base necessities of a point and click game - requires (1) hovering near the top of the screen to open the tool bar, (2) selecting the inventory button to open your inventory, (3) selecting the item from the inventory, (4) clicking outside the inventory to close it, then finally (5) clicking on the thing in the world that you want to use the item on.  On all the interfaces mentioned, there are also many confusing and sometimes unnecessary/duplicate buttons.  The datachron (which automatically takes notes on things you have learned) has a horrific interface that looks something like an old school gameboy, with giant text on a tiny screen, and buttons (that you have to click with your mouse) for scolling up and down.  Similarly, the signal transmitter - on which you frequently need to set a 4-digit number to transmit - is pretty obnoxious, requiring you to click on the left and right sides of two dials (not even buttons that you can see, so it's hard to find the sweet spot to actually click on) - one to cycle through numbers, and one to cycle through DIGITS.  DIGITS.All that being said, however, I think this game is definitely worth playing for the story alone, which like I said is fantastic.			"

												Primorida is one of those games that's really emotionally devastating and depressing and you do feel bad for the characters and the world, but there's also that part of you that didn't really attach yourself to the characters and you're almost kinda glad to have it over and done with.As a point-and-click adventure game (and as a story) its all really well put together. The graphics and music create an eerie setting. Upon entering the city of Metropol, I immediately felt a disease with everything around me. Every step taken is a direct threat to the big bad, for the mere fact you aren't obeying her every word from the get-go. The knowledge that the bad guy is watching your every move and is intelligent enough to start planning hundreds of steps ahead makes me shiver.The puzzles are what you'd expect in a robot apocolypse: very technological, a strict sense of rules behind each one. All give off an extra feeling that speaks to me as ""yep. Puzzles caused by robots alright.""By the end though, I didn't feel particularly emotionally affected. Which was weird because I did feel for the characters. I gasped at plot twists, I shivered at the Big Bad, and my heart felt like it was stepped on when spoiler stuff happened. But I suppose it was just brief moments of emotions rather than a lasting impact. Maybe apocolypse stuff isn't my thing. Maybe it was that the darkness of the plot sort of negated any victory. I won but it didn't feel like a win. Maybe that was the point.Whatever, I'm rambling. TL:DR: its a good game. Really. If you play point-and-clicks or apocolypse games are your thing, check it out.

												This game has some of the most intelligent writing and spot-on voice acting out of anything I've ever played. That kept me trucking through more than anything else. The humor in particular is well done, and perfectly timed. I actually thought the art and graphical design was interesting, and didn't mind the ""crudeness"" of the animation, etc. If anything I felt like it added to the atmosphere and feel. The puzzles are well thought out, but can get maddeningly difficult if you forget to scribble down key information that isn't recorded by your logger at some points. I also enjoyed all the hidden homages tossed in that aren't thrown in your face. The ending seemed to come too quickly, but I was only disappointed that there wasn't more to do.I only wish that it was easier to adjust the scaling other than having to edit a file. Before doing that, it's often difficult to spot clues and changes in the environment. The music can get a bit repetitive as well.Other than that, this is a developer to keep an eye on if you're into this genre.			"

												Wow, what a game. It has certainly been a long time since a game has sucked me into its storyline to the extent that a movie can. The puzzles tied into the game in a very natural way, they seemed like they were supposed to be there and weren't thrown in as an after-thought. I hear IGN and some others gave a bad review saying that the puzzles are ""too hard"", I play games at a very casual pace and I got through it without frustration (seriously who the ♥♥♥♥ works at IGN? salamanders?).The voice actiong is phenominal, and it speaks the same for the writing, something reminiscent of the average Marvel movie charm.Visually there are a lot of mixed views, personally i thought it was very wholesome in its simplified nature; it speaks volumes in and of itself and often finds my mind recreating the build up to the scenes that primordia shows it.All in all the only negative things I have to say about the game is that it does itself a diservice by its legnth, if the game was just a couple hours longer it would suit its own theme better. And Primordia is lacking a couple sequels :).			"

												Point-and-click adventure games were one of the first things I ever played: When I got my first computer around 1994-’95 I played Discworld with my dad. We had a walkthrough since neither of us could understand English. Since then I have gone mostly to other genres but the adventuring spark were left in me somewhere. That’s why I have bought a great many point-and-click games but every time I play one the same thing happens: I click around for a while and get bored. They just don’t get a grip on me. That was until Primordia.The player takes role of Horatio and his sidekick Crispin, who live in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. What seems like a peaceful existence is interrupted when a robot crashes through their wall and steals a power core that is keeping the two alive. The game is a quest to find and get back the power core. The mood is melancholic and sad but is lighten up by Crispin’s surprisingly funny dialog. Every other character was also fascinating and had some personality to them.This was the first ever adventure game that I completed without looking at a walkthrough. Most of the puzzles are logical in a sense that if you have an item that might fit it most likely does. Every solution made sense. The puzzles are quite varied: There are use-item-on-item puzzles but also drawing, memorization, code breaking and so on. I was surprised at how many different kind of obstacles the creators had thought out. It took 7 hours to complete the game, though length varies greatly depending on how fast you solve the puzzles. There appears to be different endings and outcomes since I only got half of the achievements on single playthrough.The graphics in this are amazing. Everything is a post-apocalyptic bleak wasteland but the world that was destroyed has this art deco kind of style (think Bioshock) that is really nice. The game actually runs at the tiniest of resolutions but is stretched to full screen. Not a lot of pixels to work with but what has been achieved is wonderful. I’d love to see full resolution images of the art since it’s so great. This is also why the game probably runs on pretty much any potato as long as there is electricity. For some strange reason in one room, after certain thing happens, my fps dropped to single digits but it was solved after I got out of the room. You cannot die and there is no rush so it doesn’t matter. Even better than the visuals is the sound and music. I think the voice acting is great but, together with the art, it’s the music that shines the most. If you have any interest in point-and-click Primordia is a must play, no doubt about that. For someone new to the genre it’s also a good place to start since it’s not as far-out weird with its puzzles as some games in the genre. I can only give a big recommend for this wonderful game!			"

												Primordia is a cyberpunk game about faith. Much like in the movie Tron, the main character is a robot with a mission he forgot. A mission given by his own creator, Man.Primordia is a point-and-click adventure game by Wormwood Studios. The main character is a robot with amnesia, but made for a very significant purpose. It is still his choice to fulfill this purpose. He can be a faithful warrior that defeats the evil progressive mind and unites the robots, or he can run away from it. In the game, the robots live under a totalitarian secularist regime, where the belief that the machines were created by a mysterious being called Man is forbidden. His faith in Man keeps the protagonist alive. It is a very interesting twist for the cyberpunk genre.The graphics are beautiful, as well as the soundtrack. The voice acting is complete and very well done. The voice of Crispin is the best. The dialogues are funny and the developers opted for a more dynamic gameplay, allowing the player to engage in the story without huge dialogues.One of the advantages is a map that saves the player a good time that would be wasted wandering around. Another advantage is the ""automatic notes"", which saves you the trouble of writing down important information. There are several ways to solve the puzzles, and the developers sought to avoid puzzles that are incoherent with the setting. There is a great internal system for tips, preventing players from getting stuck.If you like games like Beneath a Steel Sky, or games that allow you to immerse in an engaging and deep atmosphere with unique and intriguing stories, you should give a chance to Primordia.Positive points* Amazing setting.* Good writing and voice-acting.Negative points* The engine is limited.

												Wow, that was really great!I think it just takes the title of my favourite point and click game, it has great story, with many endings, the characters are done wonderfuly, voice acting is one of the best I've heard, I love the voices and dialogues/monologues. The artstyle is great, shame it isn't in great resolution.The only thing I don't really like about this game (other might like it) is difficulty of this game. Puzzles are nice and hard, which I like, but some of them are just too hard, sometimes items or places of interaction are really small, or hard to find, overall it's easy to get stuck in this game. I used guide more times than on dark seed or I have no mouth and i must scream, really.tl;drOverall, it's great game, great story, characters, voice acting and artstyle, but gamers who don't like puzzles will need to use guide, a lot.

												Primordia is a simple point and click game. Like all games in this style it is all about the depth of the story and music that really makes the game. Well the music is a 4/5 and the story 5/5.  Graphics are a bit simple but are by no means disapointing. It enforces the fact high def is not needed to be visualy pleasing.  I did laugh a lot at the side kick who if you happen to be stuck, can be prompted to give clues, after a few great entertaining remarks that is. That and the multipleways to end the story add to very good replay without thinking about the achievements. The puzzles range from easy to hair pulling, till the OOOOOHHHHhhh I am an idiot moment. So in short, good replay, great story, worth every cent I spent on it & I have recommended it to friends.			"

												I hardly recommend this game to anybody new to the genre. While the game offers multiple solutions to their puzzles, the most important ones are quite complicated for the casual player. It offers a handy hint system to keep progress (Sometimes a bit too vague however) but you'll find inmense difficult spikes in some parts of the game.If you can handle the challenge the game is a very solid adventure from beginning to end. Starts with a simple premise and snowballs the plot through the end. It also offers multiple endings so you can experiment with alternative solutions and choices in consequent playthroughs. The graphics and artstyle offers wonderful atmosphere and character design, but I advise you to play it windowed since the sprites don't transition well in full screen.Overall a must have for the fans of this kind of games, specially veterans which want tough puzzles but not a single or convoluted solution to solve them. It might force you to find a guide sometimes, but even so the story is great enough to experience by its own merits.			"

												As a ginormous fan of point-and-click games, having grown up playing the old Sierra Classics, I absolutely love Primordia. The art really hits the nostalgia button for those old VGA games and I feel like I'm back in the late 1990's sitting at a computer for hours playing Space Quest or something. The only real criticism I have of the game is the lack of dying. Some of the best memories of the old P&C adventures back in the day were the hilarious ways you could off yourself, but it's a minor gripe. Based on the humor in this game, death scenes could have potentially been awesome.If you've played those old classics, this game is right up your alley. It seems to me that the developers here wanted to make a game faithful to those older titles, and I appreciate that.Get it. It's awesome.			"

												Let me just start this review by giving you the following context: I very rarely play point-and-clicks. The most notable ones (namely, those by LucasArts) were before my time, so my only games in this genre I’ve played are the new Sam and Max games and this one.This genre greatly focuses on its writing and story, and I feel Primorida does well in that regard. What starts as a simple story of tracking a robot who stole your stuff turns into a one with many hints about the world and why it’s in the state it is, and Horatio’s role in it. Each character, from the straight-laced and practical main character Horatio, to his perpetually floating, snarky sidekick Crispin, and everyone else you interact with is written with enough skill to give them unique personalities without falling into two-dimensional archetypes. While many NPCs fall into some stereotypes of their characters (ex: a soldier robot speaks how you’d expect him to, likewise with a robot with a monocle), they get moments where they flesh out their character and have some very clever lines.The overall plot kept me guessing all the way to the end, but stayed mostly clear about what was going on the whole way through. The story is straightforward in that regard, although the littering of hints of the details behind the game world really helped the story shine when it revealed big plot elements.However, I NEED to talk about the gameplay. It’s your typical adventure game fare of solving puzzles by figuring out how items interact with each other, listening to context clues, etc. The game doesn’t go too crazy with the solutions.That being said, I will be honest and say I had to use a walkthrough for this game. This is most likely due to my inexperience with the genre, but many times I felt clueless on what to do. Furthermore, when I looked up the solution, I felt like the game gave me little to no inclination that what I was supposed to do may be the answer.PUZZLE SPOILERSOne of the most “how was I supposed to do that” moments was when I needed to figure out how to remove rust from gears so I could open a door. I hadn’t met anyone who was a cleaning robot or the like, and I had no items on me that implied they could clean. It turns out that in one segment, there are underwater “submersible” robots who, when I dunked the gears underwater where they were, cleaned the gears. When I clicked on them normally, the main character said NOTHING about their potential cleaning ability.Another annoying one was a moment of “I didn’t know I could do that”. I had to inspect a door in order to solve a puzzle, but left-clicking it gave me a quote that didn’t help me. However, right-clicking it gave me a different one relevant to the puzzle. I know that could right-click on items to hear a description of them in my inventory, but I didn’t know why I couldn’t just left-click this door to hear the contextually-important quote for this puzzle.END PUZZLE SPOILERSSo overall, I’d say that you should not feel ashamed if you need a walkthrough for certain puzzles in this game. The second half of this game has quite a few rather obtuse ones, which is a shame since they can halt the progression of what is otherwise a really cool story.My other problem is a technical one: this game has no resolution options! It can only either run in fullscreen (which I think is 1024x768!!!) or windowed which has a default size that is most suitable for ants. Thankfully you can turn the “scaling” up, which means increasing the size of the internal resolution (window size in windowed mode increases with this), but the lack of proper resolution options just strikes me as lazy to me.Lastly, and this is sort of a nitpick, but this isn’t Logan Cunningham’s best work. He does a decent job not sounding bored in his lines and emoting properly when necessary, but either due to sound engineering, low quality audio files, or otherwise not as much strength in his voice work, he isn’t as memorable as he was in Bastion. I felt the sidekick Crispin out-did him in passionately delivering his lines. It doesn’t detract from the game at all really, I’m more just feeling like he could have done better.SUMMARY:I strongly suggest you guys pick up Primorida. It’s got an interesting plot inside a unique atmosphere of a post-human world, and the writing does those both justice. The puzzles can be result in premature baldness due to hair-pulling difficulty, but they didn’t stop me from enjoying the game.			"

If you liked Gemini Rue, I think you will like this.Pros:- Great story- Good voice acting- Good artworkCons:- I only had a few issues with some of the puzzles being a little to vague to solve without staring at a screen and thinking for 15 minutes, but it rewards those who like hard puzzles. - The only minor bug in this game is that when you shift-tab to view the Steam overlay, the audio/text will not play/appear. I had to restart the game several times and load a save to get around this.			"

												If you took a little from Grim Fandango, Fallout 2, and Planescape: Torment, melted them down till they were completely mixed together and poured that into a retro-style pixel-art adventure game, you would have something close to Primordia. I was really glad to discover this game, even though it took me years past its release. The setting is intriguing, the characters well defined, the music and voice acting impressive, and the visual art style really holds up in that retro way. If I had to find something to critique it would simply be that I wish there was more of Primordia to explore.			"

												If you like point and clicks this game is for you. I'm not really a fan of point and click games except maybe a little Myst. The game has great art, great voice acting and a wonderful story with multiple endings. I wish for a sequel.			"

												All Horatio ever wanted was his power core back...This is the best adventure game I've played in a decade. The robopocalypse has never been this atmospheric, or bleak, or beautiful, or funny ALL AT THE SAME TIME. Also: Primordia is mercifully devoid of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t adventure game logic, there are multiple approaches to puzzles, it's got alternate endings and even has a commentary track. Get this game.			"

												Cool environment, interesting characters, good sci-fi/post-apocalypse story. Thoroughly enjoyed this point and click adventure. Some puzzles were quite confusing or non-sensical, but most are decent. I wish I could increase the resolution, but that seems to be a common thing with Wadjet Eye games. Overall it didn't detract too much from the experience. Occasionally the sidekick got annoying. Occasional crashes, once was catastrophic (had to restart from the beginning, thankfully I remembered everything), but usually stable. I'd recommend it if you like this sort of game and you can get it in a bundle or discounted.			"

												I do not like point and clicks.I love this point and click.Characters you actually care about. Very interesting story told mostly through implication rather than blatant exposition. At least as many allusions as any Fallout game. Despite the fact that the game is fairly small and your ability to explore and interact with the world are necessarily limited it still manages to create the impression of a much larger world. My only complaint, and it's a small one in this internet world, is that some of the bread crumbs are so far off the path that after you look up a walkthrough to get you unstuck you're left wondering how the first guy ever managed to figure it out in the first place.I have more money. If they ever add to this world I will have a little less.			"

												Where can i start to review this game?On the surface it's an old shool point-and-click adventure, but the story, the voice acting, the art and the setting are simply amazing.Set in a post-apocalyptic world where machines have became sentient and capable of build (and re-build) themselves.In this world, humans are only a fading memory, kept in partially corrupted data gathered by some and spread in a form of a religion.Most of the world is now covered by the desert, where most of the androids live in a single huge city.This is the background where Horatio, the protagonist, starts its (his?) journey to find a stolen component of his ship, revealing part of his (and our) past in the process.The amazing art (all hand-made) and the attention to details of the world makes me heavily recomend this game to any point-and-click adventures fan with a soft spot for the post-apocaliptic setting :)			"

												I love point'n'click adventures, but Primordia is only slightly above average. I couldn't immerse myself into the atmosphere and the whole world design was ""too human"". I didn't believe at all they were robots. All the characters could be replaced by humans (except Metromind, I guess) and you woudn't feel a difference. This is definitelly not my idea of a post-apocalypse AI world. However, the story was nice with interesting characters and a great sense of humour (I am looking at you, Crispin), it is definitely worth a try. 6/10			"

												==New ReviewI've written a new review on completing the game. First I still think the warning applies: it should be made clearer that it runs 640x400.** That's not a full screen size image in the video**. However I found it best to turn on x4 anti-aliasing, this is the best option.This is a great story, nice main character and side kick, good voice acting, setting is interesting. I only got stuck a couple of times, and you know when you do in these games it's because you've missed something obvious or not so obvious on the screen. I'm not a fan of searching the screen for a clue and there is'nt  too much of that, but if you get stuck chances are it's that. The memorious puzzle was in fact a bit oblique to me, like I'd forgotten something in a trunk.I'd also say this is the type of game where even though the in game data collection works fine you will need a pen and paper for a couple of the code and logic puzzles but that's it. Mostly because getting it wrong the first time locks you out of achieving some of the achievements, though this does give you incentive to play again.  It has multiple endings so there's some replayability to it at the end. I'd compare the setting to Machinarium, but story style wise and feel more Beneth a steel sky. I happen to think those are two top games.To dev: I dont think a sequel would be possible *right now* but maybe a prequel  would fit really well here. Do a Star Wars and make a trilogy and jump around the timeline.Having read the Fallen pdf it did give me much more of a sense of story, I can see how things would be missing with out it. I'd put a link on the store page for download if it's not already there. Add the setting to right click change settings to the library entry.Top Rating=== old reviewI bought a bunch of point and clicks at the same time, and when I got this I really didnt realise it ran this size. It's too fiddly and post stamp size. I'm aware I can scale it up x4 but then it becomes quite hard to discern things in the picture, which is annoying.I don't have a problem with pixel art, and in some cases that's easier for finding things on screen rather than a high res style, but the art style here makes it too difficult to recognise things. I played through Techno Babylon no problem, which is at a larger resolution but something about that game has cleaner lines where as Primordia has a lot of detail. I'd compare this more to Machinarium style but pixelated.This could really benefit the clarity it has at 640x400 at a larger frame. I know that won't be possible without remaking it, but that might actually be worth doing...At the moment im in two minds about it and getting a refund.Which is a pity because im pretty sure it is good. Depends if you can live with that size. edit: use 4x anti-aliasing, it goes a bit dream like looking but it's certainly better. cheers===			"

												Golden age of point-and-click / text adventures might be gone, but this title brings you back to early 90's, when greatest classics were born. Primordia is pure 2D pixely adventure with unique art style, gripping story that will leave you thinking, great voiceacting (Logan Cunningham - Bastion) and atmosphere of dystopian future emanating from every single pixel. It should be noted that it shares couple of similarities with Beneath a Steel Sky, another great experience.Any fan of classic point-n-clickery can't go wrong with this one, as it is one of the best in its genre available on Steam. However it might be a little bit too short if you follow only the most straightforward path and forget to explore the backstory, explore details and solve few optional puzzles.			"

That being said I loved the enviroments, the art direction in this game is really solid they capture the distopian depression look very nicely, and the world feels larger than the game itself. I found myself wanting to see more places more locations as the game drew to a close. Puzzles are still adventuregames issues, but, typically it involves how much you pay attention. This one likes to slap you with obvious solutions after you are predispositioned to go in an obtuse way.Overall, if you love adventure games and want a healthy dose of post human robotland distopia, you should get it.

												Ok so let me start off by saying even at full price this game is worth buying.It's goregous in a rusty-noir (that's mine) kind of way that, I honestly didn't think was possible with this type of rendering. This game has made me an instand wadjet eye fanboy.I experienced absolutely no bugs in my playthrough, I thoroughly enjoyed the voice acting, and the writing is excellent. I was able to play this game with my 3 year old in the room (you don't generally find such a dark story free of offensive language or innapropriate visual content so it's a huge plus for me.)Easily the best point and click game I have ever played (I've been gaming for 27 years now I like to think of myself as a connoisseur).If you like the point and click genre you NEED to play this.If you don't, but like a good story then I'd say you wont be dissapointed.You can read more about the story and setting in other reviews so I wont go into it. I'd just say that it was enthralling start to finish and the puzzles aren't brainwracking but you need to use your head throughout the game. "

												A dark but not excessively dramatic game with a slight Planescape: Torment vibe to its atmosphere and side characters. The music is beautiful and well-chosen for the scenes that are meant to get to you (and they really do), and the voices feel spot on for most characters you meet. Some puzzles can get frustrating due to the combination of 'I don't need this right now' for interactable objects that you might or might not use in the future and objects that only become interactable when something else happens in a different area. However, dialogue usually contains hints on where you need to go, and your humorous floating skull sidekick might have something useful to say as well, so pay attention. There's a variety of endings, and you're not restricted to the path of the good guy, though, by that time you'll be questioning your definition of a 'good guy' and how good your actions actually were. This game will definitely make you think and not just about solving puzzles. tl;dr Buy it. It's great.			"

												It is an excellent point and click adventure. It is a little short (taking me only 4 hours) ,and it would fast forward through text randomly if I didn't switch the text and voice option. However, For the price it's at it is well worth it in my opinion. It had great puzzles that really made me think in order to figure them out. In the end I would give this game a 8/10.			"

												Great old school point-and-click adventure set in a post-human society where sentient robots populate the world and humanity is treated as a mythical race of ultimate creators. Good voice acting and writing, and a very old school 90's graphical style. The puzzles are tough sometimes but thats part of the fun. Definitely recommend this one.			"

												What a great ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.  So well done, so deep.  The only thing I felt lacking was the ending, but then I discovered that I had only experienced 2 possible endings out of SEVEN.  Top notch artwork.  Outstanding voice acting.  A gripping story in a world that could be our own.  I have never consumed ANY form of media that made me feel sympathy for a robot (except Marvin from Hitchhiker's, perhaps...)  I really can't wait for Wormwood Studios' next project.			"

												Ok so let me start off by saying even at full price this game is worth buying.It's goregous in a rusty-noir (that's mine) kind of way that, I honestly didn't think was possible with this type of rendering. This game has made me an instand wadjet eye fanboy.I experienced absolutely no bugs in my playthrough, I thoroughly enjoyed the voice acting, and the writing is excellent. I was able to play this game with my 3 year old in the room (you don't generally find such a dark story free of offensive language or innapropriate visual content so it's a huge plus for me.)Easily the best point and click game I have ever played (I've been gaming for 27 years now I like to think of myself as a connoisseur).If you like the point and click genre you NEED to play this.If you don't, but like a good story then I'd say you wont be dissapointed.You can read more about the story and setting in other reviews so I wont go into it. I'd just say that it was enthralling start to finish and the puzzles aren't brainwracking but you need to use your head throughout the game. "

												A dark but not excessively dramatic game with a slight Planescape: Torment vibe to its atmosphere and side characters. The music is beautiful and well-chosen for the scenes that are meant to get to you (and they really do), and the voices feel spot on for most characters you meet. Some puzzles can get frustrating due to the combination of 'I don't need this right now' for interactable objects that you might or might not use in the future and objects that only become interactable when something else happens in a different area. However, dialogue usually contains hints on where you need to go, and your humorous floating skull sidekick might have something useful to say as well, so pay attention. There's a variety of endings, and you're not restricted to the path of the good guy, though, by that time you'll be questioning your definition of a 'good guy' and how good your actions actually were. This game will definitely make you think and not just about solving puzzles. tl;dr Buy it. It's great.			"

												Gemini Rue meets Machinarium. Great story, great voice acting from all except Crispin IMO. It's a point and click game with old style graphics, but the original and futuresque story makes up for it. The mood is brought to life with the scenery and music. I enjoyed searching for answers and learning about the world. Primordia and To The Moon are games you can talk about, have a life discussion about once they are over as they deal with deeper and hypothetical life scenerious.  I appreciate games that cane bring more to the table than kill bad guy, game over. My only complaints are some of the puzzles are really difficult to achieve without outside help (info kiosk words). I do not like using outside help, but one puzzle requires a typed guess, that's ridiculous.  The hardest achievement isn't impossible, but requires finding the right post in the forums (I just bumped it to the top recently for those struggling for 100%).  Even though there are multiple endings, they take place at the very end (obviously) so it's not like what you did earlier in the game  really mattered, unless you were trying to get the achievements.  Overall 8/10, I would have given it a 9/10 if that one puzzle was really impossible to figure out.			"

												A very strong adventure game in the mold of Day of the Tentacle or King's Quest. One of its features, missing from many other games of this genre, is a subtle hint mechanism to help when you are completely stuck. In the old days, this kind of ""stuckness"" was a death knell for a game that none of your friends had already beaten. Today, there's a different kind of problem, because you go all too easily to the internet to look up the answer. You do it begrudgingly, the first time, easier the second, and on the third time, you accidentally see how it ends.But back to the game in specific: a nice balance of humor and seriousness. I dig the universe the story is set in, which brings some pretty serious gravity to the plot, but you have a zany sidekick who really does actually grow on you. The writers did a great job making you care about the characters... who are robots... Addtionally, in stark contrast to many of the ""Press a button to select your ending"" problems some games have presented us with recently, there are something like ten seperate endings which are... all pretty different.  All in all, bravo, very fun game.			"

												A hidden gem on the Steam store, Primordia is a game that is about robots in a world where their creators have long since been gone. You are a robot named Horatio Nullbuilt with his best friend Crispin Harotiobuilt, and you two are living in a wasteland. This game is great at charather development and world building.Man is a god among robots and some say Man never existed. Some robots are barely surviving in the dying world they find themselves in. Others live together in Metro city, a strange place that seems like the last civil place on earth. When Horatio and Crispin's power core (the thing that keeps them alive and running) is stolen, they must embark on a journey using only stuff they can salvage in classic point and click style to find whats rightfully theirs. The gameplay is simple, but like most point and clicks it's about the world and the story is tells. And it tells a good story. Without wanting to spoil anything, trust me and get this.			"

The dialogue is well written. Crispin is a little talkative but I grew to enjoy his company. The puzzles have a range of difficulties. My only issue with the game was it crashed on my a few times. I was able to fix the crashing but there was still a glitch were the images of my inventory looked like colored blocks. It did not really effect the game play though.Would highly recommend.			"

												I've always been a fan of the adventure games Myst and Riven. My favorite part about these games, as a kid, was that they whisked you away to a completely different, and foreign place. Though many adventure games seek to do this, few fall short, and end up feeling like ""just another point and click"" derived of any rich narrative. Primordia is not one of those games that falls short at all.I should admit before I go any further that I've only played the opening sequence of this game thus far, and am extremely excited to get back to it after this review, but this particular summary will be noting the aesthetic, and initial response of Primordia.I absolutely love post-apocalypse. It's not an uncommon scenario, thankfully, so there's lots of material to dig through on the subject. Unfortunately, there's quite a lot of BAD post-apocalypse games out there, and so with some hesitation, I bought this game, and sat down with some skepticism. For ten bucks, I was hoping it was going to deliver, and the reviews spoke for themselves.Primordia does something a lot of post-apocalyptic stories don't, and removes humans altogether from the character roster. You begin the game as Horatio Nullbuilt (the surname meaning some dude presumeably named 'Null' built him, which is a common theme throughout the game), the 5th version to be precise, and are accompanied by Crispin Horatiobuilt, your custom companion and comic relief. The world around you is an age-old Earth, looking very barren and very post-war. A strange robot cuts down your door one day and steals your power core, without which you can not charge your own batteries (nor Crispin's). Since that simply won't do, you venture out into the world in order to find the strange robot and reclaim your power core. Easier said than done. What follows are scenes common to Adventure/Point+Click games: You meet hosts of interesting robots, travel to new and exciting places, and spend a good deal of time trying to combine every single item in your inventory to see if it does something cool. Excellent (okay... MOSTLY excellent) voice acting, a (so far) riveting and comedic script, beautiful artwork, and intriguing characters make this one of my favorite Adventure games to date, and I've barely even started it.Should you get it? I mean, it's a point and click. You know what you're getting. The deciding factor, in most cases, is the story and artwork, and both deliver wholeheartedly. Even this early, the story is already showing to be incredibly promising, with twists and turns, and dark comedy as only robots can deliver. The script, as mentioned, is really quite good, and I don't find myself simply reading through the subtitles and clicking through in order to progress, but rather relishing the lines and the delivery. The art, while simple and ""retro"" in style, does not detract at all from the story, but actually enhances it with far-off vistas, incredible robot designs, and teeming robot cities, both very alive, and strangely dead. Fans of point and clicks, this is another excellent addition to your collection, reminding me of titles like Deponia, Riven, and (of course) Monkey Island. Fans of sci-fi, post apocalyptic fiction will also love this game. All in all, I think it's one of those rare games on Steam where I feel like I absolutely got what I paid for, and then some.And I haven't even finished it. "

												What happens when robots rule the world? Primordia answers that question. After an apocolyptic war, the only thing left is desert, bots, and scrap. Take control of an andriod who seems to have some kind of past with the, city of glass. Help him and his assistant. AKA the floating bomb unravel mysteries, and build a new future. All while dealing with the many inhabitants. The machines!			"

												A brilliant point & click adventure game. Engaging story, great voice acting, interesting characters, and a perfect balance of difficulty with the puzzles.Many memorable characters from this game, and the writing at critical points is top notch. The antagonist and the setting are very well done.The palette is pretty much brown, blue, and grey. Perhaps more color would have been nice, but I really can't criticize when the artwork is so beautiful. The graphics are otherwise retro-style and very well done.If you are a fan of classic adventure games, I can't recommend this enough. I love this game.			"

												TL;DR:It's a PCA (Point and Click Adventure). No actual puzzles, just good old-school inventory combining and environment clicking!Graphics:     8/10 (Sub-HD resolution. All the scenes, characters and animations are VERY well drawn/animated.)Sound:       10/10 (Fully voiced, fully music'd, and it's all high-quality. Doesn't get better!)Interface:     9/10 (Art'ed menus that fit the game; intuitive and minimalistic.)Story:           8/10 (Engaging, entertaining, fascinating and everything is tied together. Nice!)Characters:  9/10 (Horatio reminds me of Ben from Full Throttle. Crispin is quite entertaining, deep ""B"" listers, too!)Toughness:  5/10 (Security through Obscurity. Score with autohints off. Discworld = 10/10, for reference).Length:        7/10 (Took me 12h to beat without hints. I liked it and didn't want it to end!)Overall:        9/10 (Great fun if you like PCAs, post-apocalyptic themes, robots, and a fun sidekick!)Thanks for a rather great PCA! I'd really like to see a HD version sometime, but it's still totally worth it!			"

												A great point and click adventure through and through. The art style is fitting, the voice acting is great and the puzzles are generally logical and fun. However, the story is the part that really shines. The story in itself already has a lot of twists and turns, but the amount of symbolism is mind boggling. If you are interested in discussion of philosophy, this game offers you a lot to think about, such as religions, laws, good-vs-evil, progression and more. Highly recommanded.			"

												HOLY COW!!! Through out the game I kept remembering how it felt to play Riven and Myst. It has been MANY years since then and for a modern game to take me back to my childhood like that is one of MY first signs of a great game. The puzzles, the dialog, the art, the interface, and the music... I could not have asked for better. Definatlly on my top 5 BEST puzzle games of all time. I actually care about what happens to each character. Try you hardest to solve the puzzles on your own, they are VERY rewarding. Also take care there are more than just a couple endings.			"

												The game gripped me shortly after beginning. My heater was broken, it was freezing outside. But this wonderful adventure had hooked me. The world is one of the best-presented I've ever seen. The characters are very well presented to make you curious for more. I just wanted to spend more time exploring this world. It's also filled with humor that lightens up the somber setting, it's difficult to explain just how well the combination works.The puzzles themselves vary in quality, with some doing a great job in feeling like you're just solving problems that would exist in the world rather than an arbitrary roadblock by the developers. Others... Not so much. One particular puzzle stands out as an example of this problem (slight spoiler warning, though I won't give the answer)You need two different objects that can obstruct a vent. The first is easily gained by cutting off the tip of a robot's finger. However, the game doesn't allow you to cut off the tip of another finger for the second item. This is a frustrating limitation, and can easily lead to resenting the puzzle. The fact that important objects are often indistinguishable from the background only adds to the frustration.HOWEVER, and I can't stress this enough, while this kind of uneven quality in puzzles should suck the fun out of an adventure game... It doesn't. The rest of the world is too entrancing. It single-handedly rekindled my love of adventure games. I bring up these drawbacks to help emphasize how truly great the rest of the experience is, that even these issues don't sour it.TLDR; If you're considering buying this game, do so. Do it now. Play it. Enjoy it. Have fun. "

												Takes me back to the old days of the point and click adventures for DOS. Great atmosphere, driving story, and lovely pixelated graphics. Tons of time frustrated in how do i solve this puzzle, and what do i do with this ****ing item? Had to break out my pencil and paper to make it through this, haen thad to do taht since MYST on my dad,s win95 NEC laptop. It does have a note style system in game that will help, but somethings are better left to nostalgia. I digress...NOTE: Disable steam overlay! it is documented in community, look for my question if you want to know more.Get this game if- you like solving puzzles (Not Tetris)- Thinking (almost over thinking..?)- Sarcastic, whitty humor (Yeah, I don't really have to tell you more... Do I?)- robotic steampunk hybrid style (Gottta love them hybrids)- emersive story telling (they still didn't tell me a bed time story!)- dragging and clicking the mouse cursor over ever pixel on the screen (It is fun.... . . .  .   .   .    !)- Multiple endings (You don't really HAVE to save the world!}avoid this game if-  you cant think longer than 5,000,000 microseconds (go play tetris, wait you couldn't make it through that either...)- cant stand to see pixels (Under 12 years old?)- dragging and clicking the mouse cursor over ever pixel on the screen (Is it fun.... . . .  .   .   .    ?)- Hate story driven game play (Go do something in *Cough*craft)- you dont have the money for it currently (Add it to your wish list!)

												This game is underrated in my opinion. If you like Point&Click Adventure games and haven't played this yet, definitely do. It has hard puzzles (sure - I might have taken a look in a walkthrough once or twice), great general geeky humor, robots, amazing voice acting (Logan Cunningham of Bastion!), beautiful pixely art style (try 640x480 on a 27"" monitor, it's great). Oh and did I mention robots?Once I started I couldn't stop playing until the early morning. But even once you're done, you're not done. There's replay value due to different ways to do the same puzzles, multiple endings and achievements you won't unlock on your first playthrough.			"

												Overall satisfying adventure game with only a few caveats.  Most of all I recommend this game.  Pros: • Thought-provoking story full of moral ambiguities and juxtaposed viewpoints making you question your own judgments of the characters and their actions.• Good interface with a minimum of unnecessary clicking and waiting.• Varied endings dependant on choices made by the player.• Interesting scenery, good voice acting, and excellent atmosphereic soundtrack.Cons: • Completely unnecessary gender references at various points.  It's a world full of robots... Why does there need to be a ""female"" robot with boob-curves, or gender binary relationship references between androgynous mechanoids?• Serious tone somewhat undermined by numerous 4th-wall jokes by  a main character.• Lots of back-tracking and occasionally preposterous leaps in logic were needed to solve puzzles.  Several times I found myself resorting to ""randomly combine junk until something happens"" or having to look up walkthroughs, and being utterly baffled how someone would arrive at that solution.As stated above, I do highly recommend this game, and I enjoyed the story.  You should check it out! "

												I revived a giant war robot by sticking its finger up its nose 11/10.In all seriousness though, this game is beautiful. The story is wonderful and moving, the characters are well-written and fleshed out, and the humor is surprisingly funny despite the game's bleak dystopian setting. The art and backgrounds, though they look somewhat dated and old-fashioned, are still detailed and do a very good job building the world and creating the atmosphere. The puzzles were a little hard to figure out at times, but always had a logical solution. I strongly recommend this game to everyone, unless you're not much of a point-and-click fan or can't stand dystopian settings I guess. Seriously though, this game is amazing. You won't be disappointed.This game also happened to introduce me to Wadjet Eye Games and has sort of been a gateway drug into their other games. Which are also really good. I am ok with that.			"

												Wow. What an incredible little game. This is the second point and click adventure I've ever completed and it was worth every penny. If I'm not mistaken this game was Greenlit on Steam, Wormwood Studios is an Indie developer with a lot of support in the GOG community. The style and apocalyptic hand painted backdrops of each space is nothing short of awe inspireing. I didn't even mind having to play in a lower res and sacrificing my second screen to play this game. Very cool story line and excellent sound score kept me gripped 'til the end. If this game looks interesting to you, do yourself a favor and try it out, especially if it's on sale, you just might love it, ya dingus!p.s. The song on Horatio's phonograph ""Dreams Of Green"" by Kim Beokbinder and Nathaneil Chambers is one of the most haunting and beautiful compisitions reflecting a post apocalytpic landscape that I've heard, Only proof that behind any great game, there needs to be great music. Wormwood Studios, I hope this isn't the last Primordia title, thank you guys for this piece of art.			"

												This game became a favorite of mine very quickly.For some reason I absolutely love any story that mixes machines with religion.  Perhaps I have that bias as a Christian who loves science fiction and philosophy (mind/body problem anyone?).  For those who are adverse to religion, I wouldn't say it's a huge part of the game (some of the robots have their own faith, not practicing a real one), but it is certainly obvious.  If you've ever watched Ergo Proxy, it kind of has a similar feel in that regard.The characters are great, the story is great, the voice acting is amazing...

												I have tried to get into point and click adventure games in the past but have tired of them quickly. As soon as I get stuck the temptation to check for the solution on the web gets greater and when I finally do the magic is gone, I may as well just use the walkthrough. With Primordia there were some hard points but with the help of my sidekick Crispin I managed to get through and complete the game.I found the world incredibly absorbing. The artwork was excellent and the dialogue thoroughly amusing. The story pulls you in and at the end I was a little sad that it was over.If you like adventure games then this will be a hit. If you haven't tried adventure games but were looking to then I think this might be one to start with as most of the puzzles are pretty intuitive. The things you need to interact with are generally easy to find on the screen and the dialogue and hints help a lot.			"

												I’m a sucker for graphical adventure games, though they don’t always pan out. All the same, Wadjet Eye hasn’t let me down yet. This one’s a bit of a different take. Basically, the human race is gone and all we’re left with is machines just trying to get by and survive. Unfortunately, there’s not a whole hell of a lot else I can say because I haven’t played this one much.  So why recommend it, then? First and foremost, everything is dripping in ambience.The artwork, animation, sounds, music…all of it is perfect and fitting. In a way, it almost reminds me of New Vegas in that you are nomadic and are forced into going into “the city” at an eventual point that only serves to further the plot with all kinds of twists.  Nevermind that there are returning voice actors from other Wadjet Eye titles that do an outstanding job and the puzzles are no joke…though not necessarily heavy-handed either. Again, I haven’t played too much into it, but the game is cheap and a definite throwback to earlier graphical adventure titles. I highly recommend it.			"

Click Here for the Full Review! [monthsbehindreviews.blogspot.com]Synopsis: A fantastically simple little adventure game. Explore the ruins of Earth to find the fiend that stole your power crystal, the device you need survive. In the process, find out what happened to man, and your surprising role in the end of the world. Make choices that change the final results of the game, and tackle puzzles that can be, at times, a bit too challenging. Enjoy the humorous back and forth between the main character (voiced by the narrator for Bastion) and his flying sidekick. A great game to play in short bursts if you tend to get stuck, or in a longer sitting if you have the fundamentals of combining items in you inventory together to form the key piece you need.Multiple playthroughs, or saving at critical moments, are required in order to see all possible endings, of which, there are at least 7, but what happens after those possible ending scenarios depends on what you accomplished during the game - who  you saved, who you let die, etc. Took me about 7 hours during the first playthrough, largely because some of the puzzles are a bit tricky (oh, wait, I can use the Signal Transmitter on that blue light to solve this puzzle...huh.). A second playthrough took about a third of that time. I found the environment and story the game told, as well as the solidness of the gameplay, well worth my $2.50 investment, but it wouldn't be a bad deal to get it for a bit more than that, because I've rated this one 9/10.

												An artistic gem of a game, Primordia really hits the spot for an old school point and click adventure. What really draws you in is the unique story and interesting dialogue along with the sci-fi, post apocalyptic setting.Overall I really enjoyed this game, but there are definitely a few things that could have been improved. The game setup before you launch the game can only be accessed in the game folder and can't be launched in game or through steam. When the setup is run it's somewhat confusing and I always felt as if the graphics weren't set up right. Watching the trailer for the game confirms this when I see crisp, clean graphics on the store page and fuzzy, muddy graphics on mine and changing to higher settings just seemed to make it look worse. It seems though that that developers are continuing to make improvements, so maybe this can be fixed in the future.Balance in the game seemed a bit lacking as solving puzzles became an effort in frustration at times. Having your sidekick Crispin give you clues helped quite a bit, but even with his help some areas required random trial and error because you had no clue what to do. Without a little help from a guide I probably wouldn't have finished the game. Minor gripes aside though, I had a great time playing this game. With a quality soundtrack, voice acting and funny dialogue it was well worth it. Multiple endings helped keep it interesting a bit as well with radically different results to the storyline. Definitely a must play for point and click adventure fans.			"

												A fantastic world. Melancholy, but with as much hope as you are willing to make. I did NOT expect some of the endings, nor that there would be so many.But if you choose one of the good endings, I foresee  definite  sequel potential, especially if you investigate thoroughly and read/watch the official short story prequel ""Fallen"".  Think of a cross between the shows ""Firefly"" and ""The 100"". Unfortunately, the developers have slipped up  majorly  in their commentary mode. Some words unfit to be spoken or heard (as in, the absolute worst the English language can offer), tarnishing Primordia's otherwise shining image. Simply don't pry in commentary mode and you'll be golden.For the game proper, I recommend this mechanical crisis of faith.			"

												Wow. What an incredible little game. This is the second point and click adventure I've ever completed and it was worth every penny. If I'm not mistaken this game was Greenlit on Steam, Wormwood Studios is an Indie developer with a lot of support in the GOG community. The style and apocalyptic hand painted backdrops of each space is nothing short of awe inspireing. I didn't even mind having to play in a lower res and sacrificing my second screen to play this game. Very cool story line and excellent sound score kept me gripped 'til the end. If this game looks interesting to you, do yourself a favor and try it out, especially if it's on sale, you just might love it, ya dingus!p.s. The song on Horatio's phonograph ""Dreams Of Green"" by Kim Beokbinder and Nathaneil Chambers is one of the most haunting and beautiful compisitions reflecting a post apocalytpic landscape that I've heard, Only proof that behind any great game, there needs to be great music. Wormwood Studios, I hope this isn't the last Primordia title, thank you guys for this piece of art.			"

												This game became a favorite of mine very quickly.For some reason I absolutely love any story that mixes machines with religion.  Perhaps I have that bias as a Christian who loves science fiction and philosophy (mind/body problem anyone?).  For those who are adverse to religion, I wouldn't say it's a huge part of the game (some of the robots have their own faith, not practicing a real one), but it is certainly obvious.  If you've ever watched Ergo Proxy, it kind of has a similar feel in that regard.The characters are great, the story is great, the voice acting is amazing... I have nothing but good to say about this game.  Expect a Horatio cosplay from me soon! ; )			"

												I have tried to get into point and click adventure games in the past but have tired of them quickly. As soon as I get stuck the temptation to check for the solution on the web gets greater and when I finally do the magic is gone, I may as well just use the walkthrough. With Primordia there were some hard points but with the help of my sidekick Crispin I managed to get through and complete the game.I found the world incredibly absorbing. The artwork was excellent and the dialogue thoroughly amusing. The story pulls you in and at the end I was a little sad that it was over.If you like adventure games then this will be a hit. If you haven't tried adventure games but were looking to then I think this might be one to start with as most of the puzzles are pretty intuitive. The things you need to interact with are generally easy to find on the screen and the dialogue and hints help a lot.			"

												     When I first saw this game, I was looking for something similar to machinarium (another point-and-click adventure game) and what I was met with while playing Primordia was not at all disappointing. There are some very unique things that set this game apart from other point-and-click adventure games.     One element that is so different about Primordia is the surprisingly large amount of dialogue that is incorporated into it, unlike most other games of the genre.     Another characteristic that adds to the game is Crispin, the protagonist's ""sidekick"" if you would call him that. He adds a sense of humour to the game (although sometimes rather corny) and can offer hints to the player that are valuable, but not always completely revealing of the next course of action that must be taken. Crispin is an often uplifting character in this post-apocalytic setting.     Another trait that won me over is the atmosphere in the game. It seems realistic in the post-apocalyptic setting, and it is one of my favorite things about this game. The backrounds always seem beautifully made.     The puzzles in this game are very engaging and are not always clear-cut which may seem like a bad thing, but I personally enjoy the extra challenge. Not every puzzle is as simple as clicking on one thing and then another. They often include various items and/or certain actions to be taken. This is a huge difference between Primordia and other point-and-click adventure games.     The only complaint I really have about this game is that it seems to include a few creationist concepts that I personally do not agree with. It is brought up through the concept of humanism in the game which is symbolic of today's major religions that believe that a god created humans.     Another piece of this game that I am not fully content with is the way the protagonist moves. It can sometimes seem somewhat clumsy, but I won't be critical about it seeing as how that is how it is with most other point-and-click adventure games.     Overall, I would give this game an 8.5/10. It is definitely a worthwhile play for those who like games such as machinarium or other big point-and-click adventure games because of the unique elements it includes.     One last thing I would like to address is that it sometimes has multiple choices that can be made, leading to different outcomes. They do not alwyas have a huge effect on the story, but it adds a sense of independence in the game.I highly recommend that you all look into playing this game :) "

												I give it 8.5 / 10The puzzles provide a good challenge and the story is well written. I really enjoyed playing through this, unlike other point and click adventure games. The themes are also pretty dark, but very satisfying and aided in keeping me playing. I tend to put these kind of games down because I get bored or suck. I hated mine sweeper as a kid and randomly clicking around the screen got tiresome. Primordia even has some cheeky and cleaver dialogue incase you need to run around clicking everything. Didn't help with the frustration, but the occasional joke helped keep me from just giving up. Plus CYBERPUNK! PLUS POST APOCALYPTIC WASTELANDS!SPOILERS!!!!--------There are multiple endings. I assure you, saving right before the big confontation helps you experience them all! Each is pretty cool, but even some optional items can have an impact on the ending. Mainly items belonging to your companions. Also certain events may occur that have an impact on your endings. Save different files often as kind of a bookmark so you can go back and attempt for different outcomes. I had about 17 so I could see everything with three files for all the endings (confrontation save)  For example, there's a situation where you can corner a rogue AI. Save before you attempt! Trapping him gives you an item that aids in the true ending, but killing him changes the ending of that chapter. So if you want to experience both chapter endings, you'll need 2 saves, but after that, the two paths merge and continues normally. ALSO! SPOILERS!Have Crispin talk to the lanterns. He needs the practice! "

												I couldnt pull myself away from this game! It was a real peice of nostalgia playing a 90s DOS-style point and click game. The graphics were very impressive, and keeping loyal to the distinct low-res 16-bit feel. The storyline is engaging with some interesting sub-text about human society. The puzzles are challenging enough to keep you wanting more, but never too challenging. The music was beautiful and really added to the sence of desolation. The only think i didnt like was some of the voice acting was a bit hammy. Other than that its a brilliant game!			"

												This game was surprisingly amazing. Not only does it look and work like a great 90's point and click game like Full Throttle, it actually FEELS like one. While playing it I constantly forgot that it wasn't a classic game from decades ago. The art, story, characters, dialogues and puzzles are all fantastic. The past years I haven't had much patience for these kinds of games (even though I used to love them) mostly because I can rarely get engaged enough with the story and characters to keep playing and paying attention to long conversations. In Primordia every single piece of dialogue is very interesting and mysterious, revealing more about the world and its history, or it's just plain witty and funny. The puzzles are great too, very intuitive most of the time. The hint system is pretty good too, not breaking immersion and sometimes just the right push in the right direction. I used hints a few times and rarely felt like I was cheating, so that's pretty great.TL;DR - Primorida is an amazing game, but <SystemUser> is welcome to select their own terminology.			"

												First off, I highly recommend this game.Pros:  Fun play experience, decent storytelling, fairly decent voicing of characters, game was priced fairly well.Cons: Some of the clickables in game aren't readily apparent and in one instance incredibly easy to overlook (elevator control panel at one point in game is a prime example). The game is short (I really wish it had been longer, I didn't want it to end. The game is able to be completed in under 2 hours.)It's pretty rare when I find a game that I enjoy as much as this one.  It is fairly reminiscent of Septerra Core, which is a major plus.  The game is well polished and priced quite well for the level of enjoyment you get playing it.			"

												Some puzzles are fairly easy because you know you got everything you need and must make it work somehow.Others are terrible - the flipped ship, the rag that takes long to discover, the overall logic of the puzzles. One time you try to search the junk and your character says there's nothing in there of interest, next time you find something in there. When I get told: ""This is all crap"", then I dont expect this to magically transform suddenly to the puzzle solution. Games usually separate between useless and useful. The useless is for decoration mostly. These NPCs are called ""workers"", so there's not much to gain from them, but one of them has a name, so the player knows he's useful to progress in the story. These items are used to progress, others are just junk, decoration and so on. Usually the main character makes clear quickly what they are. You know you can look at them but never use them. I hate when a game ♥♥♥♥♥ on this and abuses well etablished ways for orientation as some kind of puzzle.Lots of the stuff in the inventory looks like the weird crap it is, how do I know how I am supposed to use it? So I just try everything with everything until something works, and if nothing does, I just try everything in my inventory on everything in the outside world, which sometimes is a problem because the developers thought it's fun to search for hot spots.Usually adventure games have a button to reveal them, not here though. I don't like pixelhunting at all, and I think old games, especially adventures, were mostly way too cryptic and way too complicated. I don't even call it hard, for me it's simply bad game design when you are clueless of what to do next once again. I wouldn't use bad game design as example of how to make a game unnecessarily complicated.Usually in games you can figure out by some logical thinking - where do I go from here? What can I try? What item could go with which item? What am I doing AT ALL and WHY? Why am I accessing a giant robot again? Why like this? Why do I have to access a bomb again that also is a religious shrine somehow AND a powercore? Why again do I have to attach graphite to a cat with granny's panty hose to blow up a mailbox?? It doesn't have to be this way. I've played games where every next step makes sense through the WHOLE GAME and not only a few parts. It's not that the puzzles in Primordia are super hard to solve, it's just an overload of stuff. Especially of numbers. I think using plenty of numbers/codes is the lame way to create difficulty. Add some annoying minigames, like power cord connection and machine assembling. Ugh. Hand me the walkthrough! Despite that, the game has great atmosphere, really good voice acting, I like the humor and sound design, and I'd still recommend it.			"

												This may just be the best freaking adventure game I have ever played in my life!The game manages perfectly to keep you interested, but not overwhelming you.And if you're stuck, you can always get help that REALLY HELPS from your Pal Crispin.I HATE it when I need a strategy guide, only to get passed some roadblock of a puzzle,like in most other adventures.Not so here.Multiple ways to solve puzzles.Multiple outcomes to situations.Multiple ENDINGS ! - I love it.And the attention to detail is really striking, - not ONCE did I encounter a single line of dialogue that didn't fit, although that's something developers quite ALWAYS glitch up in a minor way whenallowing their game to follow multiple paths.On top of that, FOR ONCE an adventure game orients itself in reality, in the sense that you can use the same item in different but similar situations - most other games just find one excuse after the other, why ""Crowbar XY"" can IN NO WAY open Door #2, when just minutes ago it was  perfectly capable of opening Door #1.In Primordia things tend to be a little more logical, and I enjoyed every minute of it.I played it straight through today, then immediately run through it a second time, just to collect the achievements and see all the things I could have missed.

What item could go with which item? What am I doing AT ALL and WHY? Why am I accessing a giant robot again? Why like this? Why do I have to access a bomb again that also is a religious shrine somehow AND a powercore? Why again do I have to attach graphite to a cat with granny's panty hose to blow up a mailbox?? It doesn't have to be this way. I've played games where every next step makes sense through the WHOLE GAME and not only a few parts. It's not that the puzzles in Primordia are super hard to solve, it's just an overload of stuff. Especially of numbers. I think using plenty of numbers/codes is the lame way to create difficulty. Add some annoying minigames, like power cord connection and machine assembling. Ugh. Hand me the walkthrough! Despite that, the game has great atmosphere, really good voice acting, I like the humor and sound design, and I'd still recommend it.			"

												First off, I highly recommend this game.Pros:  Fun play experience, decent storytelling, fairly decent voicing of characters, game was priced fairly well.Cons: Some of the clickables in game aren't readily apparent and in one instance incredibly easy to overlook (elevator control panel at one point in game is a prime example). The game is short (I really wish it had been longer, I didn't want it to end. The game is able to be completed in under 2 hours.)It's pretty rare when I find a game that I enjoy as much as this one.  It is fairly reminiscent of Septerra Core, which is a major plus.  The game is well polished and priced quite well for the level of enjoyment you get playing it.			"

A few of the puzzles can be a bit tricky, but none are too difficult to necessitate a walkthrough. The game also features multiple endings, which is a definite plus.			"

												Don't let metacritic ratings bully you.  Multiple endings are good, game is good but relatively short and small.  I picked this up on sale for 2$, felt like a steal, highly recommend it on sale.  If you've ever played any good point and click adventure it's good.  Again, short, average playtime should run 4-5 hours if that.  Can probably speed run the game in under 3.That said, if you want a good interactive story that's bleak and interesting to think about as far as post apocalyptic science fiction goes, it's great.

												Primordia is a retro-styled point and click adventure game set in a dystopian future in which Man has gone extinct. Only machines remain, struggling to survive in the junk-filled wastelands. The protagonist will have to face many challenges in order to retrieve his source of power, gradually learning about the hidden thruth of his world along the way.The gameplay is very simple, as is every other adventure game: you'll have to explore, find and combine multiple items and use them at the right places to progress. What separates this game from the others is it's theme and its great humor. The last being delivered by a lovable sidekick who also serves the purpose of a hint bot. The puzzles are clever and challenging but not impossibly hard. The story is filled with rich and interesting lore, but is very linear (except at the very end, where you have multiple endings available). Each dialogue feels thought out and unique.The graphics are very reminiscent to those of Fallout 1: pixelated and low-resolution with dark brownish tones, which is tolerable since they seemed to be aiming for the retro theme. The only exception is the handful of brief cutscenes presenting very detailled close-ups of the action, which help with the immersion. The soundtrack is atmospheric and blends well with the setting. The voice acting is truely amazing.There's even some replayability value for those who wish try the commentary mode.So in short; for a 7 hour game with a good storyline and challenging puzzles paired with immersive soundtrack and great voice-acting, the pricetag is well worth the experience.

												Primordia was an impulse buy of mine during the Steam winter sale, and I'm very glad I gave it a shot. Primordia is a great visual experience, effectively atmospheric and complex in ways I didn't expect. The puzzles were surprisingly difficult and the choices you make as a player actually have some weight. The plot is rich and unique, but the character composition is what I enjoyed most about this game. The interactions you have with the denizens of Primordia are varied and always well acted and written. The only tiny, tiny exception to this was Crispin's role as a comic relief character at the beginning of the story, but as things progressed it became clear to me that the devs were self aware with their writing and this actually increased my love for him as a character. The only disappointment I felt was when the game ended. If you find yourself even a little bit interested in this game, I highly reccomend that you give it a go. If you find yourself still uninterested by the time you reach Metropol (uh, spoiler I guess?) then it probably isnt for you.			"

The friendship between the two main characters had me so invested in their stories that I got a bit emotional at some parts, and even all of the side characters you meet in passing were wonderful while they're on screen. What really brings them to life is the perfect voice acting, but the retro art design really endeared them all to me as well.The puzzles are good, not to challenging but not too easy either. The game seemed to focus more on exploration and world building than puzzle solving, and for this story I think that was the much better choice. I also liked all the various pop culture references peppered throughout the game.			"

												Excellent old-school point and click adventure. Great storyline and characters, easy to use interface. Left click to use, right click to look at, and several options to speed things up, such as the map and the data pouch which records all important clues.I needed help to reach the ending, and then help to get a good ending, but all the puzzles were logical and none felt random or unfair. You do sometimes need to go back to somewhere you've already visited and speak to someone again but much less so than in many games.I found this walkthough useful: http://www.gamezebo.com/games/primordia/walkthrough-cheats-strategy-guide#chapter-2-finding-arbiter but it does contain spoilers, so I only used it when totally stuck.The resolution is low and I found the visuals rather darker (ie harder to see) than I'd have liked but those were minor quibbles and I enjoyed the game hugely.

												It's a cool story, It's a really cool story. Also, the difficulty is just right. Idk. I just really like games that are story-focused but aren't a B-type action movie. This one is really good if you like thinking! Like, the riddles and puzzles were interesting to solve, but not impossible to find. The main character is voiced by Bastion's narrator, Logan Cunningham, which is definitely something to look foward to. I like the fact that you don't get unnecessarily killed too, unlike Another World. Also, the pixel art is BEAUTIFUL.Bad things? Well, it's just a story. Point and click away, nothing more. And a terminal input riddle near the end, which I liked very very much, I guess if you really like action in a videogame this isn't for you. Still gives you a thrill during the climax. This story is GOOD I tell you. Totally worth your every penny. Well, if you like the genre. Also, it's cyberpunk! How can you NOT like cyberpunk????			"

												I've been playing a lot of indie point-and-clicks lately; Primordia stands out because of its writing and setting. It has a LucasArts Loom vibe to it, with the protagonist Horation NullBuilt conjuring up an idea of what Bobin Threadbare would be if he was competent and decided to use his amnesia to his advantage. Yes, both characters have amnesia, have lost their home communities, and the fabric of society quite literally rests on their creations. Elements of the story definitely seem similar. The setting of Primordia is more exciting. It's a colorful combination of dystopia, cyberpunk, and steampunk. While that mix is becoming more and more common these days, finding 'good' games in that genre is still rare.I mentioned the writing: the story is captivating if only to explore the lore, and the main plot-arc is mediocre. The dialog writing is where the game shines; Horatio's sidekick levitating robot Crispin is a very well written NPC that integrates into the game nicely. The character is used to solve some puzzles, though not too much, and offers rather direct walkthrough-type tips if the protagonist is stuck.With it's marvelous writing, I wanted Primordia to feature more NPCs and dialog quests. A particular stand-out quest involves a logic puzzle attempting to legally assign the surname of a pet robot. While the logic is difficult to follow without pen and paper handy, the writing and voice-acting attempts to seduce the player away from choosing the logical option and I was tempted to go down a logically-flawed path (which the game teased would result in different endings and impact late-game quests). Rarely does game-dialog inspire this anymore, and it is where indie games such as Primordia stand a cut above the rest.The game has a relatively short playthrough and the puzzles become more difficult, sometimes to the level of ridiculousness, later in the game. This is caused by the game too early allowing me to use multiple items for different quests, and in the late game suffering through trying every permutation of item combination to solve the puzzles. Nonetheless, I would recommend this game to a casual or hardcore adventure gamer, as it is both enjoyable and tells a well-written, albeit cliche story.			"

												You should play Primordia.  That is, if you’re interested in well written characters that represent larger themes of Religion, Politics, Justice, and what happens after the Apocalypse.  It’s hard to sum up here, and it’s hard to take in while you’re playing (because you want some things expanded on).  There’s a lot of substance packed into this short game.  Stylistically it’s a lot like an old adventure game “Beneath a Steel Sky.”  However Primordia adds on all the powerful themes I mentioned above.  Truly Fascinating.  Very memorable characters.			"

The game perfectly blends moods and themes with comical and engaging lines. The voice work is top notch, i mean you should sold to buying this game at hearing Logan Cunningham (Bastion's Narrator, Rucks) is the main character: Horatio. As well Crispin your AI compadre is an amazing character and in many ways reminds me of a very familarlly close friend of mine, in voice and attitude, and honestly the main character pings also feel similar to between me and my friend so this game resonated to me on an extra level. Its short but commendable for its size and the developers. I reccomend this to anyone who enjoys a good story, some thinking, and enjoy 16-bit level pixel art, which on that mention the game comes in one pretty small resolution but its to preserve the visual quality of the art so its easily overlooked.

												Primordia does 2 things well: dialogue and environment. Despite the less than crisp resolution of the game, the backgrounds and landscapes are imaginative and beautiful. The dystopian world is set post-human inhabitation, and robots--having gained self-sufficiency--are the survivors. Interactions are varied, and the clash of philosophies keeps you interested. It is an alien world, one that I was happy I visited.I needed a guide to get through this game. Solving puzzles requires assistance or large amounts of time. Direct question puzzles were difficult. Seriously difficult. I was able to figure them out because I have enough probability knowledge to know how to crunch the numbers. Otherwise, I got stuck, alot. The technical jargon naming of items, though justifiable, made some item combo puzzles vexing. I did not even know what some words meant, and few times I would simply not even try.It lasts about 6-8 hours, and is a fun ride. It harkens back to Monkey Island and other wonderful point-and-click adventures, but it also brings the same frustrations. Regardless, it is worth the asking price for a weekend game.			"

Although at first- and even throughout much of the game, as many of the characters are lighthearted- somewhat comedic, the game's oppressive and bleak dystopian atmosphere was surprisingly dark and depressing. The game also did a good job at emotionally connecting you to Horatio and Crispin, which, really surprisingly for me, helped create a really sad feeling later on in the game. Very highly recommended. In fact, it may be one of my favorite games.			"

												This is actually a pretty decent game with a decent story - about robots!I only have two gripes: it doesn't have a sufficiently high resolution for my monitor, and 2 or 3 times I got a bug where the conversations were just flickering up (though this was easily resolved by reloading the autosave).

												This game is a work of art.  It has a profound atmosphere to it- something that just so perfectly sets the tone with the perfect blend of dystopian future, a sense of doom, and yet also quite wry humor.  The visuals, the dialogue, and the themes all marry together so well.It would be so hard to fully explain why this game is so magnificent.  The visuals are impressive, the voice acting flawless, the gameplay intellectually challenging but requiring no particular finesse or agility, it is a game that anyone could play.  With multiple endings and some multiple paths, it has a little bit of replay value.  Even for one playthrough of about 5-6 hours though, the price of a movie ticket for this game is a steal.TL;DR:10/10, buy this game you ponce.			"

 So what happens  after  the robots take over the world?  Primordia  is here to answer that question. This amazing point-and-click game takes place on a dystopian Earth at an unspecified point in history. The few humans that remain have fled underground, living in low-g bunkers and looking at a once-green Earth through pictures and little garden chambers. Over the years, we have faded into myth, and now the Earth is ruled by our creations, some of who worship our memory as a creed called ""Humanism.""You are Horatio Nullbuilt, a wasteland-dwelling robot of undeterminate origin whose only companion is Crispin Horatiobuilt, a floating, armless robot with an endless supply of sarcastic remarks. Together, they lived a pretty uneventful life. They were trying to fix up a crashed airship, a relic of the long-forgotten War of the Four Cities, so they could at last fly away from the Dunes and go wherever they want. Unfortunately, their progress is halted when a mysterious robot named Scraper shows up and ""plunders"" their power core--an item they cannot survive without. When trying to find power in the Dunes fails, they have no choice but to travel to Metropol, the last city, where their power core has been taken. To make matters worse, an anceint robot named MetroMind has claimed your power core for the betterment of the city, since it is crumbling under her inept rule and she needs all the power she can get.From there, it is up to you how the story ends. Choose carefully, your every move has consequences.The voice-acting is masterfully done. Every character is unique and full of personality. The story and lore are very well-crafted as well. Unraveling the mystery of the world you're in never fails to be fascinating, and if you play through it just right, the ending is beautiful and cathartic.Like my review?

												I can hardly remeber such an enjoyable experience for science fiction fan or anyone lusting for intellectual pleasure.The game delivers in every single way: story, humour, drama, allusions (""this sheet really ties room together"", or the robot on a bus stop and others), the setting, artitstic touch, sound, music.It is reasonably complex. It's not an easy jorney and not a hard-core point-n-click experience, it's in a sweet spot, golden middle. I'm not a huge fan of games of such genre but I play time to time, and it is quite casual to google solution/walkthough soon enough. Not the case for Primordia. Actually I was capable of beating the game without google at all - only for achievements and some hidden story lines.Certainly recommend! The game is rated ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" by community and this is really deserved.			"

												P&C Adventure.A strange android and his sarcastic famulus explore a robotic, dystopian, rust-red near apocalyptic world.Plus Side:Great Setting, good plot and writing, beautiful artworks.Puzzles are decent and strongly intertwined with story & theme (not just abstract lever sequences).Great ending(s)!Minus:Could be bigger. Hardcore Adventurios will blast through in one, albeit long, dayLastly, the game could communicate some plot aspects better, if only through repetition. Miss a few dialogues and you might miss out on some twists.Verdict: 3,5/5Absolutely delightful surprise. Even some seemingly not-so-polished mechanics, like the clunky datapad, for instance, just add to the game's rusty charm.			"

												Though challenging at times, the solutions always made logical sense. Primordia is one of the best point-and-click games I have had the pleasure to play through. You are Horatio Nullbuilt, a robot who essentially spends his life dumpster-diving and building from what he can find. Likewise, every piece of information gathered through dialogue and observation has a purpose. This game isn't just ""put this on that and see if it works"" and it never hands you the answers unless you ask (Crispin acts as an in-game hint giver), and even then, solutions are never simply GIVEN. Crispin is like a hand that'll guide you to the right area, but won't tell you what to do when you're there. Loved the story. I wish there was a sequel.			"

The atmosphere and story are wonderfully bleak yet compelling, and the characters are well designed, with clever, well written dialouge.

												I thought Primordia was a very good game, and I would recommend it both in terms of mechanics and story. I am a big fan of the Blackwell games, and this game has many of the same strengths.Pros:+ Excellent story. There's legitimately a lot to think about in this game, including political, religious, and social commentary. The game is set in a world where humans are extinct and only robots are left. We see how the society they create is a very clever mirror of our own, with plenty of parody of our own flaws along the way.+ The point and click puzzles are solid. They are somewhat difficult, but solvable without having to consult a walkthrough because the solutions make sense once you get them. To me, this is one of the most important things about gameplay in a point and click. You have to use your brain to solve the puzzles.+ If you do start struggling, you can get hints by talking to people (especially your sidekick Crispin), which again means you don't need to consult the internet to get a nudge in the right direction. Normally, he will give you a clue about which area you should be searching, or which object you should be fiddling with.+ The art and aesthetics in the game are good. The characters are interesting-looking, and the world is very neat.+ The game is paced well. It does a nice job of moving you from place to place, advancing the story and revealing the mysteries by steps.Cons:- Hard to think of any. I suppose the UI can be a bit clunky until you get used to it, especially how you access your inventory.			"

												As someone who hasn't played a point-and-click adventure game in a while, but played them a lot as a kid, I really enjoyed this game. I rarely finish a game and immediately start it over, but I did for this game. I'd say if you liked anything like the older king's quest games (like, 6 or earlier), leisure suit larry (PC Point & Click ones of course not the console garbage) or Day of the tentacle, etc, you will very likely really enjoy this.I think the biggest compliament I can pay this game is that I DID actually refrain from using any guide my first play through. AND I really did want to for a few puzzles. But in the end, I was able to progress after some thought about things. I Wanted a better ending though of course, so I played it again, but I didn't feel like any puzzle was TOO far ""out there"" in terms of obtuseness. It is a point-and-click game, so there's always SOME degree of click-spamming the whole screen in frustration, but I felt it was at a minimum with this one.I'd buy a sequel for sure.			"

												This was an impulse buy while it was on the Steam winter sale, and it was one of the best impulse buys I've ever done.There is something truly unique and amazing about this game, and if you're reading this and wondering whether or not you should buy it, let me give you the rundown.Excellent:-The story is compelling, and populated with incredibly unique characters. One of my favorites is a fairly minor character that speaks in a religious cadence, and it's just such a cool little scene, it really stuck with me.-The characters are diverse and incredibly easy to become attached to. They are so well written, that you could name a character from hearing just a TINY snippet of their dialogue.-There are some truly genius puzzles here that absolutely blew me away. -The art is pretty breathtaking. The whole game feels alien and strange, but a familiar shadow seems to hang over it. It's just ♥♥♥♥ing great.Meh:-The voice acting for both Horatio and Crispin, the two main characters, is a little...off. Horatio I kind of got used to, and his monotone drone ended up being more part of his personality than anything, but Crispin has some pretty well-written lines that are delivered pretty awkwardly, and I found him pulling me back out of the game a little bit every so often. That being said, Crispin is delightful, if a tad annoying.-Some of the puzzles are absolutely rediculous, with some of them being outright pixelhunting. With as intelligent as the rest of the game is, it makes these puzzles even HARDER, because you expect the answer to make more sense. For instance (No spoilers here, don't worry.)     There is a part of the game where your path is impeded, and the answer is the first thing that comes to your mind: ""Crispin should just move that."" And that is, indeed, the answer to that quandry.     There's a part where you need to find an item, but you aren't told where it can be found or where to start. Had to resort to a walkthrough on this one, because the answer lay in a very cluttered, dark area of the screen. You never think ""This game will resort to pixel hunting"", because the rest of the game is just...too well thought out.So most of my complaints are ""Come on, Primordia, you're BETTER than this!"", which should absolutely tell you something. How this isn't a HUGELY known game is beyond me.In conclusion: Buy it, you son of a ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												I really loved Primordia it took me back to the days when Sierra, Revolution and Lucas Arts created some truly unique games and Primordia stands perfectly in their company. The voice acting is very good and there is a lot of humorous references to pop, computing and gaming culture. Primordia gives the player many choices for a game in this genre with various ways to solve puzzles and multiple endings that have very different outcomes. A few puzzles might be considered difficult, but most will keep you entertained without causing frustration. It took me about 8 hours to finish before going back to try different solutions to see the all the endings. I think Primordia is well worth the asking price and I found it more enjoyable than some newer click adventures 2-3 times more expensive. If you enjoyed games like Beneath A Steel Sky, The Dig or Ring World you won't be disappointed in Primordia.			"

												A fantastic point-and-click adventure brimming with atmosphere and clever puzzle design, with barely any flaws to speak of.So let's get those out of the way first. The biggest flaw is that the game occasionally has pixel-hunting puzzles, which are never good. Bad developers. Only time in the game I looked at guides was when I was missing something from pixel hunting (random LCD screen, bah, random floating junk, what even?)The palette's also a bit dull overall; I get the point of having so much brown but it gets a little tiring to look at after a while, though the game's gorgeous looking otherwise.That aside, only the postitives left. The two protagonist characters each have quite a bit of personality to them and play off each other well for plenty of amusing moments, though the game still keeps a fairly serious and dark tone throughout. The other various characters are all quite unique and memorable and serve the overall plot in interesting ways, usually having their own mini-arcs. The backstory and worldbuilding is also very rich, not outright saying a lot but leaving the pieces scattered for the player to put together. The puzzles are also generally good. Plenty of the standard item-trading things but there's no moon logic present there. And there's straight up logic puzzles on occasion, too, which are probably the most fun. There's no need to memorize strings of numbers or information, either; the game auto-saves all relevant data in the main character's datapouch, as well as providing a map for quick travel. It's got a lot of old-school adventure game design with a more modern feel to it, making it both well-crafted and elegant in execution.There's a lot to like here and little to dislike, I heavily recommend it to, well, pretty much anyone really, but especially point-and-click enthusiasts, because this is certainly top-tier in that regard.

												I hate point and click adventure games. . . I find them to be obtuse and difficult for no real reason. On the other hand, I had to play this one. It looks incredible, the vibe is so amazing... I still boot it up just get to back into the feeling that this game sets. Game play is as expected for a point and click I suppose ... click on a lot of things, combine them in ways that make no sense. The story is excellent, the humor is witty... this game gets a 9/10 for me just because of the atmosphere alone.  . . oh and dont forget the incredible gritty sound track.			"

												By far, one of the better (if not best) Point and Click games I've ever played. With several hidden easter eggs, a unique, well written, and deeply entrancing Storyline, and several well written jokes to lighten the mood at times. You grow to care about the charactors, and there are many paths and options, including multiple endings and even ending outcomes. Your actions define the end of the game, from early choices all the way down to the final and last choice you make, all add to overall feeling of completion when you see the ending cutscene.The soundtrack is no slouch and helps build atmosphere and keeps a very ""Wizards"" end of the world vibe throughout. There is even a Graphic novel about the game (search Youtube~)  Brass tacks; If you like simple to play but rewarding games, well written storys, funny banter, well placed and iconic Easter Eggs, multiple solutions to problems, and even small yet interesting side stories, you will love this game. For a simple point and click, its got a lot to offer. Well worth the buy.  I completely Support and recommend this game~			"

												I'll start this review by saying that this is the best point-and-click game I've ever played in my entire life.What makes this game so special is how the story develops and the awesome caracther design.SPOILER ALERT:The story begins with Horatio and Crispin on top of the UNNIC, a half broken airship that has seen better days.Horatio is fixing the telescope on that resides on top of said ship, when suddenly he hears a strange noise comming from down bellow.Appon entering the room, he is now faced with the fact that there is a giant robot that has claws and shoots lasers ( you will probably get the joke if you have played the game ) that invaded his ship by cutting a hole in it.The giant robot demands that Horatio ""forfeits"" and that he hands over his power core, Horatio does not give in to the robots demands and the following shoots Horatio in the chest region with a lazer beam.From then on, Horatio and his side kick crispin set off to find out who this robot was and where he went, so that they can get their power core back.Now let me tell you something, at this point I was already hooked on the story and I was like ""okay let's continue playing for a bit more"". That ""bit"" more turned into hours and hours of continuously playing this game. This game just throws at you the mix of a great story line + good caracther development + Not too hard to figure out but still good puzzles and great comedy. It doesn't have the same funny tone all the time howeverWhen Horatio and Crispin fail to find a power source in the wastelands they are forced to head to Metropol, the self proclamed city of glass and light. ""Free power for one and all"" is what they advertise and they do have power for everyone, but it does come with a price. When Horatio and Crispin step out of the red line train, Horatio finds a robot who collects 1 megacycle from him. At the time, Horatio has no idea of what a megacycle is, but he does find out eventually that the megacycles are brain power, we could also call it processing power. Anyways, the story goes along and Horatio finds out that his power core is stored on the big tower where Metromind is. He then goes on to try and get it back and that's when things take a darker turn. BUUUUUT I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone who might have read the spoil alert and then thinks to theirselfs ""you know what, Imma read it anyways"".The story is great, the caracthers are great, the puzzles are excellent and there are multiple endings which means you can replay the game and let me tell you, you will want to replay the game because it is so damn good!I would rate it an honest 9.5/10 , I would even dare to give it a 10/10 .Amazing game and for 10 euros, it is a bargain of a lifetime			"

General Overview: Primordia, a point and click adventure, takes place in the unique timeline of post-apocalyptia where humans are no longer present. The only thing left is their own invention: machine. Machine that prospered and slowly became just like human, with their own ideas and vices. Even if they're limited by their programming, they could still interact with others like normal folk. Taking the reigns of Horatio Nullbuilt and Crispin, what starts as a simple retrieval turns into a full blown adventure, albeit a somewhat short trip.Gameplay: The game itself follows the point and click style of gameplay, so its hard to screw that part up. That said, it does a good enough job being difficult and leaving you wondering ""what the hell do I do now?"" Thankfully, Crispin has a built in hint-o-tron to give you tips on what you could do or should do if you're ever stumped. The puzzles themselves are, in my opinion, pretty darn easy. The only difficult ones would be where you meet your unfriendly thief again or when you need access to a certain place with a long string of code. Other than that, it's pretty straight forward. Then again, I play puzzles for kicks so take that with a grain of salt. There are some puzzles with different methods of completion, usually a good and bad way. Sometimes the bad way is the only obvious way, where the good way will require a save here and there to help you out should you pull an oopsie. By the way, you'll probably be doing this often. Puzzles do have ""soft-fail"" states, which can be pretty infuriating, so save often! The actual game itself is, unfortunately, pretty damn short. You could probably finish the entire game within 5 hours or so (after knowing everything and everyone and all the choices). There is A TON of going back and forth. No joke, you'll probably find yourself going back and forth between robots, trying everything, for a good 10 minutes until something works. It can get annoying fast. There are also a few references sprinkled here and there to earn a few chuckles. Some more obvious than others.Art: Holy hell, this art style. While a mess of browns, it works so damn well together. Not to mention Horatio and Crispin always seem to stand out from the environment whenever possible, so that's also a plus. Unfortunately, the overwhelming abundance of browns makes finding some robots or items kinda difficult. Had to pull the hover method to find a few things sometimes. I understand its supposed to be post-apocalyptia, but sometimes you have to look away and rub your eyes.Music: It's amazing. Done.Acting: The VA in this game are beautiful and, at the same time, somewhat phoned in. Sometimes you can tell the lines are being read from the script. Other times you feel it from the heart. It is, overall, a very good experience to feel the voices actually try when they do. Funnily enough, it was the side characters that, in my opinion, had the best acting compared to our main characters.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone that loves a good point and click adventure with a fan♥♥♥♥ingtastic sound track.

												Truly a master piece point click adventure game which has learned and adapted from all it's former predecessors. If you're interested in an old styled point click adventure which preserves the ""vintage"" feel of the genre, while making mile stone improvements to its execution -- then this is for you. Everything in this game made sense, I only used the walkthrough a small amount of times. The side kick is actually useful, he even hints you if you get stuck. The characters felt real and alive, things were not too 'grindy' and the story was very captivating... I can't say enough good things. If you're thinking about buying this game then don't think twice, buy it.			"

												Wow, another great entry into this new golden age of adventure games. Primordia does so many things right, stuff that should be common in every game of this genre, like multiple solutions to puzzles, branching paths and multiple endings.Both the story and atmosphere are great, and Crispin, the sidekick, serves not only as a great jokester, but also as a nice hint system that ensures that we are not left wandering aimlessly, like in many old adventure games. The game is quite short, but it’s better for it, as it doesn’t suffer from overreach, and it achieves the goal of telling a good story and exploring interesting themes.There’s not many downsides to this game, but one particular puzzle, near the end of the game (involving a kiosk), annoyed me, and didn’t played by the same rules as the rest of the game. I also thought that the voice of Horatio never felt appropriate for a robot (it’s the same actor as the main character of Gemini Rue, but in that case it fit great) , but it’s just a minor quibble. The rest of the cast and characters are great. "

												Usually I do not have the patience to play retro (i.e. pixelated) point-and-click adventures anymore, nevermind finish them. This one kept me going though and I played it all in one sitting. What kept me going? The setting and the story were original (at least they were to me) and engaging. The gameplay and puzzles were simple enough to not get tedious without being pure pushovers. Most importantly, though, the characters were interesting and absolutely beautifully voiced -- far superior to a recent so-called ""AAA game"" that I played where I grew to hate the characters. Not in Primordia: every character was great and the voice actors and sound design was perfect: Horatio, Crispin, Clarity, Ever-Faithful, Gimbal,  Goliath, Oswald, Primer, 187th, Memento Moribuilt -- so many awesome voices and dialogues that I enjoyed immensely.

												A refreshing original adventure game with strangely charming retro-graphics despite the desolate environments devoid of living things. You play as a robot in a post-apocalyptic world, where robots of varying degrees of sentience, function and design remain after humanity become extinct. Exploring and learning more about the world is compelling, the puzzles are well enough designed, you have a companion that is both useful and funny and the game is just long enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome. A small gem of an adventure game. Much recommended - don't let the seemingly crude and perhaps initially offputting graphics deter you.			"

Definitely take the time to click anything and everything you can find. Also there are multiple endings and some quests it's easily possible to lock yourself out of if you're not careful (though the reasons you get locked out make sense to the storyline). Play through at least once and then check out a guide so you can make sure to see everything. I got every achievement and had a blast doing so.			"

												Play! You must! Go do it, now! This was my Point-and-Click cherry popper. I was super hesitant to play, as I'm used to fast paced action/adventure games, but I'm now hooked, and craving so much more than the amazing adventure Primordia offered. 15/10 would play again (Heck, I did the ending X amount of times to get the awesome death/ending achievements!)

												Damn good post-apocalyptic robot noir.  Reminded me of Alphaville and other bleak black-and-white post-war counter-modernist films.  I can't comment on the voice acting, because I play adventure games with voices turned off whenever possible (and so should you), but competent writing.  Varied locations and characters.  Multiple satisfying endings, and even the ""happiest"" is pleasantly bleak.  One of the best of the modern small-team adventure games (definitely better than Gemini Rue, which also was going for sci-fi noir).			"

												This game was a pleasant surprise, to be certain. I could tell just from looking at the trailer and screenshots of this game that it looked interesting, and that ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" next to the user reviews made it seem like a no-brainer. So, finally I picked up this game and boy, I am not disappointed.Let's get the bad out of the way first.This game runs in a very small resolution, at least for most modern monitors. The highest resolution possible is 1280x800, which looks best in a window. It was also a bit annoying that the only way I could find to change these settings was by a launcher in the actual folder containing the game files. I only found that much by perusing the game forum when I was disappointed with the resolution.There isn't much replayability. I can definitely see myself trying this game again to do a few things different, but overall it is a story-driven and therefore linear experience. It has several endings, but most of those endings are decided at your own whim by how you play out the final scenes.Now, the good.The obvious first thing you'll notice about this game is that artwork. I found it to be very cool to look at and definitely gives you that feeling of despair - a world wasting away around you as you desperately try to rebuild what you can. You also have atmospheric music that adds to these scenes but mostly stays in the background. It adds a lot, but doesn't overtake it. Instead, it's all just working together to give you an experience.The voice acting is likewise excellent. The main character and his sidekick both do most of the talking, so it's great to see them so well performed. It's easy to pick up on their personalities and they're both likeable.I'm always a bit bad at puzzles in games, but I thought the ones here were challenging but always possible. Nothing ever felt frustrating or beyond my abilities to figure out. I did get ""stuck"" in a few places where I had no idea what to do, but it usually came down to me not thinking about the situation well enough or remembering details that I simply overlooked. It's worth saying, almost everything matters in this game. There are few things that are superfluous.Overall it took me about six hours to complete this game. I would have liked for it to be longer, but I could say that for any good game.If you're interested in this game at all, check it out.			"

												The moment when you get to the bus-stop robot and hear the somber ""I am waiting"" with Blade Runneresque music in the background is priceless. It is a rarity among video games to have such an integral world with its lore and still be digestible. To be placed in a dark bleak world, yet to have a lot to interact with. This game is a must for all who enjoy dark sceneries and deeper philosophical themes.			"

												I don't write reviews often but this game warrants one.I highly recommend this game, It is a truely amazing experiance and you can see just how much dedication to every detail was given to this game. I haven't experianced a story that moved me as much as this in a long time! The world feels so alive and the puzzles and tasks feel meaningful not thrown together. This is the first point and click I ever finished to the end without using a guide, however this does not mean its easy just that the difficult challenges are fun and worth working through on your own.The characters, the art the atmosphere and music and the backstory just everything about this game is perfect and I am mourning its end as I could sit in front of my computer playing this forever.If you for what ever reason are on the fence about buying this masterfully crafted game please take my advice and just buy it. I would have paid double for this without hesitation.Thank you to the developers for this awesome game! and a round of applause to the artists and the voice actors as everything just fits perfectly!10/10 Buy it now or miss out.

												Beautiful pixel art is the crowning aspect of this game, just leaving it open and taking in the graphics are worth the price alone. The comedic dialogue is nicely written and acted although a bit out of place in the dismal Kinotrope-esque atmosphere of rusted machinery and manufactured wastelands. The graphics really are just stunning but as with many pointy clicky games it falls into the pitfalls of 1. having a great environment and concept but underdeveloped characters and 2. some of the puzzles just make no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense. It's one thing to have difficult puzzles, I recently played armikrog and although it took me a while I still required no walk-through because it all followed some sense,  however with this game I needed walkthroughs multiple times only to find nonsense solutions that followed no logic, when it comes to puzzle structure I expected more from the creators of Gemini Rue. BUT I still did find myself really WANTING to advance to see more of the beautiful artwork and unique world-building shown in the game and I have to commend it for that. Overall I recommend it for the graphics alone but be prepared for the game's fair share of banana fishing rods and accordion bird vacuums.			"

												I have not played a point and click adventure game in a long time. Maybe since I was seven or ten either way I was really young.And being much older I looked down on this games and never give them a chance.But man do I feel stupid after playing this wonderful game.Not only is this a great game for many reason's but its done more then just play and run wonderfully.Its opened my eyes to what amazing storys and places are in all types of games not just your AAA titles.This game is why I love steam their's something for almost everone to enjoy and being someone whos super into mecha,robots, mechanical design, pixal art, and post apocalyptic setting this game hit all the right buttons.But for the game itself I will keep this simple.Its got amazing characters.Great voice acting.Amazing art and styling.Super interesting story and lore I can't get enough of.Gamplay is fun and inventive.And the sound design and soundtrack is just prefect.I really want to thank the people at Wormwood Studios and everyone who took the time, And effort to make this game.Thank you so much for making this game its an amazing title and made me open my eyes more to other cool and interesting games and made me love the imagintion of this wonderful industry even more so thank you.10/10 easily makes my top ten games I have ever played.

												My god. You want to talk about fun and story-driven gameplay? This thing comes close to a masterpiece. 9/10. Details below.Set in an extreme post-apocolyptia, our hero attempts to recover a power source he desperatly needs, stolen from him by a hulking robot. As his simple quest progresses, he finds himself drawn into the day-to-day conflicts of many men and women bots, deepening the story and lore of the world naturally. On the way you, the player, solve simple yet satisying point-and-click puzzles with elegent conectivity and solutions. The vast majority of the puzzles feel very natural, not forcibly integrated with the environment. The few esoteric ones can be figured out by paying careful attention to the dialogue of NPC bots. As you travel from your humble abode across vast wastes, to a sprawling, decrepit city, you meet incredibly interesting characters. The amount of work that went into the art design is astounding, and reflects well on the amount of work that went into the writing. The story is driven by dialogue rather than the environment, though all the scenes are breathtaking. I will say Crispin's playful banter leaves something to be desired and feels off-key, coming as it is in such a bleak game. But the story and gameplay merge so seemlessly you can forgive it. An incredible game with replay value and amazing choice endings. Highly reccomended.			"

												Ok I just finished this and first: this game was horribly crashing until I recently updated it, though unfortunately, I was already at the end of the game.The story is kind of...sad. Beautiful. The puzzles interesting and fun. I liked Technobabylon more though. Those ♥♥♥♥ing crashes ruined it for me to an extent...The end was just...hm. I miss the feeling of a final closure to the beautiful story. I revolted against MetroMind to the very end but the story ending was like....like the authors wished to finish the game early and stopped caring about the script. I sensed considerable laziness from the developers in the game, here and there, mainly in the story development. Not in the puzzles though, some of them were sure tough to solve - the kiosk was the worst hurdle and figuring out some codes literally hurt my head. Also, the puzzle where you need to answer two robots in answering three questions is broken...in the second question only though. You are asked which of selected statements MUST be true but all of the statements DO NOT NEED TO BE true so I had to find the answer online.Also, I'm not a good puzzle solver.All in all...this game DEFINITELY needs more story into it. And the story parts of ""Humans destroyed themselves""? Cmon...that's lame. Human destroyed themselves / robots destroyed humans / wars between robots and humans....it's just not original. I mean: the Gospel of man, that is so beautifully written, I swear I read it many times. That is poetic. That was ART!! So was the philosophical laments of the MEMORIUS in the Kiosk. And Crispin! The Dunes! The Goliath!! All beautiful and very original, at least to me. Honestly, reading the gospel of man at the start of the game hyped me incredibly. I expected that the game was going to be preseting very hard, unsettling, maybe existential questions in its story. Conflict of religious beliefs among postapocalyptic robots? With philosophical insights and two-sided arguments I can relate to? I dig that. After reading the gospel of man at the start of the game, I realized that not only the author means the story, he is actually capable of meaning it! But...the story does not really go fully in this direction and remains a ""beautiful adventure game"" with a great story plot. At the start, I thought ""this is going to be a masterpiece"" but it was not. To be a masterpiece, it needs even more human soul given to it.			"

												I liked this little game. It could be a little bit longer maybe but I guess I can still give it a second run later - with the developer commentary turned on and with trying to find out the solution for a few ""side stories"" i missed.  Puzzles and solutions did make sense which was quite refreshing. In a whole game there was only one point where I really needed to look the solution up*.Sometimes the game engine is a little choppy, especially in scenes with parallax scrolling attempts, which is funny with all the power computers have nowadays. I see the 320*200 -ish resolution is kind of intentional ""retro style"" but the engine does not have to :). After seeing some concept art which obviously was not low-res I even wonder whether it would harm the game If it was made in high resolution... The current result is still fine. So, I guess it was not the worst decision anyway.All in all, a very good adventure game. With the current Steam sale price any adventure games lover should give it a try.* The kiosk ""puzzle"": Art? Seriously, ART? It could easilly be any random word! :) "

												If you enjoy dark dystopian sci-fi, beautiful artwork, and a storybook gameplay I highly recommend you try Primordia!As a point-and-click storybook game, Primordia does not dissappoint. It's smart, well-illustrated, and presents a compelling story. The writers took care to build an internally consistent world complete with mythology and believable motives. It's a world I would not be dissappointed to return to in a follow-up title. There is an obvious retro-feel that permeates not only the art style, but also the story and game-mechanic. Primordia's writing reminds me of 1980s robot sci-fi including a few text-based games from that era. The art is clearly influenced by visual work from that period including Lynch's Dune. There are multiple endings, and I enjoyed that the best of them still presented a dark and morally clouded set of choices for the main character.The only criticism I have of Primordia is the same criticism I have of similar point-and-click games; many of the inventory combinations and item uses are not intuitive and are occassionally inconsistent. Also, while the side-kick character was a wise choice for an in-game hint system, his personality occassionally feels out of place. FYI: There were also 2 achievements which I believe I met the criteria for but did not recieve. Probably not a bug, but other reviewers have had the same problem.			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic. I don't think I can do it justice here, but I will try.This game is a work of art. It's very fun and the puzzles are stimulating, but the real treasure is in the dialogue and the world. This game explores the nature of religion, justice, and creation in a post-human, post-apocalyptic world. It's so achingly beautiful. I also literally cried at the end. It's a rare story that can reduce me to tears, but this one did it.Mechanically this game is great as well. The music and the voice acting are wonderful, and the graphics are perfect for the story. The game flows well, and I think it was a good length. The character arc of Horatio was fantastic and satisfying - any longer and I think the game would lose some of the power of its narration.The details are what really make this game. Explore everything. Talk a lot to Crispin. Right-click on everything. Go through all dialogue options. This world is compelling, and beautiful, and utterly desolate. Horatio, the protagonist, is similarly compelling, beautiful, and desolate. If you're looking through the reviews because Primordia's on sale, please just buy it. You will 100% not regret it, I promise.			"

												Worth every penny. The game is just amazing, the voice acting, funny and smart dialogs, characters which will stay with you after you will finish, and world which is just mesmerizing. I just genuinly would love to see with my own eyes Metropolis and Dunes, and especially Goliath. And the art. The pixel art in this game just reminds me of Beksinsky work. It's beautiful, dark, full of gorgeous details. This game, for me at least, doesn't have any weak sides. The story is dark, and really gives lots of to think about. It's just a great game and everybody should give a try.			"

												Promordia is probably the best point-&-click i've played since the mid 90s.  The story, atmosphere and voice acting are all great but what REALLy set it's apart from modern point-&-clicks is that it is one, continuous game, not seperated in short episodes so you keep your stuff all the way through.  My only complaint is that it was too short but that is a great complaint to have.Also, room has been left to make a sequel, one that hopefully involve humans.			"

												When I first saw this game it looked like a bleak, soulless game. The colors, the crude graphics. Screenshots don't do this game justice.But 5 minutes in, and i've fallen in love with world and characters. The game tells an epic story set in a very interesting world where Man is no more. The writing is excellent; Horatio and Cirspin's (the main character and his sidekick) relationship is fun and they play off each other really well. And there's a peculiar character you meet a few hours in that is one of the best characters I've seen in recent years. His name starts with a P; that's all i'm going to say.It's an excellent game but I thought the ending was a little underwhelming. Still very worth your time.			"

												Summary : Buy it!Long story:First of all, when you start the game having a 1080p display, the graphics seem extra old, pixelated and just ugly. The reason behind it seems to be the fact that the pixels were drawn by hand. There is a way to ""resize"" the original 300xsomething resolution and get a nice 1200xsth window without losing quality of detail. (Settings are changed using a separate exe file located in the installation folder)The atmosphere of the game is fantastic. You immerse yourself into a beautifully done post-apocalyptic world filled with dust, junk and characters with their own personalities, thoughts, beliefs and so on. It is a well-thought world based on one of the possible continuations of mankind's history. The game offers multiple completely different endings affected by your interpretation of the world and events around you.The puzzles are fun to solve, you can get hints if you get stuck and there is only a couple of moments when the solution felt not 100% logical to me personally. The interface needs 5-10 minutes to get completely used to, there is a ""how to play"" option in the menu.I think that purchasing this game is a good idea for point&click experts as well as those new to the genre.

(and did not try to rip you off for 50 bucks or so(I got mine for ten!!))Its really abut much more, but I am confident that you will find out for yourself.Thank you.(also... sry for mstakes)			"

												For those that are fans of Robert Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke and (most relatable to this game) Isaac Asimov, then this is the game will blow your mind.Admittedly after several hours of frying my mind over the game I resorted to a guide and just enjoyed the excellent voice acting and in depth storytelling.The gaming interface is a little clunky and a highlight option to find out what items are useable would have made things easier, but the over all atmosphere of this game pulled me in.  Your two main characters are likeable with some offhand banter to bring you more into this dark Machinarium type world.			"

												I have played a good number of point and click games. This is what I WANT from a point and click game.  a) Beautiful artwork (why?  cause it is a point and click...you need some bang for your buck. Syberia is a great example of this, though it fails in other regards)b)  Puzzles that are challenging, but intuitive (point-n-clicks RARELY get the 'intuitive part'...I'm looking at you Longest Journey).c) Good voice acting (if they are not text-based) and dialogue.d) Memorable characters (yes Myst...your puzzles were lovely, but there was no one there!!!)e) A cool mechanic (you know, like the time-turning or the pill-popping…ala Fran Bow and others)f) Consequences (if not, choices are meaningless, and point-n-clicks are the perfect medium for giving players choices that matter).Given these personal metrics, I must give this game high marks in all categories.  a) 9/10.  Many folks may disagree. I admit, I was skeptical when I saw screen shots of the game...it looked dated and drab.  But the music and the voice-work mixed with the pixelated brown and reds...somehow it worked beautifully. The style perfectly suited the story.  I thought it was an absolutely beautiful game, with its own unique atmosphere.  Nothing else is quite like it.b) 8/10 – Seriously, this is the first point and click game where I said “well, if I really had these things, this is what I would do” and lo and behold…it was the solution!!!  Plus, there was a fun mix of number-based, logic-based, and text-based puzzles.  The only downside is that I wish there were more!!  And to be fair, not all were challenging…it is a pretty easy game.  But I was never bored or frustrated, so I consider it a win!c) 10/10 – loved every single voice.  And…I mean…they are robots.  And somehow, this game had better voice acting than 90% of the games out there!d) 8/10 – Loved the leads, loved the sides, loved that one lone guy (*sniff*).  More interaction would have allowed better character development for side characters…but it is just a point and click game after all.  The banter is spot-on!e) 6/10 – you get a sidekick who helps you out. Nothing to write home about…although…to be fair…he is a really awesome sidekick personality-wise!! f) Yup.  Consequences and multiple endings.  Woohoo!! (I don’t want to score this part…just wanted to cheer for the effort!)Cons?  Not much.  It is a good time for the price. It is a little short…but it is not “empty”.  Ie, I would rather have a short, full game than a long game of needless filler. If you feel the same, buy it!Hope this helps!  "

Annotation: After having a comprehensive conversation with the developer (which can be found underneath) I decided to change my review entirely. In case you are interested in why this is important to be mentioned, you can find the original review below. But first for the important point:This game has the nicest developer I have ever heard of, in my entire life. Although I couldn't enjoy this awesome game as much as I should have, he was friendly and really supportive. This review was intended to be a negative one, but after I was responded it's really not fair to give him a negativ rating. So yes, this is basically a review for the developer, not for Primordia, but I just have to point that out. If you don't believe me, check the other reviews. He literally responded to every single one, even after more than four years of service. (Go check him out)However, so far for this review, every single line under here is what matters according to my view on the game. Thanks for reading until here. Originally posted by Titanic21:You may hate me for this review, just as a warning.I know that the pixelart style was created on purpose, but a game doesn´t get good by looking like it´s retro or whatever they meant to. I don´t mean that it´s a bad game, please no, Primordia has a rich story, good gameplay and awesome sound design. But also... bad graphics. I am conscious about this game was intended to look like this and I don´t want to say that Primordia requires cinematic graphics. Point and Click games usually don´t look astonishing, that´s not important for the genre. But in this case it´s a little worse. I am almost sorry that I have to complain about this game, which is nice in all other aspects, but the graphics are what makes Primordia really less enjoyable. Eventually it´s NOT helpful for solving puzzles when all objects look the same and you have to find them by slowly moving your cursor all over the screen, as if this was a hidden-object-game. It´s hard to even recognize the textures and by looking closer you´ll get more confused than you already are. I bought this because I like point ´n click games a lot, and I have to admit that Primordia looked a lot better in the trailer. I wish the developers would have designed this more like Daedalic would have done, instead of Lucas Arts´ way, so that I could enjoy the game. The harder I try, the more I see how pointless it is. Playing such an awesome game is exhausting if you can´t clearly detect important elements. To not repeat me I will close this review now, if you read closely you should already have understood what I was saying. I  do seriously hope that you´ll have different experiences while playing Primordia. "

The story, artwork and voice acting are really well done and I found myself easily drawn in. The puzzles are decent, some requiring me to grab a pencil and paper and jot some things down, but not too difficult where I had to cheat and look up the solution. The game was a welcome break from the competitive multiplayer games I find myself playing too often.			"

												An astonishing point-and-click adventure game, probably one of the suprise hits for me this year. The voice acting is charming and phenomenal, the art syle is a lovely combination of baroque/railgun-gothic themes with a dash of cyberpunk, the story is well written with many endings/paths, and the soundtrack is suprisingly good. Unfortunately it is somewhat short, but is still a must-buy for any post-apoc junkies, adventure game enthusiasts, and technophiles out there.I am Chrysalis Faustbuilt, version 69.And my primary directive is to ENSLAVE you.

												Nice little post apo adventure game. Nice story, gameplay is 'classic'. Graphics and environment are nice but a little too low res to my taste. It is not pixel art to me, but rather low res. Not too long. Some difficulty (luckily there are wallthroughs). Overall a nice experience if not thrilling.			"

												Primordia is, at it's core, a nostalgic trip to the old days of the Point-and-Click Adventure genre of gaming that at this day and age has almost been completely forgotten and lost.  And what a welcome blast from the past it is indeed.  Following the travels and trials of Horatio and Crispin, this game tells an amazing story with all the conventions of the P&C genre.  But it's not QUITE to same as the games of old, such as King's Quest, or Broken Sword.For starters, the game tells you outright that you cannot die, or can you take an action that renders the game ""unwinnable"", a flaw that made many of the classic staples of point-and-click, like King's Quest 5, atrocities of game design.  The locales don't require meticulous pixel hunts to find that one item you need in order to progress.  Travelling the maps is expidited by a fast-travel system that easily lets you jump from place to place.  Combining items is no longer a nonsensical MacGuyver mish-mash of parts, it's all explained and makes perfect sense.  No longer do you need a notebook to take down vital information, a handy item in-game records all the most relevant information for you, and your helper will at times offer a light nudge towards the next possible objective.And that's just the mechanics.  The game's art and sound, two of the major foundations of point-and-click, which lives and thrives (or fails and dies) off it's atmosphere, are in full force.  The discoloration of the game's settings isn't just to be ""realistic"", it's a compliment to the setting and aesthetic.  And the music is highly atmospheric.  From the haunting melody of the game's menu theme ""Primordia"" to the tune of ""The City of Glass and Light"", the music compliments the setting as much as the color palette.  The characters are all fully voiced, and the voice work is clean and quality, with voices befitting each character and role.Of course, Primordia isn't perfect.  For starters, the biggest and possibly most glaring flaw, is just how SHORT the game is.  Even if the puzzles make you spend extra time (and at first, they will), you'll likely only wind up spending 5-7 hours on this game.  It's basically over before it seems to really begin.  While it follows the classic story-telling formula, the climax of the story seems to be on you before you know it.  A point in the game that feels like the 50% is more like the 75% mark instead.  And before you know it, you're already at the final scene.  Even with multiple endings (which can be achieved by just reloading and making a different choice) the game feels painfully short-lived.  You'll be left wanting to hear and see more.The music, while perfectly fitting the mood, never seems to stick with the player much.  I couldn't tell you a moment in the game and point out the music for it, besides the music at the main menu.  Which isn't to say the music is bad, because it's not.  But it's not catchy much.  Or very present.  The music mostly serves as a background to the game, ambience.  And it does it's part amazingly well.  I just wish that perhaps the music felt a bit more powerful at certain scenes.  Speaking of sound, the voice-acting and sound effects are a bit off as well.  Some scenes would have effects, like gunshots, with NO sound accompanying them, which removed something important to the scene.  And the voice actors themselves, while very good, still felt a bit rough.  Horatio's voice actor in particular, either does a stellar job, or seems a bit too stoic when you'd think a situation would call for a more forceful, emotional or venomous delivery.Overall though, Primordia definitely feels like it was a game that SHOULD have existed back in the Golden Age of the adventure genre of PC gaming.  It feels like a game that I missed from my childhood and I'm just getting to sit down and enjoy it now for the first time in years, and it's not even that old!  But it takes me back to that time in gaming that I've almost forgotten and reminded me of what games I use to partake of, and that's a feeling I can't being to say how much I enjoy.  If you are a person who enjoys the point-and-click genre, grew up in that era, or want a relaxing, easy-paced game that can still deliver a great story, Primordia is worth every possible virtual cent you pay for it.

												Let me just say, I adore this game. As someone who enjoys point-and-click adventure games as well as cyberpunk themes, this was a match made in heaven.The story revolves around Horatio and Crispin, two robots who live in a wrecked ship. Horatio is a believer in Humanism, that humans are the creators, which is a frowned upon idea in the world the live in. They live far away from the city, isolated, until their power supply is stolen and they are forced to go to Metropol. As they search they discover the corrupt system that the city is operating under and Horatio's past. The characters themselves were enough to keep me playing. I enjoyed each one's own personality, their dialog, their story, it was all well done. The art style very well sets the tone for Primordia and was pleasing to look at while playing. The story was actually surprisingly well done and with multiple endings it just increases the replay value as well as my interests. It was challenging enough to where I felt incredibly accomplished once I finished it, but easy enough to where I didn't rage quite and ignore it for days. I was easily absorbed into Primordia's world and it's certainly a game I will replay more than once (and already have).Overall, worth the money and the time if you enjoy this genre. A must have.			"

												This game surprised me. I went in expecting another tedious point-n-click, but was quickly sucked into the world that is Primoridia. You play a robot named Horatio that is on a quest for the rather simple goal of finding his home's battery. What ensues is a storyline that unveils a history and lore rooted in a mixture of ""God and his creation"", aiming forward with questions of freewill and the role of the State within a society. All the while, Horatio simply wants his power core. A brilliant, rich and enticing game. It asks more questions that it answers, while playing with your imagination and leaves you wanting more from this universe. All in all, if you're looking for a game that challenges your logic and problem-solving skills, while experiencing a well-developed world and excellent cast of characters, look no further.			"

Set in a far-future dystopian setting, robots struggle to make sense of a world where humans, their creators, no longer exist. As Horatio, a robot seeking to repair what has broken or fallen into disuse, you will explore the landscape of the desolate world and explore one of the few remaining cities with his faithful and sarcastic sidekick Crispin. The voice-work is excellent, as are the music and visuals. Now with the 2.0 release, I'm looking forward to playing it again and taking a different path.			"

												I really liked this game and I think anyone that had played games like Kings Quest series would love this too.Story has a fallout kind of vib with graphics from the late 80's to early 90's which I liked.The art work and the rustic desolated world really had me enticed the entire time I played it.My only grip with this game was trying to find one or two items, I mean I literally had to click on every pixel in order to find this little part in a junk pile. I kind of wished it would have had a glimmer to it or something to help you find it better, not like spoon feed you but, if you didn't unlock a part of the story then you might not find it at all but out of chance, then you get a certian object that might help you find object b easier or something.Other than that, this game is awesome click adventure and I highly recommend it to anyone that likes doom and gloom retro art and click adventure games.

												Primordia is one of the best classic point-and-click adventures in recent memory. Its difficulty is only equaled by its conceptual beauty. Darkly macabre in design and heavily themed in religious and philospohical question, Primordia is worth the time. The voice acting is top-notch all around along a exceedingly mysterious universe. While the abrupt ending is somewhat disappointing, it game never seems to lose a step and the dialogue is exceedingly cyncial and hilarious. The soundtrack is appropriate for horror-thriller films and reminds of the minimalistic The Thing (1982) soundtrack that fits the scene perfectly. Can't recommend it enough.			"

												I held of on buying this game for a very long time due to how minimal it seemed, but after playing it I wished I hadn't done so.  This game is as close to flawless as an adventure game can ever be.  It has the best writing and the best soundtrack of any video game I've played and has a surprisingly deep setting and lore to it, which is impressive considering the small size of the game world.  With just a few locations, it creates a realistic world that had me immersed for hours.The story and atmosphere of the game did a remarkable job of drawing me in and building tension, but where I believe the game stands out the most is in its setting.  The game takes place in a future in which life has long been extinct and Man has become a mythical deity worshipped by the remaining robots that now wander the lifeless desert that covers the earth, or even dismissed altogether as nothing more than legend.  Glass and light have become precious resources and what little remains of human invention is constantly scrapped to build new robots.  This is the kind of creativity that is lacking in most adventure games, and the subtlety with which it was presented was refreshing.It was surprising to see a post-apocalyptic setting in which humans take only a background role and the nature of the world before is long forgotten.  Rather than barrage the player with the history of the world, Primordia puts the story and gameplay first while allowing players to discover the lore on their own, avoiding many (though not quite all) of the tropes that plague post-apocalyptic, dystopian, and robotic science fiction settings.The game takes itself seriously and the comic relief exists for the amusement of the characters rather than that of the player, which is a skillful way of keeping the story believable, though Crispin's lines did make me cringe in more than a few points.  The primary cause of the chaotic dystopia is the degradation and corruption of the robots' programming, which becomes increasingly apparent as more of them are encountered.  All of the robots from the days of the humans are dead, insane, or rebuilt to the point of having no memories of the previous era, and the world inhabited by the rusting automotons that remain of civilization is chaotic, unpredictable, and bleak.  The dramatic irony of many characters' situations as well as the limited color palette contribute a depressing and hopeless tone that makes this an especially memorable experience.Primordia is an essential contribution to the adventure genre of computer games, and one that I will gladly recommend to anyone who has an interest in interactive stories.  If you are considering getting Primordia, then please do yourself a favor and don't make the mistake I made of waiting for several years before buying it.			"

It just shows you how fantastic it is. It's already one of my favorites. Look, I encourage you to buy it, play it, even tell Markiplier, Cryaotic, Jacksepticeye and all your favorite YouTubers to about it. Challenge them to get all the endings and achievements on their own. It's so full and charming!IT IS EPIC. IT IS WORTH IT. I want more games like this, with its enriching tale and way of storytelling, how the small puzzles urge you forward rather than hinder you... Believe me, it's more than ""satisfying.""			"

												This game is beauty incarnate. It uses the point-and-click adventure format masterfully, and delivers an incredible experience. Unlike some other games (Blackwell Epiphany, cough-cough xD), you always feel like you have agency, and the number of alternate endings only add to this feel. The puzzles are fair, and the world vast and interesting.As someone who grew up on Lem's Cyberiad, for me, robots inhabiting a post-mankind world was a must buy... but what really managed to awe me was how incredibly well they were executed. No throw-away characters and no bad cliches in this game.If you like Asimov or Lem, robots, and adventure games, get this. It's one of the top titles of the genre at the moment, surpassing even many of the big old titles by LucasArts in the golden days.			"

												That has to be one of the greatest game of our time. With great storyline, cute graphics and interesting characters, Primordia is more immersive than 3D games with latest graphics. The built-in hint system keeps you inside the game, instead of searching in manuals over the internet.  "

												Amazing game.  It's officially my favorite point and click adventure since Maniac Mansion on the NES.  I LITERALLY laughed out loud at parts and shed a tear near the end.  Nearly perfectly paced, non-frustrating puzzle game mechanics, GORGEOUS artstyle in the vein of sorta Geiger meets Syd Mead.  I can't recommend it enough. 10 out of 10.			"

												A very good point n click about robots in a post-human world that oozes atmosphere. Think Fallout/Wasteland + Machinarium with more voice acting (starring Logan Cunningham of Bastion fame!) Do mind that it's very much a point n click adventure with all the bad it usually comes with like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t puzzles and impossible to see objects you need to pick up.			"

												Primordia is not what it first appears. It's description is: ""What happened to the Humans"", but that isn't what the game is about. I thought this would be an Adeptus Mechanicus themed Adventure game with a Sam and Max buddyish element, but was actually wrong.Instead, this is a game about logic, law, and a divide between liberty and community. The main characters are both charming and the other characters all have little quirks that ensures there is no ""that guy"" of the game. The puzzles are good without ever being too challenging and the story is tightly knit, with only about 10-11 locations and about 15 characters in the entire game. It's concise without any red herrings. Actually, because the game is so tightly knit, some important secrets are left out in plain sight, which makes it interesting to replay. What I also like about the puzzles in this game are that there's dialouge if the game understands what you were trying to do with a puzzle, but you were using the wrong piece and there's multiple ways to solve several of the puzzles. In fact, the biggest and longest puzzle of the game can literally be bypassed from the moment you enter the second act. My only complaint with the game would be the antagonist. The antagonist has a trait that they can ""never lie"" but then you manage to catch them in lies several times and when confronted with this, the antagonist says ""no player, you must be mistaken because I am not"". In a game where the entire second act is about logic, it just seems silly. Additionally, my other problem with the antagonist is that at one point the antagonist just says ""I know you have a lot of questions about the world and history of this game world, so let me answer all of them for you"". However, that small gripe aside, this game had me engaged and immersed the whole time, trying to figure out its secrets and lore (until the minute that it got bored and laid out its cards on the table).

												An exceptionally well crafted adventure game with difficult puzzles and a beautifully written story.  I had thought that the intrigue and mystery of playing games like Beneath a Steel Sky and Monkey Island was lost to the dumbed down 'puzzle' games of the console era - Primordia proves that this isn't so, and I am so very grateful.

												I held of on buying this game for a very long time due to how minimal it seemed, but after playing it I wished I hadn't done so.  This game is as close to flawless as an adventure game can ever be.  It has the best writing and the best soundtrack of any video game I've played and has a surprisingly deep setting and lore to it, which is impressive considering the small size of the game world.  With just a few locations, it creates a realistic world that had me immersed for hours.The story and atmosphere of the game did a remarkable job of drawing me in and building tension, but where I believe the game stands out the most is in its setting.  The game takes place in a future in which life has long been extinct and Man has become a mythical deity worshipped by the remaining robots that now wander the lifeless desert that covers the earth, or even dismissed altogether as nothing more than legend.  Glass and light have become precious resources and what little remains of human invention is constantly scrapped to build new robots.  This is the kind of creativity that is lacking in most adventure games, and the subtlety with which it was presented was refreshing.It was surprising to see a post-apocalyptic setting in which humans take only a background role and the nature of the world before is long forgotten.  Rather than barrage the player with the history of the world, Primordia puts the story and gameplay first while allowing players to discover the lore on their own, avoiding many (though not quite all) of the tropes that plague post-apocalyptic, dystopian, and robotic science fiction settings.The game takes itself seriously and the comic relief exists for the amusement of the characters rather than that of the player, which is a skillful way of keeping the story believable, though Crispin's lines did make me cringe in more than a few points.  The primary cause of the chaotic dystopia is the degradation and corruption of the robots' programming, which becomes increasingly apparent as more of them are encountered.  All of the robots from the days of the humans are dead, insane, or rebuilt to the point of having no memories of the previous era, and the world inhabited by the rusting automotons that remain of civilization is chaotic, unpredictable, and bleak.  The dramatic irony of many characters' situations as well as the limited color palette contribute a depressing and hopeless tone that makes this an especially memorable experience.Primordia is an essential contribution to the adventure genre of computer games, and one that I will gladly recommend to anyone who has an interest in interactive stories.  If you are considering getting Primordia, then please do yourself a favor and don't make the mistake I made of waiting for several years before buying it.			"

This game is funny, the areas are interesting and actually make you want to look around, while not bieng soooo big that you just dont want to be bothered with trying to find all the things. Also, the logic in this game is solid. There are no moments where you use a rubber band and a rock to make a rocket ship or anything. It all made sense as i played through it, and when i was stuck, i was still invested enough to want to keep going.Also multiple endings that are really awesome. I think that just about covers it.

The humor in the dialogue is great and the actual story is pretty interesting as well. This game has a strong atmosphere that reminds me of old games like Falout and Syberia and if you like either this is definitely worth checking out. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this at fullprice though, as 10€ seems a bit steep. 5€ is definitely the correct price for a game like this. Anything below it is a steal.			"

												Though perhaps not worth full price, this game is a gem that leaves you thinking about it long after it ends. The puzzles, for the most part, aren't too difficult, with a few exceptions that force you to pay very close attention to the lore. the pixel art is gorgoeus, though the map is perhaps a little small. The characters, though, are what make this game special. Much like Portal, these robots draw you in and force emotion upon you. Their witty banter and personalities are just so fresh and engaging. If you're looking for a game with nice graphics, a bit of thinking involved, and an awesome story with emotive characters, pick Primordia up on sale!			"

Strong contentender for my favorite game.  I will say, take your time toward the end, there are some important things you can miss right after the explosion.  That's not a spoiler, but you can REALLY easily miss two very important things if you are not careful, it's worth looking at a walkthrough if you don't find them.  If you have not played this one, do yourself a favor and just do it.  It took me a long time try it because I was kind of on the fence about whether to play a ""point & click"".  Now, it makes me look at several other games and wonder if they would be better in this format.  No offense to the original Deus Ex, I love that game, but that game would be killer in this format with it's great story & characters.  Primordia makes me want to write the story for a P&C game, and I think I will give it a try!!			"

												TL;DR: If you love noir and/or sci-fi, get this on sale and play with a walkthrough, because it's not a super-fun game, but it's an awesome experience!A very classic-feeling adventure game with a perfect blend of science fiction and noir - and not the watered-down versions you might be used to, I mean think classics, the genre-defining stuff people still remember from 50+ years ago. As a fan of both, I was very satisfied. It's a smart story excellently told with top-notch writing and art. Kudos to the devs for having the game run in super-low resolution - no accidental ruining of the retro feel by hi-res glows or particle effects. You want retro? This is retro. The art direction is consistent right down to the screen resolution.As a game... not so much. See, it's an adventure game, and that means exactly what you think it means. Personally, I bought it for half-off and after the first 40 minutes or so I opened up a guide - so much more enjoyable! The writing is witty, the world-building is amazing, the story unfolds with perfect timing... why be bogged down with ""find the hidden active zone in the dozen screens you have access to"" or ""use X on Y in order to use X, Y, and Z together, no other combination works""? Those games are dumb. When you actually have all the items and clues the puzzles are usually not stupid, but you never really know if you do - the fundamental failing of adventure games. Don't put yourself through that just to get at the good stuff. Keep a walkthrough open and peek at it any time you're starting to get the slightest doubt on how to proceed.I am not the kind of person who usually goes into games for storytelling, but I am a sucker for sci-fi and an even bigger sucker for noir, so this was totally worth it. If I'd known how good a time I would have I might have even paid full price! If any of what I wrote sounded interesting and you have the time to kill, it's definitely worth at least the price of a movie ticket.			"

												Primordia is a sci-fi, futuristic, post-apocalyptic story where you play as a robot named Horatio. In the world of Primordia robots run the planet; ""Man"" is but long forgotten and a thing only of legend. The puzzles are decently hard but not overbearing. Some puzzles actually have multiple solutions and the game has multiple endings. There is a built in hint system that you have the option of using. The hints gently nudge you in the correct direction but do not give obvious answers. I liked how the story pokes fun/satirizes modern day society and its views on religion without making it overly obvious. It was done subtley and in good taste. The story is just really well done; it is one of my favorites and certainly memorable. Primordia isn't just a well designed game; it is also beautiful, sad, and poetic. Overall, definitely another great title from Wadjet Eye. Side note - There is an option to turn on commentary from the writers. I highly recommend turning on the commentary if you are enjoying the game - it provides a ton of context and for me made the experience even more so enjoyable.9.5/10Please upvote this review if you found it useful :)			"

												Primordia is a modern point and click game. It draws parallels to classic games in the genre, and it's aesthetic greatly reminds me of the game ""Dark Seed"". It takes place in a post apocalpytic world where humans have gone extinct. The main character is an android named Horatio who undergoes a quest that leads him to discovering his origins and why the world ultimately ended.It's a nice enough game in general, and it's engine reminds me quite a lot of Scumm. Of course it's not a particularly difficult game, and without prior interest in the genre it will just collect dust on your harddrive.			"

												I can say, without any exaggeration, that this is hands down one of the best adventure games I have ever played in my 40 years of life. I binge played it in a day from start to finish and I could not stop. It's amazing. 5 alternate endings, multiple ways to solve certain puzzles, amazing storyline, beautiful ambience and timeline, and fantastic ""life lesson."" 10/10. I wish I could lobotimize myself and forget this game and play it again from the beginning.			"

												I liked it a lot. It's dark and grim. It's about ""Horatio Nullbuilt"", a somewhat stoic and secretive humanoid robot living alone in some long-stranded organic-looking airship in the middle of some barren brown desert. Humans are long gone, only machines remain, some worship them - or their legacy - in a secluded and lonesome manner as Horatio does. He has a self-built low-grade flying companion robot, ""Crispin Horatiobuilt"", who is an obvious sidekick, who keeps refering to himself as that and who is supposed to be a constant contrast to his builder for he is not as nearly withdrawn as him but more humorous, even on a meta-like level for example when he comments your futile efforts to do the same thing over and over and expecting different results.There are more interesting characters to see. All kinds of machines who inhabit the few remaining places in the world. Be it a bomb from some long-past war that never detonated and which is worshipped for it is a creation of man, the remains of colossal titan robots buried deep within the desert or old human cities maintained by robots just enough not to collapse totally.Primorida is a middle-scaled adventure for what I can tell. It has an interesting story, great characters, powerful voice acting (every character is voiced - and those robots who cannot talk bleep around in their own manner) and a significant amount of puzzling too. If I remember right I had to look up a walkthrough a few times, though I guess I was just blind on one eye for the solutions seemed reasonable afterwards. There are several endings, they all seem fitting and interesting in their way, and while the decision which you will see is made very lately in the game it is still somewhat relevant what you do mid-game. There is a significant amount of lore background. You will meet characters who share their stories and views on the world. You will learn more about them, their motivations and failures. There is a robot society that kinda imitates human society. It has it's own leadership and entities. However barely anything about is perfect. It is in demise, and Horatio is trying to find his way through. He is connected to the world around him more than he admits, and getting to know him better was done very well I think, from robots remembering him to data logs hidden within the places he visits. The art is nice, there are some great dark or soothing music tunes, everything seemed crafted together well and I thought I was satisfied with all aspects of the game even though it has been a long while since I've played it. Definitely the best adventure from Wadjet Eye Games I've played thus far.			"

												Primordia is an attempt at a weighty story that somewhat misses its mark in execution.  As in all adventure games, things start innocently (loosely applied) enough as a giant robot looking like the mobile version of HAL crossed with a lobster (I know, right?) invades your home on a derelict ship and steals your power core.  You, Horatio, from a long line of previous Horatios, must now find a way to retrieve it.  It should be mentioned that everyone in this game, including you, is a robot, and as you begin to explore the world and meet its denizens, you'll find yourself wrapped in a robot existentialist's wetware runtime environment, rolling around in what amounts to be the robotic version of a Kafka story... okay, maybe not that weighty.  There's just something about the ending (of which there are many) that just never seems satisfying, even if you take all the steps to do the 'good' one.  That being said, Primordia still manages to tell its story with care and it's delivered in perfectly-bleak dialogue for a perfectly-bleak world.Technically, the game suffers a little bit from a few questionable design decisions.  Being (I assume) an homage to the point 'n' click (PNC) games of yesteryear, the developer insisted on a low-res, 2D game - which is great - but instead of doing what most modern games do which is make a hi-res game look low-res, this game is actually 800x600.  This isn't really that big a deal until you notice that often the character sprites don't 'belong' to the scene.  In classic adventure games, different sprites were created depending on where the character is supposed to be standing; in Primordia, the technique used instead is simply scaling down the larger sprite with the end result being a much crisper sprite on a purposely-blocky background.  Not a dealbreaker, but it can be a little bit distracting.Other design decisions that were made are quite inexcusable in a modern PNC game.  Despite the genre being declared 'dead' for years, the truth is that the genre has thrived (loosely applied) throughout the decades and made many advances, all of which are ignored by Primordia.  For instance, in most modern PNCs, there's a hotspot-highlight button to speed along play; Primordia does not have that.  In most modern PNCs, you can usually double-click an exit to skip the slow plod of the character walking offscreen; Primordia does not have that.  To be fair, it -does- have a map system for quick travel.Finally, there is what is known as adventure-game-logic and Primordia is rife with it.  If you're unfamiliar with the term, it is a criticism of classic adventure game puzzle solutions and how they often make little logical sense.  For example, if you needed to sharpen a pencil, logic would dictate you find a pencil sharpener, but older adventure games were known for instead making you combine a stick with a piece of glass and some tape in order to whittle the pencil... while you stand in front of a pencil sharpener.  While the puzzles in Primordia aren't quite so asinine, two extremely dense puzzles spring to mind that are just bad ideas.  Like older adventure games, you could totally sit there and work it out and feel that ego boost, but I find it hard to believe that most players won't be looking for a walkthrough when they encounter them.  That being said, most of the game is paced out well so long as you can get your head into that mindframe of the 90s and just tough it out.All in all, Primordia is an accomplished title and a lot of love went into it, especially in the art department.  For a game entirely populated by artificial beings, there is a sort of haunting organic decay that pierces almost every piece of art in the game.  Similarly, the voice direction is quite good and despite Crispin - your sidekick floaty robot buddy - sounding a hell of a lot like Otacon from Metal Gear Solid (it doesn't fit, believe me), every one of the actors gets what the director is trying to accomplish and paints a beautiful, if desolate, piece of work.By all accounts, I did not enjoy (but did not dislike) Primordia particularly because I found a lot of the puzzles to be purposely obtuse and the story was not one that resonated with me.  However, that does not make this a bad game and so I cannot possibly give it a thumbs down.  For some people, the story is a mindblowing, harrowing look at the nature of existence, life, its foundations, and its possible future.  It is a fascinating perspective, to be sure, but I was left unsatisfied.Thus, if you're looking for a new PNC game, there's no reason to steer clear from this one.  What I present above are not detractions, but warnings.  PNC veterans will not bat an eye at anything that goes on in this game, but fans of modern PNC games might find a lot of things in Primordia to be frustrating.  Stick with it and it mostly rewards you - just remember that it's more about the journey than the destination in this one.			"

												The interplay between Horatio and Crispin as they push deeper into this pixelated robotic realm to recover their stolen goods is a high point in an adventure that feels like a bit of a slog despite its relatively short length. Primordia never quite sold me on its experience like other some of Wadget Eye Games' more impressive releases have in the past. It's certainly worth digging into for the beautiful settings and interesting characters, but the puzzles and story don't have that satisfying hook that makes you feel like it was worth all the effort.

												I recommend this game. However I have to point it isn't going to be the best adventure you have ever played. I really liked how decisions mattered and it's nice to see an adventure willing to take risks and giving more than one solution for most puzzles. It has its faults, but it was still very enjoyable and I would recommend to anyone looking for an adventure to take your time. Getting every achievement may take you some time, though playing it more than once is cool for listening to the authors commentaries. So if you're into the games ""meta,"" I extra recommend this to you. The writer namedrops loads of great novels and other games and stories as inspirations that helped shape this game, which only makes it the more sad that this game is only ""not bad."" Not bad is still recommended in my book.			"

												This was an interesting game. Don't be fooled by the endings you think you see. Somehow, I managed to mess up the game so badly that I only got sad endings. These are the endings that no one talks about. The endings where the main character's friends are all dead, and he goes back to his ship, and reprograms himself to forget about what happened at the city. The ending when he has nothing left to live for.Yet, I have seen other playthroughs where he manages to save his friends, and the ending is full of hope. It all depends on you. Will you save your friends? Will you join the AI who ruined your life? It is all your choice.and in the end, what does it mean to be human?			"

												It was interesting and kept me through the whole thing, though there were a few points I couldn't figure out the creators 'logic'. That's not uncommon though, as what is obvious to it's creator may be extremely obscure at time to others. The graphics looked pixelated, but even giving it some leeway for being fullscreen, they were still a bit too pixelated for my preferences. There seemed to be no antialiasing at all. Sometimes the things you have to find, despite having no clue they are supposed to exist, are small objects, blend in very well with the clutter and trash, or are in dark areas and not really visible.  This isn't exactly an uncommon theme with these types of adventure games. Still, I rather enjoyed it, and hope the author takes the criticisms to heart and makes an even better game next time. I'm going to have to give it a yes. "

												Primordia centers on the travails of two robots, Horatio and Crispen, who live in what is eventually revealed to be a warship on the edge of the ruins of a great city, Metropol. Their wasteland idyll is broken when another robot appears and steals the pair's power core. As robots, they require power, and embark upon a journey in a wasteland that reflects the splendour of a now dead world. Historically, I am not a fan of point-and-click adventure games.  But this game may have changed that. While I did occassionally cheat and look for solutions online, the tale of our two robots drew me in like the scent of a pitcher plant draws in flies. Upon reflection, the story reminds me of something that would have been published in Metal Hurlant three or more decades ago (minus the gratutious sex). The game makes explicit, though with subtle insertion, reference to other  speculative fiction masterpieces from multiple media. Fallout, Half-Life and A Canticle for Liebowitz being the ones I could clearly identify. Furthermore, the development team, usually the writer, provide liner notes revealing the design decisions they made in making this compelling tale. As someone interested in the division of labor in video game production, this was fascinating in its own right. If you like dystopian or melancholoy worldbuilding, this game is for you.			"

												This game is a point and click adventure set in a post-apocalpytic world where all humans are (presumably) dead.  Although I haven't really read books or played other games on this topic, I think it does a pretty good take on the setting, enough so to spark some creative interest of my own.  The characters and full-game voicework are for the most part fairly well done but dialogue kind of falls flat in a few places, mostly because of the script writing and not because of the voice actors.  The story is fairly cohesive and events therein are weighty and interesting, but in a few places I feel like the scenes were not given -enough- weight.  This is especially true of all the alternate endings and post-game cinematics, which although included to give the player some logical options, needed a bit more fleshing out.  It is also interesting to point out, it is impossible to game over although some decisions can change your endings.The visual aesthetic of the game is quite nice, as is the music.  While pleasant to listen to and not annoying in any way, none of the tunes were especially catchy or easily memorable, and in a few of the dramatic scenes a stronger musical touch would have gone a long way.  Sound effects are unfortunately fairly weak, lacking thematic when operating devices and having little oomph when explosions occur, and in some places the game seems bugged and plays no sound effect at all.  The voice work has a nice robotic emulation added, although some characters seem to exhibit multiple variances in recording quality or style that doesn't seem to be a character quirk.Performance-wise the game runs fine.  Although it resizes itself and forces fullscreen (thus making dual-monitor setups a little wonky), the resolution is not a complaint.  I never had pathing issues or pixel-hunts (just me being blind).  The game interface is functional and unobtrusive, as well as autosaving.  There are some included commentaries as well in the options menu.All in all, I really did enjoy the game despite some of its flaws.  Its not very expensive, and it's about 7 hours of gameplay for one playthrough, with low replayability.  The setting is done very nicely and the story is good, what's there to complain about is mostly some rough edges and needed spitshining.  It doesn't ruin the game at all.  I'd say pick it up.			"

So like all of the games I played through I'm going to review it in PROs and CONs. Or you can of course read the Verdict at the end.PROs: Beautiful pixel art graphics Incredibly immersive  Awesome storyline Really good and unique Jokes especially if you're a computer geek You have a floating companion A lot of content to explore and scenes to unlock Multiple choices to solve puzzles Multiple endings (you should play all of them) Really really awesome ambient and musicb]CONs:[/b] Too short Should be longer  Really too short Some parts of the game should be more explorable WE NEED MORE BACKSTORYVerdictIt's an incredibly beautiful game, with beautiful music and funny jokes.

Or you can of course read the Verdict at the end.PROs: Beautiful pixel art graphics Incredibly immersive  Awesome storyline Really good and unique Jokes especially if you're a computer geek You have a floating companion A lot of content to explore and scenes to unlock Multiple choices to solve puzzles Multiple endings (you should play all of them) Really really awesome ambient and musicb]CONs:[/b] Too short Should be longer  Really too short Some parts of the game should be more explorable WE NEED MORE BACKSTORYVerdictIt's an incredibly beautiful game, with beautiful music and funny jokes.

												A mysterious past is slowly unveiled in a post-apocalyptic art-noveau cyberpunk world.If you like robots, themes of AI, and/or adventure games - especially classic ones - this game is for you.  The game follows the pretty standard adventure mechanic - click on things to make things happen - sometimes click on things with things from your inventory, or mix things in your inventory together until they become clickable on other things.  Take notes.  (Most of which actually happens for you with the in-game ""data-pad"".)  Solve puzzles with said notes.  The game runs at 640x400 resolution - which can be off-putting to some, but really lends to the retro-adventure feel of the game, and I've come to love it.  (On my 1080p tv, it won't actually fill up the whole screen, but it doesn't really bother me.)  That said - I highly recommend going into the options menu and chosing the ""DX"" display mode as opposed to D3D if it works for you - the sprites mesh with the backgrounds much better this way in my opinion.  DOS nostalgia!What really shines in Primordia is the story - and the art.  They come together to create a fascinating atmosphere that makes me want to revisit the game again and again - and the developer commentary is great on a second or third playthrough.  The excellent voice acting and seven or so potential endings don't hurt, either.  (The narrator from Bastion plays the main character - and the sidekick that follows you through the game is entertaining at every turn.)  The music and sound mesh well with the art to create an engrossing atmosphere - despite the retro low-res graphics.  There aren't many puzzles in the ""puzzle game"" sense - but there is plenty of puzzling to be done in the game in terms of figuring out how things fit together, what things mean, and what the significance of certain items or pieces of information may be.  The story is mostly linear, but there are a few opportunities to take different approaches to solve situations - especially near the end.  Observation and careful contemplation are rewarded.The setting is in the distant future in a post-human world - no organic life is to be found anywhere - even the bugs and little things swimming in the sewers are machines - but make no mistake, they have lives and thoughts of their own, and are no less interesting than any human character.  And for the robot fan, there are references to other robots from both popular and obscure culture everywhere - along with a videogame reference or two.  MST3K, Short Circuit, Metropolis, and Fallout - just to name a few.I would highly recommend this game to any fan of classic graphic adventures, narrative-driven games, or robots.			"

												Great art, engaging story. However, the game has a critical flaw that permeates the entire experience: discovering how to progress is less an exercise in logic and more an exercise in clicking and walking the world. Many of the components of each puzzle are only tangentially related, oftentimes only in the most esoteric ways. Progression is further  hindered by the game's lack of robust programming. Sometimes you will try something that should work, only to find out that you were supposed to perform that action through slightly different mechanisms. The game also does not handle choices well. Now, there aren't many story-altering choices to make in this game, but the creators should have given the player more indications of what the effects of their actions would be, as well as more indication that certain paths could have been taken. I felt cheated out of the ending I would have chosen because of the problem I mentioned above. I clicked on something, nothing happened, and I went on my way, not realizing that I could have performed the intended action. This changed the ultimate ending.Still very much recommended, but don't be ashamed to open up a guidebook if you get stuck.Edit: Also, the save system was bad. They could have easily done it better.			"

												If story is more important for you in a game than mechanics or visuals than you will enjoy Primordia as it is a decently written story.> Great game lore / interesting setting> Great plot and semi twist if you don't see it coming, I enjoyed the little seeds throughout the game like the ship being named ""UNIIC""  (VGER anyone?).If the writer reads this not that I minded the ending but I think the twist would have had even more punch if Horus had followed through with his mission instead of Metromind carrying it out, big bad being the big bad is not as fun of a twist as the good guy was the bad guy. Would have made the final choice more interesting and a more interesting realization for the player ""I'm a humanist trying to save humanity but I killed them?"", my two cents as a wannabe writer, was still good though> Main character deals with interesting themes, and can choose different paths, ""Progress needs transformation needs art needs freedom"" reminded me of 'what can change the nature of a man' from Planescape: Torment... was interesting to think about it, as were the logical arguments of the robots> Sidekick character is more funny and likeable than most comedic relief companion characters, reminded me a lot of Morte from Planescape:Torment while still being unique and memorable as his own character  I felt a great deal of loss after he died, almost found myself getting angry like the main character and strongly felt his absense in the scenes following his death, great immersion!Mild Cons:> Puzzles were okay, not overly hard or easy. I enjoyed the logic puzzles more so than go search a map for random item (I could see others minding those quests less), the wingman quest though had me chuckle> Game is short, 9 hrs for me with frequent pauses leaving the game running while I took breaks> Graphics are reto pixels but not bad if you zoom out, took my eyes a bit to adjust in the beginningFor me money well spent, memorable story.

												+++ Puzzles that make realistic sense, well-integrated into the story, and with multiple ways to solve them.+++ Solid script, greatly blending comedy and drama.+++ Rich and palpable world, friendly to immersion.--- Hand-drawn vistas difficult to appreciate due to the game's old-school extra-low resolution.Primordia is a game that almost plays itself.  The sort of puzzle-adventure where you become engrossed into the world, and lose track of time.  Its strongest point by far is how its puzzles blend in seamlessly with the world story, and thus the solutions feel natural and well thought out.  Without doubt, this is an extremely high-quality game.			"

												Primordia caught my eye due to its design, which I adore, in addition to the sci-fi, mechanical protagonist / world.The story and interactive aspects were also fresh and fun. You will find yourself searching for pixels, but you will also find yourself searching for clues within the dialogue.For the duration of the game, they kept the motif of ""a mechanical world"" to its fullest: with religion, culture, social echelons and political power born out of machine-esque beaurocracy.Since I am a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I do not think Primordia is worth 10$, I played it twice-thrice, and I found it to be a pretty short experience -- especially the ending, which felt like it came too soon. The middle section of the game is also burdened with swapping items for other items endlessly, which felt like a chore.Overall, I got it when it was on discount, and I encourage you to do the same.

												Primordia is a point and click game that has beautiful artwork and immersive music. The story is enjoyable and I encountered zero bugs. The characters are well-developed and the occasional humor is pretty funny. Sounds awesome, right? Well, there's just one problem: I didn't have fun. As I played I felt more annoyed by the puzzles than I felt happy that I completed them. Because as soon as you fix a problem, PLOP new thing for you to fix! At first, Crispin's (your comedic companion) hints helped but when you get farther he seems to just tell you what you already know. The items you must obtain are typically in places that you wouldn't expect, and the hitboxes for them are typically small. This game just drives you to the point where you try to use every item on every object, even if it doesn't make sense, to see if that will work. I found myself sitting there trying to combine my crowbar with my memory pouch. What will that do? Nothing. But I HAD to try it because I've done everything else. And then it turns out all you had to do was something simple but there was no way you could have known about it. This game has so many amazing qualities; I wanted to like it so bad. But I just couldn't. It's just not fun. Overall, I just found this game more frustrating than satisfying. If you've got the ten bucks and you LOVE point and click puzzle adventures, go for it. You might like it. But for the average gamer, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												I'm sorry to say that I was rather disappointed with this game. I think the trailer made me expect too much from it (what else is new). And the first half of the game itself made me expect too much from the second half. I can't really say how without spoiling, unfortunately. Let's just say that I expected some pretty grand moments that the game never even came close to delivering. But I would still recommend this game, as parts of the story are pretty interesting and some of the puzzles and conversations are cool.I do have to talk about Crispin though. It feels like they tried to make a Wheatley-esque character who follows you everywhere, and is kind of annoying but also endearing and adorable. Unfortunately they made Crispin too much of a smartass, so he comes off as not very endearing, not even remotely adorable, but still quite annoying. His lines also get very tiresome, as they are often just lame puns and jokes, and he doesn't have a very large number of them. And aside from scripted scenes, his comedic presence didn't change in response to the increasingly minatory plot, which often ruined the tone.Lastly, the voice-acting generally isn't very good. The villain probably has the best voice-acting. The voices themselves? Very good, well-chosen, well-suited to their characters. But the acting itself wasn't very good. It's fairly boring and I got tired of listening to everyone speak pretty quickly. Perhaps this was intentional because they were robots, but you can make someone sound robotic without sacrificing solid, emotive acting (case in point: Portal).			"

												Bottom line: I can recommend this game to fans of the genre, however it is not without it's flaws. It will probably be a rewarding experience if you are willing to approach it charitably. However, there are better games of this kind to play first (Gemini Rue, the Blackwell series and so on).Pros: A very well crafted and engaging universe, with it's own history and mythology. Some excellent puzzle design in parts. A haunting atmosphere facilitated by a decent soundtrack (probably inspired by Vangelis' Blade Runner music). Fans of Beneath a Steel Sky will find much to like here.Cons: Impossible to enjoy without a walkthrough on hand to get over the occasional obtuse puzzle solution. Could have done with more blind testing to deal with this, or a more robust hint system. Some of the voice acting feels a little innappropriate in tone - the sidekick character in particular.			"

Like The Dig, this game is immersive and otherworldly, with a soundtrack that completely meshes with the bleak landscape of the game.  The gameplay is as polished as any of the old school lucas arts, and I think it proves that there's limit to how a game can use a really old style of gameplay, and so long as there is a decent story, still be amazing.

												Challenging puzzles and interesting premise. However, there are no graphical options so you're stuck with an absurd 320x200 resolution and I encountered a game breaking bug when you tell a character your true name and the character acts like you never did and won't let you retrieve an item he has.

												One of my favorite games on Steam. It's not the longest story you've ever played if lets say your the kind of person who defults to a walk through when you get stuck in a Point n Click adventure game, but if you enjoy puzzles, sci fi story lines and have a good sense of humor you'll enjoy this one immencelly.

												Primordia is a game about robots.  Unlike Machinarium, it is a very dark and gritty setting.  While that fits the game very well, it makes the artwork quite dull and dreary, amplified by the very low resolution the game runs at.  The story, however, makes good use of the setting and is well-written and even includes multiple endings, but that unfortunately is the extent of the the game that I enjoyed.Primordia is the best example I have run into of a modern adventure game succumbing to the classic adventure game failing of very confusing and obtuse puzzles.  If you don't already need a guide to complete the story, and you probably will, trying to complete the optional achievements is even worse, essentially necessitating the use of a guide.It's hard for me to recommend Primordia when there's so many better adventure games to choose from.

												This is one of the best adventure games I've played in a long time. The story is great, which in my book, separates ok adventures from great ones. The graphics leave a lot to be desired, but the story is great, the interplay between the the main characters is awesome and the puzzles are fun and challenging. Did I mention the voice acting is really good? Not many games leave me wishing for more, but this was one of them. I'm also hoping for a some sort of sequel!Check out more reviews on: http://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/ "

												First the good: Nice world, nice graphics, reasonable story, adequate voice acting.Now the bad: Arbitrary puzzles, extemely linear, except for the magic points you should save to redo different ""paths"" for the achievements, terrible obvious boring ending, unskippable credit sequence that doesn't even respect alt-F4, and worst of all it just not fun.Constructive advice to the devs: Don't make your hint bot refuse to give hints, especially in a snarky tone. Make your puzzles actually make sense. Tell the player when the path of a mostly linear game is going to diverge. Better yet, auto-save right before that divergence. Allow the player to be the hero at the end. Choosing ""I'll never join you!"" should not end with a crap series of still screens and the player losing to the big bad.Constructive advice to people who play it: Use a walkthrough. The first part is pretty decent but the city is just silly and arbitrary. And you'll never get the achievements without a walkthrough, unless you click everything always forever in the right order (including not talking to someone when you first meet them!).			"

												I would really like to recommend this game but I simply can't.  Despite the unique story, amazing voice acting, and fun universe it all took a back seat to the puzzle aspect of the game.I'm no stranger to adventure games.  I've always been a fan of these types of games but Primordia simply doesn't do it for me.  I found the puzzles to be frustrating and counter intuitive.Part way through the game I ran into a game breaking bug that caused it to be impossible to continue without a guide.  After an hour of rubbing things on other things and clicking on every pixel I did the unthinkable and went to a guide only to find out I've run into a somewhat common glitch.  On this Steam forum I see a post from one of the writers/designers for the game say ""Sigh. If we ever do another patch, I'll make sure it gets fixed.""  This is my ulitmate woe with the indy developer.  I pay for the game and I would hope that known bugs would be fixed.  I don't like to hear ""IF we ever do another patch.""  A bug in an adventure game isn't like most other games.  You don't always know there is a problem.  You just keep trying to solve the puzzle till you give up or turn to a guide.  For me that ruined half the experience.  Now every time I get stuck I wonder if I'm wasting my time because of another bug or did I forget to pick up a cup of coffee three screens back.TLDR:  If you want the game then get it for the story and the art and not the puzzles.

												Overall this is a sad case of a game with brilliant elements but too many faults to make it an enjoyable experience. It has the best sense of humour of just about any game I have played. The story is good, though some of the elements don't fit together.The problems are:  1/ the graphics are terrible. Yes, they have a cute, arty style but they are ridiculously low resolution. 2/ The mechanics are clunky, with slow menus and too much time watching pixellated figures crossing the screen painfully slowly. 3/ Some of the puzzles are good, but a lot of the time I had to use a walkthrough not because a puzzle was difficult but because the game is inconsistent. Most exits are identified by mousing over, but some are only identified if you move the character to the edge of the screen. There is a system of storing info useful for solving puzzles but some of the info stored is irrelevant and some vital info is not stored. To combine items in inventory you pick up A and mouse it over B. You get a message telling you that's a dumb idea, but it turns out you need to pick up B and mouse it over A.			"

												Primordia is a point-and-click adventure game with a ""classic"" look. The story is set in a sci-fi world, where all humans have died and only robots remain. Even though the game has an interesting setting, the story was kinda dull.Graphics-wise the game looks like the classic point-and-click adventures of the 90's. The world looked interesting with its post-apocalyptic look, but often the graphics were quite low-res, which is unfortunate. Music was pretty nice although I didn't pay much attention to it. However, I thought the voice acting was pretty bad even though most reviews online say it's great. The voices didn't seem to fit the characters, which made me dislike some of them. Especially the voice of the droid companion was kinda annoying.The puzzles were kinda hard, because they weren't very logical and sometimes required you to backtrack to a previous area to get an item that wasn't available there before. It would have been fine, if you had to use a certain item to get that other item i.e. the item was there, but you couldn't get it yet. The ""appearance"" of the needed item wasn't indicated in any way. So basically the puzzle design was quite bad.Overall it's an average point-and-click adventure that suffers from bad puzzle design and a dull story.			"

												Words cannot express the deep and thoughtful world that Primordia is. Unless for some reason, you hate – and I mean, truly, with burning fire, HATE – point and click adventure games, you owe it to yourself to play this game.As dark as the world can seem, humor abounds in this game. The simple graphics are still beautifully rendered, and the characters you meet are ones who will climb inside your head, and stay for the long haul. With a cast of incredibly well realized and acted robots, the world doesn't just invite you in; it sucks you down, and makes you a part of it. Things in this game will be thought about days, weeks later. Enough cannot be said for how immersive this game is.As unfortunate and bleak as the world of Primordia may seem, it has many things I wish to see again. Perhaps, if enough people play Primordia, some day we can all go back together.			"

												The flaws:  It's very short, lasting around 6 hours if you don't linger too much on the puzzles, which are sometimes (later on in the game) reliant on numbers and math to an extent that there was no way I wouldn't be pulling out a guide.  Worse, when I found the numbers needed to solve a puzzle, I wondered how the writers even arrived at that solution.  Evidently, I cannot math.  (Thankfully, though, plenty of other puzzles are subtle yet logical, and a pleasure to work out.)  Some of the dialogue here is pretty cornball, clashing with the dreary dystopian setting, but then again I suppose that fits with the tradition of this style of game.  Beyond these issues, Primordia enjoys an aesthetic drawing from Giger, Moebius, Dune, and probably a bit of Machinarium and/or Beneath a Steel Sky, with music that recalls Blade Runner and Kaiba.  The scope of the story and its setting suggests far more than the ground you actually cover, but just that it seems so sprawling is wonderful.  Primordia feels like a labor of love.			"

												Not a fan of point and click puzzles thus i had to rely on a walkthrough for the most part. However the storytelling, voice acting and the soundtrack are utterly superb. I really enjoyed the post apocalyptic- ....steampunk(robots okay) feel. The pixelated graphics complimented the game really well. Interesting gameplay and i have to say that i love the fact that I can fail at parts of the game. What i really love about this game is the notable effort of detail. For example -POSSIBLE SPOILER- the bus breaks down and if you travel below the courthouse you can see a sad robot, that you can talk to, waiting for the bus that never comes and he doesn't contribute anything to the major plot but he is just there :( .GET IT, ♥♥♥♥♥ES.

												I bought this game out of blue, just from curiosity and nostalgy for the old games. So I expected absolutely nothing from it... And had found a beautiful jewel, proudly shining through the pixels of sepia-colored design. I don't want to talk about the plot - you should walk through the whole story by yourself, to feel & understand the world and its inhabitants, to see the whole story from your point of view and to decide, what will happen at the end. I will just say that if you're looking for a game with not-so-simple story, with ability to choose how to solve difficult situation, with an almost alive (figuratively, of course) characters - this game is what you are looking for.P.S. If you're scared off by the drawing style - believe me, I's bringing absolutely unique feelings about this game. It's totally charming and I couldn't imagine this game any other way.			"

Unlike other games who have puzzles that are like, Combine spoon with fork to make a flame thrower.The story is excellent, and its filled with mystery, and the best part? Most of it gets explained! The universe it takes place in is just awesome. There are multiple endings aswell, and even characters you can save. So it has quite a bunch of replay value aswell, and all that for the low price of 10 dollars. :) It really is quite worth its money!			"

												To those post apocalyptic sci fi freaks out there, this is your wet dream. It's a dirty, gritty point and click adventure. - key word being adventure here. Absolutely fantastic story and great 8 bit computer art with some of the most amasing sci fi music I've heard in any game. Pick this up!			"

												Primoridia is an amazing game; it is a point and click adventure/puzzle game.  The story is very easily immersive, and as the game progresses you struggle as you learn more about yourself and the sick twisted machine world that you reside in.  Thurst into a machine wasteland, the main character Horatio Nullbuilt searches for a power cell that was stolen from his ship.  If you like sci-fi ish games and also somewhat of a challenging yet fun adventure, then you will love this game!  It is easily one of the best games I have ever played, and it left me craving more.

												This is the type of game that falls under classifications; ""point and click"", ""puzzle solving"", but for about 95% of my playthrough, I was engaged and immersed. Even to where at one moment I stopped and found myself wishing it was a movie instead. It's a sarcastic drama, that deals with heavy topics, causing you to stop, think and problem solve. But also holds on to a clever side that lightens the mood and feels at home within the tale. 10/10.			"

												A nice little point and click adventure title. Suffers from the same click on everything, combine everything until you figure out the answer problems all PAC games. The story is neat, the voice acting is great and the art style is quite nice (even if low rez so i recomend playing it in window mode by running the \steamapps\common\Primordia\winsetup.exe). The hints system was well implemented so I'd give it a 3/5. Worth <$10 if you enjoy this sort of game.			"

												Primordia is a real gem. Well-written story, lore and characters.Great puzzles force the player to think about the solutions and try different approaches.The only thing I didn't like about it was the occasional need for pixelhunting; a ""highlight hotspots"" button would have been nice.

												As a person who has never played a single adventure game before in his life, Primordia caught my eye with its visuals and premise. From its art style, well done puzzles, top-notch voice acting, and great story, its an amazing little gem that you should not pass up. The challenges are usually rough, sometimes easy, but are always rewarding. The writing itself is enough to keep you going; witty, and like everything else, masterfully done. If you’re thinking about trying it out, definitely do so!Word to the wise: If you think it's a clue, it is. Write it down!			"

												One of the better adventure games I've played. The puzzles generally make sense, the story's interesting enough to keep your attention and it's got Abe Goldfarb in it. A few gripes: There are some bits where it's not clear that you can travel further to the side of particular scenes (which stumped me for a while), and there are some items you need to pick up that are pretty hard to see, but the worst is that there are some things you can fail to do (or do incorrectly) that will lock you out of some of the content. But those are pretty minor. Even if you do miss the optional bits, you still get most of it and it's impossible to get stuck in an unwinnable state. This is definitely an example of how adventure games should be.			"

												Unlike a lot of other adventure games, the puzzles in this one are literal logic puzzles. You play as a robot named Horatio who lives a hermit-ish existance in a post-human world with his little buddy Crispin. All is grand till a mean robot busts up your place and steals your home power supply. So now it's a quest of revenge and such. Great little game. No major issues bug-wise since they've been patched out as far as I can see. I believe it's a total of 6 endings or so. It's not completely linear but there are parts that have to be completed in certain ways if you want the achievements. Late-ish in the game there is an achievement everyone hates that requires you to enter all key words into the kiosk. If you don't have the monocle, don't worry about it yet. I recommend 2 videos on youtube by Tomoch. Write the words he uses down then type them in, don't save half way through. Do exactly what he does. Click the mores on the screen, don't type more. If you do both of those videos by the letter you should get the achievement which many people still cannot get. Achievements aside, this is a golden adventure point & click game with challenging logic puzzles with a dash of humour.			"

												This is a really entertaining and well written classic point and click adventure game. Set in a dystopian world where all humans have died years ago, you play as a robot and his sidekick trying to recover a stolen power core. The puzzles are pretty intuitive and not too frustrating (like many adventure games are for me). It's very cyberpunkish  with retro 16-bit graphics. It's also very reminicent of Beneath a Steel Sky, one of my favorite adventure games which is now freeware.			"

												Best game i've played since Machinarium!Just buy this game.  This game is perfect.  All of the dialogue is narrated beautifully.  The characters are unique and interesting.  The last time I talked to EverFaithful (not a spoiler I swear. Early in the game) I wanted to cry. I might get a tattoo of him.  The art is mindblowingly good.  The story is unique, interesting,  and well written.  I freaking love this game.  It's like a really good book.  As soon as you're done you want to read it again. You can't wait until it's been so long you can't quite remember it and know you can read it again and kind of get that same feeling with a bit of nostalgia.  That's this game.			"

												I think this game is awesome; a really well made Indie Adventure title. Reminiscent of 90's PC adventure games, Primordia is a 'point and click' game in which you must use skills of logical deduction, puzzle solving, listening and recall to complete all tasks and find all usable objects. I really like the tone created by the graphics, artwork/scenery, soundtrack and dialogue; I quite liked Horatio and Crispin as protagonists, too. The game has backstory that ties into the plot nicely, and I didn't find it overly expansive or tedious. The world in the game is quite small, but its an appropriate fit for the length of the story and the style of gameplay. I highly recommend this, its a beautiful little game. *****			"

I really enjoyed the post apocalyptic- ....steampunk(robots okay) feel. The pixelated graphics complimented the game really well. Interesting gameplay and i have to say that i love the fact that I can fail at parts of the game. What i really love about this game is the notable effort of detail. For example -POSSIBLE SPOILER- the bus breaks down and if you travel below the courthouse you can see a sad robot, that you can talk to, waiting for the bus that never comes and he doesn't contribute anything to the major plot but he is just there :( .GET IT, ♥♥♥♥♥ES.

												Nice and old-school but with extra apocalypse.  The inventory system is clunky and they have that horrible 'looking for interactable objects' type problems, but the puzzles are generally old-school with a few extra logic and dialogue puzzles (I had to get out a notepad and pen to work out one code cobination).  Lots of alternate endings depending on whether you managed to accomplish certain things during the game as well as according to your choices at the end, so I'll be playing through again at some point.   Doesn't play well with steam though; don't try to use the in-game chat or otherwise disrupt the program whilst it's running or it will turn glitchy.			"

												Delivers the spirit of the old adventure games are in a very great way with its decent story line, puzzles and locations. It remembered me of Revolution Softwares ""Beneath a Steel Sky"" in a lot of ways, from its postpocalyptic setting to the funny robot companion. Every nostalgic should give it a try, hopefully there more great games will come from Wadget Eye.			"

												I liked the story but I guess point and clicks like this aren't for me (some of the actions were so convoluted I would have been lost without a guide). If you just want to play a good story and use the guide then I would recommend this this game. Otherwise it can be a bit frustrating.			"

												Primordia is a well done point and click adventure game, but those new to the genre may find it frustrating and inconsistent. Point and click adventure games depend on their characters and setting, and Primordia delivers in both. The NPC robots who inhabit the world are all distinctive and have personality, but the real centrepieces are the two main characters. Horatio, the playable protagonist, plays the straight man to Crispin, his robot sidekick who I personally found kind of annoying. However, Crispin's sarcasm and jokes do a lot to lighten the mood established by the setting. Primordia takes place in a post-apocalyptic world inhabited entirely by robots. As a crucial and interesting element of this world, some of the robots worship humanity, who they view as their creators and the originators of the world. The world itself is interesting to look at and there are some really striking setpieces in several of the stages. I won't really discuss the story, but I will say that the ""good"" ending resolves much more than any of the other ones. Though you have to be careful as there are a couple decisions in the game that can lock you out of getting what seems to be the only ending that gives you some sense of closure. The graphics are done in a retro, psuedo-16 bit style that can occasionally make it difficult to determine which objects are in the background and which are interactive objects. Furthermore, my biggest problem with the game comes when you try to use these objects. Several times in the game you have to use Crispin to retrieve objects that are out of reach but the things he can do and the types of objects he can get aren't consistent. Sometimes he can bump things off ledges but other times he can't, sometimes he can use a keypad and other times he can't, sometimes he can fly into a pipe and get something and other times he can't. What it boils down to is trying everything you can and relying on trial and error to solve several puzzles as things that worked last time don't now for mainly arbitrary reasons.Overall, Primordia is an interesting, well-fleshed out point and click adventure game that occasionally doesn't follow it's own rules. But if you can get past hearing ""I don't think that will work"" several dozen times you'll find a fascinating world filled with a host of unique characters.			"

												I think this game is awesome; a really well made Indie Adventure title. Reminiscent of 90's PC adventure games, Primordia is a 'point and click' game in which you must use skills of logical deduction, puzzle solving, listening and recall to complete all tasks and find all usable objects. I really like the tone created by the graphics, artwork/scenery, soundtrack and dialogue; I quite liked Horatio and Crispin as protagonists, too. The game has backstory that ties into the plot nicely, and I didn't find it overly expansive or tedious. The world in the game is quite small, but its an appropriate fit for the length of the story and the style of gameplay. I highly recommend this, its a beautiful little game. *****			"

												Words cannot express the deep and thoughtful world that Primordia is. Unless for some reason, you hate – and I mean, truly, with burning fire, HATE – point and click adventure games, you owe it to yourself to play this game.As dark as the world can seem, humor abounds in this game. The simple graphics are still beautifully rendered, and the characters you meet are ones who will climb inside your head, and stay for the long haul. With a cast of incredibly well realized and acted robots, the world doesn't just invite you in; it sucks you down, and makes you a part of it. Things in this game will be thought about days, weeks later. Enough cannot be said for how immersive this game is.As unfortunate and bleak as the world of Primordia may seem, it has many things I wish to see again. Perhaps, if enough people play Primordia, some day we can all go back together.			"

												Pretty much everything I ever wanted in a point and click game - witty dialouge, lovable characters, a feeling of discovery uncovering an intriguing story. The puzzles are quite well-balanced IMO, just maybe a bit on the pixelly side so you might end up missing hotspots to click (they do have the words pop up when you mouseover hotspots to help with that)			"

Most of the puzzles are solvable with a little thought, although from the look of the achievements I haven't unlocked, there are a few puzzles I either missed or got locked out of by my story choices.I'm not sure what the full price was, but if and when this shows up as flash sale, its very worth a $3-4 sale price.

												There was an era of adventure gaming that I really loved: the 90s LucasArts-style era.  These were games that ran in 256-color MCGA mode and had MIDI soundtracks.  If you were fortunate enough to own, rather than download, these games, you might even have gotten the voice tracks.This game is a lot like those.  It has some puzzles that make little sense and some arbitrary hurdles, but on the whole, it holds up very well.  The surplus of endings is interesting, as well.  Primordia doesn't have a very long playthrough, which is nice.  It's like a novella and it just hits the spot.			"

												I haven't been this happy since Grim Fandango. It's a 16-bit point-and-click adventure (in the play style of Curse of Monkey Island) in sepia tones. The game is fully voice acted, and it's the least annoying voice acting ever. The lead is voiced by Logan Cunningham, the guy who narrated Bastion, and the other characters and voices thus far have been FANTASTIC. At one point, I had to set the mouse aside to get pencil and paper out because a pair of indignant robots wanted me to settle a legal dispute, but not until after proving my worthiness by solving a logical story problem. Basically I have spent six times as much money on games that were one tenth as engaging and wonderful. I don't know why this game isn't blowing up my friends list already, but hey, now you know.			"
