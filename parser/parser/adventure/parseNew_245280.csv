												Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a sci-fi reworking of the classic Chinese tale, Journey to the West. Set after an apocalyptic war, the world has largely been abandoned and only a remnant of civilisation remains, alongside what's left of a hostile robot army.The setting is at times stunning. The skeletal remains of civilisation are being re-enveloped by verdant nature. It's a refreshing move away from the barren browns and reds we usually associate with post-apocalyptic settings. Despite its age and technical limitations - coupled with even more limited graphics options - Enslaved is a beautiful game with obvious care and attention paid to its lush environments, its detailed, motion-captured animation overseen by Andy ""Gollum"" Serkis, and its nuanced character design.It's also clear that care has been lavished on the story. Main characters Monkey and Trip are fully rounded out. The nature of their strained relationship plays out naturally, and develops organically. There are the occasional fumbles, especially at the very beginning as the rules of their relationship are set, and the conflict feels a little rushed and too quickly resolved. Overall, however, the dialogue and character development prove to be sophisticated to a degree far in excess of what one might expect from an action-brawler.Other characters taken and adapted from the novel are equally well represented, and the central narrative pays homage to original story reinterpreting its themes of action, choice and consequence expertly and without the heavy hand mass market media so often utilises. The game plays out as an extended escort mission of sorts. The concept may strike dread in the hearts of many a gamer, but it’s not so much a burden and plays in a similar fashion to Bioshock Infinite’s Elizabeth. Trip will hide from combat while Monkey lays the smack down on robots. The combat its self is initially frantic and exciting, but soon it becomes clear it lacks any sort of depth. In fact, for all its visual punch the combat has no actual power behind it and its limitations quickly become evident. Other aspects of the game also suffer from being pedestrian and uninteresting. Platforming and puzzle elements are functional, but both lack any imagination and act as little more than a distraction from the combat zones.Enslaved is highly scripted and very linear, and despite the verticality of many levels and the sprawling nature of the world Money and Trip have a very narrow path to follow. The scripted nature of the game is both its strength and ultimately its biggest weakness.Despite some stunning art direction and a rich story complete with interesting and complex characters, Enslaved fails to provide a compelling game play experience to complement its artistic and narrative strengths.

												8/10genre : action/adventure  Enslaved is a sci-fi tale, set after an apocalyptic war, where only a remnant of civilisation remains and a hostile robot army prevails. You take the role of Monkey and you are captured and compelled to aid Trip by use of an electronic slave headband in order to escort her to her home.+ Very solid presentation, with care and attention paid to its lush environments, the character models are very well done, detailed motion-captured animations. Configuring the .cfg file can improve the results (see the forum), since the graphics options are limited.+ Excellent atmosphere, sci-fi post apocalyptic setting,  original and complelling story and likeable main character , sophisticated dialogue and character development way more than one might expect from an action/brawler.+ Gameplay wise it's an action game with some platforming and exploration elements, simplistic puzzles, cooperation with the main npc in order to advance, some tactical options like distract etc. It never becomes boring. It's kind of a game that we don't see often on our pcs.+ Melee which is the main element of gameplay feels very satisfying , don't except variety like in dmc, but still it's done right.+ Fluid controls ,also remappable, runs smoothly.+/- Highly scripted and very linear.-  Platforming and puzzle elements are functional, but both lack any imagination and act as little more than a distraction from the combat zones- Some camera problems when platforming- The combat is initially frantic and exciting, but soon it becomes clear it lacks any sort of depth. This was a surprise for me , since i don't play on consoles and didn't know the game before, straightforward action-adventure game with a detailed and involving story , refreshing and at times stunning setting. Two thumbs up.			"

												Based on the ancient Chinese story 'Journey to the West'This has got to be one of my top favorite games. It has a brilliant storyline, engaging characters and character development. Beautiful scenery, funny moments within the game between Trip and Monkey. It's just overall a amazing game to play.I'd recommend playing it on hard though, and to tweak your graphic settings in the ini file to improve the game a lot more better.			"

												Disclaimer: Do not buy this game if you do not own a gamepad.  The mouse support is about as bad as it gets.  I use kb/m whenever possible in third person games and I had to use a gamepad for this one.Enslaved is a well-written and satisfying-but-simple spectacle fighter with a heavy story emphasis and some minor puzzles.  It is a post-apocalyptic adaptation of a classic Chinese novel ""Journey to the West.""  There are several nods to the original story, such as the names of the main characters which may interest those who have read the book.The writing is excellent for the most part and acted very well.  The game manages to be both serious and humorous while telling the story and rarely feels out of place.  My one issue is the way that the two main characters Monkey and Trip meet.  The meeting should be the biggest source of conflict in the entire story, yet it is glossed over and forgotten within a minute.  It reminds me a lot of the criticism aimed at Tomb Raider 2013 and Far Cry 3 for how quickly those main characters got used to killing people after leading normal, peaceful lives up to that point.Gameplay is pretty simple and definitely nothing groundbreaking.  The game is a simple yet satisfying spectacle fighter with simple one-button traversal mechanics.  You also need to solve a few basic puzzles to make it through some levels.  It is quite easy even on hard difficulty.  Unfortunately the game makes use of seemingly randomly-placed fixed camera angles that can easily confuse the player and will sometimes make your character immediately walk back through a doorway after entering a room.  The other big issue with the camera is during combat itself.  It likes to jerk the camera around randomly every time you attack and zoom way in so it's impossible to keep track of enemies other than the one you're attacking.  It may also cause motion sickness.  It's a stupid design decision chosen just to make the combat more flashy, as seems to be a common problem with spectacle fighters.The game has a nice art style, but average last-gen console-quality graphics.  I find that this is enough to hamper the art style in what should be a very beautiful game, which is very unfortunate.  It still has its moments, but it would be an absolutely gorgeous game if the developers had put any effort into the PC port.Speaking of the port, it's just about as lazy as it gets.  The mouse is treated like a joystick and is given a deadzone when you go into aim mode, just like Dead Space.  It's basically useless and I found it unplayable.  Graphical quality is limited to low/medium/high though it thankfully has a separate toggle for motion blur which looks even more fake and ugly than most games.  There are no graphical enhancements for the PC version.  Button prompts always show controller buttons even if you don't have one plugged in.  The game has a custom mouse cursor, yet the mouse doesn't work in menus.  The one good thing about the port is that the game uses Unreal Engine 3 so it runs very smoothly and will handle 120/144 Hz flawlessly with only a minor config tweak.So while it's far from a perfect game, mostly due to poor and outdated design decisions and a lazy port, it's quite fun and a great story experience.The Premium Edition on PC also includes the Pigsy's Perfect 10 DLC.  It turns the game from a simple-but-satisfying story-focused spectacle fighter into a sub-par stealth/cover shooter starring a fat, disgusting, misogynist pig on his quest to build a robot girlfriend.  Seriously what were they thinking?  Thankfully it was short.			"

												In 2010, ""Enslaved - Odyssey to the West"" came out for consoles and sold a little less than half of what the publisher had hoped for. Reasons quoted for this were that it was overshadowed by a number of other AAA titles and that there were quite some glitches. But reviews praised it, especially for its story. With a delay of 3 years, it has now been ported to PC.""Enslaved"" is very loosely based on a classic Chinese tale, ""Journey to the West"", and plays 150 years in the future. The planet has been ravaged by a brutal war the remainders of which are ruined desolate cities and hostile mechs that attack anyone they encounter. Humanity has scattered far and about, not only threatened by the mechs, but also by mysterious slave hunters that kidnap people without so much as a clue as to where they're taking them. Onboard a ship of slaves-to-be, Trip, a young woman with tech skills manages to escape her cell. This also opens up a way out for fellow prisoner ""Monkey"", a muscular loner who has subsisted in the wilderness on his own for most of his life. They manage to flee from the crashing slave ship on the last remaining escape pod, but Monkey loses his consciousness. He awakens to find that Trip has put a slave headband on him that will kill him should her heart stop. She wants to return to the community where she came from and knows she would never stand a chance all alone. So Monkey is forced to cooperate: He is the muscle that takes on all hostiles they meet, Trip is the brains with her knowledge of technology.Gameplay consists of combat, climbing and some mini puzzles. Monkey has a staff he uses to fight with mechs and later on also shoot at ranged targets. The weapon can be upgraded in various ways using energy orbs found in the levels. Considering myself a mediocre gamer, I found fighting to be at an okay-ish difficulty once I had figured out how to block (others said combat was too easy - obviously, your mileage may vary on that). There could be more help with the controls though, special attacks are still described by giving console control pad keys.Climbing is rather easy since one cannot fall or miss a grip point, all of which are highlighted relatively obviously. Also, in some sequences Monkey steers a hovering disc called the ""cloud"" over water and ground surfaces - these segments add a little speed to the otherwise pedestrian experience.The changing relationship between the two main characters is at the centre of the plot. Thus, it's fortunate that voice acting is very good. And when, at times, not a lot is said (Monkey is not a man of many words), the finely motion-captured facial expressions convey all one needs to know. Story, characters, acting - this is where the game really shines and becomes a ""page turner"". Okay, well, I won't spoil the ending to you, but I think that was the one part where they could have done better. It just left me with ""Hmmmmmmmmm.""Other than that, a captivating journey and definitely recommendable.Helpful notes in case you get the game:Note 1: Others have reported graphics problems. There are quick INI fixes mentioned on the Steam forums: 


How to setup graphics via *ini file [for noobs] 
A Guide for ENSLAVED™: Odyssey to the West™ Premium Edition
By: ArsNG

			Well, this game has no any advanced video settings to change, players should setup it manually via *ini file or videodriver profile. It's not a clear or specific manual, it's just a way to do-it-good-in-one-minute.		


With those tweaks I didn't have any issues.Note 2: You can skip cutscenes with the Backspace key (didn't find that mentioned in-game).Note 3 (since I've seen this problem pop up in several threads, to the point that people called it game-breaking, but hey, the solution is already in-game, so no need to get stuck): For some jumps during climbing, you have to move diagonally, not straight up/left/right. That's possible by pressing two direction keys at once, e.g. W+D http://steamcommunity.com/app/245280/discussions/0/648811670597314811/ "

												A journey through a desperate mind.Enslaved is an adventure game overlooked by a majority and (rightfully) loved by most who played it. It follows the story of the great classical Chinese novel, although is set in a post apocalyptic future where seemingly armed robots are enslaving people. Armed with a staff and some sweet climbing skills, you play the enslaved warrior Monkey. Tasked with helping your captor, Trip, get home to her father. Throughout most of the game, you will be jumping, climbing over obstacles and mowing down mecs in either brawling close combat or shooting plasma bolts long rage style.The game is designed in such a way to keep this recipe fresh and not feel repetitive. Smart enemy placements contribute to this as mixing ranged and melee enemies in fights makes you think before you act. Boss fights are a sweet bonus.Weapons, shields, health and combat techniques are all upgradable and a must to get past the later chapters.Contrary to what you may believe, the post apocalyptic setting in Enslaved really does its art justice as the environment and visuals are just gorgeous. The greenest of trees, bluest of skies and warmest colors of explosions are visually pleasing. The art is well complemented by the ambient sounds and music.After about half of the game, you are joined by Pigsy who is, although a disgusting pig, easily the most exotic and colorful of characters. He livens up the game to a high degree and counters the somewhat reserved character of Monkey. Pigsy is playable in the included DLC and offers a different kind of play style by scrapping the melee combat in favor of a rifle and four kinds of cooldown-based items (distraction device, EMP, ally bomb and damage based bomb). Accompanied with the joyful Truffles, Pigsy goes on his own little adventure. The extra content is a must play and Is just as good if not even stronger in some parts than the main game.The only weaknesses I found in the game was the overly scripted camera that takes camera controls away from you to show objects of interest in an overly obvious way. Sometimes the camera becomes fixed in a static position for portions of the pacing through the level. This can sometimes become a bit distracting. I was also annoyed with how some animations take to long to complete. While fighting (bosses especially) I found it very difficult to evade after attacking due to the attack animations not completing yet. Similarly when climbing pipes jumps to other objects would not register.So, linear post apocalyptic action adventure brawler with ravishing visuals and interesting characters. Action, drama and humor packed into an adventure with a deeper meaning. It has completionist potential and took me 12 hours to beat with the must play extra Pigsy campaign. Sit back, plug in that controller and go on a fun adventure.			"

												I'm only on the third chapter, but it's refreshing to see such a lively game that mixes so many great emotions. I don't understand why this isn't some sort of bestseller.

You have satisfying combat, fun puzzles that aren't frustrating, colorful characters with personality, whom are well voiced by the actors, and a lovely art style with amazing environments. And did I mention the music?  Amazing!  The game does not get old.  I kept telling  myself I'd take a break at the next mission, but then kept on playing. If you want to have fun and mix it with a great story, give this game a try. I give it an easy 10/10.			"

												I remember playing Enslaved on the PS3 and that I was unimpressed by it. I have no idea why, because I absolutely love it after having played the PC version. It managed to pull me in right from the start and it has that fine mix of solving puzzles, platforming and combat that only few games have these days. The combat starts off shallow, but once you get access to the shooting part of your staff it becomes immensely satisfying. Hitting robots feels heavy and right, and looks great in motion.Platforming is pretty much the same as the later Prince Of Persia and Assassin's Creed games, You can swiftly move horizontally and vertically without being afraid to fall to your death, which is always a bonus if you ask me.The puzzles are of the platforming kind and usually require pressing (and holding) a button. It's not all that exciting and that's why there aren't a lot of them in this game. Which is good. It's just enough to keep it from being boring or frustrating.The graphics are awesome (except for a few shadow glitches) and there are lots of colors used for the environments. It's truly beautifully made. The same goes for the characters. They are very well animated and the faces - usually a bit flawed in many, many games - are great, making it not awkward to look at whenever a cutscene starts playing. The voice acting is done extremely well, and by well known people; one of them being the great Andy Serkis. That guy just has a great voice and his motion capture performances are through the roof. Just awesome.The story is deep and makes you think, and the game is just long enough before it becomes a chore. It lasts around 8-10 hours. If you want to find all of the orbs it could take you several hours longer. But no more, because it's a linear game and there just aren't any collectibles to be found here. Which is great for me, a guy who just wants to play through the story, but not for those collectors out there.Enslaved is a wonderul experience and I sincerely hope more people will give it a try. It deserves another chance, people. This is it.[Rating: 86/100]			"

												Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a very good, but somewhat flawed game that deserves to be played by anyone who likes action-adventure-platformers. This game reminded me a lot of the Prince of Persia game from 2008. You do a fair amount of easy platforming and also spent a pretty good amount of time in combat. The combat is by no means difficult and by no means super interesting.What makes the game work is that it does the few things it does very well. The platforming is solid and has great controls. I found myself enjoying all the little platforming sections they threw at me. They make the next object you are to leap to flash so you never find yourself wondering where to go next. Also, the combat in this game responds well. You are able to upgrade yourself as you play and I found that the extra costumes that came with this version of the game were really useful. What does not work in this game are the turret sections. I found aiming the turrets in this game to be a chore and that it was really hard to hit moving targets enough to kill them. Obviously, I made it through the game, but I dreaded every time I was in a turret section. Fortunately, there are only about three or four turret sequences. All have terrible checkpoints as well....something that is actually a problem throughout the game. It doesn't save after each major section, but rather saves when it feels like it. I quit once, confident that I would be fine, only to come back and learn I had to replay 10-15 solid minutes. Annoying. The ""surf board"" sections are also annoying, but quite brief.The laziness of the PC port is obvious at times. There are graphical glitches and I once had to reduce the game to the lowest resolution for the character to make a jump. Odd. A final note about a few high points of the game. The characters and story are really good, as are the graphics. I found myself really liking both the main leads and was very much pulled into their adventure. The voice-acting is top notch and the facial capturing they did for these characters is one of the best in any game I've seen. The environments  are lush and beautiful and the game ran smoothly for the most part(aside from a few glitches).In the end, I loved the game and really recommend it if you liked any Prince of Persia game.8/10 - a solid game everyone should pick up.

												Completed the game in a little over 7 hours. Great story with compelling characters and great voice acting, although by the end it leaves a lot of unanswered questions that I suppose would be answered in a sequel or two, that sadly we are unlikely too see. In that respect it felt a little lackluster and just a bit weird.Combat on the whole can become very repetetive but it's still a challenge in some scenarios and not bad overall for such an old game. Climbing isn't much of a challenge but still feels cool enough for that to not matter. I feel like a lot of effort went into the opening sequence and would have liked that level of immersion to carry on throughout.The key thing that kept me playing was the synergy between Monkey & Trip and I feel it would have developed into an excellent franchise had it continued.Overall: 7/10			"

												In general, it is a 3D action/arcade/adventure. Fighting, running, jumping, solving mini-puzzles and so on...You can't say that its gameplay is anyhow innovative, but it is amusing and well-balanced. What really makes ENSLAVED an outstanding  game is a beautiful, thoughtful and detailed crafting of the story, characters, dialogues, cut-scenes, locations... just everything. It is a wonderful story and a refreshing experience that you'll remember for long.In the age of ""visit 20 towers and collect 100 feathers"" games, an adventure from a crowd of many, surprisingly reminds us of what true game artistry is.Really an overlooked masterpiece. I play computer games since 80s, and ENSLAVED is definitely in my Top-10.			"

												There are three modes of play to choose from - I chose Normal -  and I used an X-box 360 controller -- mostly. From the main menu you can choose to ""Continue Journey"", which of course continues your game from the last save point. Saves are automatic; just watch for the swirling blue symbol in the bottom right corner.  If you choose to continue after you've already finished the game, you'll get to re-watch the game's epilogue.  You can go back and try to get all of the collectibles via ""Chapter Select"" (it will give you stats on the collectibles per chapter from this section), and if you've gone back since finishing the game, ""Continue Journey"" will return you to the chapter you were last working on.The Chapter Select is available from the beginning of the game, though of course you can only access chapters that you've already been to (no jumping ahead in the story.)  Just be aware that if you decide to go back and replay a chapter, whatever chapter you're currently in will be reset to the beginning.So, what ARE these collectibles I keep mentioning?  There are two to collect in the main game -- ""tech orbs"", which are floating balls of light, and as of chapter 3, masks.  The masks add a little bit of extra depth to the story, and the orbs you will need to grab to get upgrades.  More on that later.The tutorial is pretty straightforward, but I'll add some of the info here so that you can get an idea of the gameplay and combat.We have full 360-degree control of both our character and the camera... most of the time.  Sometimes we have only limited control of the camera, which I believe the devs did to help us know which direction we're supposed to go.  There were a few moments when I simply could not figure out what I was supposed to be doing, but by taking my time to look around, I'd eventually spot something flashing.  These flashing objects are items that you can climb, jump on/to, clamber on, etc.  Our character is quite acrobatic, but you don't have to stop and watch him twirl around to finish his maneuver before jumping to the next location; that can be fun, but when you're being attacked, I really don't recommend it. ;pBy the way, you generally can't fall to your death in this game.  There are exceptions of course, but what I mean is that if you're up so high that death would be the result of falling, your character will simply refuse to jump.  You won't fall off of -- say -- a steel girder when you're clambering across, not even if you try reallllly hard. Another nice thing the devs have added is that when you climb a ladder, it takes a single push of a button -- climbing up and down is automatic.You have two types of attack: Up-close combat and shooting, both of which are done with your handy staff.  Ammo is VERY limited, so be choosy on what you decide to use it on!  We have both plasma and stunning ammo.  The plasma blast will NOT break through a shield, but the stunning ammo will.  The only other thing that will break through a shield is a ""charged"" hit with your staff, which you do by holding down the attack button until the staff glows.  'course you could just run behind them where their shield doesn't cover, but what would be the fun in that? XD  (In other words, I'm not dexterous enough with close combat to be able to do it. *snicker* )I really had trouble with using the controller to aim accurately when in the midst of combat.  Eventually I remembered that I could use the controller AND the mouse, so whenever I needed to shoot something, I used the mouse, and used the controller for everything else.Some of the mechs you run into will have symbols over their heads.  These are enemies that you can do a takedown on.  Hit 'em until the prompt comes up, then push the appropriate button for the takedown.  Highly recommended since it will affect any other mechs that are present, and absolutely necessary during certain boss battles -- there's no way to beat some of them without using the maneuver!We have a companion on our journey, which already know if you've looked at any of the game screens.  Trip has many abilities of her own, and she is also the reason we've been collecting those tech orbs.  First off, though, let me explain a little bit about the dynamics.We have a screen we can bring up to interact with Trip, and there we have some options.  We can tell her to create a distraction, run or do some kind of action (like flipping a switch for us), apply a health serum (provided that we have some), and the upgrade function, which is where the tech orbs come in.  There are four sub-options for upgrades: Staff, Combat, Shield, and Health.I'll let you discover for yourself what each category entails~Trip is not the badass we are, so sometimes she needs a little help... like picking her up and flinging her across a chasm... you know, that kind of thing. How you, personally (not our character), feel about Trip is going to depend on your decisions.  I know that's pretty vague, and perhaps even those who've played the game won't know what I'm talking about, but I can't really say more than that without giving spoilers.There is a widely-experienced GLITCH during one scene in the game, and I'm putting this in spoilers in case you don't want to see the solution:The second time we run into one of the mechs with wrecking balls for ""hands"" is where the glitch shows up.  You hear something, but see nothing unusual.  There's a brick wall there that's supposed to have broken, but all you see is a solid wall.  Eventually one of these mechs will appear, but there doesn't seem to be a way to defeat it, no matter how many times you hit the damned thing!  Meh.  The game is telling you to taunt it, but it just runs into one of those low walls and gets stuck there. *sigh*What you need to do is taunt it until it runs into one of the large, solid walls -- the one right below Trip is the one I used (and maybe it's the only one that works, I don't know!)  Once it hits the wall, you need to do a takedown in order to defeat it, so be sure you're close enough that you don't run out of time!The graphics are stunningly beautiful.  The attention to detail is just incredible, with those little extra touches that really add to the scene -- the way things move in the wind, lighting effects, scratches on our characters' skin, scars, even pores!  This dystopian world is really brought to life through the amazing graphics, and you know what?  The creators didn't ""cheat"" on those areas where we have limited camera range.  If you try aiming to shoot something, you'll be able to see the full 360-degree view, and that the graphics are still fleshed out in areas we shouldn't be able to see.The voice acting is excellent, and the characters are full of personality.  I generally didn't notice the music, and to me, that's the mark of really well-chosen tunes... It means that the music so perfectly fit the scene(s) that it wasn't jarring,  annoying, or feeling out-of-place.  The sound effects were great, too. ^__^I felt that the ending was ridiculous in some respects, but that's because of my habit of analyzing things.  It may have felt unrealistic to me, but it ALSO felt compelling, thought-provoking... profound.  You have to realize that the game is based on a story that is *four hundred* years old! I really enjoyed everything about this game -- from the sights and sounds to the story to the gameplay, I just enjoyed the hell out of it.  I have to agree with those who have mentioned that this is a hidden gem.  I really do think that the game deserved a lot more attention than it got, and I highly recommend it to any action-adventure fan.			"

												Wow. I had never heard of this game prior to it releasing on Steam, but this game is an absolute blast! The gameplay feels almost Uncharted-like with it's platform sequences and has one of the prettiest color palettes of any game I've played. I would literally reload a checkpoint just so I could screenshot it. The characters and story are also very well done as is the superb voice acting. The fighting is fairly basic, but still rewarding all the same. The only downside that I can think of is that it did take considerable tweaking of .ini files to get this game to run without any hiccups. Most of the issues were graphics related (resolution, shadows, etc) so it wasn't anything game breaking.At the end of the day, this is a game that is just pure fun. I rarely replay games, but I'm sure I'll be coming back to Enslaved for more.			"

												Enslaved is beautiful, interesting, well-acted, and highly polished.  Why no recommendation?  It's hardly a game at all.I love the world, and the atmosphere they've created.  I like the characters, and wanted to see where their story went.  If it weren't for that, I would have quit after the first level.  This game is totally on rails.Your character, appropriately named Monkey, does a LOT of platforming.  Most of it is climbing walls and jumping from perch to perch.  The problem?  You can't miss.  You hang from one pre-determined (and helpfully glowing) spot, hold the direction of the next one, and press A.  Then you get there, and repeat.  There aren't even any choices of where to go; you're simply following a path.  Even though you're jumping around like a monkey, it's effectively no different than walking down a hallway in FF13.You can't even hop down from platforms in non-predetermined places.  The game LITERALLY won't let you die from jumping the wrong way.  Even in dramatic sections where the wall you're climbing on is crumbling away, you can rest assured that you will make it if you simply hold up and mash A.  Seriously.  As long as you push the button, you will never lose.  If you somehow DO manage to die, it only feels like the game's fault.And that's the biggest problem: with 90% of the game so streamlined, whenever something isn't immediately obvious the game grinds to a halt.  More than once I found myself completely baffled by what to do next, simply because the game had never asked me to figure anything out before.I beat this game back when it came out on 360, simply because I wanted to see how it ended (Answer?  Very strangely.)  Now that I'm REplaying it, all I want to do is fight the on-rails system in place here.  I find myself constantly grumbling about how Monkey won't do what I'm telling him to, because it's not exactly what the game WANTS me to do.It's obvious that Ninja Theory really just wanted to tell a story and make some nice cinematics, only adding the gameplay to glue those elements together.  You are an actor in their movie, with lines and marks that you must follow, and that comes before actually PLAYING anything resembling a game.  If those elements appeal to you, and the game's on sale, you might ultimately enjoy it.Just don't expect to PLAY it.P.S. As far as the port goes, it ran well on my PC, but it doesn't support 2560x1440, and if you have both a controller and a joystick, you're gonna have to unplug one before it'll work.			"

												I loved every moment of this game. This game has near perfect nVidia 3D Vision support with the use of Helix mod and between the excellent motion capture and lush post-apocalyptic setting it's just so damn beautiful. I took many 3D screenshots, but I'll have to import them into Steam to upload any of them ;-) Heck - even the menu screen is at least a thousand times more awesome in 3D as it is in lamo 2D!Since this is a third person game I played it with an Xbox 360 controller with no problems, but I hear that it doesn't fare so well with keyboard+mouse, so if you don't have a controller you might want to stay away.I enjoyed the story, though I have a feeling this might be a bit of a hit or miss affair for different people. It is very much focussed on the journey the characters endure and how it affects them - the motion capture really adds a lot here as they perfectly nailed the characters facial expressions and body language, which really says a lot more about themselves and their journey than the words they use.The character's backstory is a bit light and I would have appreciated a bit more detail, particularly on Monkey (the main character). Plot wise it might be a little light / simplistic for some, but I didn't mind because the focus was really on the personal journey of the characters. I'd love to talk about the ending a bit, but that would be spoilers so I'll just say it made me think and reflect on a few events from the story.This game offered me a rare chance to discuss my hobby with my fiance, as the game is adapted from the classic Chinese story Journey to the West and it was interesting to talk a bit about the similarities and differences between this and the original story. Obviously the futuristic post-apocalyptic setting of the game is quite different to the original and a lot of elements have been changed to fit the setting and work in the context of a video game, but there are plenty of similarities - the character's names, Monkey's slave headband, the fact that Monkey rides on a cloud (of different sorts), PIgsy's advances and even Monkey's fighting stick (which packs away when not in use so he can hide it on his arm / in his ear).Gameplay wise it's a fairly standard spectacle fighter & third person platformer with a couple of *very* basic puzzles every so often. The combat hit a pretty good balance for me - button mashing works some of the time, but there's a few different enemy types that need different strategies to deal with effectively. Cover is important to avoid weapons fire and/or remain hidden - plus there is a distraction mechanic which can be used to safely move from cover to cover. Certain enemies can be used against others if you do a finishing move on them first so there is a bit of strategy involved, but nothing particularly difficult. It did seem like using ranged attacks was a bit OP, but I tend to prefer melee when I have a choice so that didn't bother me, though it took me most of the game to work out the timing to pull off a counter attack.Without giving too much away I must give it bonus points for the final boss fight as well - the fight feels very epic, but they didn't make the mistake that so many games do of changing up the gameplay - you're just using the exact same platforming and fighting as you have been through the rest of the game, but this time it's all part of a rather awesome showdown.Finally, this edition comes with the Pigsy's Perfect 10 DLC. Pigsy's character provided some comic relief in the main game, so naturally it follows that this DLC is more humerous and light hearted than the quite serious main game. I'm not sure whether to call Pigsy a side character or a main character you only meet halfway through the main game, but whatever the case this DLC is a completely separate campaign following Pigsy's quest to quite literally make a new friend. This really felt like DLC done right - Pigsy plays quite differently to Monkey as he does not have any melee weapons and uses a combination of gadgets and his gun instead. I was pretty happy with the length of this DLC - it perhaps could have been a little longer, but I don't think it was too short.I score it a ""You should play this"" / 10			"

												A great Uncharted-style action/adventure game. Loved the story and characters. Graphics is great, combat is OK, but the controls and platforming are a bit clunky. Some of the boss fights drag on a little too much, but it's forgivable in the grand scheme of things.Will probably take ~7 hours to finish. You can start another new game after finishing with all the abilities you've unlocked, which is rather fun.			"

												Really excellent game! I'm surprised that there wasn't more people championing it back when it originally came out. The environments, dialog, and character design are excellent (though sometimes things momentarily turn to annoying cliches). The homage to Journey to the West is interesting and I think they handled it well, but sometimes I worry that games can only do a good adaptation by adding post-apocalyptic robots.The gameplay feels a lot like The Last of Us except actually fun and with visual flare. The PC controls can be pretty awful. It uses controller button prompts so I was constantly groping around to guess the key. I never figured out any of the special attacks that required button combos. Some of the menus will suddenly use arrows instead of WASD. I used gamepad on occasion and it was better there, but I have to relearn the controls.The ending is really odd and makes me think that maybe they were going to develop 2 endings and ran out of time. I can go along with it, it's just very abrupt. There's also a DLC with different gameplay and tone. It's a nice companion if you want some more time in that world.Overall it's beautifully polished with some highs and lows, but one that I think was more forgotten/ignored that it should have been.

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. It takes place in amazing environments, the characters seem interesting enough, and the story seems interesting as well. But, frankly, the gameplay is terrible, mainly because of the ridiculously awful camera controls. It doesn't matter if you are using a gamepad or kb/m, the game has it's own ideas about what it wants to do with the camera and it will fight your control of it every step of the way.The worst is in combat, where the camera will often shift angles automatically, usually to angles more about making your character look cool than about actually giving you a decent view of or angle of attack on your enemies. Many times this stupidity will cause your attacks to go completely in the wrong direction, which really sucks for charged attacks. Seriously, it's just not fun when you have to fight the camera just as much as you fight the bad guys, and you have to do so while trying to fight the bad guys. If the camera were better under user control without the game randomly shifting it around based on whatever automatic rules it follows, then I would probably be willing to recommend this game. But as it is now, with utter crap camera control making combat pretty much impossible, or at least insanely frustrating, at times, I cannot recommend this game.			"

												This is a much better game than I thought it would be. I wanted to get it for PS3 when it came out but decided to wait. I was excited to see that a few years later it came to PC with enhanced graphics and picked it up on sale. Here's the quick bullet points:* The graphics are quite good, even though this game is not very recent. They really did upgrade significantly from the PS3 version.* The story starts out boring but gets better after the first couple hours. I wish they would have gone more in-depth by the end. The last half is actually quite good writing.* The combat is meh. Initially I was irritated with it but I adjusted. It's not Arkham, but it's ok. Tips below.* My machine is pretty hefty but the cut-scenes would pop and stutter a bit, which was really annoying. No idea why. It didn't ruin the game, though.* Character shadows we were weird on my 7870 with maxed graphics settings. But again, did not harm my playthrough.Combat tips:* Get the upgrade that allows you to charge your stuff and burst out. Very very handy.* Learn to use the block!!!! Upgrade it and your shield strength. Also, get health regen +1 or 2 before getting health upgrade, as the regen is much more useful.* Learn to use wide attack (I completely forgot about this ability).* Get the staff gun ammo capacity upgrades, as stock-piling the ammo is very handy to have in reserve. But use it sparingly as it is rare.Enjoy!			"

												I remember being intrigued by Enslaved way back in the day of it's original release on PS3 and X360 (I owned Sony's console at the time). Having heard positive things aobut it made me try the demo out, and it, in turn, wetted my appetite for the full game. But somehow I only managed to play this game now, years later, and on PC. It started great, but slowly got more and more disappointing almost in every aspect.The beginnings are strong - quite unique concept of interaction between two characters with active and passive roles, great location design and interesting world, seasoned with a bit of character development (through upgrades). Sadly, none of this ever develops past what you see in the first 30% of the game. Combat quickly becomes repetetive and feels stiff, platforming is straight up brain-dead, enemies lack diversity (and there are only two unique boss fights throughout the campaign) and character development never really manages to get interesting story-wise. The ending feels glued on, and while it attempts to round off the game while also introducing a twist, it falls flat on it's face by feeling really, really out of context.The game manages to present the player with reasonably diverse environments throughout the campaign, though I couldn't shake the feeling that the further I got, the less inspired they were. Game's visuals are also compromised by some gnarly texturework at various spots, shadowing glitches and one of the poorest motion blur implementations I've seen (it's luckily possible to turn it off) and 30fps, highly compressed FMV's that litter the campaign. Dialogue is well done, but it's coupled with awkward lip sync and character animations - I don't really know where all that motion capture Ninja Theory bragged about is utilised. And finally - the camera has really narrow FOV, which sometimes caused confiusion for me (it tends to get stuck and perform rapid rotations on it's own), and there is no way to adjust all that.All in all - I am very disappointed by Enslaved. I've finished the campaign once, didn't even touch Pigsy's Perfect 10 that is included because I really don't see a reason. As a non-interactive story this possibly could have worked, but all the ""game-y"" aspects of Enslaved feel half-baked way too often. With so-so quality of PC port, I really can't recommend this game. A real shame.			"

												Boy oh boy, where to start with this game...Ever since I tried this masterful work back when it first released, I was immediately hooked to it, Great combat, nice quick puzzles that don't make you annoyed, AMAZING scenery, and let me just say the storyline is one you would get sucked into pretty quickly.Lets start off with the pro's~The combat: With each mech I come across, I just feel the need to smash them to bits, because the combat in this game? Lets just say every. Single. Hit, feels so damn satisfying, I can't really explain my joy for it, the staff you use makes you feel like you have weight to it in a way. This might be a con for some people because unless you upgrade a bit, the combat may tend to get a bit, er, repetitive.The characters: I won't spoil much, but the character you control is a huge buff man who goes by the name of ""Monkey"" (kinda silly, I know...) who just so happens to have ended up ""enslaved"" by another... er... ""main"" character named Trip, who actually isn't that annoying for technically being an escort character. Both of them have likeable personalities and grow good chemistry with eachother later on when you get farther into the game. Like I said, I won't spoil much, so I'll just leave that be.The Graphics: The beginning few chapters of this game will make you want to explore every inch of this pathway you either fight through or climb through (yes, i said ""pathway"", more on that later) the scenery just looks so gorgeous.Gameplay besides combat: This game has exploration moments that would be somewhat if not more similar to, say Uncharted, and Prince of Persia, basically having you climbing walls, swinging from poles, etc. Its nothing to actually get mad over though (atleast I don't think) because previously mentioned scenery makes you want to keep exploring here and there.The pacing: nothing really to go into detail about this. Not too fast, not too short, it keeps a steady pace all the way through with its story~Now onto the mixed reveiws of this game...Camera: the camera tends to be tightly controlled... that is, to a fault. I had to raise the mouse sensitivity up a bit before getting comfortable moving the camera with the mouse, it was very slow to turn upon starting the game, so I had to go through the settings a few times to select just the right speed for it, after that small problem, the camera seems to collide with walls and such, but its nothing gamebreaking... so thats good.The glitches: This here isn't too bad, but it could be fixed up just a tad, but just like the camera, It's nothing to keep you from progressing more into the game. I've never really run into any serious glitches like some reviews are saying, but I probably have yet to...Last and VERY least, the consTech orbs: I've seen nobody address this, so I'm just assuming I'm the only one annoyed with this, Tech orbs are these spherical red orbs that are scattered around each chapter you have to collect, my problem with them being? There is an achievement that states you indeed have to collect every last one of them, their purpose is simple, to upgrade your abilities, which is nice, yes, but... alot of the time they're so damn hard to even spot because of how small they are, and when you're a guy like me that feels the need to 100% everything, its so damn tedious...The achievements: SOME of these achievements like the previously mentioned tech orb one, make you slowly want to rip your hair out, like not getting hit a single time in a chapter? That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, luckily, they're only achievements, but I say again, if you're a guy like me, you want to 100% everything.Overall, this is a pretty swell game, I definitely recommend anyone who has read through this review to buy it, experience it for yourself, trust me, you WILL have fun~			"

												A excellent game which was unfairly overlooked for some reason on it's original release.It's a linear action adventure game with platforming and hack and slash style combat which is loosely based on the Chinese novel Journey to the West but the story is now based in a post apocalyptic future where the heroes have to battle evil robots.- Excellent motion capture and voice acting which is so good it feels like you're watching actors perform rather than computer generated characters miming along to the lines. It looks a little dated now compared to games like Uncharted 4 but it's still very decent.- Beautiful environments. It's the post-apocalyptic wasteland but unlike other games such as Fallout and Rage this game has more colours than grey and brown. I think i even saw some blue stuff a few times.- Likeable characters who made me laugh and care about what was happening when they were in danger.- Responsive and satisfying melee combat where you feel like you're bashing the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of those evil robots. It isn't very difficult but it is fun.- The game moves at a quick pace so you always feel like you're moving forward on to the next story beat or enemy encounter.- The platforming comes from the same school as games like Uncharted meaning you won't die whilst jumping between ledges and platforms unless you jump in the wrong direction because your character just kind of snaps to the next platform. I guess that could be seen as a con to some people but i enjoyed it.If you're looking for a well made action adventure game with nice graphics and a well told and acted story which won't take you 20 hours to finish then pick it up. It will also run at a constant 60fps on your old toaster of a PC.Good stuff.			"

Like all PC ports of older games there are some tweaks to reseach online to set it running how I liked it best graphically, but nothing too difficult to figure out.

												Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a post-apocalyptic action adventure with high production values but boring and stale gameplay.The graphics hold up quite well and many of the environments are gorgeous. There are a few low resolution textures and graphics glitches here and there, but overall the game still looks great. Animations and voice acting are very high quality too.Unfortunately the gameplay is rather stale and boring. The game is extremely linear and the combat is rather simple and fairly easy even on hard difficulty. This kind of melee combat against waves of enemies has been done way too many times before and often much better than here. The camera controls can be rather annoying at times too, especially when the game switches to a more ""cinematic"" (i.e. terrible) camera angle.The platforming sections are even more disappointing than the combat. It's pretty much impossible to mess up jumps and as a consequence the platforming is so trivially easy that even a trained monkey could do it.The story and the writing are more of a mixed bag. The core story is a decent enough (if very loose) retelling of the famous Chinese novel Journey to the West. Unfortunately the characters themselves are not particularly interesting and often feel like walking cliches. Trip in particular is rather cringeworthy and having to rescue her all the time gets old fast.Overall I found Enslaved: Odyssey to the West a very mediocre game. Not really recommended, although if you can get it cheap it's certainly not a terrible way to spend your time.I played through the game on hard difficulty. Even on hard I found the game rather easy once I got hang of the combat controls.The good:- Interesting setting- Beautiful environments and characters- Great animations- Good voiceacting- Decent story (apart from the ending)The bad:- Extremely linear- Platforming is ridiculously easy- Combat is pretty simple and gets boring quickly- Collecting orbs breaks the flow of the game- Trip can be annoying at times and ends up being a damsel in distress way too often- Abrupt ending that's poorly connected to the rest of the storyThe ugly:- Buggy shadows- Lots of minor bugs and glitches			"

												Amazing action adventure game, although not without some flaws. Its most compelling aspects are the story, voice acting and world design. The game is set in post-apocalyptic USA and looks amazing. The destroyed remnants of modern civilization are overrun by vibrant plant life and the world looks absolutely gorgeous. The story was written by Alex Garland (author of The Beach and screenwriter of 28 Days Later, Sunshine, Dredd) and the player character is voiced by Andy Serkis (who did a great job and should totally be in more games). If you're the kind of person who plays games for the story, give this game a try, it's really great. There's quite a lot of platforming, frequently involving puzzles which are mostly not very difficult to solve. The combat is pretty decent: your weapon is a staff that serves both as a melee weapon and a long-range weapon, providing a variety of options for dealing with enemies. In the DLC you can play as a different character with a completely different combat style and powers. The less great aspects of the game are the rather linear nature of the levels and the stupid checkpoint system which will put you before the cutscene (some of which are completely unskippable) if you reload the game, but if you die the game will restart from the point after the cutscene. Makes no sense. Another thing that makes no sense is the forced camera in many situations where it's not needed to highlight an important area or path (since it's hard to get lost in the levels anyway), so it's just mildly annoying for no reason. But other than that, the game is a very enjoyable experience and a must for fans of good storytelling in games.			"

												The good: If you're looking for funny heartwarming characters, this is for you. Monkey and Pigsy are incredibly well done, Trip is not my cup of tea, but that's a matter of opinion. All the characters are very well voiced.The bad: This game is not for you if you're looking for good gameplay. The camera angles are constantly annoying, and the platforming requires little to no effort.Technical issues: The PC version is pretty clunky. I could not add antialiasing and I had to edit a config file to set the correct resolution. It's a mediocre port, typical for a japanese publisher who releases games primarily for consoles.Overall I really enjoyed the game, if you can deal with the lazy port and annoyances, it's well worth a playthrough for the story and characters.

												I was surpried by this ""hidden gem"" Pros- Great visuals Fun combat Interesting Story Great platformingInteresting charactersReally fun boss fights, especially the last one.Loved the snippet's of ""memories"" Cons-The camera control's were a bit annoying at first but i got used to it.The aiming sensitivity when shooting was really bad, had to max out the sensitivity.Only goes to 1080p or 1200p, - Can Edit the files to get Higher. Under 10 hours gameplay.I would recommend if you like Platforming, fun combat and a interesting story. "

												This game is quite enjoyable, but it is definetly rough around the edges. Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a 3rd person adventure character action game in which you play as Monkey on the 2 core gameplay aspects of fighting robots and platforming, while journeying into some great enviroments and through a nice story which will take you around 7-8 hours to beat.The combat feels good but it gets repetitive, there's not that much enemy variety, even a boss is reused once, and you only have 1 weapon with limted moves, I wish they expanded on it a bit more, but it does the job I suppose. The camera can be quite bad at times though, it is too close to your character so sometimes you'll get hit from enemies offscreen and whatnot, they should've zoomed it out a little bit. You can also use your staff to shoot damaging and stunning projectiles but I will warn you that aiming feels a bit sluggish with the mouse.Now the platforming looks cool and all but it's very linear and there's not much of a challenge, you're just pressing the movement keys and the jump button at the same time following a simple path, it can get a bit fidley however, like sometimes there's just this one very specific spot to jump from to grab another ledge, and even if you're just slighly to the side of it, your jump won't work, and sometimes it works from anywhere, so it's a bit inconsistent on that note.Right now you can probably see the game's flaws, but here's what they did right, the enviroments are really beaultiful, and it just takes you right in this post apocalyptic world that the game's trying to build, it definetly feels lonely, and the overgrown nature on New York early in the game serves to reinforce that. The story is quite good too, Monkey the main character escapes from a slave ship and crash lands on the city of New York, only to find himself wearing a slave helmet put on by another prisioner who escaped, Trip. She does this because she needs his protection to reach her home community, so Monkey is now forced to help her, otherwise he's killed by the slave helmet, and also if Trip dies, she set it so his helmet triggers too. That is quite an interesting set up for our two main characters and you can definetly see the chemistry between them as you play the game, I'd say the story is great on that regard, but on a side note I thought that the ending is kinda bad in my opinion, but to avoid spoilers that's all I'll say about it so you can check it out for yourself.Overall, Enslaved: Odyseey to the West has quite a few flaws, but I'd definetly recommend you pick it up on sale, the story and the gourgeous enviroments will definetly make for an exciting journey into this post apocalyptic world.

												Ultimately, I can't recommend this game. There are many great parts, but I wouldn't tell anyone that the experience is worth it. This game is completely mediocre, but with the potential to be amazing. A few slight adjustments would have turned this into a must-play game.The storyline is nothing new, but it's compelling and engaging. The quick cut scenes and overall flow make the game seem really relatable and it's easy to care about the characters. They are also funny and the plot makes sense from start to finish. Nothing is stupid or contrived.However, those are the qualities, all related to the cinematic potential. The gameplay is boring, tedious, and repetitive. The path is lined up in front of you (figuratively), and you never have to guess what to do next. That's not really a bad thing, but it's been a long time since I've played a game that was this incredibly linear. There is no way to mess up, no reason to second-guess, and it makes the game feel more like a slog that slows you down between cut scenes than an experience you want to have again.If I could spare a few words for the developers in the hopes that they might read them:The orbs are a bad idea. Running all over hell and back to collecting floating orbs that are never explained at all was the single worst part of this game. I collected 92% of them overall, and I'd rather lose my all hair than do it again. Ever.The RPG system is weak, making the orbs even less appealing to collect. The majority of combat focuses on melee, but the upgrades for melee are few and weak. The ranged attack becomes very strong, but ammo was scarce and I only used it when I had to. I played on Hard, so maybe ammo is more plentiful in lower levels, but I prefer the challenge. However, I wasn't aware that I'd only be able to upgrade my ranged attack with any great improvements when I started. More upgrade options, please.Certain parts are laughably incosistent. Monkey can toss Trip up to those high ledges, but can't jump up there himself? Other times he makes leaps across gaps so huge I would have been sure that I needed another route. However, the worst part of the incosistency was the Cloud. Works sometimes, inexplicably? Yeah, Monkey says it, and Trip offers a vague reason, but there are times where it doesn't work even in the same area once I've killed the boss that requires its use. The Cloud is the single most enjoyable portion of gameplay in Enslaved, and it was a shame I didn't get to use it more.Finally, the camera work. An auto-center is a must-have feature in any game, and I can't tell you how many times my attacks would swing wide because the camera angle changed on its own and I had to swing it back around manually. Those fixed angle sections caused me a lot of headache when Monkey decides to do a 180 because the camera just flipped in front of him.Finally, just some continuity stuff. In Chapter 14, you get the clear message that this is your final chance to upgrade any further. Why the heck are there orbs after that point then? More tedious collection with NO payoff this time. Perhaps there's a New Game + feature, but I don't want to find out. Harsh review, I know, but I'm only being so precise because I think thsi game could have been so extremely wonderful that I will be looking forward to seeing how Ninja Theory progresses from here. Learn from your mistakes, and you'll have a bright future in games.			"

												Good for about seven hours, this reminds me of a better executed Darksiders. Spectacle brawler and tactical shooting are broken up by light platforming and simple puzzles. Mechanically simple, it acts as a good backdrop to a nice story with amazing character animation and decent voice acting. I really enjoyed the story and it sucked me in to finish the game in about two play sessions. Worth a look!			"

												Enslaved Oddysey to the West PC review:     Enslaved : Odyssey to the West is best described as an adaptation of the novel and concept : Journey to the West. Despite never having read the novel Journey to the West I expected it to be a game with history about slaves and our history as a nation escaping slavery of the days of old. However, what I found was a game that has more on its plate then what is just under the surface of its base description.  It has parkour, a decently good story to follow along with at the start of every new chapter, collectibles for replayability and a world that seems as just a lonely and barren wasteland.Story: At first the story I thought was rather lacking. However, once I made it past the first chapter this whole synopsis about this barren wasteland being the home of enslaved people really caught on to me. You play as a character named Monkey which later on finds one slave remaining that has survived and wants to return home to their family just like yourself. However later on we find out Monkey doesn't really have a home anywhere while Trip the female character you partner up with does have  a family and a home where she grew up.  Early on Monkey and Trip's friendship isn't that strong. However when later you need teamwork as you help Trip up to ledges she can't reach and more , the friendship between you and her get close and strong knit.  Appeal: Many people will be interested to try out this game because of the description of it being a game about companionship, emotions and the escape of being enslaved by your own world and order that controls your daily life. Many people's first question would be can you find freedom outside yourself and others through embracing a new life to claim your freedom. The answer is yes and the ending of the game's story concludes with a very emotional transversal of events. The thoughts that went through mine and I am sure others who have or want to play this game is , would it of made a difference if Namco Bandai Games added more history about slavery into this game?  I think history of enslavement and enslavement camps would of gave this game a more appealing and interesting story overall. That is not to say that the story was not good. I highly enjoyed the game's story and Pigsy this other character you meet along the way with his one liners that are somewhat humerous in tone.Overall: 8.5/10.			"

												Since Enslaved was released on console I had always wanted to play it, now that I have I can say that it is a mixed bag.    My initial impression of the game from trailers and promotions was that it harked back to classic PS2 games, what it most reminded me of was Jak and Daxter, the general gameplay seemed similar and immediately I was interested. The Jak series has always been one of my favourites, anything close to that was something I would be happy to play. When I finally got the chance to purchase it on steam I had mixed feelings. The general look of the game interested me, vaguely steampunk with a scrapyard feel to it. The control scheme was close to what I expected except with more of a God of War style to it. No jump instead a roll and the combat despite being satisfying became very repetitive and was not especially free-form.     The game is split into two distinct sections, the parkour and the fighting. These sections rarely mix and when they do it is just frustrating because enemies will interrupt your forward progress at awkward times. The parkour itself is average at best. It is very constrictive and lacks any skill. Flashing handholds and bars make it a simple task of pressing the right direction. In fact the best thing I could say about the gameplay is that it is satisfying, the animations are smooth and the characters have a real sense of weight to them however this is overshadowed by the number of almost identical situations and encounters that quickly become tedious. The game has some puzzle elements, very simple but not necessarily boring.    At this point the game seems somewhat unappealing but what I mostly enjoyed about this game was the character interaction. The story is simple, not really good or bad, just enough to set the scene and move the game along. However the relationship of the two main characters, Monkey and Trip soon becomes the main focus. Trip is your captor, she placing a headband on Monkey that forces him to obey her and kills Monkey if Trip dies. This adds an interesting dynamic between the characters. Initially there is a hate for Trip and her selfishness but as the story progresses the headband stops being the reason the player looks after her. It almost becomes irrelevant. It probably sounds like the game would do little to support a strong connection between you and Trip but actually this is its most successful piece. Gameplay revolving around carrying trip through areas she can't navigate and protecting her strengthens your involvement in the relationship in a way I didn't really expect. On the other hand don't think Trip is another useless female companion for you to escort, while she cannot fight the huge mechs on her own she has many gadgets to both protect herself and aid you, so that's nice.So should you buy it? Maybe. The main thing to consider is whether the gameplay sounds too repetitive for you. If you enjoy God of War style combat then go for it. Enslaved definitely isn't something I regret buying however it is far from being one of my favourites, it was good while it lasted.			"

												BUY THIS GAME!!!Ok, now that I got that out of my system, let me start by saying that I only purchased this game because it was on sale. And it has turned out to be one of my best purchases in a while. I genuinely had fun playing it unlike some other games that i play up until i get all of the card drops. lol. The graphics are solid. The voice-acting is spot on. The characters, they grow on you and make you invested in the game. Pigsy, he has some pretty spot-on one-liners that unexpectedly make you laugh and look like an idiot. haha. From start to finish, this game will entertain without skipping a beat. It's definitely worth if you can get it for less that 10 or 15 dollars.Happy Gaming,CARDIO			"

												Great atmosphere and setpieces plus a memorable story -- and though the game is basically a continual escort mission, your charge isn't annoying and useless, instead actually becoming rather endearing through the course of the game. The gameplay is straightforward (but still very fun) puzzle, navigation and satisfying action fare with few combos to memorize other than what-counters-what. It's one of the few games that I think is a lot stronger for its sticking to well-tuned though tried-and-true mechanics, linearity and focus on (a still rather janky) story as it drives the gameplay quite well, though the ending leaves much to be desired.Overall an unpretentious, well-balanced, well-executed action-adventure romp through a beautifully ruined post-apocalyptic world. Just be sure to use a 360 controller and manually edit the game settings ini file for extra prettiness!			"

												This game is just absolutely incredible. To begin, though, it's worth pointing out that this isn't a game for everyone: in particular, if you have no interest in narrative-focused games then don't bother playing Enslaved. The gameplay is enjoyable, sure; clambering around the gorgeous environments is fun, and the combat is solid (if a bit repetitive). The focus for Enslaved, however, is definitely, without a doubt, on the story it tells, the feelings it provokes, and the experience that it leaves with the player.It would be easy to say that the game isn't breaking any new ground here, since it's an adaption of Journey to the West, but the writers took the building blocks of that familiar story, placed them in a completely different setting, and created something both fun and compelling. Aside from the very end, there are no surprises in the plot as everything is clearly foreshadowed; if anything, though, this just increased the impact of certain scenes, as the game builds up feelings of excitement, anticipation, or dread.To me, this is the key to Enslaved's success: every aspect of the game is crafted almost perfectly to evoke these strong emotional responses, from the music to the writing to the visuals (especially the excellent mo-cap for facial expressions, which adds a whole lot to the delivery of each character's lines). By the time the game ended, it really, truly felt like a long journey, and to me that's the most satisfying emotion after completing a game--even with its disjointed environments and simple, text-based transitions (a la ""two weeks later"", etc), it still conveyed all the feelings one would expect with a subtitle like ""Odyssey to the West.""While the gameplay isn't the focus for Enslaved, though, it's still very much enjoyable. The combat felt a bit simple, and there were a few too many fights that were a little bit too long, but fighting has a really satisfying, visceral feel to it. The boss battles perfectly encapsulate both the positives and the negatives of combat: they're exciting and well-crafted, but they take a bit too long to beat and a couple fights are recurring and get a bit boring. About two-thirds of the way through the game, I was starting to get sick of the regular encounters with enemies, but it obviously wasn't enough to dissuade me from the game entirely. The platforming, while a bit simplistic in nature, never got old to me; the puzzles are solid if not spectacular, and the collectibles are a nice diversion without taking away too much of the focus from the rest of the game (Alan Wake really suffered from this).It bears repeating, however, that Enslaved is first and foremost a narrative-focused game. It's a fantastic choice for those who enjoy video games as a storytelling medium, as it provides an incredible experience to the player. It's not as fully realized as something like Spec Ops: The Line--where every single aspect of the game contributed to its narrative--but Enslaved does an excellent job of combining a great story and fun gameplay into a single package.Also, if you played and enjoyed it on a console, it is absolutely worth picking up on PC; it looks and runs very well, and it deserves to be seen at 1080p+/60FPS.

												Ambitious. That's a word I'd use to describe Ninja Theory. In terms of game narrative, this is one studio that goes all-out and is never afraid to stray from the accepted archetypes that have plagued so many other games over the years. Originality, depth of story, and incredibly rich characters are the name of the game, and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West has that in spades. Heavenly Sword, Ninja Theory's previous game, also had those things. However, it was sorely lacking in the gameplay department, a problem that demonstrated why ambition alone is never enough. With Enslaved, Ninja Theory has taken everything good about Heavenly Sword and added the one crucial element -- great gameplay.And by God ... the combination has never tasted so sweet.Enslaved tells the tale of Monkey, a hard-headed loner who must survive in a world where most of humanity is dead, and an army of violent robots stalks the ruins of civilization in its place. After barely bailing from a mech slave ship with his life, Monkey awakens in the wreckage of an escape pod and comes face to face with Trip, a young girl who has trapped him with a slaver's headband that forces him to do as she says, and will kill him if Trip dies. Her terms: get her home, and she'll let him go.Thus starts an uneasy alliance between Monkey and Trip, an alliance that, during the course of the game, evolves and becomes something much more complex, deep, and quite believable. The power dynamic between the two characters constantly shifts as Trip holds Monkey's life in her hands, yet is thoroughly dependent upon him to survive herself. Once a third character, the inimitable Pigsy, is introduced, you have a cast of characters more original, endearing and heartwarming than that of any other videogame released this year. With its loose nods to the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, some excellently written dialog and wonderful vocal performances, Enslaved does what games so often fail to do -- bring its characters to life. The game feels like the odyssey it sets out to be, and the narrative really has it all: genuinely amusing comedy, surprisingly touching tragedy, and plenty of action. As far as action goes, Enslaved has a natural flow between environmental clambering and combat, with the game often seamlessly switching between the two. The game does this with cutscenes as well, giving the entire campaign a sense of natural progression that very few titles have ever achieved.The climbing sections may or may not be a problem depending on what kind of gamer you are. Those who love titles like Prince of Persia may want to be careful with what they expect of Enslaved, as the climbing has not been designed to explicitly challenge the player.Although later climbing sections have traps and pitfalls, Enslaved's monkey business is more geared around delivering a sense of exploration and providing an empowering feeling of acrobatic skill. Indeed, there are no pitfall deaths to fear in this game. Monkey won't jump off something unless he definitively can, and once you find a foothold, it's a pretty clear path from A to B. The lack of challenge might upset some gamers, but I personally appreciated a title that wasn't full of cheap pitfalls, and Monkey moves with such fluidity and speed that it's much better to simply enjoy the ride. Very few games make climbing feel both swift and fun, but Enslaved has done it. There are a few issues, however, with the game's fussiness when it comes to climbing. There are some sections where Monkey clearly has to jump from one platform to another, but the game wants you to stand in one exact spot before letting you do so, and even if you're a few inches away from the ""sweet"" spot, Monkey will simply stumble and refuse to jump. It can get a little annoying, and sometimes it's just confusing, as one could easily be fooled into thinking they've gone the wrong way. Combat is significantly more challenging, but it can be a mixed bag. Monkey is armed with a magic staff that performs light and strong attacks, and can also be wielded like a gun to shoot plasma or stun bolts. Combos are very simple and amount to little more than button mashing, but again, it's the speed and fluidity that really makes it satisfying. Learning when best to stun enemies, perform a crowd-clearing move, block and counter is the key to victory, and while at times the combat is terrific fun, it can also get frustrating. Monkey's dodge move, for instance, is borderline useless, and he also can't cancel attack animations to block, which often means getting pummeled with cheap shots. These issues aside, the combat is mostly pretty good, and feels varied enough despite the simplicity of the commands. Switching up between shooting and melee attacks, not to mention unlocking new moves and enhancements with ""tech orbs"" collected in each stage, makes the combat system feel much deeper than it actually is. It's also somewhat nice to see health packs return to an action game. Health is pretty easy to come by, and you can lengthen the life bar and unlock a regen skill as you delve deeper.With the help of Trip and her pet mechanical dragonfly, Monkey can analyze various enemies and gain the ability to tell which mechs are defective. These defective mechs can be beaten with a special ""takedown"" move so they grant an extra advantage in battle. For instance, defective combat mechs can be taken down and then thrown at other enemies for explosive damage, while an electric-firing variant detonates an EMP shockwave that stuns surrounding foes. It gets a little tiresome watching the dragonfly scan everything at scripted intervals throughout the game, but the various takedown moves are incredibly cool, so it's a fair trade. All of this is fun enough, but it's the interactions between Monkey and Trip that really put Enslaved ahead. In essence, the whole game is an escort mission, except that the person being escorted never becomes a hindrance. Trip is only very rarely in danger, and even then, she is able to temporarily stun enemies to give Monkey a chance to rescue her. Trip didn't die once throughout my entire game, and I never felt like she was a burden. At times, Monkey and Trip will need to create distractions for each other. Commanding Trip is a simple case of opening a command wheel, from which you can tell her to distract enemies or follow you. Monkey also has his own distraction command, and using these simple skills, the duo can avoid enemy gunfire and help each other progress. As with everything in Enslaved, it's an incredibly simple concept, yet it just feels great to pull off. There are other co-op puzzles throughout the game, and while none of them tax the brain, they're not annoying, either.The star of the show, however, has to be the Cloud. A flying disc that Monkey can access at various points of the game, the Cloud scores points not only for being fun, but for being easy to control. It's so easy for ""vehicular"" sections of an action game to fall apart, but by keeping the controls for both Monkey and the Cloud uniform, Ninja Theory has crafted an excellent little steed for our nimble hero. There are also a couple of fantastic boss fights that require use of the Cloud, and the only complaint I have is that the game doesn't give us enough chances to use it. More chase sequences, or just a chance to use it more regularly than being limited to a few areas, would have really been wonderful.A huge part of Enslaved is the art direction and graphics, and I have to say that they are simply stunning. The gorgeous, lush, colorful environments provide a totally different take on post-apocalyptic America than we're used to, and in an industry full of brown and grey. 10/10			"

												I can say this game is worth giving a go, Rami Ismail called it a flawed gem, but i don't know if i'd go that far. The combat is a very samey, the story is okay, Trip (the redhead in the promo image) has terrible pathing. And the game suffers many glitches, none-game breaking that I found but a few needing checkpoint restarts, happily though checkpoints are common.Also get a gamepad or xbox controller for this, keyboard and mouse sucks here and the you will be fighting some less-than-brilliant camera angles so you are going to want that extra joystick for that at least. Story actually gets interesting right at the end of the game so maybe a missed opportunity there I think. Worth trying as a retelling of ""Journey to the West"" but maybe not worth 20 dollars AUD, get it on sale, smash it out in a weekend			"

												This game is not only art, but a masterpiece. It's the culmination of 3 decades of video games. It has just enough dialogue and cutscenes to play as a movie, but just enough gameplay to also be a game. I love it. People who say you can die during cutscenes... don't listen to them, you get to choose when you hear dialogue. You should kill all the enemies before you do that. The ending of this game is truly amazing and raises a very important question on morality. The way boss battles play out is similar to God of war. You wittle ttheir health down then do the right combo of buttons to finish them off. Graphics are AMAZING, they really suck you into this world. Play it if you like epic experiences.			"

												One of those classic adventures from the last days of (what I consider at least) the golden age of game development. When people actually gave two shts to make an adventure that was interesting and not just a collect-a-thon, side questing jerk-around for your wallet. Even the person below me who didn't recommend the game still admitted it ""Kept (them) playing though, somehow""... I'm convinced it's because of the story. It's one you actually want to finish, not one that feels like a chore to get to the end of after 'X' amount of hours. The ending is even more of a trip than the chick named Trip. Gameplay isn't too shabby either, pretty rewarding beating the sht outta things with a giant stickAll in All, I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Glad I picked it up when it was on sale.			"

												Well... It's a solid autoplatformer. Nothing groundbreaking, but if you're not averse to games like Prince of Persia 2008 or Uncharted, you might find the game to your liking as well. Funnily enough, the platforming segments are even less interactive than widely panned PoP2008 (single button+stick for directional input).The environments, especially in the opening chapters were simply beautiful. Great use of color, lush vegetation, decayed civilization. Personally, out of all UE3 games I've played so far, I believe only Spec Ops: The Line could top this game graphic/design-wise. It gets minus points for some rather questionable texture work (at times you would think UE3 glitched out and stopped loading mip-maps of the texture after the first one) and the later levels, especially the junkyard ones, which simply didn't look as nice as the opening segments.Story was... there, I guess. Doesn't make much sense if you try to piece it together, but oh well. It's an action video game, if I wanted a story that wouldn't insult my intelligence I'd read a novel. Characters were all right, mocap work very impressive.Unfortunately, where Spec Ops was a really solid, (un)pleasant experience, I can't say Enslaved was as stress free. There is a well known bug with the game, which results in it freezing randomly once in a while. I'm not sure if you can call it stuttering when the freeze can last up to 30 seconds, and can be almost immediately followed by another one lasting as long. Also, shadows during cutscenes were beyond broken for me.As you can imagine, this completely kills immersion, and is downright infuriating if you're hit with this during a fight or a timed platforming section. I hope my neighbors won't think badly of me now, with the amount of swearwords I uttered while playing (or rather waiting to play) the game.DLC was a completely separate thing, both story and gameplay-wise. And I do mean separate, where the main game had mostly QTE, platforming, fights and bits of shooting, DLC is pretty much a cover-based forced-stealth puzzle game. Reminded me more of an Oddworld game, truth be told. Later sections devolved into shooting galleries, which is a bummer.Overall, both the main scenario and DLC are a good way to spend a few hours. Your enjoyment of it will be largely dependent on how much the bug I mentioned will affect you, and, well, how much you like interactive movies.Price I'd pay for the game and wouldn't feel ripped off? $3.75 tops.

												I want to see more games do to the post-apocalyptic genre that ENSLAVED has done here. There's no cold, drab, desaturated colour-palette; instead, everything from the environments to the characters are beautifully vibrant. If there was a single word to describe this game it would have to be ""lush"".There's not much to the story, there's almost no exposition, but that's okay. I enjoy how the very, very few characters interact with each other. The humour and insults exchanged throughout the dialogue are quirky at first, and there were a few words said that I wasn't expecting to hear from a game such as this, but I found it hilarious and strangely comforting. Maybe because I'd grown attached to what appears to be the only humans left in existence.There are a number of issues, though. Firstly, the battle camera is horrendous, it makes fighting a lot more difficult than it needs to be as there is no lock-on camera. The field of view is so close to your character it's hard to tell when to block or evade an incoming attack. The battle system is also quite clunky, fighting numbers of enemies at once with melee attacks is sometimes frustrating and tactics such as countering and evading attacks aren't accurate. I found that maximising your ranged weapon's upgrades makes it a lot easier in order to manage groups of enemies from a distance.The story also seemed to come to an abrupt end. I feel as though an additional one or two chapters would have improved how the last portion of the game unfolded but that's not to say it was a poor ending, it just seemed to be over sooner than I'd have liked. It's a shame too, because the ending raised more questions than had been answered; it was a huge contrast to what I'd previously experienced through my journey and not at all something that I expected to happen.I also hugely appreciate that the optional collectibles throughout the map actually add to the significance of the story. It's not clear at first what meaning is behind them but it all comes together quite neatly in the end.			"

												Very underrated action adventure. It should definitly see more love!In ENSLAVED: Odyssey to the West you will follow Trip and Monkey through the post-apocalyptic USA after you have fled from a slave-ship. Monkey, who is now forced to help Trip, protects her during their search for a way to bring her home. While Trip brings the brain, Monkey brings the muscles. To overcome all struggles you have to make best use of both. As the story progresses both characters will often interact and their relationship develops from a mere Master-to-slave-situation to a real friendship.GameplayBecause Trip is not much of a fighter you have to play the warrior. Luckily Monkey has some vast knowledge about beating up one or two mechs! During the tutorial you learn all the basic moves. And every time Monkey learns a new trick a note pops up on your screen. The fighting is very easy and intuitive. You havea strong, a weak but fast, a charged, and a radial attack. Alternativly your weapon can shoot stun and beam attacks. All viable in most situations. But enough of Monkeys skills. What does Trip actually do? Well not that much. But the developer tried to make your VIP not totally garbage. She scans the environment for traps, mechs for weakspots, and decoys enemies so Monkey can sneak away. Also she is not totally defenceless. She has a EMP which stuns mechs for a short period of time when they come to close.The good+ well-written story and likeable protagonists+ fluent and intuitive combat+ less generic end-scenario and a bit more ""believable""+ good music and actors+ good animationsThe average~ eventhough it's one big escort mission it doesnt feel like a chore to protect Trip because of the developing relationship between her and Monkey. Also she is not completely useless and has some nice utilities~ dated (last generation) graphics~ linear but beautiful levels~ the climbing passages are mediocre but still good enough to have fun (quite simliliar to Tomb Raider)The bad- you can't configure the keys and the menu is missing precision when using a mouse- horrible camera movement which is not optimised for PC usageConlusionA good game worth your time if you like action-adventures, a good story and smashing robots with a stick.

												I nominated this game for the ""Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!” 2016 Steam Award.The motion capture animation in this game lends itself well to this astounding cinematic experience. Andy Serkis (of Lord of the Rings - Gollum fame) did the motion for one of the main characters and it made me want to see games use real actors more often.When friends ask me what my favorite adventure game is I tell them this one. Everything works together for an amazing experience. I played this from start to finish in a matter of days, something I rarely do.			"

												In short, a game that lives up to the name: an Odyssey with narrative/gameplay varying between moments of contemplation, discovery, comedy, tragedy, companionship and plenty of action.First things first: Andy Serkis is a real talented fellow, kudos to him.The game environment is absolutely beautiful, one of the game's highlights for sure, and the dynamics developed by the 3 main characters gives the story great pacing and keeps the player engaged.The passages between areas of exploration / platforms / combat are well balanced and keep the experience fresh.On the downside, I had a few hickups in the camera angles during the fighting phases, but nothing really annoying.I also thought the last 2 chapters didn't keep the same pace / interest, perhaps because they are set in more straightforward setting without much mistery, but the epilogue compensated it with a good plot twist.As a final note, I have to say this: if you like adventures, you have to try this game out. It will surprise you from the beggining and keep you wanting to know more.			"

												This game is a pleasant surprise. A sold platform/action game.The graphics are nice and the environment is very pretty. The gameplay is nice (at least with a controller, can't say about keyboard and mouse). The combat could use a few more combos, but it's still solid. The voice acting is good, as is the music.The only thing i complain about is the story. Don't get me wrong, the story in itself is not bad, although very predictable, but there's lack of lore and the ending doesn't really make much sense imo. Or at least didn't answer much of the questions i had, and left me with even more question.Still the game is worth it's price.8.5/10			"

A touching story that is memorable and leads us to an afterthought while bearing in mind the addictive and clever game.ENSLAVED: Odyssey to the West consists of several simple elements, all well connected together, so that manages to maintain excellent pace and never bring the player to boredom. But the most important thing in the game is the story, in which the gameplay is just an attachment. Not only perfectly presented, rooted in the realities of interesting and filled with charismatic characters, but also thought-provoking. And this in video games is still a rarity.PROS:PlotCharacters and their relationships (Pigsy rules!)Post-apocalyptic climateFacial animationConsistent, specific artworkVariety of gameplayKeeps you in suspense until the very endMust-see final (The whole is topped with heavily surprising ending, which every player should interpret in their own way.)CONS:Many simplifications related to gameplayMinor technical mistakesWhen you finish this game, it feels like you have broken up with a girlfriend.

												This game has an interesting story/concept, but it's such a bad console port. Right from the starting message (do not power down your console when you see this save icon) to the camera controls. You're constantly being grabbed by the chin and made to look in a certain direction, so it's a real struggle to keep the camera pointed at where you're going or the enemies you're fighting.Cherry on top of the cake: I alt tabbed a few times, the ground disappeared, textures messed up and it crashed.

VERDICT: Buy Immediately (10/10) Completion Time: 7-8 hoursBottom Line: ""Don't wait any longer and get this game.""PROS+Massive and Beautiful World+Excellent and Diverse Gameplay+Engaging Story+Musical Score+Excellent Optimization+THAT ENDING THOUGHCONS-Controller strongly recommended, otherwise good luck lolREVIEWThis is hands down my favorite adventure game of all time. It has absolutely everything you could want in a game, and in a world where games struggle to capture my attention for an extended period of time, this adventure had me engaged until the very end.Enter Monkey, a man who wakes up on a slave ship in the distant future. Humanity has fallen to a war with machines, and our hero has been captured by a slave ship run by robots and the mysterious organization ""Pyramid"". Then Tripp, another girl captured on the ship, inadvertantly helps you escape. From this point on you need to help Tripp return to her home village in the West. That's the basic story, but the relationship that forms between these two characters through the course of the game is not only believable, but keeps you, the player, going. This is all attributed to the pitch perfect voice acting, and detailed facial animation system. And let me just say, it's been years since my first completion on the Xbox 360 and I still think about the ending to this game.The gameplay boils down to combat with robots, traversing gigantic set pieces, and completing simple puzzles. Everything about this game is so incredibly smooth. Combat feels great as you unleash deadly combos on your enemies with a variety of abilities, and the finishing moves look amazing. Traversing is similar to Assassin's Creed, and many of these sequences involve climbing crumbling buildings, massive robots, and everything in between. The puzzles are an easy distraction and aren't too challenging, but probably the weakest aspect of the game.My favorite part of the game is the world. The art direction is absolutely gorgeous. The world of Enslaved has been reclaimed by nature, and the first half of the game has you venturing through locations with lush green and vibrant reds. In the later stages the levels become more mechanical, and heavy hues of purple become a regular theme. Every once in a while I just had to stop and look around to admire the view, it's that amazing.Other things I'd like to note are that the musical score is epic and really conveys a post-apocolyptic feel, and the game ran perfectly on my laptop with no issues to report.Bottom line, don't wait any longer and get this game. It's beautiful, fun, and you will not soon forget it.			"

												I ignored this game when it first came out because I thought it was just another wannabe 3D platformer with ICO bits grafted in. But I recently saw this in a sale on GMG and thought why the heck not and bought it. Boy am I glad I did. What a wonderful gaming experience!Inspired by but very loosely based on the ancient Chinese tale, Journey to the West, ENSLAVED: Odyssey to the West is one of the best 3D action games I have played. With a script written by Alex Garland as well as voice acting and mocapping by Andy Serkis, the story is one of the best I have experienced in a video game. Set in a post-apocalyptic USA, art design is splendid and it looks like the art team took their inspiration from the documentary Life After People, which isn't a bad thing. Setpieces are amazing, from beginning to end.Gameplay however is merely adequate. Yes, it gets the job done. Yes. platforming segments are fun, especially if you love Uncharted-style platforming. But puzzles are super-easy and combat is just... perfunctory. It's not deep and it just seems to be there for the sake of being there.The PC port isn't perfect either. I had input problems occasionally (usually after cutscenes). And while I have a fast PC (Core i7-3770, AMD Radeon HD7870XT), most times the game didn't feel like it was running at 60fps even though I had it vsynced. I didn't check but it also seemed that anti-aliasing didn't really work even though I had it switched on in the settings. I'm also left wondering whether the game was even running at 1080p.But even with those slight hiccups, I enjoyed my time with it. I wholly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good action-platformer. It truly is an underrated gem.			"

Not a perfect console port and I had to meddle with the ini files a bit to get everything working as I should, but it was really worth it.Also, some save points are buggy, make sure you don\t click restart from checkpoint too often as it might pull you back to the beginning of a section.

												First of all I'm gonna say this is not going to be an in-depth review of the game but rather a point by point review of what really stood out to me in this game.-GRAPHICS:This is a port of a game that originally came out on the Xbox 360 and PS3 in 2010 (I believe) but later made it's way to steam.  I make that point because the graphics are beautiful - they really are! The face animations for the lead characters are humanly accurate and the textures for the world are stunning. You won't be let down.-STORYThe story was good, but I'm not talking about the actual plot here. I'm talking about the character development between the two lead characters progress very well as the frustrated yet powerful 'Slave' and the vulnerable yet dominating 'Slave owner' grow a bond that I won't spoil, but will say it was welcomed.As for the main plot; well, it is what it is. It's good! But if you've watched most of the major sci-fi filmes of the last 20 years you'll recognise what book this page is ripped right out of.-PIGSY'S REVENGEI played the Premium Edition of the game that comes with all the extra costumes and a nice expansion pack called 'Pigsys Revenge' which is pleasantly long, and surprisingly good! You are not the physically powerful 'Monkey' of the main story but a grotesquely obese gadget god of the wastes; meaning you have to rely on gadgets in every room you enter. Which is great, because it's a nice change of pace compared to the main story. You have to stop and think in EVERY situation you enter.Overall this game gets a 9.5/10. I'm taking .05 off because the story is just not original enough. The rest of the game however, is a professionally polished joy ride.			"

												I'm honestly uncertain if I want to recommend this game or not. Pros: -Pretty graphics -Interesting world, characters and story. -Good voice actingCons: -Extremely linear gameplay, almost boringly so. I've been on actual train rides that have been less railroaded. I get that it is for console gamers originally, but please, they cannot be that weakminded. Not a single place in the game can you figure stuff out for yourself, which pathway to take, or which way to solve a problem. You're basically just following instructions the whole game. -A lot of the gameplay involves jumping, but you can't jump wrong and there is only one path, so most of the time you don't need to see or aim where you're jumping. Just hit whatever direction you're going and jump, jump, jump. Ta-da, you're there. -Occasional annoyances due to camera angles-Some sections are impossible to succeed at unless you're very lucky or you know where the next obstacle is going to be. -The port from console is not flawless, sometimes when selecting menus with the mouse the cursor is not where it is supposed to be. -Unskipable cut-scenes. That you have to watch again and again if you die at a difficult section. Seriously, this is not acceptable! Main gripe:This could have been an awesome game. But the way it has been designed, it should have been an animation movie instead. There's just not enough actual game in it. The player has no agency. I still finished the game, because I wanted to see where it was going and I was marginally pleased. No spoilers, but a waste-disposal related question popped into my mind when I saw the end cutscene, which is the kind of thing that annoys me. Aside from that anal-retentive (pun may be intended) technicality, the game as a whole just doesn't do it for me. There were times in the early game when I thought, this is going to be neat once all the hand-holding and easy linear paths become more complex, but that never happened. As such, I would not recommend this game if you're looking for a good game. If on the other hand you're looking for a cute interactive animated series, then, heck, it's all right for that purpose.

I had really fun time playing this game. Interesting main story, with cloudy back story and this game left me wanting to know what happened next. I guess it is too good to hope about second part of this game or some kind of other game in the same universe to continue developing this world. Game mechanics is easy. reminded me prince of persia just a lot less hardcore version of that. You can't jump of the cliff like in POP there you had endless ways to die. Get xbox 360 controller or something like that. Game ment to be played on consoles and consoles input is the best. Tried with keyboard and didn't like that . finished all game with the controller.I can recommend this game, have funny time playing it.			"

												A linear Action/Adventure game made Ninja Therory (makers of DmC: Devil May Cry) starring Andy Serkis as Monkey.Backed by great motion capture and voice work, the development of the relationship between Monkey and Trip is one of the strong points of this ""Journey to the West"".At first, the journey is about taking Trip from one place to another while protecting her from the mechs left over from the war that destroyed the world.For that, you can carry her on your back (:3), throw her in other areas, she can distract enemies, disable them with an EMP, upgrade your skills, etc.And she is also used in the puzzle solving.Then there is the combat, which is more on the tactical side, ""slow"", you have to wait for the right time to attack.There are different close and long range attacks for damage, crow control, area of effect, there are blocks and dodges, you can Takedown an enemy and explode them into others, etc.The traversing of the environment (""platforming"") is where the game pretty much plays itself, you just aim, press a button and Monkey will jump on the glowy areas, the only danger is when some of them fall.Still, it feels pretty good, when you press at the right moments he'll immediately swing from one place to another with fluid monkey-like animations.If you enjoy games like Tomb Raider (2013), Alice: Madness Return or the Batman Arkham series, you will probably enjoy Enslaved.This is a console port so the game has some performance problems but nothing unlayable.Check the Steam Guides for some tweaks, unlocking DLC costumes early and removing intro logos.Playing with the Keyboard and Mouse is possible but the sensitivity is weird and there are only Xbox 360 button prompts.With the Xbox 360 controller it plays perfectly.

												I expected a generic Action/Adventure game and the game delivered... With something extra.Going through the first few chapters, ENSLAVED: Odyssey to the West felt like a normal action-platforming game with an interesting story, but it became better.Even with a not-so-special battlesystem, the action in this game is still something fun. You'll find yourself battling enemies quite some time between the usual platforming. So if the battlesystem doesn't suit you (it takes some time getting used to, the game getting far more easy if you get into it), you might not have a lot of fun.The platforming itself is not much of a big deal. Sure, the game has decent graphics and pleasing sceneries but the controls can be a bit annoying when you're hurrying. For example, your character not jumping because your aim was slightly off, not correctly pushing the analog stick the right way.Now we're talking about controls, yes I did play the game with a controller and overall it was fine, besides the camera working against me sometimes. Can't say much about the keyboard and mouse controls 'cause I haven't tried it myself, but lots say that a controller is recommended since this game is a (pretty good) console port.That game at normal difficulty is actually quite easy. First you'll have some problems learning how to defeat enemies efficiently making the game quite hard first but after a few chapters it does get really easy, especially if you get the (health) upgrades. Regeneration makes surviving a whole lot easier, and never actually found myself in need of the health syringes you can get from your companion Trip, who I forgot to mention. (Yes, part of the game is basically an escort mission, but no, Trip won't get in your way at all.)Also want to give a quick shoutout to the voice actors! They did a really great job.TLDR: The game might not look like anything special at first sight, but doesn't fail to deliver. The gameplay isn't anything new yet is still fun. The story (based on an old Chinese novel) is great and makes up for the few cons this game has. Definetely worth a buy.			"

												Like many others I overlooked this game when it was released on consoles several years ago. I simply love anything with a post-apocalyptic theme so it is somewhat odd that it has taken until now for me to get stuck into this. The storyline is based very loosely on the novel 'Journey to the West' written by Wu Cheng'en. But unlike the original story that is set in a fantasy version of ancient China, Enslaved is set 150 years into the future following a global war, with only the remnants of humanity left along with mechs left over from the conflict.What is refreshing though is that coupled with the damsel in distress angel, the world after the war is actually beautiful to look at. The usual reliance on a grey and brown colour pallete is not here, instead Ninja Theory have taken a different approach and the world hums with light and colour. The ruined city of New York, now decayed and destroyed has been taken back by nature (think of the documentary 'Life After People' and you've got the idea). The games great art style is not restricted to the scenery, as the characters are also pleasing to the eye, especially during the cutscence sequences.The game is a mostly linear experience that is heavily narrative driven, but this is combined with good action/adventure and platforming mechanics. If you're familiar with console games like Uncharted, you'll be familiar with the formula here. Get from A to B, fight a few monsters, climb on some buildings/structures along your way and deal with the occasional boss.So go on and buy it! It's worth the asking price. "

												I had high hopes for this game, but in reality it's a sloppy mess. A bad PC port, horrible camera and poor controls hamper what could of been a fun game. You spend more time wrestling with the game than playing it. You are constantly sabotaged while fighting by a camera that spins away from enemies, a autotargeting system that fails to target anything remotely useful, attacks that get redirected into thin air, attacks that simply pass through targets as the autotargeting decides to hit something else out of range. An unresponsive combat system, combo's that don't end even when you stop pressing buttons, and game crippling bugs that will force you to replay areas that you already cleared. The list of problems goes on and on... Attacks that won't activate, dying during some minor animation clip as it paralyses you while the mechs are still moving and attacking. This game might of been passable 3 years ago on console but in todays world we expect some finesse in our combat and controls you will find this title sadly lacking. Its just a button mash of a game, with little skill required.The character ""acting"" is the highlight of this game however, as it was when it first came out with some great moments in the cut-scenes that work better than most games.If you want to play this game, pull it out of the bargain bin. I completed it on Hard on my first playthrough out of pure spite. And shame on the publishers for not having the games crippling bugs fixed in their game after 3 months of release time.			"

												Great game. Good graphic, plot. Bad cloud control. Great included DLC. 8/10Отличный, не очень сложный слешер. Неплохой сюжет. Завязано на героях древнего китайского произведения ""Путешествие на запад"". Когда появляется Пигси - так вообще все становится замечательно и весело.Ачивки довольно несложные. Все делаются часов за 20-25.Местами кривоватое управление (особенно с полетами на облаке).Отдельного внимания требует ДЛС. Оно просто отличное. Вот все бы такие делали. Добавляет геймплея часа на 2-4. В нем играешь за Пигси.В целом отличная игра 8/10.			"

												I have played and completed the PS3 version of the game and would complely recommend that to anyone. That being said I wanted to play it again on my trusty PC and I was 100% disapointed. It is a PC port so going in you expect it too not be perfect.... But come on Namco, this is just silly. I had a Loading screen in the middle of combat, the AA actually makes this game look terrible and lets not talk about the camera.... Or maybe yet, lets! The forced perspective is asinine. You want to look to your left? Too damn bad, we are going to zap the camera back over to the left over Monkey's shoulder. I get severe motion sickness and even with the motion blur off I couldn't keep going. The constant fighting with the camera angles forcing me to stop playing after 5 minutes was enough to uninstall.I know it's a underrated game, and one of the VERY vrey games I was willing to play a second time around but the port over is just terrible to the point of making me physically sick. It's a great game, just not on the PC.			"

												From the team that made DmC Reboot (which I wasn't a fan of) comes Enslaved, a super charming, beautiful game. I first played this on the PS3 when it launched but its poor frame rate turned me off the game. Fast forward a few years, I bought this on a Steam sale, just an impulse purchase and didnt play it for a long time. This year I finally wanted to go through my Steam backlog and gave it another chance and I'm so happy I did. Enslaved gives me a lot of Beyond Good & Evil vibes (it even has a pig character!), the game has stunning environments, good narative driven cut scenes and a great atmosphere. It runs super smooth on my PC and is a joy to play. You collect orbs to upgrade your character, there's a good amount of Prince of Persia style platforming, some stealth and adventure sections and combat sprinkled in between. The game has good mechanics and has impressed me so much that I feel like replaying DmC again. I went in with super low expectations and I'm pleasantly surprised how good Enslaved is and how it managed to keep me hooked. Going forth, I'm a fan of Ninja Theory and looking forward to their next game.Thumbs up / 10			"

												Let me start by saying firstly you 100% need a controller to play this right.I had never even heard of this game when i got it. Thought i would try it out, and being someone with 400+ games and always feeling like none of the games I have I feel like playing, this one felt casual enough, but still had a story I wanted to see out to make me want to play. Graphicly sure its a little dated, but still looks good, game play, with a controller its not as cluncky as people say. I really dont mind this game, and I do no write reviews unless I get something out of it (achieves or the like) normally, I write this one as I actually think more people should try this lil gem out.

 Enslaved: Odyssey to the West  is an extraordinary game, a game that I feel is hugely underrated, a game that is one of the hidden gems of the last generation. TL;DR version in the bottom of the review.  STORY:  A reimagining of the Chinese novel ""Journey to the West"" by Wu Cheng'en. It’s set in a bleak overgrown with vegetation post-apocalyptic world, ruled by slavers and machinery, you follow Monkey and Trip on their journey to get Trip back to her home safely. If Trip dies, you (Monkey) die. The game's opening pulls you into the story and it never let you go; you're constantly on the lookout for what's next!I won't spoil much because the story is the game's highlight for me. GAMEPLAY:  The game is an action-adventure platformer at heart with some simple puzzles thrown at you a few times to shake up the game's pace a bit. The combat is simple, yet fun enough to keep you engaged through the game's 7-hour campaign. Red glowing orbs are the game's currency; they are used to upgrade Monkey's fighting capabilities, health, and shield. Weird floating white masks are the extra collectibles found within the game; they reveal much about the game's world and story since they give you glimpses of life before the war.One of the major gripes with the gameplay is the camera, sometimes you'll be fighting the camera instead of fighting the enemies! Another noticeable flaw in the game is the lack of direction in some of the platforming areas as you’ll be wandering around aimlessly until you find the correct path. GRAPHICS:  Varied beautiful looking locales with vivid colors shining all through the game coupled with great animations and facial expressions that bring the characters to life. Motion capture genius Andy Serkis worked on the game's motion capture and he even co-wrote the game's story (he also appears in the game and he is Monkey's voice actor) . The game runs on Unreal engine 3 which runs really well. Don't expect to be blown away by the game’s graphical prowess, though, it’s a 2010 console game. The game relies on its style to impress. AUDIO:  Superb voice acting that brings the characters to life. The soundtrack sets the mood right in every scene, whether being chased by a mechanical rhino or chilling in a boat gazing at the stars, the soundtrack is mesmerizing.TL;DR:Pros: Amazing, captivating story set in a believable world and lovable characters. Great platforming gameplay Simple yet fun combat Short but sweet (7 hours)Cons: Wonky camera (at times) Misguided platforming paths in some sections Short but sweet (7 hours) 9/10  "

												It has some definite flaws--for example, it checkpoints before unskippable cutscenes, so when you die you have to watch them again. The gameplay was fun but did get a bit repetitive for me by the end of the game (it took me about 10 hours). There's also a gamebreaking bug if you're on low graphics settings that you can only fix by replaying the fight on high settings. BUT I thought the story was compelling and the characters were just fantastic, and the game was definitely fun overall, so I'd absolutely recommend it.			"

												Very interesting adventure. I'm not even saying game, as it was really cinematic. Maybe call it ""an experience""? I played this on X360 a few years ago. Didn't even know it was on PC, but then I saw it on the featured page for five euros (-75% off) and snatched it right away.Even though the game is developed by Ninja Theory (company that later went ahead and made the new Devil May Cry), the game is very story driven. So if you are the type who likes to skip all the cutscenes and go straight into action, this game might not be for you.Story is well written and takes some influences from ""Journey to the West"" which was a nice touch. Graphical style is very lively and has vibrant colors. The game still looks good, even though it's from the last generation.Combat is nothing spectacular, basic hack and slash and doesn't really evolve during the game all that much.Definitely a good pick, at least when it's on sale.

												I've never heard of this game before a friend on Steam recommended it to me. At the first glance, the game is absolutely gorgeous, despite its age. But our first meeting was marred by a s-hitty camera and bad controls (keyboard and mouse). I was told it'd be better with a controller but I don't have one to test it with. But anyway, I managed to complete the game with only keyboard + mouse.The Chinese story (or legend) that it was based on, Journey to the West, is a personal favourite of mine; and so, I persevered and boy, was I glad I did. I got used to the control somehow (though it did still gave me problems, especially during fights), and I fell in love with the game. I didn't even take to Trip initially because she was very needy and all, but she grew on me. There was never a dull moment in the game and even though it's a face-paced game, the dialogues gave us valuable snippets and insights into the characters' personalities and helped the players' immersion into the story.+ Loved the graphics; for a post-apocalyptic world, it was vibrant and stunning+ Loved the characters, yes, even Trip, the damsel in distress (""Save me, Monkey!"" ~ *sigh*).+ Loved the dialogues, especially the light and funny banter between the characters.+ Good melee system, though simple.+ Great story.+ Superb voice acting.+ Very forgiving check points.- S-hitty non-flexible camera, sometimes made me dizzy- Average controls (keyboard + mouse)- Easy and short final boss fight.- Unskippable cut scenes - Linear; path is marked. It was sad to say goodbye to the characters; I WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WITH TRIP AND MONKEY NEXT. *sigh* I wish there'll be a sequel.Anyway, yes, I was glad I gave it a second chance. It was definitely a fun ride. Would absolutely recommend this at its original price, and it's a no-brainer if it's on sale. My Rating: 9/10			"

												10/10 at being an action adventure game. Controls are very responsive, the game design is interesting, rather than ""annoying"" like action adventure games tend to be. The graphics and art are gorgeous, though keep in mind I'm not a current gen gamer in most respects, different people say ""wow"" at different levels of graphics. The music is....bland, but theme appropriate. The voice acting is good.Another important thing, it detected my Xbox One controller right away, as we know ""full controller support"" doesn't always mean full controller support.It's very much a console game so I don't think kb+m would be a very fun way to play.The character personalities are kinda..ah...campy, I guess... the game isn't going to leave you saying ""wow how deep"". Someone strongly gender conscious might take issue with the male-female/masculine-feminine dynamic going on, since there's some clear definition in the game; The two characters are strong and weak, protector and protected, etc... It isn't enough to offend me personally, but it might be enough for others.The story telling is done in medias res, and the game fully respects the average gamer's attention span and lack of patience.My standards for judging an action adventure game aren't exactly tough, however, there have been annoying design elements/styles in this genre through recent gens that will make my opinion of a game plummet when I encounter them, and this game doesn't have any such serious cons.TOTALLY worth the sale price.

												Truly one of the best games I've played in recent years. Some of the best writing, characters, set pieces, visuals, animations and gameplay to date.The voice acting is perfectly delivered with both witty and serious dialogue.Trip is a genuinely helpful companion which makes the game feel less like an escort mission, and more like a co-operative experience.I have no idea how this game seemingly flew under both my and everyone else's radar since it came out.I would wholeheartedly recommend anyone who is a fan of third-person platformers and hack-and-slash games to pick this up immediately. 9.5/10  "

												In a future Where man lives in constant fear of slavers and mechsAn unlikely duo can make a differenceTrip is a young woman, her skills include: hacking, giving orders, and causing distractions.Monkey is a bit of an enigma, and thanks to a headband, is under Trip's control. He's the character you play as, and you'll spend much of the game climbing around, keeping an eye out for Trip, and crushing mechs with your staff. There are even rare moments where he can use a hoverboard (which he refers to as a ""cloud"") to cross over lakes and such.The parellels to the classic Chinese novel ""Journey to the West"" are pretty obvious.As an action-adventure game, Enslaved leads towards the simplistic side of things. Well, perhaps simplistic isn't the word I'm looking for. Overly approachable, casual, automated, ehhh I'm better off just explaining it. Enslaved is one of those games that would have been very difficult a generation or three ago. Let's use Tomb Raider for comparison. The original game featured some difficult platforming segments. You had to account for several different possibilities. Is Lara moving fast enough? Did she jump at the right moment? Are there obstacles nearby? Fast-forward through numerous sequels and now you don't have to worry about where and when to jump. If you're facing the right direction, Lara will always make the jump. Enslaved pushes this game-design even further. You can't die from falling even if you wanted to, Monkey won't allow it. I think I managed a falling death once, and that was by getting zapped out of the air by a Mech. It was more of a fluke than anything.There is a lot of fighting to be done in this game, but it's typically very trivial. I have to wonder how Capcom decided Ninja Theory was a good fit for Devil May Cry after playing through this game. While not quite a button-masher, Enslaved's combat doesn't require much effort. Enemies fall into certain camps. There are the close-range slashers, the long-range shooters, shockers have some mid-range ability, sometimes they have shields. The strategy rarely deviates from ""hit them really hard"" or ""blast them with plasma and/or stun shots"". Also, there's not much in the way of stylish maneuvers. Monkey does some flipping and spinning around, but he's not pulling off any Dante-esque combos. None of the mechs survive long enough anyway. I made the mistake of playing this game on the easy difficulty. Not only did Monkey never die (in combat), he never lost more than 1/5th of his health. It's best to jump straight to the hard difficulty, which doesn't make much of a difference aside from everyone doing a bit more damage. Most of my deaths came from mines.With easy combat and platforming, Enslaved thrives almost entirely on its other aspects. The locales in this game are pretty neat to visit, and there's some nice attention to detail in this post-apocalyptic land. The pacing is also effectively done, with a nice balance between combat, puzzle-solving, and a hint of exploration. Some credit should also be given to the chapter setup. This game is broken up into 14 chapters, and most of them can be completed in 15-20 minutes. You can play for a fairly short amount of time, and still make quite a bit of progress. I prefer this over having something like 5 chapters that take an hour or more to get through. As an action game, Enslaved is bound to disappoint. It does work as more of an adventure game though. The world is impressively-realized, the characters (all three of them) are well-done, and for the most part it's a breezy experience that you just take in. Three characters? Oh right...can't forget about Pigsy.This dude is another reference to Journey to the West. While human, Pigsy is also part...mecha pig. He's a fat slob with an eye for Trip, and he wears socks with his sandals. Unlike his inspiration, this little piggy prefers a sniper rifle over an 11,000 pound rake. In the latter half of the game he's the comic relief, and he ain't too bad at it. He also has his own quest. This was originally DLC in the console version of Enslaved. Pigsy's Perfect 10 follows his misadventures in building a new friend. As I said, Enslaved has three characters, it's a pretty lonely world.Unlike Monkey, Pigsy isn't very tough, punch or stab him a couple times and he's a goner. In order to survive, you have to sneak around, make your shots count, and take advantage of various gadgets. Unlike the main game, there's actually a bit of creativity and depth that goes into each encounter. Simply blasting everyone is never the answer, but you can distract them, stun them, seduce them(?!) to fight your enemies, or simply destroy them with a bomb. While this quest does run a bit long, I think it does a good job at providing something different from the rest of Enslaved. The similarities to cover-based shooters are apparent, but PP10 does enough to stand out. This is pretty impressive for a DLC adventure.			"

												Just finished the game, and I've got to say, it was fantastic.  I was worried coming into it, because I read a lot of reviews and forum comments that said this was a game ""on rails"", completely linear and therefore, terrible.Well that's just wrong. Sure, it is a linear game, but I thought there was still enough exploring of the areas you went though that it was open enough. Just because a game isn't an open world/sandbox game, doesn't mean it's bad. As for the game being on rails? I read a review that said the game babied you, showed you exactly where to go and what do the whole time, but in my case at least, that wasn't true. There was a few times in the game I was stuck, and not because of a bug in the game, but because I was stumped. And when I figured out to do, it was a slap to the ol' forehead, but that type of puzzle platforming is good to me.Now on to combat: There is some criticism to be made, because outside of ""boss"" battles, there are like 3 or 4 different types of enemies you will fight throughout the game. Once you learn the best way to take each one down, combat becomes easier, but I still died my fair share of times in the game, trying to figure out the right strategy for the certain environment/enamies I was dealing with. The combat system is not cut and dry though, even though there are limited combos you can learn in the game. But the different combos come with the upgrade system, as well as many other ""perks"" that you sometimes find in games like these. Somewhat similar to the Batman Arkham games ""perk"" system (Only other recently played game that has something like that, so it came to mind). Last word for combat: It's freaking awesome feeling and looking to finish off a group of mechs, they've got some great animations for the final kill. And that's not to mention the cinematics of the boss fights/finishes.Now where the game is really great, is the story. That's what got me to buy the game regardless of the negative reviews/comments. I saw a lot of good reviews/comments saying that the story made the game worth it. I honestly didn't think the rest of the game was as bad as people make it out to be, but I will agree that the story is fantasic. It really isn't the best story ever, but it's pretty damm good, and what makes it even better is the feeling you will develop for the characters in the game. I can't even get into that part of it because of spoilers, but if you like a good story with engaging characters that you develop bonds with, then this game is probably one that you will enjoy.			"

												To get the cons out of the way:  Occasionally you find yourself stuck on a random bit of scenery.  This isn't game breaking, it's not forever stuck, sometimes you just hit it at the wrong angle and you roll instead of jumping, which is only really frustating in the timed sections in which you die you don't make that jump.Also, the camera occasionally just decides that you should definately be looking in THIS direction, right now -- which is maddening when you're trying to aim, or find the next hand hold, or whatever.All that said, the game is fantastic.  The Graphics aren't bleeding edge or anything, but it's colorful, well drawn, well animated,  I'd call it decidedly pretty, and a huge relief after years of gritty brown ""realism.""Combat is intuitive and easy to pick up, some of the mechanics are great fun, and as someone who is not a fighting game junkie, that means a lot.  The climbing and jumping around bits are fluid and entertaining.  The characters are likeable, even though the escortee does do the occasional annoying reminding you of the objective every two minutes shtick that escortees do, you still find yourself rooting for them.There's a romance, bit it doesn't feel awkward, or forced or slapped on in post production, it's actually a bit of a slow burn and quite enjoyable.  No sudden but inevitable declarations, no because-the-back-story-said-so -- there's actual chemistry and lingering glances.This game sucks you in, and rarely lets you up for air, so try not to start it an hour before you have to be somewhere -- you are going to be late.

												This game is a diamond in the rough. It has one of the most interesting settings I've ever seen and the character development is phenomenal. The voice acting in particular is some of the best in all of video games. The only real downside is that gameplay is as standard as you can get. It is mostly a God of War style hack n' slach with a needless and hideously broken RPG style upgrade system. The level design is reminicent of Devil May Cry but the platforming is contextual, meaning there is only one real way to go and is impossible to fail. There is some form of collectible hunting but it is mostly tied to the upgrade system, makeing it almost just as needless.The gameplay in the DLC would have better suited the entire game, with abilities unlocking via progression and the game presenting you with a problem and expecting you to resolve it with what you have at your disposal. All in all, as someone who values story, setting and Immersion over gameplay, this game is pure gold and comes highly recomended. Indeed even considering the lack luster gameplay, I was completly won over by the charm and richness of the setting and story.			"

												It pains my heart to give this a 'not recommended'.However, this must be the laziest console-to-PC port I've ever played. If you don't own a gamepad, then do yourself a favour and avoid this game.It's a shame, because I was actually enjoying the storyline. It's well-acted and intriguing. Unfortunately, the controls messed up the experience completely. The default key-assignments left a lot to be desired, so I changed them. Then I found out that the game didn't recognise half the changes I made. This made it impossible to play past a certain point early on.How did the developers not notice this? I guess it's too late to get anyone to fix this, but until then I'm going to leave this game to gather digital dust.			"

												3rd person, post apocalyptic, action brawler with puzzles and platforming. Story is basically about couple survivors on Earth, after terrible cataclysm and/or war that devastated the planet, turning most of it into wasteland and ruins. To not spoil the story, you fight robots that are taking people as slaves, so you and your companion try to find out why they do it. You gather Tech orbs around the environment and killed enemies, to spend them on upgrades. Combat is mostly melee attacks with some ranged abilities. Your companion will often help you with Intel and useful survival skills, yet she can't fend for herself and require constant babysitting. Game has great voice acting and humor, good looking main character models, nice in game environments yet poor texture quality. You are looking for up to 10 hours of gameplay.			"

												This games awesome for a number of reasons, +The environments are beautiful, + story is a big ole homage to ""Monkey: Journey to the West"" and they make that very clear (so don't go b!+*hing about it and claim that this game is a rip-off)+With a gamepad it's pretty smooth for platforming and the combats good; it gets progressively difficult in a good way.My main fault with this game is the character of Trip. but first- Lets look at Monkey as a character: He's so strong that he can rip countless metal killing machines apart with his bare hands. He's so agile he can do crazy swinging flips and jump such enourmous gaps that even Nathan Drake might get jelous. And he's so level-headed that he stays calm in the craziest situations, he doesn't freak out or become spiteful .. he just deals with the problem he's faced with. Basically he's absolutely frikin awesome.Now lets look at Trip. - Despite her phisique, She can't fight. At all. When a situation comes up, she just cowers and hides and leaves the male to deal with it. She can't jump a lot of gaps, so Monkey has to constanly deal with puzzles and enemies just to give her a smaller gap to cross. ...NOW can she cross tht gap herself?? Most often the answer is NO. So Monkey has to pick her up and CARRY her, or literally THROW her across the gap, or up to a ledge. Oh and for most of this game she's either crying, acting irrationally or calling out for Monkeys help!!So to me the biggest plot hole is the question ""How did Trip possibly survive in this world for more than an hour without a macho male to take care of her???""It would have been so easy to make Trip a badass, who can help Monkey out during (actual) combat, or maybe give her some unique skills and make her playable from time to time during areas that Monkey isn't suited to deal with.I hate Trip. It would've been better if Trip was a straight up villian, enslaving Monkey coz shes evil. Instead shes a damsel in constant distress... and she enslaved monkey coz shes just awful and doesn't realize it.  ....she is hot tho.			"

												I absolutely loved this game and its characters. I was very sad to have fininished it because the story telling and art design are great and the game itself is a lot of fun to play. Definitely invest in a controler though, as it helps the port feel less clunky and confusing. I would definitely reccomend this game!			"

												I have always felt that a review of a game should start with 1 simple thing, did you like it or not? In short yes, yes i did. Its a really nice game, graphiics are great, clean visuals and a nice style, controls are good and there is a nice balance between platforming and combat It is worth noting that i played using a game pad, as there are a lot of quick time events. The strongest element i felt was the story(apart from the end which i felt was a bit of a missed oppertunity) theres a really nice relationship between the characters and they are excellently voice acted. On a negative note its a bit repetitive and linear, now dont get me wrong, i have nothing against linear games as they are often a great vehicle for telling a story exactly the way it was intended but i see little replay value in this as a result and as the main draw for me is the story once you experience iit you will probably shelve it. In summary great game, well worth a play but as its pretty short and if you are anything like me you will likely play it once, try get it on sale- think i paid 6 bucks for it but its definetly worth a bit more..

												A great Game, enjoyed it really much, but has some big issues:Pro:+ Nice Graphic still+ easy story+ mixed Gameplay experience (puzzles, jumping, fighting etc.)+ angry protagonist XD+ nice world setting+ interesting and easy understandable fighting mechanic+ few interesting charsNegative:- major issues with tab-crashing- graphic bugs which lead to some game overs or Trish falling into the graphic- no window mode possible, even tried with another program (no suceess)- graphic issues after tabbing- some minor graphic bugs- fixed save pointsThe Game was enjoyable though, but if you hunt after achievements or sometimes you must look outside the game (not really possible without window mode). game crashes most instantly. i would love to finish the achievements, but i am afraid  to alt+tab out of the game.  it would be okay. if you can save more often, but you have an automatic save. but sorry, i don't have time to play a part of the level 10 times, because of crashing. but if you wanna play through the game, without making much alt+tab you can enjoy it. 85% for me (without the bugs, for the nice gameplay time i had)70 % (with bugs included)			"

												Thank goodness this game looks good and has an alright story, otherwise it would’ve been a piece of crap. I read a couple reviews after finishing the game, both claimed the game “never frustrates”, yet that is the defining feature of the game. It♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off many times.Platforming is rigid. Like Thief 4 you can only jump in predetermined areas. This means I was rolling around two-three times near ledges before I happened to hit the jump area. Sometimes your character jumps automatically, sometimes you have to press a button. There’s no consistency. At one point you’re told you can’t clamber while carrying Trip, your companion. 30 minutes later you’re required to carry her while clambering in order to progress, without the game prompting you to do so. Button assignments are nonsensical. Sometimes you press A to perform an action, sometimes B. It’s constant button mashing. It’s also glitchy. Several times I was teleported outside the hidden walls, and I had to restart the checkpoint or I died by suddenly flying up in the air. The rigid platforming was intended to make the game smooth and accessible. But instead it’s the worst thing about it. It doesn’t even signpost where you’re supposed to go properly. All platforms you can interact with flash, but because the game is so bright it’s still easy to miss. Despite how controlled the platforming is it’s possible to do buggy jumps, where you fly off past platforms to somewhere you’re not supposed to be. It’s no Tomb Raider, or even Prince of Persia. It’s more like Legacy of Kain.Even with everything that annoyed me the game is still ok. The story was written by Alex Garland and Andy Serkis, who when they make movies tend to make very nice stuff. The same is true here. The story, setting and characters are great. But because they came from film, the story feels a lot like a movie script. The big important moments are there, but all the stuff around it, the “game” bits, don’t fit naturally into the script. It has several sections which feel like drawn out busywork. I could easily see players get bored in some of the puzzle sections and never finish the game because of it. I’m glad I powered through the slow bits and finished the game. It has its moments, and the ending is good. I’m now more impressed by the quality of Ninja Theory’s work in DmC. They made huge steps forward in that game compared to Enslaved. Unlike SCE Santa Monica who make the same God of War game over and over, Ninja Theory saw what went wrong, and had the ambition to do better next time. Who knows, maybe by their next game they’ll be able to match Platinum Games.			"

												I had missed out on this game when it first came out, and picked it up as part of a humble bundle a few months ago. I finally got around to playing it this week, and I'm glad I did.Gameplay-wise it's similar to Uncharted (or games of that ilk) - climbing/platform-y sections interspersed with fights with enemies and the occasional puzzle. The key differences in gameplay are a focus on melee attacks (which I prefer) and your constant escort/partner, Trip. She has a few abilities she can use to help you out (distract enemies, EMP) and she's also the one who can upgrade your abilities (which means if she's not around then you're not upgrading♥♥♥♥♥♥. The gameplay is solid, though not very challenging. The platforming doesn't even let you fail; there are some jumps you have to time correctly, but you can never accidentally jump to your death. The combat, on normal difficulty, never made me feel like I was going to die.The setting is pretty cool - it's a post-apocalyptic world not unlike what the previews for Horizon: Zero Dawn look like. Things are reverting back to nature, there are antagonistic mech animals and humanoids, but some technology is still around and kicking. The story is decent, though I didn't quite feel like the concept was explored enough - the story was also written by Alex Garland (28 Days Later, Sunshine, Dredd) which was a pleasant surprise.The protagonist, Monkey (not actually a monkey, it's just his name, but he has some monkey-like characteristics) is pretty great. I like his character design (if I were twice as big as I currently am and all muscle I would probably want to cosplay him), and he's performed perfectly by Andy Serkis. Monkey's partner, Trip, is also pretty great. She's a little damsel-y at times, but I like that they just establish that you each have your own skill sets, and beating up mechs is Monkey's. The chemistry between Trip and Monkey makes the first half of the game fantastic.Then, halfway through, they introduce a third wheel named Pigsy. He is the worst ♥♥♥♥ing character. He's needlessly crude, hits on Trip in a creepy way, and kind of kills the dynamic. Everything else about the game I love, but Pigsy is an attempt at comedy relief that fell horribly flat.In spite of that, I still definitely recommend this game. The third act doesn't quite come together (the presence of Pigsy and an underwhelming plot resolution combine to bring it down a notch or two), but even that isn't enough to put a damper on the overall game (and it only took me 7 hours to get through).

												You Play as Monkey an loner which has survived the harsh post apocalyptic earth since he was small, where humankind is few and mechs are everywhere.He gets enslaved by the beautiful Trip which puts an slave headband on him that will fry his brain if he doesn't do as Trip commands.Her mission is to go home to her people and Monkey have no choice than accompany her.The environment is breath taking and i frequently stopped and just admired the details and the scenery.The voice acting was top notch and the chemistry between Monkey and Trip was superb. Their evolving relationship and dialogue was one of the things i enjoyed the most.Combat was basic and had no complicated combos you could do but that was fine, it felt good to just casually bash some robot heads with a badass staff while enjoying the scenery and story.I found the animations to be good and Monkeys movements where quick and responsive, same with the platforming. It was fast and fluid and i really enjoyed watching Monkey doing his moves.The headband was an intresting feature and it actually made me feel a bit like being enslaved. I was often thinking ""Can i go over there or should i wait/get Trip first""It was a quite linear game but since the presence of the headband it didn't bother me. If you went to far away your brain could get fried.			"

												This game was magical. I'm not sure how else to put it. Maybe I was just in need of a good story but I'm not sure I care. I enjoyed every bit of Enslaved. The story was simple but well thought out and, for me, really felt alive. As far as games go there were some minor ""issues"" that should be mentioned: Some choppy screen rates, awkward lighting, blocky animations, but they were few and far between and didn't really take anything away from the experience. The puzzles were simplistic but still had a nice rhythm to them and the overall flow of the game just felt right. Combat was also rather simplistic but still left your options wide open. With no set combos you were really just free to go crazy with it but in doing so it didn't feel like you were just mashing buttons. Notable parts to mention for me included:1.Great voice acting as well as an interesting script that felt realistic at every moment. Nothing felt too cliché or over done and It was really easy to relate to the characters and their emotions from sad to funny and angry to carefree.2. Story. It's a story about a journey and questions that may not have answers. Very relatable and has a strong impact for better or worse. For me something like that is timeless and deserves many replays. 3. I'm kind of a sucker for the unreal engineEnslaved doesn't feel like it's trying to be some ground breaking adventure game that has new twists and is trying to force some special mechanic. It just feels like a solid, down to earth, absorbing story that really carries you along, is easy to relate to and keeps you interested.			"

A little irony to enslave someone to defeat slaves and free slaves.Fantastic voice acting from Lindsey Shaw, Andy Serkis, and Richard Ridings.

												A simple but nice game, nothing great or bad.Enslaved was released a very long time ago in 2010 for Xbox 360 and PS3 but it was ported to PC in 2013. I dont belive it would hold up well in this generation of games because of how repetitive it is. Over the course of the game you will be climbing to the next area where you will fight more robots and then repeating, excluding the very rare moments it tries to change things up. Combat itself is very repetitive but still somewhat enjoyable later on after a few move upgrades but really.....spamming the heavy attack 3 times on a robot which is the same attack you will use 95% of the game is combat in a nutshell. You do unlock a range attack which one-shots (after upgrades) robots later on but ammo for it is so rare that you have to keep it for when you need it. While in combat the camera is also...not great. it will often pan to a view where you cant see the robots while in combat so it could be better.Overall the game is ""Okay"", I liked alot of the story even though it was mostly drawn out alot to stretch the whole game out to be longer though some events made me think ""WTF"", I wont say what they are because spoilers but consider them plot holes/bad decisions that made me think the story was rushed of somewhat. Its worth getting if you want a simple game to use up your time and its on sale but dont go in expecting something amazing, its still okey..... but not great.Ps. After you meet ""Pigsy"" I get the feeling some insperation was taken from ""Beyond good and evil""...main character fighting with a staff in a futuristic world with a pig-like mechanic as a sidekick "

												I have to say this was the best $5 I have ever spent on a game. I kind of wish I had just given the developer $20 toward a sequel.10/10. Gorgeous art even on this shitbox, fluid combat/movement that is engaging until the end and some future replayability because DLC/awesomeness from everything outside the story/lack of sequel.First, the game plays out sort of like this:You adventure through an area via Assassin's Creed-esque climbing antics. While climbing is not as intense as it is in the AC games, in ENSLAVED it is more streamlined especially early on. I didn't really enjoy the scaling until later in the game when there were more challenges added to it, but I didn't hate it either. One of the things they do really nicely is, the camera angle changes slightly when you climb. At first it was a bit off-putting, but I quickly realized that they were giving really cool angles with their gorgeous backgrounds and art style. It quickly becomes sort of addicting to scale these large beautiful expanses with your every step looking like a screenshot in a gaming magazine.When you aren't reaching new heights, you're fighting mech mobs or mini-bosses. The combat is pretty simplistic and is carried by mechanics being constantly introduced to keep it refreshing. I played through the game on hard first, which made it feel more rewarding as I can't imagine how stale the combat must feel on easy. Once you get in a good rhythym it's easy to overlook the fact that combat consists of spamming X and Y. You can upgrade your dude as you progress and eventually the B button plays a small role too. All the mechs do something different that help you clear the mob if you can take advantage of them. They block and dodge which can be annoying but makes it all the sweeter when you get a slow-motion kill on them. Your dude is pretty much Goku. Seriously, both Dragonball Z and this game are based on the same Chinese story so your guy is pretty much Goku in a different world and setting.Lastly, the story and characters are pretty well done. You play as Monkey (Goku) who has a complex relationship with a highly skilled techno-wiz/hacker named Tripitaka or Trip for short. Without spoiling past the first 5 minutes, the complex part being that in the first few minutes of the game you become enslaved by her. Now you can't get too far away from her or let her die or you die. This actually has more effect on the story than actual combat, but there were a few fights where mechs went after her or I climbed too far from her and ended up dying. I fell in love with both these characters and their interactions, and I think it had to do with the amazing motion capture and the actress/actor used. The beautiful environments, witty dialogue and crazy cinematics helped. The story itself is nothing to write home about. It is pretty much these two just trying to survive while travelling West. What makes the story seem particularly good though is that you genuinely care about these characters pretty quickly and can't wait to see where their adventure takes them next. This is all tied together by a fairly interesting ending to the plot. Again, without spoiling, I think perhaps my final thought process during the ending is telling:""Oh yeah, there's a plot to this game I guess besides them just travelling. Okay there is kind of a message about the human condition that most post-apocalyptic content has already explored. Well, that was kind of a neat twist to a plot I hadn't thought important while playing, a plot that I thought was just a means to the journey's end. Not exactly an original twist, but a neat spin on it for this context.""That all being said, the story really benefitting from the character's relationship unfolding makes the ending kind of maddening. I really want this game to have done well so that they would make a sequel. I really love the setting. I really love the main characters and their adventures. There are loose ends left when the game ends when it comes to the characters' story. I guess that is always the case when you want a game to keep going. You want to know what happens to them next. The next game could have picked up where it left off. This game felt like certain aspects such as climbing or combat were really well done but maybe a few tweaks in a sequel could have perfected them. It's glaringly obvious this game was set for a sequel that might never come because of lower than expected sales and that's a shame. A damn shame. A damn crying shame.Edit: I wouldn't be doing this game justice if I forgot to mention how much of a fox Trip is.			"

												I can't recommend this game more. I played it years ago on Xbox when it came out, adored it, and rebought it instantly when it was released on Steam. I loved it that much. Played the game countless times, and it's definitely up there in my top 10 games of all time.Let me just start by saying that for anyone that likes the old adventure games we used to have like Ratchet and Clank, Spyro, Beyond good and Evil, Rayman etc. this game is a fantastic way to get yourself into the same world you used to feel when playing those older games. It could also be compared to newer games like Tomb Raider and Uncharted.Story:=====Without giving away too much of the discovery on your part, I can say that the world is a very fresh take on the post-apocalyptic setting. The cutscenes and dialogue are very gripping, polished and well spoken. All characters are very likeable, (all 3 of them). Gameplay:========The gameplay consists of platforming and combat. The platforming is relatively easy, though the difficulty is ramped up during sections where you're running away from something, or you might have the ground and walls collapsing under you. It generally feels very satisfying. The combat is relatively fleshed out. At first you don't exactly have many abilities to use, but you can gain more through a rewarding level-up system. Different enemy types keep you on your feet, forcing you to deal with them differently or use them to your advantage against their allies. There are some sections before actually getting to the enemy, where you'll have to move from cover to cover using decoy abilities and such to get to the enemy before they shoot you to bits, without going into spoilers, I'll just say the boss fights are very fun to play, with intuitive ways of killing them as you implement things you have learned in the game to defeat them. There's also one very fun type of section where you use a gadget I don't want to spoil, so I'll just say it feels veeeery fun and cool to use. Graphics, Sound and Music:====================As I said earlier, the game uses an unusual post-apocalyptic setting, in the sense that the environment is all lush, vibrant and filled with nature. The place is overgrown and has nice saturated colours. The Sounds all make sense and are satisfying where they need to be. From collectible-pick-up sounds to smashing-robot-faces-in-with-my-weapon.The soundtrack is great, cueing in at the right moments, upping the emotion in certain scenes.Controls:=======Although the keyboard and mouse controls are okay, I would definitely recommend using a gamepad for this game. It benefits the experience by quite a bit.Overall:======This is a very rare, hidden gem that absolutely doesn't get the credit it deserves. Give it a try, the devs really deserve the money			"

												""This game is a sleeping hit"". (More in-depth review through the whole post)pros:+Story - great story, great ending.+Gameplay - even tho it gets sturdy, and there aren't many combos you can do, it's still when time comes a fun aspect of the game+graphics cons:-voiceacting - was pretty bad, mediocre at best if you want it-explosion effects-camera - sometimes, it can really annoy you how when you're fighting a boss, it focuses and switches you from one place to the otherIt starts of really fast, and you kinda bump into a story. There's no background, there's nothing until you progress a bit through the game. Even then, you will ask yourself few questions, like, how did I get here where I am, what actually happend, but, even those ""loop-holes"" that exist in the story are minority, and should be ignored. The game picks it up once you go past the first chapter, the combat evolves, and you feel more connection to the characters. For me personaly, the way it was produced, I didn't feel special bond between main character, nor the girl that was with you all the time. Story is something definitely memorable, and if nothing, you should check the game only for that. Gameplay and graphics are something that are also mediocre I would say. Levels are linear, so there's nothing really to add up to it. Gameplay gets robust after a while, but what's interesting in this game is that there isn't that much of a combat as I thought it would be. There are few puzzles here and there, but that's pretty much it. Graphics are also for a game that came out in 2013 I would say pretty solid. Nothing spectacular, effects when popping up the mechs aren't fabulous, but that doesn't stop this game to excell at what it's best.			"

												Still a great game. I played this quite some years ago on the Xbox 360 and really loved it. It's a pity this gem didn't get the attention it deserved. The game mechanics itself may not be something new, but it's flawlessly executed and tells a great story with characters you really grow attached to. The storytelling and the postapocalyptic setting remind me of The Last of Us, in general there are way too few postapocalyptic games.The PC version can have its settings changed to the graphics use modern level features of your graphics card like FSAA and Filtering so it really doesn't look its age. Make sure you switch the settings in the config file (just google for a guide) since the options menu does not offer all the improvements that are possible.Definitely recommended.			"

												Where do I begin... Firstly, this game is not perfect, and completionists and currency hogs everywhere as well as the distance measuring camera jerking players, will die. A LOT. If you're into the mainly casual hey let's just enjoy the scenery or whatever game, you may or may not see these things, but when you're seconds from a mine near some cash and your turn animation puts you in mine proximity... It happens, trust me. In my opinion, this game could have easily been made Co Op, beef up enemies, boom, teamwork required. But it's not, anyhow, as it is and from a glance it appears to be a grueling escort mission as you play the slave, where the entire prologue could have made the title itself seem so real. As you really get treated like dirt only to be... Needed shortly after in the worst of ways. The game will surely pull your strings. However, it is not bad at all, but the way the game looks and behaves visually will make you question some of the more simpler things games had. Like being what it is and not slapping you with a kill trap. Though, you do in fact need each other's help a lot in this game, and unlike other look I have a partner, God they're useless games. There is enough there for you to enjoy playing and actually feel like there is some teamwork involved despite it really being mostly if not entirely micro management, followed with some story conversation and a lot of jesting and orders from her... Hopefully she quits or takes that helmet off soon, or there are some EA elements that allow some sort of character growth and choice that really allows a character to bond and not play soldier.Regardless, it's worth a sale buy, and if you can let go of a few orbs or walk really really REALLY REALLY slow near the mines to get them. (Not exaggerating, at all) You can come to enjoy what this game has to offer rather than repeatedly waste three to five minutes of your life each time tripping the same mine in rapid succession in a stubborn ""But I'm good at these"" craze. But in my humble opinion, if you're looking for a more accurate vision of platforming or even Co op, there are other better more precise or more checkpoint friendly games you could pursue. But as visuals and story experiences go, I think this won't disappoint here. As always, if you are unsure, hit a walkthrough and such.			"

												I purchased it with a sale on somewhere else outside of steam, so I did not complete a tour on the local forum which was a big mistake! Because If I did, I might hold my horse back and wait at least for some time!The game was done by Ninja Theory (which is one of my favourite game studios in U.K), it is pretty amazing on graphics and storyline. (I believe they took some inspirations from a famous Chinese fantasy novel which is called “ Journey to the West” due to some pretty obvious elements from the original novel which I found was hilarious. The gameplay is a bit different from an AA game we usually play. Your journey is going through with a female NPC who called Trip along your side. But you’re her slave rather than a fair companion, Most of the time, following her orders is the significant part of your objectives, if you don’t do so, she would kill you without a second thought( which I found was not that enjoyable). In addition, this is a very linear game that I need to mention in this review, because some of you might not enjoy it that much.And also, regarding to the gameplay, it takes some time to get use to her, but before it, you might have a lot of unpleasant experience with her around.The most terrible part of the game is: The check points are so few, if you die somewhere in a chapter, you would take a big risk to redo the whole chapter again, which I found wasn’t so necessary to an Action & Adventure based-on game. Well, there are few exceptions, but just not that many.*Warning!! You have to read this below! Oh, boy...This game could be fantastic if only without SO many bugs and laggy issue which torn the game into pieces.It has been tested that the game will constantly & randomly freeze and it HAS nothing to do with your machines! And with countless bugs here and there, it severely damages your gameplay experience and might even stop you from your progress!! I said so, because it happened to many gamers including me. With a long term without frequent check points, this just makes the walkthrough even worse. I had experienced fighting bosses and trigging bugs neither could my character die nor could he attack, and I reloaded the last CP but to find I have to do the whole combat sequence all over again!! Overall, if you can bare all the bugs which could be breathe taking for the gameplay and laggy issue which is very annoying while engaging your enemies, and still not losing your faith on playing it, this is the game for you! If you just want to have a trial of it, I strongly recommend you purchase it on the other console like Xbox 360 or PS platform, because the PC console seriously does not look like a finished game, and is way too far waiting to be fixed completely!Scarlet’s Score: 8.4/10 (However, for all the bugs, Freeze on random Machine, etc.) = 7.4/10			"

												Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a game with nice production values and better than average storytelling. It's also one of the most boring games I've ever played. I see it in my Steam queue and I end up wanting to do the dishes instead.The combat is cliched borderline button-mash with the pre-requisite unnecessary RPG experience system tied in. So if you want the regeneration perk that breaks the game right off the bat and makes health packs almost unnecessary, start running around for those red-colored experience points! You'll be able to grab it after you collect about 60 of them. Platforming is constant, and it's the kind of platforming designed by a really fussy nanny that doesn't tolerate failure. It's almost impossible to fall to your death, and the game only lets you change positions only if you go towards the shiny handhold things. The puzzles are in the style of Quake II, that is that they are actually not puzzles but busywork. Like doing the dishes, then having to take the mashed robots out to the recycling bin.Even the narrative that the game loves so much isn't great. The fundamentals are fine, except for the part where there's no clear antagonist and the game doesn't go into detail about what's going on. It's still better than usual, but the drive of the game disappears about halfway in when the developers decide it's time to kill the big bad man introduced only really introduced near the end of the game! Woo hoo, I like it when my villains are pop-up targets to shoot in the face! Like Pop Tarts! Pop Tarts shaped like Hitler!It's eighty minutes of movie stretched to five hours. And because something's gotta be done with the other three hours and forty minutes, there's undisciplined game design, busywork masquerading as puzzles, and robots that are evil because there's evil robots, evil robots with guns, and sometimes there's evil robots who enslave people. Pbbbbthhhhhhhhppppppp. Watch it on Youtube instead.			"

												Without a doubt this is one of the greatest games I've played in all my years of gaming. This isn't just a game, its an experience. If you come for nothing else, come for the story. I grew so attatched to all the characters that I literally cried when the game ended.Gameplay consists mostly of clever platforming and rhythmic combat. The combat is about as engrossing as the Batman Arkham series and the true glory in it is never quite lost. While there is essentially no danger of dying during platforming, the sheer joy of watching Monkey traverse the enviroment with ease is more than worth it.I cannot reccomend this game highly enough, the acting is SUPREME and surpasses any game I've ever played. This is one I will come back to again and again to escape to this purely magical world.The trailers above don't cut it. HERE is the true trailer for this game:

A Paladin's Steam Review: Enslaved: Odyssey to the West: Premium Edition. A Colorful Post-Apocalyptic Hack & Slash.Genre: 3rd Person Hack-and-Slash Adventure.Developed & Published by: Ninja Theory & Bandai NamcoPlatform: Windows, Xbox 360, Playstation 3.Business Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by Myself PreambleThe game was sold to me as the Journey to the West story set in the distant future with Andy Serkis voicing a grumpy main protagonist, Monkey. I can't say no to that! If we continue to get these console-based ports over on PC with all released DLC set for a lower price, I’ll stay happy. This is the second game I’ve personally played with that business model and I can’t complain. (Metal Gear Rising being the other). Overall Story & Gameplay ThoughtsThe story is great, its well written and well paced, keeping the humor and/or seriousness of the situation at the right level the entire time. There’s plenty of emotional moments between the two main protagonists of Monkey and Tripp as they experience the hardships of the journey. The connection doesn’t feel forced, contrived or stupid. For the most part, it doesn't seem romantically driven either. A refreshing change of pace. Though there are plenty of hints that there’s a deep connection between the two. While Monkey gives off the impression of being a survivor, he still has good humor moments. Tripp is a great character as well both in-game and from the story aspect. She never feels like a hinderance or nuisance….well...when she doesn’t fall through the floor or get stuck on ladders. That happened to me a couple of times when playing the game. But when she isn’t getting bugged up, she’s a compelling character to learn about. Most of the challenge or antagonism comes come from the environment and machines that were designed for one purpose: to kill humans. The robots have no dialogue and little personality outside of their physical traits. On a quick side note, I wonder what these robots would do if they did succeed in their mission of killing all humans. Would they just self-destruct out of sheer boredom? Or take up knitting as a hobby? I guess we’ll probably never find out, will we. The game features two distinct gameplay areas, one involving combat and other puzzle solving with lots of “easy” platforming interspersed between and throughout the game. Given that the platforming is really hard to fail, I found that I didn't like it all that much. It’s easy though and it does add depth to each area you explore and helps pace the game out so I’ll let it slide. Even if exploration only rewards you with currency to a fairly shallow upgrade system. Keep in mind that while I sound harsh on these points, it’s only because other games have done it better. It’s not bad, it’s just nothing new. Combat Gameplay3rd Person combat that focuses on combos and blocking shots with a few special abilities. Combat is nice and responsive with plenty of weight to each attack and reaction. Dodging is a bit funky to make work especially when you can just use your shield instead to block the shots you need to. You do see a decent number of enemies in the game but the combat ultimately lacks in variety when it’s summed up to: spam the attack button till they blow up. There’s a “dog” boss mid way through the game that is built up as this big bad robot but when the actual fight breaks out? All you do is stun it repeatedly and spam your attacks, repeatedly, until it dies. It’s rather anti-climactic. The challenge usually comes in the form of groups of robots where some will try and stun or knock you back. Still, the combat is decent enough to keep from getting stale (if only barely) throughout the four hour campaign. Business Model & DLCI got six hours out of the game, four hours for the main campaign and two out of the included DLC short story. I think that’s just the right amount of content for the asking price. Any longer and the combat or platforming would have gotten stale or dull. Oh, right, I almost forgot to talk about the DLC. A surprising side mission where you control Pigsy, a character you meet in the main campaign, on a journey to find the perfect companion. As his physique is not designed for close up and personal combat, he can’t brawl it out with the robots. Instead, you have to use stealth, a sniper/assault rifle and tricks to get around the obstacles. It adds a different flavor to the game while showing you an enjoyable little side story. It’s a good thing it ends at two hours because the end level starts turning into a twitchy shooter arena which I didn’t find as enjoyable. What I did find more than a little heartwarming was Pigsy’s journey of self-discovery about his actual perfect companion. Kudos to the devs on this one as I enjoyed it quite a bit even after the four hours in the main campaign. It didn’t feel tacked on at all. PC Settings & Port ReportPC Port wise, it’s not bad but its not the greatest port from the console. Optimization seems to be decent though I did experience framerate drops at times. The textures are starting to show their age. Additionally, I noticed that the character’s mouth doesn’t always stay synced with the voice acting. If you’re having performance problems and/or shadows are broken, you can go to this wiki article[pcgamingwiki.com] and input the fixes in the Enhancements section. One other irritation I should point out is the camera. The darn thing likes to fight you in the middle of a fight to show you what it thinks you want to see, usually Monkey smashing a machine into tiny pieces. It’s not game breaking but it can be annoying at times. Also, using a controller is highly recommended as the Keyboard + Mouse controls feel like an afterthought. A common problem with console-ported hack and slashes it would seem. Final ThoughtsI recommend you pick this up if you’re looking for an overlooked, well crafted 3rd person hack and slash. It’s Sun Wukong in a post-apocalyptic, yet surprisingly colorful & beautiful world fighting robots. While the combat is a bit limited, the journey and characters more than make up for it. I enjoyed the characters, their interactions and the story overall.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												It's like 'I Am Legend' , but with mechs and a monkey!'Enslaved' has a solid storyline set in an intriguing post-apocalyptic landscape which is boosted by interesting characters who by the way have some of the best facial animations and expressions i've ever seen in a video-game apart from L.A. Noire. The world with it's fantastic looking backrounds makes you feel involved and part of it, and while the gameplay is fairly straightforward and isn't as exciting as done before in games like 'God of War'  and 'Prince of Persia' titles in recent years, it is entertainning enough if you don't mind casual games. In the end it's the story and performances that really make this title shine.Performance wise it's a bit rough on PC (read: rough port), with a few annoying hang-ups here and there, but in all it's a fantastic cinematic adventure. Just be sure to play it with a controller to get the best out of it, while the mouse can come in handy with the shooting parts of the game.			"

												Quite fun to play!This game features a quite simple ""Prince of Persia""-like gameplay with a story that surprised me with turning out much cooler than I had anticipated. Even though the general setting and game world design might seem to be a matter of taste (You're fighting 2-3m tall human-like Robots with a staff. yay.), the game still turns out to be well worth being played. It's a single-player story driven game, levels are mostly very linear and unchallenging to play through, which is not necessarily a bad thing.The graphical design of the game is pretty amazing and quite beyond what I expected after seeing just a little ingame footage. The landscapes are awesomely made, really a game made for screenshots. Animations are top notch, very fluid and natural, character design is really quite good, though a matter of taste nonetheless. For the matter of melee finishing moves, it seems they tried something quite awesome, when killing the last enemy in a group of attackers, the camera changes to a cinematic slow-mo close-up, the actual attack animation doesn't really change but is so well made that, when the killed mech is breaking apart it still really makes for an awesome sight that you wouldn't normally see in regular speed fighting.Glow or particle effects are minimal in comparison to other games with a similar style of gameplay which makes it quite easy to actually see very well what's going on in combat, which isn't a common thing.Now for the only really bad thing I have to say about the game (which is really an awesome result for the game, all things considered) is:It's quite hard to play with keyboard and mouse, at least that's what I experienced. Also the keyboard controls CAN NOT be changed, which is something that really really takes a chip out of my like-gem here...None the less, the game was exceptionally nice to play with an X-360 Controller f. Windows. I can really recommend it.So, if you'd like to play a game that won't take a hundred hours to actually get somewhere, and still is some fun to play, if you like a storyline progressing in a comfortable pace, beautiful post apocalyptic scenery and a gameplay system that isn't tetris but not too complex neither: Get it. =)			"

												So what can i tell anyone about enslaved?First and foremost:Buy it and play it.The 3rd person gameplay is fun (although the camera is a bit....excentric). Its basically a mixture of jump-and-run elements (quite fair and easy) and  darksiders like combat (depending on the camera, less fair :P). Playing with keyboard and mouse is acceptable, although playing with a gamepad is most probably better (i don't own one though,so i can't tell).The main point however (at least for me) is NOT the gameplay. Its the story and the graphics. The graphic aint high end but the style is enchanting and the story is simple beautifull.Tl;dr:Nice story, decent gameplay. Buy it if u like good storys. Don't buy it if u just totally hate 3rd person games or jump and runs...or storys :P			"

												Every aspect of this game is good.Only the atmosphere and the world stand out, this is where Enslaved is brilliant, still a breathtaking experience at some points. The love that has been put into building the levels can be felt and that is what compensates for the age of the game and that at some points everything yells UE3 at you.The girl is a nice sidekick. I really like monkey, he grew on me as a main char. A brute yes, but the monkeyness of his animations and poses are something I never grow tired of adoring. Only thing that annoyed me is that there are some known bugs that haven't been addressed since more than a year. Make sure to play on high details, otherwise some stuff that is supposed to break wont do that and you'll be stuck. Still, this is totally worth 20 bucks and if you see it in a sale don't hesitate and grab it, Gamepad is a must though!			"

												A beautiful and entertaining game that should not be overlooked by anyone or dismissed out of hand. The three characters that the story revolves around are modeled with care and choreographed in a very fluid and believable manner. I was hooked from the very beginning and I really did not want to stop playing because I was invested in the fates of the two main characters, Monkey and Tripp. Pigsey was a nice addition to the story at the point where he is introduced and I felt a sense of kinship with him after the intial feeling of revolt faded. His emotions and attatchment to Tripp, and his hatred and eventual begrudging accaptance of Monkey felt natural and well thought out, not forced or inexplicable. The gameplay is a little formulaic, but the formula is stable and enjoyable within the confines of the familiar ebb and flow. The scenery is beautiful and the fights are fun and fluid. I truly enjoyed and cherished my time with this game, I hope that all gamers will be enriched by it as well.			"

												A bit overstuffed and unpolished, with mediocre action/platforming. Great character work from Andy Serkis and a stunning post-apocalyptic setting make it worth-while. Would have been better as an adventure game with more time to dwell on the environment.			"

												One of the best action-adventure titles I've played. It can be overly easy at times, but it really nails the ""adventure"" feeling, the characters are incredibly well-written and the overall story is quite excellent. The gameplay is fun and varied, and the PC version comes with the fantastic DLC, ""Pigsy's Perfect 10"", which is done in a completely different style of gameplay, and features a new story that paints the title character, Pigsy, in a very different light. All in all, it might not be super long, but I really cannot recommend this enough, especially for the price of 20 dollars or less.			"

Combat isn't too easy, though the worst part may be the camera angles at times. It's a game on rails, but just sit back and enjoy the ride.			"

												So what can i tell anyone about enslaved?First and foremost:Buy it and play it.The 3rd person gameplay is fun (although the camera is a bit....excentric). Its basically a mixture of jump-and-run elements (quite fair and easy) and  darksiders like combat (depending on the camera, less fair :P). Playing with keyboard and mouse is acceptable, although playing with a gamepad is most probably better (i don't own one though,so i can't tell).The main point however (at least for me) is NOT the gameplay. Its the story and the graphics. The graphic aint high end but the style is enchanting and the story is simple beautifull.Tl;dr:Nice story, decent gameplay. Buy it if u like good storys. Don't buy it if u just totally hate 3rd person games or jump and runs...or storys :P			"

												A beautiful and entertaining game that should not be overlooked by anyone or dismissed out of hand. The three characters that the story revolves around are modeled with care and choreographed in a very fluid and believable manner. I was hooked from the very beginning and I really did not want to stop playing because I was invested in the fates of the two main characters, Monkey and Tripp. Pigsey was a nice addition to the story at the point where he is introduced and I felt a sense of kinship with him after the intial feeling of revolt faded. His emotions and attatchment to Tripp, and his hatred and eventual begrudging accaptance of Monkey felt natural and well thought out, not forced or inexplicable. The gameplay is a little formulaic, but the formula is stable and enjoyable within the confines of the familiar ebb and flow. The scenery is beautiful and the fights are fun and fluid. I truly enjoyed and cherished my time with this game, I hope that all gamers will be enriched by it as well.			"

												I've been waiting to play this game since it was released, years ago. I've finally gotten around to playing it and i'm so glad i did. Since this story is based off of ""Odyssey to the West"", there are a lot of parrallels between it and Dragon ball (which is also based off the same story). You got your monkey with a power pole and a flying cloud, tech chick companion, etc etc. The story is interesting enough to keep you trooping on to figure out how the world came to be how it is. What i love about this game is the design and setting, it's just the right amount of realism and whimsical sci-fi. The gameplay is kind of like Uncharted meets Arkham Asylum, and the characters dialogue and personality keeps you interested. Definitely not your run of the mill action game. Though, maybe if they had spent a little longer developing it, they could have worked in some more elements with collecting or more upgrades. I would have loved some more lore on the world. It's hard to complain about this game because it doesnt give any room to be frustrated, the platforming and puzzle/dungeon aspects are pretty straight forward and dont leave you scratching your head for very long. The combat is very fluid and feels really powerful, especially when doing takedowns or landing a final blow on an enemy. The voice acting in this game was top notch, i wish this game had gotten more attention so maybe there would be more push for a sequel of sorts. It was sad when i finished it because i wanted the story to keep going9.5/10			"

Other than that I really enjoy playing this game, ENSLAVED™: Odyssey to the West™ is recommended if you like adventures games.			"

												A very good example of a game that in terms of mechanics and gameplay is fairly similar to other titles.  It plays a lot like Prince of Persia, platforming, exploring, similar themes.  Indeed in terms of gameplay I think Prince of Persia, especially the reboot trilogy from 2005, is far better.BUT...this is also an example of a game that manages to succeed by charm, writing, acting, and world-building.  The gameplay is ok, certainly not unpleasant, but nothing write home about.  The acting, the plot?  Those are quite amazing.  Both characters are alive with movement and personality, from the very first moment you meet them.  I like these characters, I like the world I'm being shown.  The writing and acting carry this game, making it stand out as something worth playing.  I would say that such writing deserves a much more original game in terms of gameplay and mechanics, but I would recommend buying it and playing it regardless.  It's fun, it's clever, it's adorable, and it does a fun take on a classic tale.			"

												Pros:-Cool ending-Fun to ride the cloud (flying nimbus)-Visually pretty early stages-Great voice actingCons:-average combat-low quality textures-texture loading times-graphical glitches-unmemorable/unremarkable soundtrack-extremely linear-stiff controls-not enough characterization for the player to care-extremely linear platforming-generic art design-visually generic late stages-generic worldSummary:  Wow, I was really suprised on how average Enslaved turned out to be.  Everybody seemed to tell me how this was the greatest hidden gem from the last generation but it honestly was pretty mediocre at best.  None of it was interesting or unique.  The whole adventure was lacking a certain je ne sais quoi.  It's of average length to beat the story 7-8 hours with no replay value as it is extremely linear.  There is one route at all times to a marked objective.  There was no dedicated jump button and you could only jump onto/over stuff that the programmers wanted you to.  Overall I thought this game was okay at best, 5/10.			"

												Asian would know the classic story of Journey to the West wrt Monkey King and his master travelling to the West. And here it's the ang mo selling the same story but a total different twist. Monkey and Tripitaka, or simply ""Trip"", and of course Pigsy will come into the story later. This game is more about story telling with added action element to it so you can't do whatever you want but a rather ""guided"" tour. Scenes are beautiful and Trip, glorious. A really nice game which I'm glad I had it in a cheap bundle.			"

												This game. This game lets you experience a wide variety of feelings from ""what the f*ck is this sh*t?"" to ""wow, this is so f*cking awesome!""The most confusing part was the very first dozen of minutes, where you experience the harsh reality of a console port:-Probably the worst mouse controls ever, -Camera at strange angles...  you can move your mouse around whatever you like - it will always send you back to how it was programmed. You just have little control over it. (I played this game without a controller. I'm stubborn. It's not that bad once you get accustomed too).-A handful of cutscenes one after another.-The simplicity of world exploration. You just click jump button and w-a-s-d where your camera is suggesting you. Oh, and a world full of invisible walls. Well, these were my first impressions with the game. Yep, it wasn't very flattering. BUT, I'm a grown man. I sucked it up and continued to play the game.And then the things happened. A woman... happened.This game is like your real life simulator. The one where you live with a woman. You experience the things like:-She commands you in every step you take.-You have to help her. Always.-You can't even get mad at her, because she's adorable.-You have to toss her around.-She wants you to do all the dirty work.-She gets you in trouble all the time.-She is like the characters from the horror movies, Always trying to be brave at the wrong time. -She talks a lot. Especially when she shouldn't.-She will always shout to hurry up even when you save her♥♥♥♥♥over and over again.-She lies.Women. ^^Ok then, let's summarise the good things about this game.+Characters. They are very cool.+Dialogues are fantastic and funny.+Animations are well done.+Story. I liked it. The end was worth it.+Monkey + Pigsy = BFF ^^+Mechs.+Action.Up until the middle of the game I didn't thought I would recommend it, but the 2nd half was fantastic.			"

												One of the best gaming experiences on any platform. Still holds up after all this time. This game will never be properly appreciated and unfortunately will never see it's sequel. At less than $10, it's a must buy. Ninja Theory is one of the best!I've read some of the negative comments and wanted to edit my review to add a few things regarding those:I personally have had no glitches or bugs. No random reboots or restarts. I do have a pretty new and high end custom built PC. i7-4790K, 100% SSD, GTX 970. Oh, I will say this, things loaded a little fast when I had it installed on my SSD Raid 0. Putting it on a non Raid SSD went fine.This is a console port, with controls designed for an Xbox Controller. I highly recommend an Xbox Controller for PC though any gamepad will do. If your'e a FPS player it is unreasonable to expect a console gamepad based game to be rewritten for keyboard and mouse. That's just silly. If you can only use keyboard and mouse, or don't have a gamepad, then I woulld not recommend you play this game for that reason.For best graphic performance and appearance, you should tweak the monkeyengine.ini using one of the many guide available in the discussion forums here. You will be rewarded with a visual treat.The camera is not ""that"" bad. It could have been better, but hardly interferes with gameplay.If you think the action may be too easy, then play it on hard. You can race through just about any game avoiding as much action and ignoring collectibles and achievements and call it easy. What's the point? Unless you have obtained all the achievements, don't want to hear how easy you think it is. I'm down to ""Got the Horn"", ""Tech Curator"", and ""Great Sage Equal of Heaven."" Then I'll store this one away for my kids to play. As someone else mentioned in their review, there's no killing humans.This truly is one of the best overall games I've ever played. Perfect, no. Must have, yes.For those having trouble with Chapter 2, you can jump on top of the cars and remember to use Trip's decoy to distract the turret. "

												The Last of Us owes a lot to Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. Not only is The Last of Us built around a burgeoning relationship between two characters who are with each other throughout their journey, like Enslaved, but The Last of Us also boasts a well-realised art style similar to Enslaved's in that it emphasises light, ruin and lush vegetation. Though also like Enslaved, The Last of Us is somewhat let down by the actual nitty-gritty of its gameplay. While Enslaved's platforming is competent, straightforward and fast, its combat very quickly becomes repetitive and frustrating - it really doesn't seem designed to cope with groups, and believe me, there are a lot of group combat scenarios. It's still absolutely worth playing, though, and while its story doesn't push the envelope in quite the same way as the story in The Last of Us, it's still an enjoyable journey with genuinely interesting characters through a stunning gameworld. Just make sure you fiddle with the graphics options in the .ini file first.			"

Now the choppiness after cutscenes has been fixed for me.  Even at $20, if you haven't played this before I highly recommend giving it a go.  If you've played it before on console, you're not going to see much new, except the ability to tweak a few graphics settings for a better look.  Still, a solid game weighing about 9 hours for me.

												I paid 5 bucks for it on steam sale. Totally worth it.Pros:+ VERY likable characters. You tend to get attached to them.+ They did a really good job on facial emotions.+ Story and the world they crated is pretty cool. Like, futurisitic jungle like. Mother Earth reclaimed the world.+ Combat controls are pretty tight.Cons:- Characters get stuck on everything causing you to have to restart at checkpoints. This happens to me often. I've had to restart from dying maybe twice so far. I've restarted the game about 7 times now because characters getting stuck on a step or next to a ladder.- It's a cheap platformer. All the puzzles, everything platformer related is about as simple as you can get. There's no challenge, you can't even fall off edges from bad timing, you just push 1 button and the game does the rest. The puzzles are so monotonous and pointless it feels like it's almost a middle school programming project. There's times you have to throw your partner ""Trip"" up to a handle or something for her to climb to get around. You're always told to find another way, a harder way to push the ""platforming"". You could, more easily, just go the route Trip takes but that would mean less jumping around like a monkey. It's POORLY implemented.- All the graphic options have to be set through an .ini file. Resolution doesn't even change when using the option in game. This is a POOR oversight, and how they missed it is beyond me. They obviously don't know the different between 1024x768 resolution and 1920x1080, because they'd have noticed when setting it to 1080 it never changes.			"

												While I am normally hesitant to recommend what is essentially a console port, ENSLAVED: Odyssey to the West does so many things right it would be a crime not to. The visuals are spectacular, the characters beautifully animated (or grotesquely, in the case of Pigsy), the voice acting top notch and the script is actually pretty good. Gameplay is generally good fun too although it's spoiled somewhat by annoying camera angles. Is it a good adaptation of ""Journey to the West""? I'm no expert but despite it being a very liberal, post-apocalyptic take on the tale set in America, I think it is.			"

												I have been an serious gamer for many a year, and have seen the hype and sales pitches for numerous games.Enslaved is one of the finest assembled and planned out games that I have come across. The only negative thing I can say is the lack of any manual or instructions having to do with the PC version, but in time you can figure it out.As far as the good, the story line is amazing, the interaction between the characters, especially Andy Jerkis who plays ""Monkey"" is outstanding. There was serious time and consideration put into the plot and the graphics, even though outdated to the razzle-dazzle modern works is still amazing. The puzzles, on regular mode, are not only great, but the tension and stress that specific parts of the game put you through truly build a nice thrill. The game is NOT boring in any of the acts, and the final act is amazing (no spoilers from me you fools!). The battles with mechs and bosses are definitely a challenge and solutions are not just run-head-in and kill. The special skill system is a lot of fun to play with, especially when it is so well-balanced. The collection of orbs make you dangerously greedy, and the flying disc is a hoot and a half to play with as well. If you are looking for a great game, that truly is a sleeper, you will find Enslaved to be a great fit.			"

I never once find myself bored playing this, and its a shame that it didn't get the amount of attention that it deserved. this is a must play for anyone who enjoys mature RPG type platformers. and they optimized it for the PC PERFECTLY!. get this game! 9/10-The Boss			"

												One of the best gaming experiences on any platform. Still holds up after all this time. This game will never be properly appreciated and unfortunately will never see it's sequel. At less than $10, it's a must buy. Ninja Theory is one of the best!I've read some of the negative comments and wanted to edit my review to add a few things regarding those:I personally have had no glitches or bugs. No random reboots or restarts. I do have a pretty new and high end custom built PC. i7-4790K, 100% SSD, GTX 970. Oh, I will say this, things loaded a little fast when I had it installed on my SSD Raid 0. Putting it on a non Raid SSD went fine.This is a console port, with controls designed for an Xbox Controller. I highly recommend an Xbox Controller for PC though any gamepad will do. If your'e a FPS player it is unreasonable to expect a console gamepad based game to be rewritten for keyboard and mouse. That's just silly. If you can only use keyboard and mouse, or don't have a gamepad, then I woulld not recommend you play this game for that reason.For best graphic performance and appearance, you should tweak the monkeyengine.ini using one of the many guide available in the discussion forums here. You will be rewarded with a visual treat.The camera is not ""that"" bad. It could have been better, but hardly interferes with gameplay.If you think the action may be too easy, then play it on hard. You can race through just about any game avoiding as much action and ignoring collectibles and achievements and call it easy. What's the point? Unless you have obtained all the achievements, don't want to hear how easy you think it is. I'm down to ""Got the Horn"", ""Tech Curator"", and ""Great Sage Equal of Heaven."" Then I'll store this one away for my kids to play. As someone else mentioned in their review, there's no killing humans.This truly is one of the best overall games I've ever played. Perfect, no. Must have, yes.For those having trouble with Chapter 2, you can jump on top of the cars and remember to use Trip's decoy to distract the turret. "

												The Last of Us owes a lot to Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. Not only is The Last of Us built around a burgeoning relationship between two characters who are with each other throughout their journey, like Enslaved, but The Last of Us also boasts a well-realised art style similar to Enslaved's in that it emphasises light, ruin and lush vegetation. Though also like Enslaved, The Last of Us is somewhat let down by the actual nitty-gritty of its gameplay. While Enslaved's platforming is competent, straightforward and fast, its combat very quickly becomes repetitive and frustrating - it really doesn't seem designed to cope with groups, and believe me, there are a lot of group combat scenarios. It's still absolutely worth playing, though, and while its story doesn't push the envelope in quite the same way as the story in The Last of Us, it's still an enjoyable journey with genuinely interesting characters through a stunning gameworld. Just make sure you fiddle with the graphics options in the .ini file first.			"

Just A Really Great GameFun game, very linear but delivers a good story and makes a great game. In many ways Enslaved reminds me of Jak and Daxter from PS2.Gameplay is fun, the combat is simple but hard to master, the puzzles offer a challenge, the platforming flows nicely and the level design is excellent.The story is well paced, the characters are interesting and all have their own personalities, the voice acting and annimations are great. I managed to rush through the game in 7 hours, which is admittedly quite short but I enjoyed the experience and quality always beats quantity. I am still yet to play through the Piggy DLC which should give me an extra few hours gametime and I may decide to hunt for all the masks at a later date.For fans of Tomb Raider, Jak and Daxter and any other platformer, Enslaved is not a game to be missed!

												I was pleasantly surprised by how good this game was.A Grand adventure set in a peculiar post-apocalyptic world. Story and gameplay sections are seamlessly blended together, reminicent of how Half-life 2 does its narrative. it all feels very dynamic and polished.  Pacing is great. Gameplay is varied and always feels fresh. The game might not be a ""game of the year"" or something you absolutely have to play before you die. Because it doesn't really innovate or have something super special about it. But not every game has to be like that. Enslaved: odyssey to the west is a competent and entertaining game in its own right, You really can't go wrong with this title. So if you're considering to buy this, you will most likely not be disappointed.			"

												I love this game. I was already prepared to like it, but even those expectations were blown away. Halfway through it takes an unexpected turn, and towards the end it gets even better. Beautiful, colourful, funny, good music...In a game like this, I usually dread melee combat, and partake in it purely to move to next section, but once you get the hang of it, the combat here has a really nice flow to it, and actually presents a good challenge.My only gripes with this game are really a result of it's console origins. The restrictive nature of the platforming is really disappointing. It FEELS good, because the animations are so smooth and fast, but there's no more to it then jumping to the next glowing thing on the wall. Which is a shame because I think this game could have really benifited from more open platforming. The mouse aiming is also pretty bad.The options menu is a joke, but if you're willing to dive into .ini files and your graphics card settings, you can get this game to look absolutely stunning.Definitely worth playing!

												Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a good action/adventure/rpg-ish game. Good object scrounging, graphically wonderful, intriguing story. All in all a game I do not hesitate to recommend. My only issue came with having to adjust resolution to get past some parts as Monkey would be unable to jump to the next pole/ledge/whatever without doing so. Not a terribly big deal, just pulled me out of the game for a bit.			"

Sound is good too.Not the best PC port, but keyboard and mouse is playable. (and makes the staff much easier to use as the sensitivity scaling is really odd regardless of what control setup you use.)

												From Ninja Theory, the same developer that gave us Heavenly Sword, comes Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. Enslaved is an Action Adventure game with a story focus. There are some light puzzles, the platforming is contextual and easy but good looking, the hand to hand combat is fun and upgradable, and the third person shooting could have benefited from auto lock into the enemies. It will last you around 12 hours. It has a Metracritic score of 82 (critics - Xbox 360) and 7.9 (users - Xbox 360). Overall, it is a great and beautiful game, it has interesting characters and world and fun combat, if you like action adventure games I recommend you this game.My Score: 8/10 "

												What an odd yet wonderful little gem of a game is.  Modeled after the Chinese folk tale Journey to the West, this adaptation of the story takes place in a post apocalyptic America and tells the story of a woman and her enslaved companion as they search for home and all the trouble they run into along the way.   The game itself never tells you too much about the setting (which I can appreciate as it isn't terribly essential to the story and allows the player to fill in the blanks as they see fit).  The world within the game is lush and beautiful and the models are extremely well done for a game released in 2010.  One thing I absolutely have to say is this game has some of the best voice acting I've ever heard.    The conversations actually feel like real conversations.  Combine these elements with some fun gameplay and you'll find yourself finishing it in one sitting because of how well the game flows.  One last thing - the ending.  Obviously I won't go into detail but it was such an odd and curious thing- and I loved it.  If you're looking for a short and linear adventure with phenominal voice acting and writing and a philosophical ending, look no further. "

												Just finished playing this game, and I can't recommend it enough.Yes, the graphics are a little dated when compared to visual masterpieces like Wolfenstein: The New Order.  Yes, the gameplay is linear.  Yes, it's a pretty straight console port where they didn't even bother to change the word 'console' to PC.  Yes, the controls are annoying and the camera angles are irritating.But...  this game is FUN.  The storyline is interesting enough, but the game really shines through its two main characters--the hulking Monkey and the tech-clever Trip and their journey from a slaver ship to freedom.  The way the characters change and their relationship is charmingly set out, and even though other games have done this sort of pairing better (e.g. Last of Us), it's still a great experience.The combat and action sequences are straight out of a big-budget action flick and the best console platforming.  The combat isn't too difficult (if I can get through it, anyone can!) and neither are the platforming puzzles, but there's a joy to this game which is rarely found in gaming these days.  It's just plain, outright fun.  Even the 'filler' missions never get boring, and it's very well paced.The graphics are dated, but I think they really push the capabilities of Unreal Engine 3 to deliver a satisfying experience.  This is a post-apocalytpic world, but unlike the grey-brown ruins that most games delivery, this world is gorgeous.  The ruins of the old cities are hauntingly recognisable, but nature is slowly taking them back--this game is simply gorgeous and uses its backdrops and lighting to the best effect.  Even the metal monstrosities that litter its landscapes are interesting and intriguing to look at.And as for the grand finale...  one of the most awesome and explosive action-packed climaxes ever.  It's slightly predictable, but worth playing through--and the ending is quite well done.10/10 would rip off a mech's arms backwards and shoot it with its own gun again.			"

												Awesome game! Great story, great writing, even better voice acting, smooth gameplay and an incredibly beautiful world all add up to a fantastic experience.Combat is fun and rewarding. There are enough moves and combos for you to put together to make most battles different and the range of enemies is pretty good, though not amazing.There are some minor puzzle challenges that are relatively easy (no Myst here), but a little time consuming so they could be annoying to some.Character advancement is thorough enough for you to customise abilities to your preferred combat style.It may also have been a little too easy, but I tend to play games for the entertainment value rather than the challenge of beating them so this didn't bother me at all.And entertainment is this games strong point. All games should learn the lesson - HIRE GOOD VOICE ACTORS! It makes a noticeable difference. If you're a fan of story driven games like Bioware's or Quantic Dream's games, then you'll enjoy ENSLAVED.			"

												I'd had this game in mind for a while, and finally picked it up because it went on sale - absolutely worth it.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story (always one of the top selling points for a game with me); it had great pacing and the spectacularly voiced characters were wrapped up in a sci-fi setting that doesn't get bogged down with exposition, sprinkled over with just the right measure of philosophical inquiry.Gameplay-wise, I'd have to say the experience reminded me of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed - sans the excessively annoying boss QTEs and exhaustively long list of combo attack chains.  Monkey's climbing sequences are scripted to oblivion, but I still found them fun.  Trip manages to be a mostly competent tagalong, except for a thankfully small number of times when she must be thrown across a gap (good rule of thumb: always jump after her and mash the heck out of your ""interact"" key).  One personal irritation I had was the occasional limitation and snapping of the camera, which made orientation a bit of a headache.  Replay value is not especially high, but I plan on playing it again!Overall, I'm a happy gamer.  Definitely worth the sale price - and I would've gladly paid the regular price for it had I known I'd be this pleased.			"

The combat is alright, but the main reason one should consider this game is the story and cutscenes. It is truly epic story, the characters are all endearing in their own way.

												Very pretty game with an interestingly colourful take on the post apocalyptic setting. Story takes it's inspiration from an ancient chinese novel known in the west as ""Monkey"" and is good enough to keep you interested for the relatively short feeling 7 or so hour campaign. There are a few quite memorable set pieces and the motion capture, voice acting, subtle music and script is all fantastic for the most part.Be warned though - although the gameplay somehow remains quite fun, the combat is pretty easy and the platforming is as simple as it gets. Personally I wish they'd done a little more with the story as well.Still, overall a game worth experiencing.Game requires Joypad for maximum enjoyment. Also had to edit .ini settings manually due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in game options menu that refuses to function. For guide on this see Here "

												Such an underrated game. I can't believe I didn't hear anything about it for years after it was first released. It certainly has its flaws, but the in-game world and voice acting are very good, and the story is compelling.You play as this agile monkeyman on steroids, whose character design I am not a huge fan of, but he fits the role perfectly as you traverse the levels through acrobatic puzzles. The combat is in the same vein as God of War and Devil May Cry, but it is very simplified and has limited combo options. However, the combat is still entertaining and is not what this game is about. This is a very cinematic experience with many cut-scenes and progressing through the narrative adventure is what really keeps you going.Aside from the the monkeyman that you play as (aptly named ""Monkey""), I felt that the characters were designed very well, and again the voice acting is great across the board. Animations are smooth and satisfying, and the environments are beautiful and detailed.The writing is pretty good, except for a few small things (e.g. ""EMP pulse"" is redundant) but if you are able to look past the minor flaws in this game, I think it is definitely worth your time.

												Love the vibe of this game, reminds me of Jak & Daxter, Blades of time, and avatar all mixed together. Interesting storyline, one of those games you can play a second and third time and enjoy it just as much.Only irritating thing is damn camera angles........I also love that you can piggyback Trip whenever you want, so cute.

												Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is an absolutely fantastic journey that serves as a re-imagining of the classic Chinese novel of the 16th century, Journey to the West (translated into Monkey and abridged for english speakers). The novel is an extended account of a Buddhist Monk named Xuanzang (also known as Tripitaka), as he journeys to the west, fraught with danger and trials - travelling with the protection of three sinners seeking atonement. These three protectors (Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Wujing), each make an appearance in the video game, in one form or another. Enslaved is a creative take on the subject, so expect many unique and interesting variations on the story. Enslaved: Odyssey to the West's main draw is it's absolutely gorgeous visuals, which are bright, detailed and compelling for such a sombre post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The soundtrack is an ambient masterpiece, full of wistful tones and quirky beats. It meshes into the stories journey almost seamlessly, which really attributes to the games total atmospheric effect. Ambient sound effects bring life (or the sense of abandonment), to the game as well - from birds chirping in the distance, to the sound of the wind rushing through the foliage. The motion capture techniques used are excellent, especially the facial animations. Characters show genuine emotion (and thanks to the absolutely fantastic actor performances), manage to sound genuine as well! Andy Serkis and Lindsey Marie Shaw deserve much praise for their performances! With that being said, the mechanics of the game are a fair step down in quality. Gameplay IS entertaining, but lacking in anything new. Combat is enjoyable, although there are not many variations on how to tackle an enemy. Stun shots, power swings, light hits and heavy hits. Shields, wide attacks, counters, etc. It's generic, but secondary in regards to the visuals and story. Platforming in the game is efficient and fast. You essentially spam jump + direction to get to your destination. You can't jump in the wrong direction, nor can you actually fall... so don't expect a platforming experience similiar to Uncharted or Tomb Raider. You don't have to watch where you're going or what you're pressing. The greatest issue as far as I'm concerned, unfortunately, is the poor use of the camera system (especially for the PC). When in combat, or while running around, the camera tends to zoom into a wall here, a ledge there, or a piece of sky over yonder! This game is NOT optimized for keyboard and mouse. Neither are the graphical settings. In order to change any of the settings, you would need to access the actual files for the game to represent any changes in graphics and controls. Nothing can be changed ingame. Now, while this title has it's fair share of flaws (from it's gameplay mechanics to it being an abysmal port), it still boasts stunning visuals, a fantastic soundtrack, and an excellent story with memorable characters and scenes. I would recommend this game to any fan of the genre, as it's worth the money and the time spent!  "

												One of the most extraordinary stories told through the masterfully crafted mix of setting, characters and premise. The one where you really get to care. With it's humour (genuinely made me laugh at times), it's playful itch for the story to reveal itself and clear sense of your place in it, along with pure joy of being where you needed to be and doing what you needed to do - it was a real journey.8.5/10			"

												Only into the first couple hours, and have found the story far better than Last of Us .....(so far).The gameplay has some Uncharted type obstacle manuevering, but following behind (Trip), definitely has its perks being a woman worth dreaming of.The fighting sequences are somewhat basic, but much better than hack/slash/kill everything AI opponents.The first Boss (I'll name him Bellringer) was a nice change of pace, back to the Nintendo Era, with a little thinking involved.So far, So Good.

												Just finished playing this game, and I can't recommend it enough.Yes, the graphics are a little dated when compared to visual masterpieces like Wolfenstein: The New Order.  Yes, the gameplay is linear.  Yes, it's a pretty straight console port where they didn't even bother to change the word 'console' to PC.  Yes, the controls are annoying and the camera angles are irritating.But...  this game is FUN.  The storyline is interesting enough, but the game really shines through its two main characters--the hulking Monkey and the tech-clever Trip and their journey from a slaver ship to freedom.  The way the characters change and their relationship is charmingly set out, and even though other games have done this sort of pairing better (e.g. Last of Us), it's still a great experience.The combat and action sequences are straight out of a big-budget action flick and the best console platforming.  The combat isn't too difficult (if I can get through it, anyone can!) and neither are the platforming puzzles, but there's a joy to this game which is rarely found in gaming these days.  It's just plain, outright fun.  Even the 'filler' missions never get boring, and it's very well paced.The graphics are dated, but I think they really push the capabilities of Unreal Engine 3 to deliver a satisfying experience.  This is a post-apocalytpic world, but unlike the grey-brown ruins that most games delivery, this world is gorgeous.  The ruins of the old cities are hauntingly recognisable, but nature is slowly taking them back--this game is simply gorgeous and uses its backdrops and lighting to the best effect.  Even the metal monstrosities that litter its landscapes are interesting and intriguing to look at.And as for the grand finale...  one of the most awesome and explosive action-packed climaxes ever.  It's slightly predictable, but worth playing through--and the ending is quite well done.10/10 would rip off a mech's arms backwards and shoot it with its own gun again.			"

												This is a really really good game. If you like a game with a brilliantly crafted story (a la Mass Effect, To The Moon etc.) you will love this.So, the strongest aspects of Enslaved are the story and acting. Andy Serkis and Lindsey Shaw do a fantastic job making their characters believable and interesting. The ""screenplay"" by Andy Garland is excellent and I thought it ended in a very original and interesting fashion. The motion capture is done very well so facial expression really come through to convey emotion. Truly first class work. The graphics and ambience are utterly superb too and I loved just spending time looking around at the amazing world Ninja Theory created. I had been playing this concurrently with Dark Souls 2 and it was such a delight to escape into this colourful world having been stuck in the rather miserable (though attractive in its own way) world of Hidetaka Miyazaki. The only niggles I have with Enslaved are the camera, which behaves in a wild and frustrating fashion, and the combat which, whilst fun to begin with, becomes somewhat repetitive by the end. Luckily the story was so good that I was more than happy to carry on through even if the gameplay was not quite to my tastes. I would really love to see this story continue following the intriguing ending but I understand sales were not great. That is a  real shame because It is massively evident this game was made with a lot of love, attention and professionalism, and excels in areas most games are incredibly weak. A really good experience!			"

												The primary focus of this ""game"" is the story, and if you are a story kind of gamer, you'll like it. The characters are awesome and the animation and voice acting are a very big deal. I was way into the story. I would've watched a CGI movie with the story and characters in this game, and sometimes I wish that had been an option, because the game itself sort of suffers.The game itself suffers in three ways. First, the !@#@!%! camera has a mind of its own, and sometimes it moves around at the oddest times. Moving around is sometimes trial and error, because sometimes ""up"" is ""left"" or ""right"" is ""up"". Secondly, there are occassional scenes where you have to catch Trip being carried away by something. These scenes work almost like quick-time events and you have to die until you know which way to bob and weave. Third, the way you increase your abilities has NOTHING to do with the awesome story at all. You just wander around gathering glowing orbs. You need these, so Trip may say ""hurry!"" and you have to decide not to. You gather orbs no matter what she says, because you need them to buy things FROM HER, but you never mention these orbs and neither does she. This is an immersion breaker.All the frustrating lack of elegance in the game play, though, did not keep me from loving the story and the characters. The game was just the right length in that regard, or the frustrating game play might have become old.Now.... let me say, however, that the grand finale boss fight was absolutely great fun. I'm sad that there wasn't a sequel, because Trip and Monkey have become friends of mine. I'm gonna miss them. :)			"

												Great game.If you like quality singleplayer third-person action platformers with a few rather easy puzzles, get it (when the state of your wallet allows you to do so, wait for sale etc.).Aesthetically appealing art style.Beautiful soundtrack from renowned composer Nitin Sawhney.Some issues with camera, nothing game-breaking.Don't forget to make use of a very helpful guide in steam discussions to tweak many important graphics settings to your liking.http://steamcommunity.com/app/245280/discussions/0/792924952664793625/ But don't read the end of the thread, there are posts from 3 certain humourless people who've played too many violent numbing shooters and just can't resist the burning desire to ""anonymously"" insult everyone. Basically you only need to read the first post.Edit. I've just finished the Pigsy ""extra"" campaign which is on par with the main story IMO - funny and unexpectedly long - that's how you do extras!

												I bought this game quite some time ago and put it on the back burner as I played others. I finally gave Enslaved the chance it deserves, and you should, too.Superb voice acting, fun combat, and a well written dialoge help to propel this into that category of games that is richly rememberable.The only negative thing I have to say about Enslaved is that the camera during several of the scenes drove me nuts. I am not a fan of the twisty turny camera that they use here to track action, and it caused me to take a few hits more than once. That said, the quality of the game helped me to overlook this problem.I highly reccomend playing Enslaved, I am not dissapointed with the purchase.			"

												The game is a beautiful and enjoyable experience. The PC port is not bad. The framerate stays consistently at 60 on my average hardware on high setting with VSYC on, but the detailed settings are lacking. You can only select a preset graphic quality in low, medium, and high. The set pieces look good, and the sense of scale and post apocalyptic world is impressive. Gameplay on the other hand is a little too easy, yet still generally fun. Platforming is not challenging at all, but traverse through environment is fast and fluid. Combat is not difficult either, but the hit reaction, the sound effect, and generally diverse character animation makes smashing mechs into pieces a joy and it doesn't get old.对于天朝玩家而言，就别在意这狗血的改编了。。。			"

Enslaved tells us the story of a two adventurous heroes who fight to survive, but mostly, fight for freedom... each, at his own way.On a world collapsed by war, where robots and mech freaks rule the land, it takes muscle and heart to overcome the dangerous traps that destiny has planed.Monkey grew up alone in the wild, knows the danger around every corner, but was caught by the slavers. Trip grew up in a colony, with her father and loyal friends. When both escape, they begin a journey to find out what it really means to be free.With an amazing color palette, Enslaved got me from the very first minute. Just by looking at the images, everyone can tell it's a beautiful world, filled with detail, amazing character development and a cool concept. The entire game is exactly like that, with amazing levels, from forests, to swamp areas with mech fuel as lakes, abandon buildings covered with trees and vegetation, and even a huge titan mech. It's impossible not to enjoy the view and the casual humour that goes around sometimes.As gameplay goes, I appreciate the simplicity of the combat (and I will explain later). With combos as simple as a handful of moves, the player doesn't have much diversity, but then again, there are only a handful of enemies, so I guess it's even.It's a good thing, because with an uncomfortable camera implanted in Enslaved, even simple combat can be challenging. I have no idea what led the creators to sit in their offices and accept this decision, but the camera is awful... It self arranges in weird positions, it's fixed at some points, and moves well at other times. It's a conflict mix that works, of course, and even if it's the only bad thing I have to say about this great game, I still had to point out. Bad camera make terrible combat moments, and I'm happy combat it's as basic as it can get.But Enslaved is not all about action, platforming makes a major impact, and the level design takes a huge bonus on how good it is to jump around with Monkey.Boss fights do a cool appearance, with a great concept, and not exaggerating which is always nice!The gameplay is solid, especially at 60fps, where the fluid movement compensates for the bad camera. Although this was a console port, this game was made to run at 60fps!This Premium Edition has all the DLC, thta ads 3 costumes, and Pigsy’s Perfect 10, a spin off, featuring Pigsy. The graphical options remained, although it's not as diverse, obviously, being a more local piece of action. The gameplay suffers a change based on the new character, and the story has a deep and touching element, that I highly recommend everyone to go through it.Enslaved is a great action/platformer, with a brutal storyline that made me enjoy the ending and actually think deeply about it. I couldn't spoil it, so it's up to you to play and find out how the adventure ends!6/10 "

												Enslaved was decent. The gameplay wasn't revolutionary and the level design was very linear (not that that is necessarily bad). The game was pretty easy. There were only a handfull of places I had any difficulty with at all. The game was entertaining for the length of the game, which was around 11 hours with the DLC. The DLC did a nice job of giving more of the game, but changing things around so familiar enemies need to be handled with a whole new set of tools and strategies. It's kind of like playing an interactive summer blockbuster. It's completely forgettable, but its fun while it lasts. The game does look terrific. This is a console port of a game already a few years old, but there is some real eye candy in this game. Very impressive on the visuals front even though there are some really disgusting textures mixed in every now and then. As far as the story goes, it's all really boiler plate stuff, but perhaps there is a deeper message than is on the surface (maybe not).

												A decent 3D action hack and slash game ridden with bugs.Game's beautiful, as to be expected from Ninja Theory. Very detailed background and level designs, fascinating post apocalyptic feeling. Despite being good, though, graphic settings are just few. If you're that hardcore, then enjoy the lack of AA settings for the start. Not only that, you can only set up but few only - Gamma, Quality, Blur, Motion Blur and Vsync. If you have higher res monitor, then you're out of luck... natively. There's a way to set up manually, check here: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Enslaved:_Odyssey_to_the_WestGameplay is similar to DmC Devil May Cry, just less chaotic. Enemies are but few in one battle, you just have to beat them using limited combo and blocking/evading. Story wise, you will be forced to escort your annoying girl named Trip. She'll tie you down with that headband and forces you to help her. Though, despite being annoying, you can use her helping hands to distract enemies temporarily or to heal you. Some missions require you to explicitly protect her from harm or you'll die if she dies and the story will revolve around that.Oh did I mention the game's very linear? Not open world in the slightest? Overall, no revolutionary mechanic for gameplay and/or story, far below Batman Arkham series or DmC Devil May Cry.Then there's RPG element. If you gather enough exp, you can upgrade your abilities. Don't expect complex skill trees, but at last there's an alternative for your build and playstyle. For playing the game controller's super recommended. Unfortunately Unreal Engine is garbage at picking up older controllers, so most likely you'll see your buttons reversed if it's Dinput. Xinput is doing fine, though. MK/B is... err.. forget it. Just play with controller.Now here's the catch, progression blockers are everywhere. If you're caught in it, restart your game and try from last checkpoints. Game is saved automatically periodically so you won't lose much progress, it's just the blockers are beyond annoying if it's not solved as fast as possible after restart. Overall, great game to play, but not worth full price due to rater shallow gameplay mechanic, bugs ridden game and rather poor port. At this moment of writing, it's 75% off and I can fully recommend you at that price.8/10			"

												Man, this game was great!! Awesome graphics and spectacular fighting system, but most of all - the story, the ending! The immersion!!!  It may be short, like so many story driven games these days, but it'd definately worth it - scratch that - I went back to check, the game on first playthrough took me 9 hours - that pretty long for modern story driven game, so even more worth it ^^. I know it's only loosely based on it, but I wish I've read the Journey to the West before playing the game.That's 9.5 out of 10 in my books.			"

												Beautiful art direction and some great acting make Enslaved a joy to watch. Playing it (or actually making it work) is a whole different story...After a strong first Act, the story never really picks up and apart from Trip (The sexy tech-savvy redhead) there aren't really that many interesting characters. The Shallow gameplay (combat and plataforming) also make this an extremely repetitive game. Since this is a terrible port you'll also deal with some pretty nasty graphical glitches and a considerable amount of game breaking bugs. And please, don't even think about Alt+Tabbing while playing this. Yeah, it's THAT bad...   The Add-on content is not that interesting either:Some extra skins for Monkey and Trip that you can only use on a New Game +, but since there's really no incentive for you to ever replay this game it's kind of pointless.There's also a side story that gives some much needed depth to one of the secondary characters. Unfortunately the game changes from a simplistic hack and slash to a Heavily scripted 3rd person stealth game. Needless to say, it doesn't really work very well...			"

												Steam would do well to offer a mixed opinion option for reviews.Enslaved: Oddyssey to the West is a great game, but horribly optimized, requiring quite a bit of tweaking out of the box to get it working even somewhat well. For some, it likely isn't worth the headache to suffer through the random frame drops, freezing,  and general annoyances after cutscenes. Would only recommend to the patient; otherwise, skip it and play something else, or get it on console. This is a bad port.Someone decided to comment being a turbosperglord, so let me edit this review:It takes only a cursory glance through Enslaved: Odyssey to the West's steam forums to see that many other users do, in fact, have the problems I listed. There are dozens of threads dedicated to working your way through the game's terrible optimization and getting it to be somewhere within the realms of 'playable'.  Furthermore, any review that does not warn of possible issues one might have when attempting to play the game in question, does not quite fit the definition of a review. If you have somehow managed to delude yourself into thinking a game's performance isn't part of the game 'at all', then that's your problem, not mine. Waste your money, but not my time reading your smart♥♥♥♥♥comments. ;)			"

												This is the kind of game that I feel is a sleeper-hit along with Beyond Good And Evil. It's one of those games that although the gameplay is similar to God Of War, or Darksiders 2, has its own identity in that genre. The writing is great. The music is great. The ACTING is great, the mo-cap on the models and facial expressions are among the best I've ever seen for its generation. This is phenominal. Koodos to the devs. I LOVE this game.			"

												Very quick review here. I'm super impressed. One of those games I just purchased on a whim after hearing or reading good reviews, didn't know much about it, so when it came up in a steam sale, just grabbed it and let it sit in my backlog. Nice, short and sweet. Supurb character development and a great story to go with it. I remember watching Monkey as a kid and it didn't click until the names of the characters started to ring a bell and did a bit of research on the story this game is based on. Anyways, graphically, pretty ok, considering the Unreal 3 engine is starting to look old. I had to tweak the .ini file to no ends to get this running above 20 fps on my decent pc. Problems with some ATI cards apparently, even though it runs games like Witcher 3 above 40fps on higher settings. Just beware, anything in the graphics options arent final, turning on some settings won't do the trick, you'll need to delve a bit deeper to get it running and looking nicer. Soundwise, meh, a lot of bangs and crashes which sound like people smacking trashcan lids together but I guess that's what beating up mechs is supposed to sound like. Music is actually half decent though. Gameplay. Well, it's good, I mean it's not God of war or Darksiders, heck the combat is nowhere near the fun of the Batman games but it seems to work enough to keep you going through to the end. Use a controller! Though I found the keyboard mouse setup worked well enough for me, some of the button combinations when you upgrade your skills arent exactly clear. What keeps you going through this game? To see what's at the end. This game is all about story. I wouldn't put it on the level of Mass effect epic but it's good. I didn't play through the Pigsy's perfect 10 DLC, I got the gist of it from watching the Letsplay cutscenes. One gripe. The other DLC, Monkey's ninja suit, classic monkey and Sexy trip robot, you can't use them until you complete the game....and you can't use one of monkeys appearances alongside trips sexy robot costume. Which, in my opinion look pretty darn good. Overall, get it on sale, even the current price tag is pretty good.			"

												I was surprised to see such a low metacritic rating because I had heard some reviewers rave about this game. The story, acting, and graphics are all top notch. The gameplay gets a little repetitive toward the end, but everything else will keep you engaged. The controls are tight and playing the game feels great. The main character has great movement which is integral to the game. The story, while not Steinbeck, will keep you engaged and racing to the end. The animation and voice acting are second to none. The world is beautiful and the set pieces are well crafted to get the heart pumping. I beat it in about 6 hours which is perfect length for someone with way too many games and I had a great time.

												This game, right here.A lovely story and character driven game with some memorable platforming and fighting as well as outstanding performancesA retelling of the classic ' Journey to the West', this time written by Alex Garland (The Beach, 28 Days Later, Ex Machina, Dredd, Sunshine) and outstandingly overseen and performed by Andy Serkis.Pros: - Story, yes, it has one. yes it is a bit predictable, but well told and paced - characters, Monkey and trip are a delight. Serkis is brilliant in his role as Monkey, lending the character gravitas and depth.  - game world and design. outstanding job. I found myself marveling at a few of the sights, even though the game is relatively 'old' - game mechanics, everything works properly, from fighting to platforming. Cons: - too short and no real re-play value due to it's linear storyVerdict:If you enjoy good acting and story, Enslaved offers this in spades. A must buy for any Serkis or Garland fans as both are on top of their game.It's not best of class in platforming and action, but it serves the story well.go get it :) "

 A Wonderful Journey with Brilliant Characters On first glance,  Enslaved: Odyssey to the West  gives players solid game mechanics and a good story. The jump passages are mostly very easy and occasionally the camera reacts weirdly. However, the game shines in it's details. The level design creates dynamic situations, which prevent the feeling of repitition even when players do the same things multiple times. Furthermore, the world looks great, the boss fights are not repetitive and the use of all game elements happens in a believable way, but the most outstanding feature are the characters. The way they interact, communicate and grow together is great and supported by brilliant voice actors. Great work. Rating: 4/5  "

												Enslaved is a decent game. I'd rate it around 6.5/10.It has noticeable flaws, namely a weak female lead, a lack of enemy variety and slightly awkward controls, although its biggest issue was its camera which made certain chapters much harder than they should be.But behind those flaws is a good, albeit basic story. There are plenty of character moments which made the game enjoyable for me, and although I found the female lead boring, the male lead and a 3rd character were great. A lot of funny banter in this game, which made it enjoyable despite the many problems this game has.It has a pretty solid upgrade system, varied move patterns, although you won't need most of these since the game is fairly easy, even on the hardest difficulty. Despite the mechs in this game being too similar (there are like only 5 types of enemies), it makes it up with really fun bosses.If it's on sale under 5$, I'd recommend this game. But I wouldn't spend anything more than 10$ on it personally.			"

												It might seem silly to praise this, but the acting, writing, and especially the direction in this game are the best I have ever seen. The gameplay is good too; the puzzles are clever, the fighting is balanced and fun, and the level designs are varied. Sometimes it's platforming, sometimes stealth, sometimes its a rail shooter, sometimes its a hoverboard obstacle course, but always with robots to destroy and glowy McGuffins to collect.The adventure itself is not the reward however, it's the relationship between the two main characters. They are so well portrayed and realistic in their actions. It makes the emotion very palpable, and it makes the occasional laugh land a lot harder. I found out after I played this that the PC is played and motion captured by Andy Serkis, which makes sense. I certainly liked this better than any of the Hobbit movies.The support character is really designed well, balancing her need-for and power-over the PC, making her both highly sympathetic and unbelievably selfish.The Pigsy DLC finds clever ways to slighty adjust gameplay to vary it even further, but it loses almost all of the charm by losing the two main characters. Comic relief characters are usually made up of lazy and boring writing, and when the whole story is about them... but at least the level design is interesting.			"

Score: 8/10Similar GamesMajin and the Forsaken Kingdom, Beyond Good and Evil, Castlevania: Lords of ShadowSummaryYou play as a big brawny dude named Monkey. The first goal when the game starts is to escape the slavers. As the game progresses you gain a tech savvy female companion who needs you to take her home. Using a combination of both your skills you will progress through the world and discover more about it. You will gain combat upgrades by leveling up. Eventually you will man large machine guns and use a hover board which helps break up the gameplay. I should also mention this game is somewhat based on a 16th century Chinese novel: Journey to the West.PositiveThe game is absolutely stunning. The post apocalyptic world reminded me of the animated film Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. The story is very interesting even if the ending is kind of garbage. The voicing and sound in general are also pretty top notch. Facial animations were pretty good compared to most games of the year it came out in. The actual gameplay works as intended which for a platformer is about all you really hope for since most don't.NegativeAs mentioned the ending is very lackluster compared to the rest of the games story, but who knows maybe you'll like it. The mechanics are very basic and do grow tiresome, but luckily they change up the atmosphere quite nicely. The story was done well, but adding in journal entries or readable items would have been nice to give additional backstory or character development.ConclusionThe game sets out to give you an amazing story adventure and it succeeds at doing so. The game world is amazing, and the characters are believable. Truly a great experience.ValueThis game is fully worth the low asking price of $20 if not more.			"

												I love this game. It was a huge breath of fresh air in a market of dusty, gritty post apocalypses, and while the main cast is only 3 characters, never have they felt so real. It's some of the best of the best, a delicious mix of quality voice acting, design, and animation/motion capture. Watching Pigsy waddle makes my day every time I see him. And that's where the heart of the game is, to me. The characters take the spotlight here. That said, the game is very linear, and the climbing sequences, while often breathtaking, have very clear quided paths. It's also a relatively short playthrough, somewhere around 8 hours, and it definitely feels like there were some missing scenes that got cut out (maybe it's just me, but don't worry, the story still holds up well). Despite this, I still loved every second of it. I can't fully explain how much I loved watching Monkey and Trip traverse their world, and it contains some of my favorite settings of all the games I've played. This is coming from someone who just stops and stares at wonders both virtual and natural, no matter my schedule. I found the combat to be fun, though simple, and moves can be unlocked/upgraded by finding orbs throughout the game. It's fine as far as ports go, but like many, it suffers from unclear controls. You'll probably have to look online to figure out how to counter, for example, which is something you'd think developers would have learned to deal with by now. Perhaps most sadening is that this game was clearly designed with sequels in mind. The ending is solid, so it's not a debilitating cliffhanger, but it's a crying shame this game didn't get the attention it so deserved. Hopefully we can send a big enough message of support via Steam that they'll pick up where the left off. Hey, naive hope for sequels is like, half of what being a gamer's about, right?			"

												First of all!I recommend strongly that you enter this game with a controller which will make the game a lot more easier and smooth (Played the first 4 chapteres with keyboard and the rest with controller). Since they haven't made a good transition from it's original platform release Xbox, som keys that are shown in game are based on their XBOX controller, and not PC keys which cannot be found in options, in game. You will be forced to look it up, easy fix.Still very enjoyable with keyboard, controllers are recommended if you are not a true PCMasterRace member. The graphics in this game does satisfy, very colourful that makes it feel alive, but at times it goes downhill with glitches here and there, and characters look kinda pixelated in videos (at times), and the camera can be awkward at times aswell. This will all be forgiven since the world look really pretty and has a sort of intriguing story, some decisions in game that can be questionable.I've played through the game for the first time now and may continue on Hard mode, doubt that it will be a challenge since it is pretty linear. The reviews are pretty much the same, the game has it flaws indeed, but it is easily overlooked.Rather enjoyable Campaign/SingePlayer story and it's greatly recommended for a cool story and to explore a ""different"" kind of game. You have to be good at dodging, gotta do it in the right moment.PS. MY FAVOURITE HOVERBOARD, the ""Cloud"" that you ride on has something special about it, that just makes it so smooth to ride.Buy the game to lose some time, it's great fun, go explore!			"

												This game has a really good atmosphere. You care about the two protagonists from the beginning, for no real reason outside of that they're good people in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation, and eventually they begin to care about each other, and it shows. While you play as the fighter, monkey, who protects the ""damnsel in distress"", trip, you most certainly gather that they are a team. They couldnt progress through their trials without each other, and that idea is developed well. Combat is fun, and just challenging enough in some places, but the forgiving checkpoint system makes toughing through even the hardest sections pretty easy. I will say, this game is almost 100% atmosphere and combat, as there is no real story to speak of. It starts as ""I need to get from point A, to point B, and youre going to be the one to get me there"", and doesnt develop past that single concept until maybe the last 30 minutes of the game. There are a few hints of intrigue here and there about what happened to make this interesting setting what it is, but just a few. There are literally 0 story developments besides the midway point where you get to the aforementioned ""point B"", and the veeeerry end after you beat the ""final boss"" (which is nothing more than a set piece with a few waves of basic enemies, and shooting what totals out to maybe 10 weak points). My biggest gripe with the story, is that they set it up for a sequel, which never happened. You dont leave a cliffhanger ending, when there was no story to be intrigued about until the cliffhanger itself. Overall, its a good enough game, with great atmosphere, protagonists who you really care about almost on an emotional level(the games strongest two points), fun, but repetitive combat and a solid score. The repitition and lack of combat depth and story hold back what could have easily been a classic action adventure title. I'd rate it a 6.5/10. Worth picking up on sale. Low replay value. Not enough challenge, enemy variety, combat depth or collectables to warrant playing again. Took me a month and a half to beat because it has 0 addictive qualities. Can be finished in a day if focused.			"

The artistic environment looks really great. at any point in the game, you can take a screenshot and it would make a great wallpaper.the playing style is too simple but it didn't bother me.			"

												This game is awsome on so many lvls yet there is so much room for improvmentWhats awsome 1. Setting, It takes place in destroyed future where machines rule the world and evrything is left behind to slowly decay, I love theese apocalyptic games and this is rathere colorful too.2. Character development, you can really see how characters change through the game.3. Story, through game seems to very well written4. I really liked pacing of game, it was not most games have it. Usually it is just Combat, and combat and combat what fills between combats.What could be better ?1. Camera, aghgahgahghhagh why do you this why cant i watch around freely.2. Controls on climbing, but it is probably fault of camera, because you are not sure which way you would like to go.Rating: Have you been ever so in love that columns behind you form a heart ?			"

												After playing some RPG (I just finished DA: Inquisition) I wanted to play something more action oriented, so I was thinking   about re-installing Metal Gear Rising or Alice Madness Returns, but then I saw Enslaved in the summer sales and I thought about an old RPG game with the same name that I couldn't get at its time, but to my surprise it wasn't that RPG, it was an action, platformer game so I did some research of it and finally I deciced to purchase it, so glad I did.Just played the game for a couple of hours and it's definitely an amazing game, sure it's not perfect, but it is so good that its flaws are not perceptible, well at least for me.As a big fan of Andy Serkis' work, I can say that you can see and feel all his talent in the main character Monkey - should have called him Caesar ;) - he and Trip are two very likeable characters (is it me? or Trip looks like Emily Blunt), the gameplay is awesome (a gamepad is totally recommended), the story is great (I didn't read the book but now I'm gonna), the graphics are beautiful (running at max) the post-apoclyptic New York looks amazing (reminded me of I, Legend).I'm so glad I've found out this game that I've never heard before, truly an underrated game and an awesome hidden gem. A totally 9/10 for me.			"

												Wow! I can't believe that I have had this game in my library for ages and I only just got round to playing it!The game is a sci-fi action game that really stands out because of it's fantastic story.. A sci-fi reimagining of the classic Chinese adventure story of the Monkey king. Not wanting to give too much away, but the adaptation really works, anchoring the action with a well crafted narrative and a small but memorable cast of characters,The mechanics of the game are solid, if not ground-breaking, with a mix of  melee combat, ranged combat, climbing and some good set pieces, all from a third-person perspective. Voice acting is good, although the cast is small. It took me around 11 hours to play thorugh, but I took my time and you could definitely blitz through in a lot less.As I say, the thing that really makes the game stand out is the story. I thoroughly recommend it, particularly if (like me) you can pick it up in a sale.			"

												While it doesn't have the best graphics and there are a few bugs. I love this game and it's story telling. It isn't often that I come to enjoy the characters in a game this much. While there is a romance aspect between the two main characters, it only adds to their characters, rather than detract from the game. This is an excellent game to pick up when its on sale, though I would not have regret making this purchase at full price.			"

												As a man named Monkey, you are tasked with escorting a girl named Trip back to her home.Sounds easy, right? You have to fight robots to the death and if you don't listen to Trip, she'll kill you.If the robots and Trip don't kill you, don't worry. There are plenty of times to be killed while you climb your way up buildings, across a failing bridge, and many more deadly environments. But there is more. While these robots have sharp blades and guns, you can fight them with your staff. Sounds about fair, right? Almost forgot to add. If Trip dies, you die.You're in for a ride.  "

												Good story, minor graphical glitch, no windowed mode.Other than that, I find some of the key sequence actions rather annoying, not sure whose Developer's idea it was for games now in days to require a special key sequence combo timing, to pass certain part of the game.Just let players kill the monster as they please, and move on to the rest of the story line.nVidia surround users will have to hit Alt+R to change to single screen, as this game sucks in graphical controls and it won't let you change to the proper resolution, or let you switch to windowed mode.

												Well, overall this game was okay. It is very much a console port and because of that, it suffered from a poor control scheme, and delayed control reactions. Also, that said -- they didn't update the lettering for the PC, so when you learned some more of the combat moves, you had to fumble around through trial and error to figure out how to use some of them. Also, you cannot remap the controls.Jumping, climbing and combat all suffered greatly due to the odd camera angles you get for the entire game. Often running one direction until you round a corner and then your camera angle changes, making you go in a another direction you didn't want to go. Jumping and climbing also suffered because you had to really point the character exactly in the right direction or you would not make the jump from one flashy hook point to another.Also, being tethered to your sidekick was immense pain because you really didn't get to explore your surroundings as much. This was really irritating because you need to collect little orbs to upgrade your character. Also, there will be times you need to save your sidekick, but if you don't really realize you need to, she dies and then so do you.This is also very much a check point style game, and you'll often repeat sections over and over because of one reason or another. Not usually a big deal unless there is a cut scene, which you CANNOT skip.On the other side of things, combat wasn't too bad in general aside from not being able to use all the moves. The shooting mechanic was also okay, but was only really useful more toward the end of them game.The story line was interesting and the environments were kind of neat. Overgrown New York City was an interesting idea, would have been better if they could have done more with it. Also, another section of the game they could have done more with would be when you get to ride the ""cloud"" hover  device, the control for that was well done and enjoyable.The game itself is kind of short, finished in less than eight(8) hours according to steam. I got this game way back on the summer sale at a pretty steep price cut. Would I buy this game at it's current price of $20USD -- no, I wouldn't.			"

												One of the most enjoyable platform games I've ever played.  I like this game because the story is interesting, the voice acting is top notch, and it isn't too hard.  It's just plain fun.  It is very linear, but I don't think that's a bad thing.  Sometimes you just want a game that isn't too difficult and you can just get lost in.  Most games that aren't linear can get frustrating and confusing, but not this one.  I've played through the first nine levels in 5 hours, not sure how many there are but was having so much fun I thought I'd write this review.   While the game is a little quirky on the looks for some parts, the overall visuals are great considering it's five years old when I'm writing this.			"

												This game, right here.A lovely story and character driven game with some memorable platforming and fighting as well as outstanding performancesA retelling of the classic ' Journey to the West', this time written by Alex Garland (The Beach, 28 Days Later, Ex Machina, Dredd, Sunshine) and outstandingly overseen and performed by Andy Serkis.Pros: - Story, yes, it has one. yes it is a bit predictable, but well told and paced - characters, Monkey and trip are a delight. Serkis is brilliant in his role as Monkey, lending the character gravitas and depth.  - game world and design. outstanding job. I found myself marveling at a few of the sights, even though the game is relatively 'old' - game mechanics, everything works properly, from fighting to platforming. Cons: - too short and no real re-play value due to it's linear storyVerdict:If you enjoy good acting and story, Enslaved offers this in spades. A must buy for any Serkis or Garland fans as both are on top of their game.It's not best of class in platforming and action, but it serves the story well.go get it :) "

 A Wonderful Journey with Brilliant Characters On first glance,  Enslaved: Odyssey to the West  gives players solid game mechanics and a good story. The jump passages are mostly very easy and occasionally the camera reacts weirdly. However, the game shines in it's details. The level design creates dynamic situations, which prevent the feeling of repitition even when players do the same things multiple times. Furthermore, the world looks great, the boss fights are not repetitive and the use of all game elements happens in a believable way, but the most outstanding feature are the characters. The way they interact, communicate and grow together is great and supported by brilliant voice actors. Great work. Rating: 4/5  "

												This is a pretty great experience all around... but there are two major problems with it.1) The checkpoint system is atrocious. It often forces you to watch the same cutscenes again if you fail once. Comined with the problem #2, it becomes infuriating. Not to mention some sections where you can die instantly.2) The  combat. Otherwise the highlight of the game, it is not perfect because the character you control takes forever to finish drawn out animations... making dodging difficult. You will NEED to doge and CANNOT because your character simply MUST finish the animation for an attack that has already been carried out.Because of these problems I cannot reccomend it except in a sale. However it is still a good game all things considered. It has believable characters and good facial animations. Great environments and a lot of color. A lot of varied action and combat. It also works just fine on 32-bit Windows 7.			"

												Good game with beautiful design, tight controls, great voiceacting.  Think Prince of Persia in a Fallout universe.  Combat is not that frequent but it can be very challenging.  Highly recommend playing with gamepad and not keyboard+mouse.The only negative things I would say are that it is short (1X playthrough on Hard, 7 or 8 hours) and the story is too bare bones and could use some meat.  It's too bad a sequel was cancelled because this could have been a solid franchise.Upgrades are simplistic but of vital importance.

I'm thinking this forgotten little gem should be made into a movie.  Then again, it unfolds just like a movie as you play it, so why bother.  Even in-game between cutscenes it feels natural and cinematic.  If thats not enough, there are several ways to customize the game for replayability and even bonus games built into the menu which can be accessed before completing the main game.  Sheesh!

												This is an very underrated game.Oddly enough, what first attracted me to this game was the music I had heard in trailers/demo of the game. I had filed it away as a game ""I'd have to try someday"" and it stayed there for years. I finally noticed it on a sale, and snagged it up. I can't believe what I had been missing!To get the not-so-great stuff out of the way, the combat isn't that amazing or inventive. It works, and it's fun enough that I never got annoyed with it. The leveling system for skills is a nice touch, and adds some customization to the player to fit a play style.The graphics are very nice, even for a game that came out quite a while ago. The art style fits the story perfectly, and the character models and animation are top-notch.The main draw here though, is the story and voice acting. If these are big selling points to you, get this game now. I loved the story, really pulled me in, and the character interactions felt natural and believable. The incredible voice acting only adds to the wonderful story to help bring it to life. I'll have to add in here about the music again as well. The soundtrack is amazing, and helps to accentuate the rest of the game's high points.TL;DRIf you want a game with a great story, amazing voice acting, wonderful music, interesting characters, decent combat and nice pacing, I'd recommend this in a heart beat. It's usually available for pretty cheap now, so it's really one to not miss!9/10			"

Score: 8/10Similar GamesMajin and the Forsaken Kingdom, Beyond Good and Evil, Castlevania: Lords of ShadowSummaryYou play as a big brawny dude named Monkey. The first goal when the game starts is to escape the slavers. As the game progresses you gain a tech savvy female companion who needs you to take her home. Using a combination of both your skills you will progress through the world and discover more about it. You will gain combat upgrades by leveling up. Eventually you will man large machine guns and use a hover board which helps break up the gameplay. I should also mention this game is somewhat based on a 16th century Chinese novel: Journey to the West.PositiveThe game is absolutely stunning. The post apocalyptic world reminded me of the animated film Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. The story is very interesting even if the ending is kind of garbage. The voicing and sound in general are also pretty top notch. Facial animations were pretty good compared to most games of the year it came out in. The actual gameplay works as intended which for a platformer is about all you really hope for since most don't.NegativeAs mentioned the ending is very lackluster compared to the rest of the games story, but who knows maybe you'll like it. The mechanics are very basic and do grow tiresome, but luckily they change up the atmosphere quite nicely. The story was done well, but adding in journal entries or readable items would have been nice to give additional backstory or character development.ConclusionThe game sets out to give you an amazing story adventure and it succeeds at doing so. The game world is amazing, and the characters are believable. Truly a great experience.ValueThis game is fully worth the low asking price of $20 if not more.			"

												A game that was created with so much love and attention to detail, and I heard so very little about it when it was released. The graphics are beautiful, and work perfectly with Nvidia 3D, to really showcase the high resolution assets and art design. The animations are early Pixar worthy, and story telling solid with little drops of humour that made me chuckle.Gameplay is far simpler, fighting is fun although repetitive and scaling walls is easy, child friendly and again slightly repetitive. At the same time, this game never outstays its welcome, and at 9 hours long feels about right for a game of this caliber.Can highly recommend to everyone out there that loves AAA Action games that have oodles of charm and are simple enough to guarantee the game can be completed in a day or two.8.8/10DLCControlling a new character, with different abilities and tactics changes the gameplay quite a bit. The story is rather sweet too. The DLC is much more stealth and tactics over action, but still lots of fun if not quite as good as the main game.			"

												A true hidden gem of a game. Enslaved is right up there with games like Beyond Good and Evil and Psychonauts as a game which is simply phenomenal, but unfortunately did not do well commercially. Gameplay is nothing revolutionary, but it's fun with tight controls. However, it's the presentation, polish, and storytelling which truly makes Enslaved worth experiencing. This game is incredibly cinematic, with great art design and color, very likable characters, and great pacing. Enslaved easily feels like you're playing through a movie. And even now, in 2015, Enslaved has some the best, if not *the* best, voice acting and facial motion capture I've ever seen in a game. An absolute must play - especially if you enjoy playing games for their stories. "

Gameplay wise it's so-so. It's somewhat repetitive but not as much as similar games. Critics would probably say there are too many cutscenes but I really enjoyed those.The game is around 10 hours long plus some extra material that takes a couple of hours.			"

												I purchased this game on a Steam sale for a couple bucks. Over all it is a decent game. Even though it is a few years old it still has a pretty good story line. There are some really cool areas or things that happen throughout the game that make the experience better, like being able to move your character around on a huge moving spaceship or machine while watching the background change. A lot of the movement of your character reminds me of Tomb Raider controls - which this part is done well and feels pretty seamless - jumping and hanging or grabing different objects to manouver around. I have two complaints though. First is the controls on menus are very flacky and annoying to use, you move hover over something and sometimes it works but other times a mouse hover doesn't register. The second large annoyance is not being able to skip cutscenes. There are many places where a cutscene happens, then if you die, you have to watch the entire cutscene over again - there are a couple places it took me 5-10 tries to beat and watching a 2-3 minute cutscene that many times wasn't fun. It's great the first time but allow me to skip it by pressing a button or something and put that on the screen. If there was a way to skip them it is not intuitive at all. Overall the game is work playing if you are into good stories and 3rd person games  - but I'd reccommend getting this on a sale, otherwise it might not be worth it.			"

												Enslaved: Odyssey to the West feels like a story in search of a medium.  The visuals are great.  The in-game acting is well done.  The story hit a bit of a lull in the middle, but even it held my attention and has me thinking about it hours after finishing.  In short: I feel this is worthy of a pick-up.  I wish the gameplay were more varied and that the levels in the second half of the game had more in common with the first half, but this was definitely an enjoyable story with well developed and acted characters.Aside: I played this with a controller.   I can't imagine playing this game without a controller.  The game was designed for a controller, has force feedback, the controls are intuitive, and this is how the game should be played.  If you try with a keyboard and mouse, you are missing out.  Go get an xbox 360 controller for windows and enjoy the ride.			"

Some people are complaining about not knowing what to do .. they must be very bad at playing games. I had no problem at finding my way through what i have played so far. There are button prompts that come up that show you your objectives. I can see this being mainly created for consoles but to be honest the game is very well made and works great on pc. The camera angles are superb and give a really great cinematic feel to the experience. I recommend this game to everyone because this is a game you definately dont want to miss out on.			"

												This game, right here.A lovely story and character driven game with some memorable platforming and fighting as well as outstanding performancesA retelling of the classic ' Journey to the West', this time written by Alex Garland (The Beach, 28 Days Later, Ex Machina, Dredd, Sunshine) and outstandingly overseen and performed by Andy Serkis.Pros: - Story, yes, it has one. yes it is a bit predictable, but well told and paced - characters, Monkey and trip are a delight. Serkis is brilliant in his role as Monkey, lending the character gravitas and depth.  - game world and design. outstanding job. I found myself marveling at a few of the sights, even though the game is relatively 'old' - game mechanics, everything works properly, from fighting to platforming. Cons: - too short and no real re-play value due to it's linear storyVerdict:If you enjoy good acting and story, Enslaved offers this in spades. A must buy for any Serkis or Garland fans as both are on top of their game.It's not best of class in platforming and action, but it serves the story well.go get it :) "

 A Wonderful Journey with Brilliant Characters On first glance,  Enslaved: Odyssey to the West  gives players solid game mechanics and a good story. The jump passages are mostly very easy and occasionally the camera reacts weirdly. However, the game shines in it's details. The level design creates dynamic situations, which prevent the feeling of repitition even when players do the same things multiple times. Furthermore, the world looks great, the boss fights are not repetitive and the use of all game elements happens in a believable way, but the most outstanding feature are the characters. The way they interact, communicate and grow together is great and supported by brilliant voice actors. Great work. Rating: 4/5  "

												I'm giving this game 10/10 despite some technical issues of the PC port. The story, the characters, the smooth gameplay and beautiful visuals make this interactive story (that's what this game is basically) enjoyable, engaging and thought provoking. Unfortunately the game did not gain much recognition at the time of release. Hopefully the publishers learnt from their mistakes and one day we'll see the sequel.			"

												(story completed) The game features great voice casting (Andy Serkis) with dialogue that is just banter enough to keep the tone light while the objectives increase in difficulty. The combat mechanics are solid but also are a bit shallow as you'll repeat similar fights often. Overall a really great game to play.			"

												This is an very underrated game.Oddly enough, what first attracted me to this game was the music I had heard in trailers/demo of the game. I had filed it away as a game ""I'd have to try someday"" and it stayed there for years. I finally noticed it on a sale, and snagged it up. I can't believe what I had been missing!To get the not-so-great stuff out of the way, the combat isn't that amazing or inventive. It works, and it's fun enough that I never got annoyed with it. The leveling system for skills is a nice touch, and adds some customization to the player to fit a play style.The graphics are very nice, even for a game that came out quite a while ago. The art style fits the story perfectly, and the character models and animation are top-notch.The main draw here though, is the story and voice acting. If these are big selling points to you, get this game now. I loved the story, really pulled me in, and the character interactions felt natural and believable. The incredible voice acting only adds to the wonderful story to help bring it to life. I'll have to add in here about the music again as well. The soundtrack is amazing, and helps to accentuate the rest of the game's high points.TL;DRIf you want a game with a great story, amazing voice acting, wonderful music, interesting characters, decent combat and nice pacing, I'd recommend this in a heart beat. It's usually available for pretty cheap now, so it's really one to not miss!9/10			"

Usually it is just Combat, and combat and combat what fills between combats.What could be better ?1. Camera, aghgahgahghhagh why do you this why cant i watch around freely.2. Controls on climbing, but it is probably fault of camera, because you are not sure which way you would like to go.Rating: Have you been ever so in love that columns behind you form a heart ?			"

												It is the game we all remember and loved, now in a premium package. You get all (or at least most... I never downloaded the DLC for the XBOX 360 copy I sold) of the costumes and the Pigsy DLC with it.It will run well, after a few changes to the BaseEngine file. This is completely understandable as the game was never made for PC, and they can't fix everything. Most of the time they just port the game, fix game breaking bugs (and whatever other major ones remain), and release it. Editing the BaseEngine file (See the discussion topics on what to change, like MotionBlur=False) will make this game run quite smoothly. The only noticeable issue I still see is with the cutscenes, but it is understandable. It is not going to run perfect, and I don't care about that. I beat it on xbox, and I'm finally buying a copy on steam because it is $5. That is a great deal. This game is still worth the full $20 (especially if you have a newer gaming pc).The story, the characters, and everything are still as I remember and still awesome.I am still always hoping for another game like this from the game company, or a prequel/sequel... either or. :)			"

												So far, it's a very basic action game with nice graphics and good acting. You don't often see a bright, vibrant post-apocalyptic world, so that is a nice touch. I find it quite fun, and well, well worth the sale price (and probably even the 20 bucks if you're a big fan of button mashing action). I don't love that the climbing paths are lit-up for you, I prefer to do a little thinking on my own. Also, there are no graphic adjustments as it is a direct console port. Overall though, I do recommend the game if you're looking for a nice little action packed, robot smashing romp. Plus it stars Andy Serkis.. so you have to buy it for that alone!			"

												I write this within minutes of completing Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, and with all the raw emotion it left me. Perhaps I was too prepared to get involved with the story but, for it's time, I felt the facial animation and dialogue of it's characters only encouraged me to do so. Trip's story was so brilliantly executed, and I really felt for her in the hardship and regrets she suffered. The world is gorgeous and helps to set the tone of the post-apocalyptic world. If anyone has ever walked in summer you will realise how vividly coloured the world really can be, something I felt is lost in other games in favour of a ""Nitty, gritty"" palette where everything is mixed with grey. But the visuals are beautiful if you can forgive the relatively low-res of the game. Otherwise the combat is decent but repetitive since you face the same enemies again and again and again. But the different contexts and environments you face them in help to spice things up a little. And when you're really into such a beautiful story you can't help but be drawn along. 9/10 if only for lack of more interesting enemies.			"

The combat is there but isn't the main feature of the game and all mixing between puzzles and brawling worked pretty well.Reading the reviews I found that several folks was complaining on the game been locked on 30 fps, I had never this problem so I guess this was fixed in a patch,Premium included - DLC : Pigys Perfect 10In the EXTRAS menu you will find this DLC, it is like a stealth fat simulator where you play as Pigsy (one of the folks you find in the campaing).I found it to be funny so I recommend to play it as well.

												This is a pretty great experience all around... but there are two major problems with it.1) The checkpoint system is atrocious. It often forces you to watch the same cutscenes again if you fail once. Comined with the problem #2, it becomes infuriating. Not to mention some sections where you can die instantly.2) The  combat. Otherwise the highlight of the game, it is not perfect because the character you control takes forever to finish drawn out animations... making dodging difficult. You will NEED to doge and CANNOT because your character simply MUST finish the animation for an attack that has already been carried out.Because of these problems I cannot reccomend it except in a sale. However it is still a good game all things considered. It has believable characters and good facial animations. Great environments and a lot of color. A lot of varied action and combat. It also works just fine on 32-bit Windows 7.			"

												Good game with beautiful design, tight controls, great voiceacting.  Think Prince of Persia in a Fallout universe.  Combat is not that frequent but it can be very challenging.  Highly recommend playing with gamepad and not keyboard+mouse.The only negative things I would say are that it is short (1X playthrough on Hard, 7 or 8 hours) and the story is too bare bones and could use some meat.  It's too bad a sequel was cancelled because this could have been a solid franchise.Upgrades are simplistic but of vital importance.  Big hint - put your points in health and shield early and you'll thank me on the bridge.   "

												When you think about post apocalyptic world, you think of dark and gloomy.  But this one isn't anything like that at all, it has vibrant colorful world.  The awesome looking atmosphere is probably what I love most about this game.Control is good using a Xbox controller, but I felt that the control seems restricted, it might be due to the lack of variation of moves.  So, I think gameplay feels a bit dull because of that, and that's my only complaint for this game.  Some parts of the game require you to interact with NPC character to get thru the game, so this game isn't just all about brute force button mashing.Voice acting is great, along with good facial animation during cutscenes, all that made characters feel very alive.  Also, loved the length of the game, about 10+ hours, and have adequate amount of cutscenes, not too long or too short.  After you finish the main game, you get to play this side adventure of this other character in the game.  Its alright, not as good as the main game, but its still a nice addition. Overall, a very decent action adventure game.  Personally I think this is one of those more underrated games, which I always enjoy playing and reviewing it.			"

												This game has a really good atmosphere. You care about the two protagonists from the beginning, for no real reason outside of that they're good people in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situation, and eventually they begin to care about each other, and it shows. While you play as the fighter, monkey, who protects the ""damnsel in distress"", trip, you most certainly gather that they are a team. They couldnt progress through their trials without each other, and that idea is developed well. Combat is fun, and just challenging enough in some places, but the forgiving checkpoint system makes toughing through even the hardest sections pretty easy. I will say, this game is almost 100% atmosphere and combat, as there is no real story to speak of. It starts as ""I need to get from point A, to point B, and youre going to be the one to get me there"", and doesnt develop past that single concept until maybe the last 30 minutes of the game. There are a few hints of intrigue here and there about what happened to make this interesting setting what it is, but just a few. There are literally 0 story developments besides the midway point where you get to the aforementioned ""point B"", and the veeeerry end after you beat the ""final boss"" (which is nothing more than a set piece with a few waves of basic enemies, and shooting what totals out to maybe 10 weak points). My biggest gripe with the story, is that they set it up for a sequel, which never happened. You dont leave a cliffhanger ending, when there was no story to be intrigued about until the cliffhanger itself. Overall, its a good enough game, with great atmosphere, protagonists who you really care about almost on an emotional level(the games strongest two points), fun, but repetitive combat and a solid score. The repitition and lack of combat depth and story hold back what could have easily been a classic action adventure title. I'd rate it a 6.5/10. Worth picking up on sale. Low replay value. Not enough challenge, enemy variety, combat depth or collectables to warrant playing again. Took me a month and a half to beat because it has 0 addictive qualities. Can be finished in a day if focused.			"

Usually it is just Combat, and combat and combat what fills between combats.What could be better ?1. Camera, aghgahgahghhagh why do you this why cant i watch around freely.2. Controls on climbing, but it is probably fault of camera, because you are not sure which way you would like to go.Rating: Have you been ever so in love that columns behind you form a heart ?			"

												Fun game, currently trying to work through it. Unfortunately, while I like the way the story is developing, I can't seem to deal with the way the camera angle changes from time to time. And I'm unable to cope well enough with the camera controls. Use wasd to move avatar, camera is moved using mouse. However, camera is centred in a third person view on the avatar/player character, and will move while you move. Combat has just been me spamming the attack keys while attempting to focus on the enemy mechs. Probably because I'm horrible with the controls.""And finally - the camera has really narrow FOV, which sometimes caused confiusion for me (it tends to get stuck and perform rapid rotations on it's own), and there is no way to adjust all that."" Seems about right. Though this is a console to PC port, eh.Storywise, it's developing nicely. Playing as an escaped slave, who then gets reslaved by another escaped slave, and forced to help save a community or something. Now I can't be bothered playing anymore since it gives me a headache with the camera controls every 20 minutes. Will recommend, since a friend recommended it to me. "

												An enjoyable game with a but...First, the characters are well done and the overall artwork is very pleasant.  I especially enjoyed the ending sequences.  The gameplay was decently fun as well for the most part.The but, however, is something you need to take into consideration before buying/playing.  It's a console game, and one that often allows very little control over your camera at that.  Yes, it makes for very interesting views, but whomever was in charge of the camera angles from ""shot"" to ""shot"" made some very bad moves, such as having you run one way but, in the next ""shot"", it flips the camera around completely meaning you are now running the wrong way.  Great for cinimatics, horrible for gameplay.  I also found several times where Monkey would just stand there or take an inordinately long time to ""reset"" to be usable from stopping motion.  This was rarely an issue but when it happened during boss battles I definitely cursed.Overall a fun game, and certainly worth a sale price if you aren't maddened by the above type of gameplay issues.

It's linear but there is enough to do and see that it doesn't end up being a problem.  The story is interesting and keeps you entertained.  I didn't play this on a difficult setting but it was challenging enough to keep me entertained.The visuals are great.  If you have a more current PC you can bump up all of your settings in your graphic card control panel (I played with an Nvidia 760).  With everything maxxed out, the graphics looked fantastic and always played liquid smooth.Controls were great.  I see some comments about the camera in this game, it was never a problem for me  (I played with an XB360 controller).  Maybe those people were trying to play with mouse and keyboard but you really should play this game with a controller.  The game plays a lot like the God of War series on PS3.  If you are into that kind of gameplay you should be pretty happy with this game.  Great overlooked title.			"

												An extremely underrated and overlooked game.Enslaved has memorable moments with excellent characters. Set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland overrun by mechs, this story is a Western adaptation on the Chinese story ""Journey to the West"", you play as Monkey(Wukong) and you are enslaved by Trip(Xuanzang) to go on a journey and bring her back home.Oh and you get to meetPigsy on the way tooProsGreat sound effects and music that kept the game excitingVoice acting is top-tier and is one of the reasons why the characters are so memorableGood level design, every level is huge and always different. They let the player have a rough view of the level using the dragonfly scoutGame looks gorgeous despite being released in 2010Combat animations are extremely well doneHumorous at timesConsFrustrating camera angles during combatNo option to change difficulty during gameplayAwful checkpoint system with unskippable cutscenes. I had to restart once because of a crash and once because of a bug where i was in an endless falling animation, had to rewatch the entire cutscene and replay the level.Platforming is FAR TOO EASY as you cannot failClose to no replayablity, they allowed you to unlock skins and extras upon completing the game to try to entice the player to replay the game, but i highly doubt you would want to replay the game as it is an extremely linear gameBad console port ( Bad menu options, resolution doesn't actually change without editing .ini files)Other thoughtsEditing the .ini file for the game is strongly encouraged as it will solve some bugs like the weird shadow graphic bug as well as make your game look much better I did not like Trip at all, she's constantly bossing Monkey around and shows no hesitation in killing him if the player walks too far from herOverall i give it a solid 8/10. Despite some technical problems and inconveniences this game does an excellent job of immersing the player into this post apocalyptic world as Monkey, beating and shooting up mechs with your monkey king bar while developing a close bond with Trip.

												Probably the biggest surprise in Enslaved: Odyssey to the West was how engaging the story was. The vibrant post-apocalyptic setting serves as the backdrop for an entertaining narrative that is driven by quality dialogue and voice acting. The game also features some really nice facial animation technology which helps capture emotions and bring even more life and believability to the characters. As for the gameplay side of things, combat is a bit simple but the speed, fluidity and flair of it makes it very satisfying nonetheless. It feels Darksiders-esque and I found it improved over time as upgrades and new moves were unlocked to add a little more depth. I enjoyed the hoverboard-style segments that were scattered about to mix things up from time to time, and the boss fights were fun as well (the final boss in particular was a blast).On the downside, while the combat is mostly enjoyable, the gameplay as a whole has a tendency to become repetitive. There's a distinct lack of enemy variety and the platforming was a bit too automatic for my liking (a poor man's Prince of Persia, so to speak). The camera work is inconsistent during platforming sections which leads to the occasional uncomfortable camera angle, while the movement controls felt a little too touchy and over-sensitive. I also wasn't very fond of the unskippable cutscenes when replaying through specific sections, although thankfully they aren't all that long or numerous to begin with.As for the quality of the port, it's well-optmized and should run fine on even below average hardware while looking sharp and maintaining a high FPS. Unfortuantely, settings like AA and AF aren't adjustable in-game and are instead tucked away in a config file.Overall, I found Enslaved: Odyssey to the West to be a flawed yet captivating and stylish platformer/brawler where the whole is better than the sum of its parts. Definitely worth playing.			"

												ENSLAVED™: Odyssey to the West™ Premium Edition is adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world, the story is based on the Chinese book Journey To The West (same book that inspired the Dragon Ball series, you can also see some Dragon Ball references on the game). You follow Monkey and Trip in their journey to the west to find Trip's dad.The game is linear and feels kind repetitive after the 50%. But the story is cool and the interactions between Trip and Monkey are really interesting and very well developed. The final of the game and way it ended for me it's perfect. If you like story and characters developement you definitely should try. If you are looking for complex gameplay, well maybe you get disapointed.In the end, really recomend.			"

												I went in wanting to enjoy a story, and I came out with more than I expected. I grew attached to the characters, the world, and was left with a memory of the experience and a bit of an open future to ponder on for the characters and the world they were in. The main things that shine through for me were the acting, characters, and storytelling elements, they are what I was looking for. The combat and traveling elements within the game were entertaining, watching Monkey climb around and do a great deal of acrobatic moves was cool, but if you are expecting the ability to miss a ledge or not make a jump based on your skill as a game player you should look elsewhere. Most of the action elements are there to help allow time for dialog between the two main characters, allow you to invest a bit of time and thought in them to grow attached to them in a sense, and as a way to get from point A to point B while drawing connections to the actual storyline. All of this adds up to an ending where you are attached to the main characters and are supposed to care about their story and survival. It doesn't seem to be getting a sequal due to low sales by the developers standpoint, but that doesn't matter because the story is complete in it's own rite.I played through the main story and will play through the Pigsy DLC, but may or may not come back to it to play through the story an additional time. I know I would enjoy it again, much like rereading a good book, but since there are other books on my shelf I will probably move on...who's to say though that I may not come back to it again one day, as I feel invested in the characters, and may want to relive the experience again.

												An exceptionally forgiving action game with simple yet fun combat mechanics.The major knock against this game is the final few chapters are rinse and repeat bordering on unnecessary; they could have easily been condensed into one or two chapters without losing a thing.It is also fairly short but due to the simple mechanics, it would overstay its welcome if it was any longer.This is a good game for someone who wants to ease into the action genre and those who want to see the mechanics of multiple popular titles such as Tomb Raider & Assassin's Creed in one place.Basically, a short, easy, and fun ride with a decent enough story along with great voice acting performances.

												Very neat, what captured my attention is the involvement and acting of Andy Serkis.  He used an eastern story and changed it to western and futuristic narration. Yes its action is not that complicated, nor you can argue it’s not as long as some other campaign only games. But for its price it’s definitely worth its length and playability. Also on hardest selection of difficulty it can be a little challenging which I always look for in games. It’s the same extent as much as RPG as other games claim to be... (i get a choice of 9 places to put my skills, that i eventually fill half of). but I just like seeing Andy Serkis at work. And not that hard to get attached to. I'v personally beat it 2.5times on console. gameplay 7/10art          8/10story     9/10music     6/10less then $20... yes worth it			"

												The environments were refreshingly unique.  I loved the use of deep contrast colors with a focus on greens and reds.  The voice acting was above average.  The story was well paced and had appropriate highs and lows.  The controls were garbage; the main character moves like he has a dish washer strapped to his forehead.  There are a couple other obvious signs that this is a console port, including the Uncharted-esque prompted jump sequences.  The final boss and epilogue escalate a bit quickly as well, introducing several story driven aspects all at once.  In the end, the game was well above average and I definitely recommend it.			"

												Overall, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a great game. The story in engaging and the voice acting lends an incredible sense of immersion. At times, it hard to tell they aren't real people. Even the combat system, which borrows heavily from God of War, is well put together.Where it really starts of come off the rails is the platforming elements. The game was developed first for consoles and clumsily ported to the PC. It doesn't play well without a controller since you frequently need to move or interact in a direction between the 8 cardinals. For time-sensitive parts, this causes no end of frustration as you'll be doing the right thing but not QUITE in the right direction and then plunge to your doom or get eaten. Even the instructions on how to use certain abilities reference controller buttons.When the game doesn't lock the camera to a fixed angle, the game is very playable with a mouse and keyboard. Even the bits it borrows from Prince of Persia and Uncharted are incrementally improved. Handholds are rarely difficult to find after a little searching, and paths through the game are usually fairly clear. Even the puzzles are the right mix of difficulty and rewards.Overall, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a solid game that could have used more love during the port.			"

												I loved playing this game. The action is satisfying, and the puzzles aren't too annoying. I think a big reason of that is because they don't over punish you for doing it wrong. You get more of a nudge, try it this way, then a well you screwed up go through the whole thing again (which does happen, just not that often.) Realisticly the game is 6 - 8 hours for a playthrough, and it just feels right at that length. What I'd say about the action is that it's satisfying and well balanced. You don't fight so many mechs that you need a break to beat them, and there's little to no omg wtf killed me. All I can say is focus on leveling up your combat skills first, youl'll have a harder time without them mid - late game. This game really reminds me of Beyond Good and Evil, (one of my favorite Gamecube games, which is on steam now.) It's nice to see a lush, plants overgrowing structures post-apocalyptic game. Rather than the brown and rust a lot of games go with. The art really nailed it and will hold up well over time. The game is rather linear, but it works just fine. The point is the story, and it builds it up nicely.As for the controls, don't bother trying to use a keyboard or mouse, plug a controller in and play it the way it's meant to be played. Some games are just better like that, and this is one of them.TL:DR 8.5/10 would stockholm syndrome again, well worth the price.			"

												Enslaved: Odyssey to the West Review:In our short lives we are greeted with a few games that really strike at our emotions and leave a mix of lingering feelings. For me Enslaved: Odyssey to the West happens to be one of those games. This is one of the few games where my first girlfriend and I spent time playing/watching one another on this journey. She barely played many games and I can't even re-call what made her pick this one out. She wanted to watch me play it but I convinced her to play and I do the watching for once. We really bonded even more over this game as story began to lay itself out before us.Anywho now to the actual review. While the PC port had a few much needed tweaks in it's ini file to make the visuals look better and run at 60+FPS; The game still holds true to what I remember enjoying on it's console debut. That being said I was very surprised this cult classic made it's way to PC as it barely got any recognition on the console front years ago.Once tweaked the game looks even more gorgeous than I remembered. The combat is still simplistic but it has enough variety to where you don't get too overly bored with it. There's also 4 skill trees to upgrade Monkey varying from, health, shields, blocking, combat moves, long range shooting moves and more. If you collect as much tech orbs as possible as you play the game upgrading becomes easy but you may miss a few along the way. The platforming is some of the best as it meshes well with enviroments but it doesn't have some of the fine-tuning of critically acclaimed platformers but it gets the job done.  The story however and the relationship between Trip and Monkey is where this game shines. The story is a re-imagining of the novel Journey to the West written by Wu Cheng'en. Unlike the original story that was set in a fantastical version of ancient China, the game is set 150 years in a future post-apocalyptic world following a global war, with only remnants of humanity left, along with the still active war machines left over from the conflict. We begin with Monkey being imprisioned on a Slaver ship as well as Trip. Trip soon escapes and Monkey follows after as she just sabotaged this Slaver ship. Both had similar goals get to the escape pods. Soon after a very ungraceful landing; Monkey wakes to find a Slave headband attached to his head and the girl Trip claiming she fit on to him. Monkey attempts to threaten Trip to remove or else to which she gives a command which causes him a great deal of pain unless he obeys the command she issued. She reveals that she had modified the headband to work with only her voice commands and that if she dies or her heart stops for whatever reason the headband would send out a lethal charge and kill Monkey. Realizing this puts some hesistation in Monkey's demeanor;  She demands Monkey to bring her back home to her village and there she will remove the headband and free him. With no options of being free from Trip; Monkey agrees reluctantly.  As the story flows Monkey and Trip begin to bond and start forming a endearing friendship as their feelings about one another change through the story. No longer will it feel like Monkey is just a disgruntled slave to Trip but a caring guardian. Trip also goes through some pretty interesting changes herself but I can't reveal what without spoiling anything.From there we are greeted with Enslaved's world which is a post-apocalyptic world based on our own. The game never directly tells us how the world ended up in such a poor state of ruins but the enviroments in fact do. Glimpses of a war, a revolution, remamnants of war-like mechs, and much more. As you play the game you can connect these pieces of what the world was like before this in the form of ""glitches""/masks that are pretty well hidden. While optional these end up being rather important to a key part of the story but no spoilers on that will be in this review.Enslaved is definitely one of the few games that I hope many get to experience from last genration as it is a wonderful story that just about everyone should at least experience with one playthrough. Overall it takes about 8 hours to complete the main story, but they've also bundled the dlc in this edition under the extras section which I have yet to start. So what are you waiting for? Give this game a go and tell everyone just what you think of it.Pigsy's Perfect Ten DLC Review: Coming Soon			"

												Bought it on sale for €5 since I already have it for the 360 and didn't want to pay €9 for ""Pigsys perfect ten"" on live. According to steam it took 3h to complete 'ppt' so I still thing the price was a bit high. Story and voices are good while the actual game is a bit so-so. This is very much like the main game. Unfortunally nothing in the PC version has been improved from the 360 version, textures looks the same, the controls are still dodgy in places and there are still performance issues on some levels, but the story is good and voice acting is among the best I've experienced in a game. Should you buy it? At €20 no, €15 maybe, €10 or less yes. The game is a sleeper hit that you will remember more for its story and setting.			"

												Dont have a PS3 but always wanted to play Drakes Fortune? This is a good substitue since it has nearly the same climbing/platforming gameplay, altho combat is all melee. Other than that theres an upgrade system, you collect orbs hidden (more or less) around the world or from enemies and then put those into stuff like more health etc.The premise suggests you control two characters altho its a little less indepth - you give commands and theres interactions like helping the other character up ladders and such but you never assume direct control (nyuk) which is abit of a missed opportunity imho, coulda spiced up the gameplay abit.Good graphics, ok story with a satisfactory conclusion (judging by the many TMs in the title id expected some cliffhanger because they wanted to make a series which never got off the ground).Solid 3d platformer/brawler. Recommended - if you have an xbox 360 controller that is.			"

												Enslaved is a fairly traditional third person advanture game.It claims to be an homage to the Chinese novel -Journy to the West. I must admit my research was minimal but I found that the homage is mainly the three main characters. Their personalities and visual design. The plot doesn't seem to be emulating the novel, other then being a journey in the western direction.The visuals are where the game shines. The post=appocalitic world it depicts is beautifull even it it's utter devestation. Toppled buildings are sprinkled with lush greenery, invading the ruins of man's fallen empire. Billboards, while whetherd with age, still display their colorful messages brightly. And the animation of running, loping, jumping and swinging is just perfectly executed.The plot is the standard post appocalyptic sci-fi. Monkey and Trip escape the clutches of a mysterious hostile empire, which uses the technology of the old world to conquer the new. There's a bit more under the surface, but not much.The relationship between Monkey and Trip is relativly interesting. She controls him through a metal headband that compells him to obey her (the same technology used by the antagonists to enslave humanity), echoing the magical thightning crown of the Chinese epic. But slowly they develop genuine friendship and affection. Although there's a bit of a twist there as well.I liked the game. The gameplay and plot are solid even if they are not particularly inventive and the visual style is trully marvalous.			"

												This console port doesn't bring anything new to the table that would make it a great video game.  So, without game mechanics, you've got to fall back on characters, locations, and story, which is another name for 'a movie'. That's what this game is: a movie interspersed here and there with the usual action-game features. There's a rail-shooter, there's cover mechanics, there's blessedly few quicktime events. There's a few puzzles and quite a bit of platforming, and a few races. The controls are good, but you might end up fighting the cinematic camera more than you'd like. There's also a frustrating lack of affordances in the world -- although wall-grabs are easy to identify, it is impossible to tell which ledge is the one you're supposed to jump off of.  Your character will spend a fair amount of time balking at obvious jumps. Combat, when it happens, will mostly devolve into button mashing. There's nothing too complex or new, here, and you won't become frustrated because you can't get the 16-button long sequence of button pushes to get the one move that works. Instead, this game is remarkably forgiving, and lets you play along with the story and with the characters. And that's where this otherwise standard game shines. Andy Sirkis voices and acts the main character with the unfortunate name. He lends his character a gravitas that sometimes seems missing from games. There's real character growth going on, here.  When you mix that with a world that is beautifully realized, it all pretty much works.  If you are a fan of the old LucasArts adventure games, like The Dig, but want a little more action to go with your story and characters... if you want some better visuals, then this might be the game for you.Saving happen at save-points, and while there are a few with terrible placement, they're generally pretty good. There's about 10 hours of play in here, but Piggy's add-on is worth another few hours of play and might actually be more fun than the main game.  I think I paid $20 for this, and I feel no regrets at that price, although I can't help thinking it would be a better weekend rental than a purchase.  Also, like most console ports, this is probably best played with an Xbox controller.			"

												I enjoyed the journey in Enslaved. Love the characters too, but I really don't like games that starts from nowhere and ends nowhere leaving a lot of unanswered question about the game universe and why this journey happened at all. I would love to have more deep story about the characters so I could care more. This is the only really negative point for me. Other than that is a good game. Could have been great though.			"

												For a long time I pondered, if I should buy this game for the PS3 or PC, as Heavenly Sword, a previous game by Ninja Theory, of which I adored, was PS3 exclusive, and the gameplay in Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is well suited for consoles (read: controllers). But where Heavenly Sword could be renamed 'Goddess of War', could this game be called 'Uncharted: Beyond Arkham', or somthing like that, as the gameplay is mix of parkour stylish platforming from Uncharted and beat 'em up gameplay from Batman: Arkham series. And there's bit of Beyond Good & Evil in there also, consider it the BGE sequel we never had.I noticed it on sale for five euros and went ahead and bought it. After playing it for some time I'm impressed enough to get it on PS3 as well some day.This is one of those games, where the cover art itself is enough to buy for, just to get it in your collection, maybe hanging on your wall. The beauty doesn't stop there, as the graphics in this game are astounding. Where every other modern video game is just different shades of brown, Enslaved is vibrant and colorful. The art style reminds me little of Bulletstorm. And unlike recent waifu-simulators, like Bioshock Infinite, The Last Of Us and Skyrim: Dawnguard add-on, Trip is actually an interesting companion.However the game feels a bit rushed and unpolished. The camera switches between fixed camera angle and free to move camera, which gets annoying. There's little to no freedom in platforming. It's just pointing a direction and then pressing the jump button, everything else is automated. You can't fail. And the Combat system from the Arkham games is a bit stripped down. This is the only game in existence (that I know of), where I think a bit more quick time events wouldn't hurt.I like that the game allows multiple playstyles. Aside from beating the crap out of everything, you can sneak past and avoid most battles. So there's a little of replay value (though only a little).			"

												This game is a must play. Below are my pro's and con's in bulleted form:Pro's- Pretty good story.- Just enough button mashing, not too much and def. not too little.- Good visuals.- In game collectibles - collect orbs to upgrade skills and attacks.Con's- Camera angles and controlling the camera can be a pain at times.- Would have been nice if the levels were a bit more 'open' for exploration.

												Bought it on sale for €5 since I already have it for the 360 and didn't want to pay €9 for ""Pigsys perfect ten"" on live. According to steam it took 3h to complete 'ppt' so I still thing the price was a bit high. Story and voices are good while the actual game is a bit so-so. This is very much like the main game. Unfortunally nothing in the PC version has been improved from the 360 version, textures looks the same, the controls are still dodgy in places and there are still performance issues on some levels, but the story is good and voice acting is among the best I've experienced in a game. Should you buy it? At €20 no, €15 maybe, €10 or less yes. The game is a sleeper hit that you will remember more for its story and setting.			"

												Short and sweet single-player game. The opening chapters and the final chapter are great. The middle chapters slump a bit the story is fairly well-paced overall. Platforming is a little too low-risk, but the parkour animations are very well-done. Combat is not always very engaging, although there is a decent amount of offensive options (some combo attacks and ranged abilities and defensive options (evading and blocking with counter-attacks). Enemy variety is very low, there are maybe 5 types of enemy in the game, with a couple variants of each. Boss battles are straightforward but make for decent set-pieces and memorable story beats. The areas where this game really shines is in art direction and characterization. The levels are gorgeous, full of bright greens and deep blues, and are very refreshing to look at. The characters are believable and the way that their personalities and relatonships develop over the course of the story is convincing and feels natural.			"

												Enslaved is a fairly traditional third person advanture game.It claims to be an homage to the Chinese novel -Journy to the West. I must admit my research was minimal but I found that the homage is mainly the three main characters. Their personalities and visual design. The plot doesn't seem to be emulating the novel, other then being a journey in the western direction.The visuals are where the game shines. The post=appocalitic world it depicts is beautifull even it it's utter devestation. Toppled buildings are sprinkled with lush greenery, invading the ruins of man's fallen empire. Billboards, while whetherd with age, still display their colorful messages brightly. And the animation of running, loping, jumping and swinging is just perfectly executed.The plot is the standard post appocalyptic sci-fi. Monkey and Trip escape the clutches of a mysterious hostile empire, which uses the technology of the old world to conquer the new. There's a bit more under the surface, but not much.The relationship between Monkey and Trip is relativly interesting. She controls him through a metal headband that compells him to obey her (the same technology used by the antagonists to enslave humanity), echoing the magical thightning crown of the Chinese epic. But slowly they develop genuine friendship and affection. Although there's a bit of a twist there as well.I liked the game. The gameplay and plot are solid even if they are not particularly inventive and the visual style is trully marvalous.			"

												This console port doesn't bring anything new to the table that would make it a great video game.  So, without game mechanics, you've got to fall back on characters, locations, and story, which is another name for 'a movie'. That's what this game is: a movie interspersed here and there with the usual action-game features. There's a rail-shooter, there's cover mechanics, there's blessedly few quicktime events. There's a few puzzles and quite a bit of platforming, and a few races. The controls are good, but you might end up fighting the cinematic camera more than you'd like. There's also a frustrating lack of affordances in the world -- although wall-grabs are easy to identify, it is impossible to tell which ledge is the one you're supposed to jump off of.  Your character will spend a fair amount of time balking at obvious jumps. Combat, when it happens, will mostly devolve into button mashing. There's nothing too complex or new, here, and you won't become frustrated because you can't get the 16-button long sequence of button pushes to get the one move that works. Instead, this game is remarkably forgiving, and lets you play along with the story and with the characters. And that's where this otherwise standard game shines. Andy Sirkis voices and acts the main character with the unfortunate name. He lends his character a gravitas that sometimes seems missing from games. There's real character growth going on, here.  When you mix that with a world that is beautifully realized, it all pretty much works.  If you are a fan of the old LucasArts adventure games, like The Dig, but want a little more action to go with your story and characters... if you want some better visuals, then this might be the game for you.Saving happen at save-points, and while there are a few with terrible placement, they're generally pretty good. There's about 10 hours of play in here, but Piggy's add-on is worth another few hours of play and might actually be more fun than the main game.  I think I paid $20 for this, and I feel no regrets at that price, although I can't help thinking it would be a better weekend rental than a purchase.  Also, like most console ports, this is probably best played with an Xbox controller.			"

The story starts slow but really picks up at the end, and is one of the more interesting scifi story in gaming. If you're familar with the Journey to the West this is actually quite a creative adaptation of it, and there's both surprisingly a lot of callbacks and subversions to the original tale.			"

It's a hidden gem, all my friends who've tried this game says the same, Fantastic.If your are old enough to remember the tv series called Monkey, with monkey, Pigsy and Trip. were he could ride the cloud, was controlled by a magic headband and fought with a staff, you will see where the devs got the great ideas for enslaved. Set 200 year from now Trip has been kidnapped by slavers and taken on a slave ship where she escapes and gets the unwilling  help of Monkey to find her way home. This is a non stop action game that should be an A title game. I recommend this game to everyone so why not give it a go.			"

												An old gem (it was made in 2010 or somewhere around that), buried within the spacious bargain bins of Steam. Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a Sci-Fi re-make of the old story, Journey to the West, but with more robots and it's set 150 years after an apocalyptic war probably involving said robots. The main character is a really strong guy who climbs like a monkey, has a staff that gets bigger when you fight with it, and sometimes rides on a ""cloud"", and also his name is actually Monkey. There are a lot of climbing parts, most of the game is an escort mission (almost all of the parts where your partner is actually in danger is scripted, but it's there), and the fights get a little tedious once you upgrade your abilities enough, but it's a solid game with amazing storytelling and level design, and I think you should probably play it. When it's on sale, of course.			"

												ENSLAVED™: Odyssey to the West™ Premium Edition is adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world, the story is based on the Chinese book Journey To The West (same book that inspired the Dragon Ball series, you can also see some Dragon Ball references on the game). You follow Monkey and Trip in their journey to the west to find Trip's dad.The game is linear and feels kind repetitive after the 50%. But the story is cool and the interactions between Trip and Monkey are really interesting and very well developed. The final of the game and way it ended for me it's perfect. If you like story and characters developement you definitely should try. If you are looking for complex gameplay, well maybe you get disapointed.In the end, really recomend.			"

												StoryReally great game, hell I was emotionally invested in it. There’s this woman, we’ll call her C**t, she leaves you to die multiple times so that she can escape. Your character finally gets to an escape pod where C**t is at. C**t hits the eject button after refusing to let you in. After you miraculously survive and become unconscious C**t puts a slave band on you. You die if C**t dies and if go too far without her you die. C**t continuously says sorry, but doesn’t do♥♥♥♥♥♥about it (so…she’s not sorry). 	As with all shows and games, when you spend time with someone in a f**ked world you tend to form a bond with them. You get to know each other and eventually you want to help out C**t, now named Trip.GameplayAwkward with mouse and keyboard. Sensitivity too fast or too slow. Made jumping a bit hard, but still doable. Even controlling the camera was a bit irritating at times. This game was a port from the consoles so if you want a more intuitive way to play I’d recommend using a controller.  "

												Enslaved is a sadly overlooked action adventure game inspired by the famous Journey to the West tale of Chinese legend (Any of you who have seen the TV show Monkey will know the story, even if you don't recognise Journey to the West). While the inspiration is very lose, it's still solid enough that I felt a connection.Enslaved uproots the story and places it in a post apocalyptic future where civilization has been destroyed in a long ago war. The ruins of man have been taken over by nature, with overgrowth slowly reclaiming our buildings and cities. The game begins with Monkey a prisoner on a massive slave ship. During the process of escaping he is enslaved by a fellow escapee, Tripitaka (Trip), who wants Monkey to help her get safely to her home far to the west, after which she promises to release him.The ruined world is overrun with hostile mechs, remenants of the old war, and Monkey will have to either fight or sneak his way around them, all the while making sure Trip survives. If Trip dies, the band on Monkey's forehead will give him a lethal shock, so it's in his own best interest to do so. Trip is not entirely helpless, if she gets caught, she can unleash an EMP blast that will stun enemies, hopefully long enough until Monkey can get there to save her. She can also create a hologram to distract enemies so that Monkey can sneak in close.The combat is reasonable, though perhaps a little simplitic. Monkey fights with a staff that can deal light or hard blows, by mixing things up he can create combos to do more damage. The staff can also shoot blasts that can either stun an enemy or damage them, though these require ammo and the ammo is often scarse. Scattered around the world are tech orbs that Monkey can collect and these effectively act as experience, allowing monkey to buy or ugrade skills from a skill tree. The tree is not hugely expansive but, like the combat, it does the job.The main draw of the game is the wonderfully vivid game world that is a lot of fun to explore. The graphics aren't hugely detailed, as to be expected from a game from 2010, but the art design is very evocative and I found the whole experience really very pleasing. The story is also quite good, coupled with the art desing, this is the main reason to play. The relationship between Trip and Monkey building slowly from resentment and anger to actual genuine friendship. It is well acted and convincing. Andy Serkis provides the voice and the motion capture for Monkey and he turns in a great performance.This edition also includes a spin off Pigsy story that takes place before the events of the main game. I don't want to say too much about this as it really was a pleasant surprise. Pigsy has none of Monkey's melee ability and is quite fragile if enemies spot him, so the gameplay for this DLC is entirely different, relying on stealth and getting to a good position so that Pigsy can bring his sniper rifle to bear. As I said, this one really took me by surprise, I wasn't expecting much but it was a lot of fun and the story itself is both funny and touching.Between the main story and the DLC, this is a great package and I wish the game had done better, as it really deserves to be more widely played.Excellent.8.5/10			"

												A note - I've played the DLC Pigsy's Perfect 10 AFTER writing the review, which was quite nice and made me appreciate the game even more. It still has some downside and I'd still leave it as thumbs down.But I'd just oppose this a bit and say that you SHOULD check out the game if you're in for an overally nice cinematic experience and appreciate games which are done with thought and care, even if not perfectly well.And here's the original review - Mind you, this game is NOT a bad one. It's just that, for several reasons, I just can't recommend it fullheartedly.Bottom line:+Amazing, lush, beautiful, graphics. Incredible locations+A very interesting take on the book ""Journey to the West""+Incredible soundtrack+Nice, fluid and somewhat fun combat and ""parkouring-ish"", assuming you managed to get the game run well enough.+An awesome WTF ending-Linear gameplay, and I mean VERY linear-Can get tedious and boring at times-Story is executed weakly-Characters barely develop. Relationships between them simply don't work and are growing awkwardly.-PC port is not optimized quite enough. I've encountered MANY technical difficulties before managing to make the game playable.-All in all, big portion of the game simply lacks substance, regarding depth of story and gameplay.For the full review, and unlike other reviews I write, I'd start with what I didn't like.THE BAD:Most of the time, and I wish to emphasis that MOST of the time, Enslaved simply lacks substance.Gameplay-wise Enslaved is an action-platformer, and unfortunately it quickly falls into the trap of an extremely linear and repetitive gameplay. Sure, it tries to twist things once in a while, and there is SOME veriaty, SOME of the time. But really, there's a lot of staring at a highly muscled man makes some incredible jump-stunts everytime you press the spacebar, which can be fascinating, but only up to some point.Without getting into too much details I'd mention that there are also some collectibles to collect throughout the game, which are usually not too well hidden, and they don't have much meaning until the very end of the game, and that would mostly leave you with just one way to go forward and not much to do and explore.There are some upgrades which will affect your combat experience but many of them aren't that interesting or significant.So, no matter how much the ""wraparound"" of the game is pretty (and it is, and I will get to it later on), when it makes me repeat the same thing again and again for 16 hours, we know that we got a problem here.But wait, it had a good STORY, doesn't it?Well, so the legends say. And the reviews. And that's what made me so intrigued about this game, because I've read some reviews before buying, and realized that the story is it's main strength.Well, I hate to be the party ruiner, but I didn't enjoy the story.But WHY? you may ask.Well, the story was actually pretty good. But I really didn't feel there was so much of it. If at all!I'm honestly not sure what story people were talking about, but the story here is pretty minimalistic and just spreaded somehow across  14 chapters and an epilogue (way too much!), while most of the time nothing actually happens.(And no, I don't count the ""we need to get this super-mega-hydraulic-mega-duper-power-surge so let's go somewhere and climb stuff and fight mechs for 60 minutes"" as a story progression. And it seems to me most of the story relies on those incidents.)Also the relationship between the two main characters of the game, Monkey and Trip, seemed rather awkward to me, developed in a very weird, nonsensical way, with some weird sexual tension the devs tries to insert, but really, it just didn't work in my opinion. I really felt Trip and Monkey really didn't have much time to develop as characters, while jumping, running, hiding, and hitting robots. There's also a third character joining later on, which I saw as an attempt to add some humorous touch to the story, and yet again, I found the resut rather awkward most of the time,Enslaved has its glory moments, and I admit some parts did feel quite moving, but they were so few along the way, and unfortunately I'd say that the execution and presentation of the story simply wasn't good.But something must have been good, right?THE GOOD:As I said earlier, Enslaved has a nice wraparount, and it deserves some credit.It shows an interesting take on an apocalyptic world taken over by mechs, and it does so with STUNNING scenery and beautiful environments, and I can say for the very least that if the story doesn't worth playing the game, at least the visual side definitely does.The game is accompanied by an INCREDIBLE soundtrack, which fits greatly the atmosphere and the characters, it mixes perfectly with the scenes without going unheard but without taking over the whole experience, too.The animations also felt pretty well done, and it's really a joy to watch Monkey climbs and jumps (he'll usually do that) and also combats (if you managed to run the game smoothly without lagging) (but as I said, it gets tiring at some point).Despite what I said earlier about the story, the ending was a ""WHOOAH DUUUUDE!"" ending. Which is fantastic, and made me look at this game with more compassionate and forgiving attitude.Also, the voice acting felt professional and I enjoyed listening to it. It was really good. Too bad the script and storyline wasn't always as good.THE UGLY:If that was all, I'd possibly consider recommending the game anyway. Unfortunately, there were also plenty of technical problems which I guess are the resuly of bad porting to PC, but that's no excuse.I don't know if these incidents occur on every computer, but from Google searches I found out that I'm definitely not the only one.First of all, it took quite a while to even get the game running, and it behaved in very odd ways. First time I tries to run it it worked alright, the next time it simply didn't want to load my save.After MANY (and I mean it) reboots, reinstallations, tweaks of ini files, changes in the exe file's properties, and lots of messing around, it still didn't work. Then it suddenly did, just when I was about to give up for good.Still, the game was lagging horribly. Not fun. And guess what? I had no way to change the graphics settings. At all. The changes I've made seem to have no effect at all on the game. No matter what I did.Eventually managed to change them manually via an ini file in the game folder.. (Which is just absolutely wrong and not user-friendly at all).And only THEN the game ran in an acceptable way. Still some unexplainable lags from time to time, but oh well. I really wanted  to see where it was going.Another annoying fact - The devs didn't bother changing the descriptions of the special attacks inside the game so that they fit to keyboards. e.g. they'd still tell you to press ""Y"" or ""A"" or ""B"" as if you were using a controller..Well, that was my experience with the game. Fortunately it had an amazing ending, so I didn't end up feeling I've wasted 17 hours of my life (And I stil have the DLC to check out) .			"

												- Wonderful scenery- Gameplay is fun and various. Don't expect technical combat though.- AMAZING characters- At its time it was a new IP. Something rare for sure.- Man, Pigsy's Dlc. Guys play it and you'll understand.This game has its flaws no doubt. They're pretty easy to find for everyone, so I won't even mention them.Enslaved is by far more than the sum of its single parts and at the end you'll be sad this wonderful adventure is already over.Play it, love it.And man, Pigsy's Dlc. Oh man			"

												I bought Enslaved the other day on a bit of a whim. I noticed it in the winter sale and thought why not? After finishing it, I enjoyed the experience so much I decided to make a video review! I'll post the link in case anyone's on the fence about buying!

												Absolutely loved it. I can not believe this game tanked on the consoles.  The story was excellent, the gameplay was at least fair, and the length was just about right.  It tells a reasonably complete story without turning it into a grindfest. I suffered none of the performance issues that some have reported. It is not without flaws however. While this is not really a complaint. I did at times find their clothing annoying. The were both rather underdressed for their roles as wasteland survivors.  Sometimes the camera seemed to do whatever it wanted at the most critcal of moments, and the target lock would inexplicably switch away from the opponent you most needed to get rid of. The ending did seem like it was meant to lead to a sequel. Could have used 3-5 more minutes at the end and wraped the story up a bit better.  All in all, still a great game, 4 out of 5 stars.			"

												Wow what a gem. Excellent story, voice acting is also great, and same with the characters. Worth putting up with my only two gripes to play. One being the menues don't like my mouse, forcing me to use the enter key to select. The second gripe is that you can't skip cinimatics, if you die you have to watch whole thing over again. Still, well worth a play through!			"

												A note - I've played the DLC Pigsy's Perfect 10 AFTER writing the review, which was quite nice and made me appreciate the game even more. It still has some downside and I'd still leave it as thumbs down.But I'd just oppose this a bit and say that you SHOULD check out the game if you're in for an overally nice cinematic experience and appreciate games which are done with thought and care, even if not perfectly well.And here's the original review - Mind you, this game is NOT a bad one. It's just that, for several reasons, I just can't recommend it fullheartedly.Bottom line:+Amazing, lush, beautiful, graphics. Incredible locations+A very interesting take on the book ""Journey to the West""+Incredible soundtrack+Nice, fluid and somewhat fun combat and ""parkouring-ish"", assuming you managed to get the game run well enough.+An awesome WTF ending-Linear gameplay, and I mean VERY linear-Can get tedious and boring at times-Story is executed weakly-Characters barely develop. Relationships between them simply don't work and are growing awkwardly.-PC port is not optimized quite enough. I've encountered MANY technical difficulties before managing to make the game playable.-All in all, big portion of the game simply lacks substance, regarding depth of story and gameplay.For the full review, and unlike other reviews I write, I'd start with what I didn't like.THE BAD:Most of the time, and I wish to emphasis that MOST of the time, Enslaved simply lacks substance.Gameplay-wise Enslaved is an action-platformer, and unfortunately it quickly falls into the trap of an extremely linear and repetitive gameplay. Sure, it tries to twist things once in a while, and there is SOME veriaty, SOME of the time. But really, there's a lot of staring at a highly muscled man makes some incredible jump-stunts everytime you press the spacebar, which can be fascinating, but only up to some point.Without getting into too much details I'd mention that there are also some collectibles to collect throughout the game, which are usually not too well hidden, and they don't have much meaning until the very end of the game, and that would mostly leave you with just one way to go forward and not much to do and explore.There are some upgrades which will affect your combat experience but many of them aren't that interesting or significant.So, no matter how much the ""wraparound"" of the game is pretty (and it is, and I will get to it later on), when it makes me repeat the same thing again and again for 16 hours, we know that we got a problem here.But wait, it had a good STORY, doesn't it?Well, so the legends say. And the reviews. And that's what made me so intrigued about this game, because I've read some reviews before buying, and realized that the story is it's main strength.Well, I hate to be the party ruiner, but I didn't enjoy the story.But WHY? you may ask.Well, the story was actually pretty good. But I really didn't feel there was so much of it. If at all!I'm honestly not sure what story people were talking about, but the story here is pretty minimalistic and just spreaded somehow across  14 chapters and an epilogue (way too much!), while most of the time nothing actually happens.(And no, I don't count the ""we need to get this super-mega-hydraulic-mega-duper-power-surge so let's go somewhere and climb stuff and fight mechs for 60 minutes"" as a story progression. And it seems to me most of the story relies on those incidents.)Also the relationship between the two main characters of the game, Monkey and Trip, seemed rather awkward to me, developed in a very weird, nonsensical way, with some weird sexual tension the devs tries to insert, but really, it just didn't work in my opinion. I really felt Trip and Monkey really didn't have much time to develop as characters, while jumping, running, hiding, and hitting robots. There's also a third character joining later on, which I saw as an attempt to add some humorous touch to the story, and yet again, I found the resut rather awkward most of the time,Enslaved has its glory moments, and I admit some parts did feel quite moving, but they were so few along the way, and unfortunately I'd say that the execution and presentation of the story simply wasn't good.But something must have been good, right?THE GOOD:As I said earlier, Enslaved has a nice wraparount, and it deserves some credit.It shows an interesting take on an apocalyptic world taken over by mechs, and it does so with STUNNING scenery and beautiful environments, and I can say for the very least that if the story doesn't worth playing the game, at least the visual side definitely does.The game is accompanied by an INCREDIBLE soundtrack, which fits greatly the atmosphere and the characters, it mixes perfectly with the scenes without going unheard but without taking over the whole experience, too.The animations also felt pretty well done, and it's really a joy to watch Monkey climbs and jumps (he'll usually do that) and also combats (if you managed to run the game smoothly without lagging) (but as I said, it gets tiring at some point).Despite what I said earlier about the story, the ending was a ""WHOOAH DUUUUDE!"" ending. Which is fantastic, and made me look at this game with more compassionate and forgiving attitude.Also, the voice acting felt professional and I enjoyed listening to it. It was really good. Too bad the script and storyline wasn't always as good.THE UGLY:If that was all, I'd possibly consider recommending the game anyway. Unfortunately, there were also plenty of technical problems which I guess are the resuly of bad porting to PC, but that's no excuse.I don't know if these incidents occur on every computer, but from Google searches I found out that I'm definitely not the only one.First of all, it took quite a while to even get the game running, and it behaved in very odd ways. First time I tries to run it it worked alright, the next time it simply didn't want to load my save.After MANY (and I mean it) reboots, reinstallations, tweaks of ini files, changes in the exe file's properties, and lots of messing around, it still didn't work. Then it suddenly did, just when I was about to give up for good.Still, the game was lagging horribly. Not fun. And guess what? I had no way to change the graphics settings. At all. The changes I've made seem to have no effect at all on the game. No matter what I did.Eventually managed to change them manually via an ini file in the game folder.. (Which is just absolutely wrong and not user-friendly at all).And only THEN the game ran in an acceptable way. Still some unexplainable lags from time to time, but oh well. I really wanted  to see where it was going.Another annoying fact - The devs didn't bother changing the descriptions of the special attacks inside the game so that they fit to keyboards. e.g. they'd still tell you to press ""Y"" or ""A"" or ""B"" as if you were using a controller..Well, that was my experience with the game.

												Enslaved has a decent story, interesting characters and fun dialog. It's overall a game worth of playing just for the characters and dialog. Especially for Pig and his dirty mind. In terms of gameplay, well, that's an another story. The gameplay is repetitive and often bad. Combat is rather braindead hack-slash and gear upgrades are nearly useless. The game itself is platforming heavy. The platforming sucks. You cannot actually do any platforming. You just press an action button and your character automatically moves to another platform. The puzzles are also spoonfed easy. The controls are weak. You often do just random dodges instead of moving to another platform due the same binding. Your placement before the action is often finicky. Especially in the DLC, you start to refer to the controlls with the words cluster and duck with an F. You move with wasd, you change to bomb with arrow keys, then you press mouse 3 to aim, shift to confirm this action and mouse 1 to perform the action. It is really overly comblicated and awkward. Behind a million button presses even if rebinding. The camera angles are static. Meaning it changes often based to the current screen. This also effects your mouse sensitivity in every different screen. Another annoying problem is stun effect which turns the came 180 degrees around 50% of the time. The game is also cutscene heavy. You cannot pause during the cutscenes. The game is around 8 hours long with 2 hours of cutscenes. One would expect more control over the cutscenes. Way too many of them can't be skipped either. Due to the save points always being before cutscenes, sometimes you have to watch unskipable cutscenes over and over if you happen to die. One more thing I have to compain about is the turrets and their overuse in the DLC. It ruins the flow of the game as well as kills all the fun. Overall the DLC was a disappointment due to the crazy amount of enemies and forced sneak combat which the character really was not suitable for since the progress was wave based mob killing.. and sneak... with guns. Yes, it doesn't really work. Overall I will recommend this game for the humor and characters despite the flaws and lacking gameplay.			"

												Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is the 2010 action-adventure game developed by Ninja Theory (noted for Heavenly Sword and infamous for DmC: Devil May Cry) and published by Namco Bandai, recently re-released for the PC with all the DLC included. Important to note: use a gamepad. Most are compatible with PC and easy to set up, it's a worthwhile investment, especially for games like these.The majority of the time spent ingame is on a functional if barebones hack n slash combat system and ""Uncharted-like"" platforming system. Combat itself is very responsive - the counter will always work, the evade has a nice amount of i-frames, and you never feel like you're working against the game, just with it. It is, predictably, marred heavily by its sheer lack of variation - you will be working with the same moves from beginning to end, bar a few bought ""enhancements"" that won't affect your actual combos, and enemy variation caps out at 4 with three minibosses. Combined with the platforming that's completely braindead and nigh automated, and while the game never gets boring it's never in danger of challenging you or demanding anything resembling skill, even starting on Hard. The upgrade system ingame exacerbates this, simply making an already easy affair easier.Despite the odd novelty shooting segment or ""Cloud"" platforming section, where you impersonate Tony Hawk in a post-apocalyptic setting (the most fun sections of the game), and the aforementioned minibosses, the game never has any ""real"" boss battles or sense of climactic moments. The game eventually blends into a continuous slurry, pacing-wise.A gorgeous slurry at that. Every single environment in Enslaved is eye-candy, with even the more robotic-leaning levels managing to impress and becoming absolutely stunning during the Village levels. Animations are fluid and the camera supports it, with the game taking advantage of its limits. While the story goes from interesting to dull to absolutely stupid, the voice-acting throughout all of it is top-notch.Worth mentioning is that the included DLC, ""Pigsy's Perfect 10"", is more than just weirdly good: it's almost as fun as the base game, a 3-hour or so romp playing as ""Pigsy"" with four gadgets, an unlimited amount of bullets, and more stealth-oriented gameplay. You can access it in ""Extras"", which is a bit out-of-the-way.Unfortunately the OST - outside of the DLC's banjo-infested romps which never fail to get old - is boring orchestrated filler and completely forgettable, with a lot of seeming SFX issues on top of it; actions triggering with no sound attached. The game as a whole is almost hilariously glitchy - nothing game-breaking, but I've had to restart at Checkpoints several times with Trip falling through the game world or Monkey doing the monkey dance midair. Forever.Enslaved, at its best, plays like the likes of ""Jak and Daxter"" with fast-paced combat and platforming, and at its worst, plays like a dry, dull AAA affair with railroaded platforming, forced cover-based shooting segments and blatant technological problems. Ultimately, it's worth playing and then some, but not without keeping the caveats in mind.It's not a game you should be buying for the mechanics, but to look at idly while you skim through it once then forget about it. It doesn't have the depth or the variety to support multiple playthroughs and ultimately ends up a bit of a chore (take it from me). Absolutely no incentive to 100% it either, not so much as a congratulations message. Still a bit sore about that.Keep it in mind when you see it in a sale, is what Enslaved: Odyssey to the West deserves. It deserves something.			"

												Enslaved is, as someone else put it, ""criminally underrated."" It came out just ahead of a bunch of established IPs, and Ninja Theory's biggest thing to date then was Heavenly Sword, so it got passed over by a lot of people. That said, while it was ignored for bigger names, Enslaved is a pretty good game... though not a great game. Still, I bought it on sale for $5 and it was worth every penny, and I'd probably recommend it for $20.Basically, while it has the usual beat'em up style gameplay and parkour'ing around, it tries to be different. There's now graybrown sludge here, the environments are vivid and bright and colorful. Not every battle needs to be fought--you can skip some. Some of the battles are less beat'em up and more puzzle, as you need to work together with the female lead to get past them. Finally, it has a sense of humor, a good sense of story, and a pleasant twist at the end.All in all, while it's nothing revolutionary, and certainly will feel a bit dated by today's standards, it's still worth a look. And at around 10 hours for one playthrough (with some DLC that comes with it and cheevos to farm, adding on time), it won't take you too long.Give it a try. You won't hate it.			"

												Underappreciated game like a lot off the other reviews say. It's a good port from console. Character development and art direction shine in this game. The game also is very good (at least for me) at building suspense and tension. The people who made this game knew what they were doing in regards to these points. Combat is 'janky', and expects you to get good to make up for it. The game is also quite easy when played on normal difficulty - I'm not sure if playing on hard will change anything except the combat, which would be a nightmare scenario.I'm not sure how I got this game. probably from a humble bundle where I overlooked this game. I would however recommend you to get it below $10. Quite fun! Not fun enough to make me want to play the DLC. :)			"

												Enslaved: Odyssey to the West was a game that I had always heard was good, but I had never known anyone who had played it. When it went on sale recently, I decided to snag it. Boy am I glad I did!The story of the game is quite interesting, as you play a Prince-of-Persia-esque character named Monkey who is enslaved by a girl named Trip to escort her home through the American wastelands. The two have an interesting relationship with one another, and the cutscenes/in-game sequences make playing through Enslaved worthwhile alone. The graphics looks great, I played everything on maxed out quality at 1080p without a hitch. The voicework was amazing, and was surprised to find that the great Andy Serkis lent his voice to the main character. Gameplay mechanics, while function spledidly, can become somewhat repititious, especially during combat. Upgrades and a few special moves help keep things fresh, but towards the six hour mark of my eight hour playthrough, I was looking forward to the platforming sequences and not the combat. I would recommend this game to anyone, whether or not it was on sale, but if you can find it on sale, pick it up now! You won't regret it!			"

												One of my go to games if I ever need to enjoy some down time.  I love their take on Journey to the West.  Trip and Monkey have some awesome interactions and the trust is a slow build.  It does have some down sides but a lot of it has to do with the camera control.  However, this is a game I've loved since the moment I started it up and I will likely continue to have it installed on all my future computers.			"

												Four stages of ENSLAVED: Odyssey to the West Premium Edition:1) Anger:* WTF with this graphics, it's wasted even for 2009* WTF with fighting and combo system, it's oversimplified* WTF with unskippable movies and wasted checkpoint system* WTF with camera angles and control2) Denial:* No, I'm not going to waste my time customizing graphics via different settings out of ones provided within the game* No, I'm not going to finish this game, my eyes are crying for better picture and my fingers are dying for something more button-pushing than this* And f@ck DLC about this *spoiler censorship*3) Bargaining:* OK, it's kind of playable and sometimes even interesting, so I'll just finish it (just to cover money spent on it) and grab all achievements and forget about it forever4) Acceptance:* Fine, I've tuned graphics via config files with help of community advices and SweetFX, no the game looks even tasty* Fine, combos are lame but tolerable* Wow, most of in-game videos can be skipped with ""backspace"" on keyboard or ""back"" (""select"") button on gamepad* Fine, I tweaked camera's FOV with Widescreen Fixer program a littlePS. I had two runs through the game with 2.5 years intervals between them. During my first run I really didn't like most of the game's aspects, while I liked most of them too. So it left 35(good)/65(bad) hangover effect on me. I didn't even touch DLC.But the game has some charm that makes you think about it. The charm made me to do second run and now I have 75(good)/25(bad) rating for it.I changed my mind about graphics (thankfully it can be tweaked), but the weakest points of the game are:- combo/fighting system- story - it feels pretty uneven, torn- bosses - most of them you won't even remember, but the final fight is pretty epic- main characters - 2 runs through the game and I still have no empathy to them (except only one episodic character (in main game), and especially after DLC about him)DLC appeared to be pretty cool and funny, I really liked it. I even liked it more than the base game. It has more even storytelling, more interactive gameplay and the main character is pretty charismatic.So what in the end? I think you should try the game at least once, because some moments in it very deep and touching, and epic. And the final credit song is so great =)			"

												A really good game that I had never even heard of until just recently I bought it in the steam daily sale for like $4. For that price it is a steal. Although the graphics look horrifyingly bad close-up, like in cut scenes when a character is shown close up, it looks sickening, but at medium to far distances, the game looks fantastic. Lots of colors and a very vibrant living world that is a pleasure to look at. The combat/controls are fluid and the sound is good, the script is good and the voice acting is pretty good, even if it is way too serious in tone. This game definitely takes itself very serious in its dialogue.The combat mechanics and the way you can give fun commands to your partner, like to use a decoy while you run behind and destroy guards, is all a lot of fun and done well. The only downside is that your main characters are pretty cliche: the main guy acts like a big ret@rded shirtless ape and the other is a hot girl who is, as usual, inexplicably a master hacker. Like I just so happened to find a really hot girl who is a master computer whiz lol. Either way, I wish I had known about this game when it first came out a year ago because it is pretty fun for a once-through.The only major downside I've seen so far is the game is NOT alt+tab friendly, causing a white screen where I could ctrl+alt+del to see my desktop but couldn't even see task manager and had to force restart with the power button which p-sses me off to no end.7.5/10 tons of fun for a once through			"

												First things first , this game isn't fully compitable with PC yeah and heres why : -You cannot adjust your display , you're stuck  with the graphics it gets installed at by default-There's slight glitches , bugs in the display dynamics that oughts you to restart from last checkpoint ( during my full gameplay happened twice ) thats it.Alright the game itself is awesome , features a unique adventure that offers you abit of everything , puzzles , action , platforming , enjoying the artwork which is flooding the game , and enjoying an intersting story.-Graphics in this game are ultra awesome , regardless the maximum requirements the game has sat up in the store page , i think you may need way higher specs to enjoy it.-Artwork , this game is really full of it , each corner in this game features lots and lots of nice artwork.-Story is amazing , runs as a still water  a little bit expected , no plot twists and its that type of ''and they lived happly ever after'' stories its still good.-Gameplay........well , this game is meant to be for consoles only yea , so it shows the flaws of the incompitability but its not standing between having fun and still getting used to the most annoying camera system i've dealt with for a while.-Puzzles they're in each chapter , so easy almost no compeition in them.-Platforming is like 60% of the game , but its variable and wont get you bored at all.In other words , this game is pretty much worth to get during sale or in full price , its fun but could have been better and sadly the techniqual problems almost ruined such an amazing game. 8/10.

												I really like this game and its characters,  I like how the relationship between Monkey and Trip evolves. The story telling and art design are great and the game itself is a lot of fun to play. I've re-played a few times and yes, the controls can be a bit clunky at times and so I would highly recomend playing with a controller, but I do recommend this game.			"

												While very linear, the characters are interesting, the gameplay is reminiscient of Prince of Persia and combat is similar to the Batman games. There are challenges to be had and lots of fun to be had. I wasn't that impressed with the ending though.			"

												This game seems cool, but it's a bad port and has sound issues and there for me atleast there is a game breaking bug that hinders me from comming any further, a distructable wall that is suppose to be ""destoryed"" by a mob when it appears, it ends up trying to destroy it and than just bugs through it and when you deal with him, your company just says ""this way will bring us back to the street"" as she runs into the wall forever.0/10 because gamebreaking bugs in a game from 2010 + bad port.

												The scenery is pretty, and the voice acting is good, but the combat gets really tiresome before too long. It's mostly dull, though not particularly difficult. The last two levels are particularly aggravating, and feel like they didn't get as much polish as the rest of the game. The final resolution comes out of nowhere, was trite, and left the story feeling pretty unsatisfactory in the end. Add to it Pigsy, the character who starts out as a quirky sidekick and ventures into creepy uncle territory, and you have a game that ends up being mildly aggravating but ultimately forgettable. If you want to see what linear action games using Unreal Engine 3 were like in the late 2010's, this will give you a pretty clear idea, and it's easy to finish in just a couple sittings.			"

												ENSLAVED seems like a pretty enjoyable game for the most part. Criminally overlooked on release, it has an interesting story going for it (including mo-cap acting from Andy Serkis and an Alex Garland story), passable combat and platforming.Sadly, though, I can't recommend it because the port of the game is so dreadful I limped through the game's first four hours before calling it quits. I really wanted to play on, but a locked-down port with frame caps and a 2GB RAM limit prevent playable framerates, let alone enjoying a pretty, immersive world.What a shame.			"

												An interactive movie if I ever saw one. Enslaved Odyssey to the West does a good job of immersing you in the world, at first. To anyone who has played the demo they may think this is a great game, or will be... but they would be wrong. Constant camera control being taken away from you for 'cinematic sequences', constantly the game slows you down by literally making you walk while characters deliver dialogue that could have easily been given while the player is actually playing the freakin' game. Seriously the freakin girl character literally stops you from doing things, barks out order to you (so you can't solve simple puzzles on your own, the game treats you like an idiot by even placing her there). The camera is wonky, combat is okay but very tedious. Graphics become tedious once you reazlie the yare resycled far too often. Did I mention this game really wants to feel like a movie? Causei f you're into that sort of thing, then you'll LOVE this game... if you want an interactive video game with interactive story telling (true interactive) you won't find it here. You will find a controlled game that is for basic players, it's very hard to screw up in this game. Everything is done for you, auto platforming and all that... it's an insult. I'm only glad I only paid 4 bucks for it, don't buy this game if you want a 3D platforming action experience, cause you won't find it here.			"

												Buyers beware!  This is a beautiful game and seems fun to play with at first but there are bugs in this game!  I'm already stuck on chapter 2 and can't move beyond a pipe because there is a glitch in this game and apparently a few others according to the forum.  I also found out the problem has been there for a year now and they don't seem to care or have any kind of support!  I'm glad I only paid $5 for it.  Until they get it fixed, this remains the worst purchase I have ever made on steam because I only got to play 1/2 hr of the game and I was on for a hour trying to get out of this twilight zone glitch I'm stuck in!!Ok, So I finally got off the stupid bug in the early going after more than an hour!!  The game gets even more frustrating as I found out the controls and cameras of this game are frustrating as hell!  fighting the mechs (common droid enemies) was like fighting a boss each time that's how hard it felt!!  The camera and controls seem to have a mind of their own and you get killed over and over again because it's so hard to defeat the mechs!!  This is the most frustrating game I've ever played in my life due to the bad and lazy port!! Stay away from this game at all cost!!!			"

												8/10 ! I. LOVE. THIS. GAME. !!!!I do advise you to play it with a controller it feels so much more fluent and natural then on keyboard.il start with the negatives after a couple of story chapters the combat gets boring realy quick. here n thereyou will pick up some new stuff or add some points in upgrading your abilities.BUT! if you make sure u see past the combat flaws and just focus on the rest of the game.u will see this game is set in an amazing world and setting i love the concept and its graphics are pretty damn goodfor when it was released. now the beautifull game isnt just its major plus, Also its well designed characters and storyline.u just cant help but feel involved in what is going on and what is about to happen.I dont realy want to spoil anything but if you want this game? its a must have! u def. want to pick it up on a sale!i would give it a higher rating but the combat issue is whats dropping it			"

												$6.22 for the premium edition. Will post more as I play. Does not port over properly as the instructions for Focus Attack are ""Press Y+B"" which does not exist on the PC version.PROS1. Cloud TravelLoved the cloud movement levels. High speed, high jumps and lot of room to explore. Boss Hound fight was great too.2. Combat systemVery interesting fighting system. Love the power of range weapons and how they function very similarly to reality. Distracting is a new mechanic, simple but it adds a different method of playing. I was a bit disappointed that the bosses tend to be killed with a similar pattern e.g. Stun, Heavy Attack, Stun, Heavy Attack, Takedown Move, Rinse, Repeat.You can't target lock/focus on an enemy making it hard to aim your shields with the lousy camera movements.3. 2-person puzzleIt is interesting but it gets kind of repetitive. E.g. Piggyback, Toss Trip, Open Security Door/Push Blocks, Rinse, Repeat.4. Dragonfly ViewInteresting but it would be better if you could control and fly the Dragonfly yourself instead of a controlled cutscene. If control was allowed, you could design hidden areas in the map, plant ambushes, plant mines, hide paths and switches etc etc and the player would have to use Dragonfly view to find them. Like hide-and-seek.5. PuzzlesQuite fun relative to plain old switches E.g. DrawbridgeCONS1. PortingDid not port over properly from Playstation. Viewing mode is horrible at certain areas. Worst, they are bugged and you can't reach certain areas. Refer to my screenshots for more information.2. Jumping Off/OnCertain ledges are really silly. While I appreciate not being able to fall off an edge, I really hate having  to find specific ledges just to jump off E.g. Theatre with the hound reaquires you to jump off at the first prop stage in order to reach the stage floor.Jumping off into a 90 degree corner can create a bug where you keep falling infinitely, so you look like you're swimming in mid air.Refer to my screenshots for more information.Very linear. There is no wrong pathway to jump to. Just keep pressing an obvious direction key and the jump button to proceed. You just need to be fast.3. StorylineVery meh. It's not exactly engaging. You have Slavers, Earth 200 years in the future, evolutionary robots, etc etc, but they don't come together to form a concrete story. They seem to be modularised instead of being integrated into a complete story.4. The StaffAbsolutely horrible to switch between Plasma and Stun on the PC. You have to Right Click, go into First person mode, then press the Left Arrow and Right Arrow key while holding down Right Click in the middle of battle.5. UpgradesOnly Staff, Combat, Health and Shield to choose from, yet you can't use WASD to choose them. You can't mouseover the correct wheel to choose the specific upgrade properly as there seems to be a bug.			"

												Extremely short, repetitive gameplay, good ideas that were excuted poorly and the toughest enemy in the entire game is the camera. The camera fights you every way possible. Forcing you to look at an object for several seconds, shifting randomly, being unable to target enemies, and very limited control over it to even look around. The characters were bland too and nothing interesting kept you hooked. It's mediocre at best. Kinda regret buying it, even at a sale price.			"

												Immensely entertaining. The nice mix of combat and platforming was good. The fact that you cannot fall off things by stepping the wrong way is hardly noticed as you are often moving to quickly to notice it. The characters really drew me in and their development and acting was well done.Seeing Andy Serkis' face throughout the game was slightly weird. I also was a bit dismayed at my time played to complete this game on normal. I picked it up on sale and do not regret the purchase. Could use some polish for a PC port as it still has some tooltips referring to console buttons.8/10 Solid fun and would play through again.			"

												I haven't stayed up late to finish a game in a long time - E: OthW was a blast!  Just the right mix for me of jumping, bashing, shooting, surfing, puzzles, and story.  Haven't had this much fun since Beyond Good and Evil, which this game made me nostaligc for with the bo-staff fights, hovercrafts, and pig-styled characters.  That said it's a completely different game and much darker story, but still enjoyable and fun to play.  The fight style can be tough, to the point of frustrated cursing at times, but it helps break the simple run through of the jump puzzles and co-op puzzles, which are thoughtful enough to add to the game but not mind breaking.  The decoy feature with your partner is handy, even if you get frustrated with the constant ""Monkey! Go fetch this!"" ""Monkey! I can't jump.""  ""Monkey!  Kill something!"" I also love the characters, Monkey in particular is great and Pigsy is hilarious.  The graphics and detail really bring them to life.  Love also the silly jumping / climbing mechanic whcih grows on you after awhile.  The only thing I wasn't happy with was the ending, which felt cut off after staying up to finish it through, but there's still extra Pigsy content to play and the journey is more satisfying than the destination.  This game is not that pricey, totally worth a few hours of your life.  Buy it!			"

												Pros:Great atmosphereGood voice actingGood character personalitiesDecent platforming and combatCons:Absolutely tacked on ending, like the last second they tried to throw in some moral dycotomy it didn't work at all.Limited enemies and platforming variety (more below if curious)Some graphical issues (may just be me, more below as well.)Definitely worth a check, I'd say if it's on sale pick it up. Though I always wait for sales so I'd rarely recommend a full price purchase unless you really want the game and know you'll probably like it.About the limited enemies and platforming elements. I felt they were both decently made but they both also get old somewhat quickly. There aren't many enemy types, mostly you'll fight the same 4 mechs so combat can grow pretty tedious. Also platforming  always stagnates in my opinion, there's only so much you can do with it and the answers paths in this game aren't hard to figure out. Luckily the game switches between fighting and platforming at a decent pace to make both more palatable. Usually a game being short I consider a con since it kind of sucks paying money for something you burn through so easily but it almost helps this game since if it went on for much longer the combat/platforming would probably end up wearing on my patience as I grew more tired of them.Graphical issues, overall the graphics are fine in my opinion. But the cutscenes had a wierd wave effect while the camera was panning that was pretty annoying, this could just be some setting on my computer I messed up I guess but it never really happened during actual gameplay. Also Tripps hair is like a bundle of wires, they clip with her face and such which I found pretty noticable. They're both very minor cons though.			"

												Enslaved: Odyseey to the West is a solid action game held up mostly by its characters and storytelling. In a distant post-apocalyptic future you play Monkey, who escapes from a slave ship only to be enslaved by a fellow escapee: Trip. From that point forward you're trying to keep her alive during various adventures. I can't really go into it any further than that without spoiling things, but suffice it to say the storytelling and character development is interesting, particularly during the first half of the game.Gameplay-wise you're looking at a fairly standard action-platformer. Monkey jumps and climbs around some crazy - and beautifully colorful - environments. And over time he unlocks more spectacular methods of navigating terrain and taking out enemies. There is an element of collecting materials to upgrade and unlock abilities here, so there's a small amount of customization. That sadly doesn't do anything to prevent the combat from being very simplistic throughout. And even the spectacular boss battles are handled by fairly basic, eventually repetitive, means.Enslaved is an older game, and it shows. The environmental design is beautiful and colorful, but the texturework is frequently hideous and there's not much detail to anything. It looks worse than a game released in 2010 should. Similarly, the audio is far from ideal. There is no separate voice volume slider, which often results in voiceovers being completely drowned out by sound effects. Subtitles are essential.The game loses a little of its focus after the halfway point, but picks it up again shortly before the ending. It ends up being a game that's most-of-the-way to being excellent. Yet it falls flat in terms of execution a few too many times to get all the way there. Some sequences are very glitchy and the combat mechanics / enemy variety could've used some more attention, for example.All DLC is included with this edition, which is a blessing. The character DLC is largely useless, because it only unlocks after playing the campaign through once, and you're really not going to play through it a second time. But Pigsy's Perfect 10 is an excellent example of how DLC can be done right. It takes the main game's formula, but puts a huge spin on the gameplay mechanics and delivers an excellent 2-3 hour linear stealth & sniping mini-campaign. It even serves as a nice self-contained prequel story ... that's best experienced after playing through the main campaign.Conclusion / TL;DREnslaved: Odyssey to the West is an excellent ""experience"". Gamers who enjoy interesting stories, strong characters and amazing environments can't go wrong. But those looking for strong action-platforming mechanics first and foremost will be let down.Technical DroningRequires some ini tweaks to render properly, specifically to fix a Shadow rendering bug and unlock the frame rate.120Hz - Yes, with ini tweaksBorderless Window - NoGraphics Options - DecentTexture Quality - PoorGamepad vs Keyboard - Gamepad, the keyboard controls aren't very goodAudio Balance - Poor.

GAMEPLAYYou play as Monkey and will spend 90% of the time tirelessly hopping from pipe to pipe, jumping across walkways and climbing buildings while all Tripp needs to do is walk a couple of steps to get to the exact same destination.What's a little annoying is the limitations on what you can do and go for. You can't jump down edges or leap in a different direction when the game doesnt want you to. You can't even fall from ledges unless you're supposed to. The game insists on holding your hand throughout the game. Despite this, I sometimes found myself in situations of not knowing what to do next, only because the objectives weren't mapped out clearly.These invisible barriers for a game isnt new or that bad actually... In fact, it's a good thing since I won't ever find myself accidentally jumping in the wrong directions and falling into a pool of acid or something but it also means no sense of danger, freedom or thought needed for the player.The gameplay mechanics are pretty interesting the first few times, then starts getting rather repetitive when you realize this is what you'll have to go through for the rest of the game. Climb this, climb that, deal with conveniently placed turrets, pull some lever and fight mostly the same robot enemies over and over again that you'll encounter throughout the whole game. Unlike what it seems, this is mostly a platformer-puzzle game than it is an action-adventure game. Not to say I hate platformer games. I've played games like the Prince of Persia series and enjoyed them, but for a game like Enslaved, all the climbing segments are all too similiar and with all the protective invisible walls in place, there's no challenge to be found in any of it.There are thankfully several instances of more fun action such as running from a giant robot dog or fighting a big robot that shoots his balls at you, but these are few and far in between.Levels are mostly linear and despite the changes in environment for each chapter, the map designs never really of changes and soon starts to feel way too repetitive.BAD PORTINGThere's little reason to roam in the maps apart from collecting bright shiny red floating orbs that you can use for upgrades which are pointless anyway. Because with such shoddy controls for this PC port, I couldn't even be bothered to use half of new movesets I unlock. One particuarly useful attack of Monkey swinging his long pole at multiple enemies (space+left mouse) can't even performed with the keyboard, with Monkey jumping up and down like an hapless dolt more times than when he actually performs the attack successfully. This is the biggest problem I had with the game and I never found a solution to it.Mouse sensitivity is all over place and it took me multiple attempts at tweaking the .ini file and in-game settings to finally settle things down. Even then, I had problems with the aiming controls, trying to aim with projectiles feels like trying to aim with WASD than with my own mouse. People who play on the controller probably wont be affected by all this crap porting issues, but hey, this is a effin' PC game. If they want to port it to PC, then port it right. A COMPELLING STORYThe story of Enslaved starts off with a half-naked dude, Monkey, being enslaved by a girl called Tripp, thus the title ""Enslaved"". Many elements are borrowed from Journey to the West, but mostly it's just the characters. Not sure if they were even travelling to the 'West'. The relationship is between Tripp and Monkey is interesting but never fully explored. Their journey spans across a few different unique locations but I honestly couldn't get that feeling of a refresh. Structures and paths are largely the same and having to battle the exact same robot enemies for all these levels made this adventure a tiring slog through.I can't give a proper conclusion to the story since I've not reached the last chapter, and it's pretty much the main reason why I, and most people I guess, play the game for. But with the kind of gameplay I have to put up with, I don't think I can be bothered to. GRAPHICSGraphics is pretty okay for 2010 standards, but far too bright and vibrant for my tastes. The excessive bloom washes away texture definition and environment details and the brightness can sometimes be too distracting instead. CONCLUSIONEnslaved Odyssey to the West has a potentially good premise in its world that leaves much to be answered but as much as I hate to say this, it just squanders too much repetitiveness, linear level design and gameplay mechanics that makes the game more boring to play than enjoy. If you're fine with a very mediocre gameplay experience and prefer playing the game for a story or adventure you might enjoy this game. But personally, as much as I wanted to, I couldn't. 2.5/5 "

												This game is pretty good. It's not the greatest thing I've ever played, but if i didn't own it anymore and needed to buy it again, i would. It doesnt bring anything new to the table, theres nothing i havent seen or done before in this game but its still fun and feels familiar. It's EXTREMELY good for the price i got it for during the Summer Sale, and would still not be a disappointing purchase if i were to pay full price.The thing that stands out the most to me in the game is the level design, it's absolutely beautiful. The city of New York in a post-apocalyptic state overgrown with trees, vines and bushes. The texturing could REALLY use some work though. It all looks great from afar but once up close things arent quite as good looking, although that takes nothing from the game IMO. Gameplay > graphics no matter how you look at it. Theres a LOT of environmental puzzles in a Prince of Persia type of way. Lots of climbing and jumping around on destroyed buildings and other things in the environment. That' one of my favorite aspects of the game, I've always loved that sort of thing. Prince of Persia is one of my favorite game series ever.The storyline in the game is GREAT. I'm really enjoying it. I'm not going to talk about the story though, as i don't want to be the guy dropping spoilers in the reviews, that's always gotten on my nerves when people do that. The writers for this deserve a lot of credit for making this game what it is, because if the story wasnt enjoyable i think i would have already moved on to another game. There is a lot of games with the same style of game mechanics as this one, so a solid story is important in this genre to me.The combat is pretty fulfilling, you have a decent variety of moves and such although it could use a little more. It reminds me a lot of God of Wars combat the way you fight in this game. The combat IS repetitive, though it hasn't felt like it was so far. You have this laser staff type thing, you can use it for melee combat and also to shoot energy projectiles at enemies. So far I've come across two different ammo types, a normal energy charge and then a stun charge but there may be more throughout the game I'm not sure. There is quick time events, but they're not very often and they're usually just a single button to press to finish off an enemy. Speaking of enemies, that's one thing this game could've use, more variety of enemies. You fight the same mechs over and over and over.You collect red orbs which are used to upgrade your health, your shield, your combat abilities and your staff. To me that's always been kind of a generic way to fill in the spaces to give a game more content and another purpose of playing, but the game does not rely too heavily on this so it does not bother me. They are found just layting around in random places and they are dropped by enemies after you defeat them.You have a female character with you at all times that is an integral part of the story, and you have to make use of her abilities to get through some parts of the game. You put her on your back an dcarry her through mine fields, she can create a decoy that attracts gunfire so you can get to places that have turrets watching, you can toss her up to palces you cannot reach for her to help you get where you need to go. Theres also other things you can do with her, but i'll leave that for you to discover.Theres whole seperate campaigns in the bonus content section, i thought that was pretty cool. You can assume the role of other characters in the game and play through their stories. A nice addition to an already satisfying game. Would be great if other games did this also.If i had to describe this game through comparisons to other games, i would say this is the lovechild of God of War, Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed. The game is good enough to be placed next to any of those 3 and stand strong in competition with them, even though this is nowhere near as well known or liked.I havent completely finished the game yet, but i feel I've played enough to give an honest, fair review and right now on a scale of 1 through 10 i would give this game 8.5/10If you are a fan of any of three series mentioned above, you shouldnt hesitate to give this one a try.

												This is the best quality of immersive gameplay i have ever seen. Difficulty is not artificial - meaning that there is a dynamic and non-repetitive way to make the game hard - not just ""this guy is super tanky and does amazing damage and now theres  5 of them""I did not get bored once during this game, there is no long winded time wasting - every action you take is relevant and will make a difference. The game has you wondering about so many things and the story is enriching. I wish there was a sequel.Honestly best game I have played that I can remember and for a 2010 game this has astonishing graphics.Also - the soundtrack!!!!!!! None of those annoying pingy bodyless tunes but instead the soundtrack is harmonic, flowing, fitting.10/10			"

												Was honestly hoping for a better game. After seeing this game on so many ""top 10 most underrated games"" and ""top 10 games nobody played"" lists, I had high hopes. While it wasn't bad, it was really just a little better than average. First off, the good. The story is semi-interesting and the character development and bond between the two characters is fun to watch. The voice and acting is good. The graphics are solid, except for some problems with shadows and shading (had nothing to do with my top of the line comp). The combat could have been much better. You use a light and heavy attack. But unlike god of war or most 3rd person action games, there are no combos. You literally just hit with all light, all heavy, or mix them, but any mixture of the two always comes out the same. You can use a stun attack and a wide attack to move everyone back. You also get a special attack from hitting people, although there is no meter or way to know how it is progressing. You have all that within the first hour. You literally gain nothing else all game. There is an evade attack where you just evade and attack, pretty boring. The game includes a counter ability, but it is the single worst in any game ever. It doesn't even work. You have to be blocking and then press a button at the right time, but the button takes you out of block and gets you hurt. I tried it like 10 times and it never once worked. The upgrade system is boring too. You get increased health, shields, better shooting damage, and thats about it. There is nothing interesting. There are collectible masks but they basically don't do anything besides show a random picture. The other biggest problem is the enemies. The entire game you fight like 4 different (but basically same looking) robots. They have no personality, don't talk, and have no incentive or agenda. There is no entity you are fighting against. So the fighting is uninteresting because the enemies never change and you don't care about them. Fighting endless silent robots the entire game just takes away the fun. The game also doesn't describe the world at all. There are 3 total people the entire game, and it is never explained why. Why were there all these robots with no masters, who controls them, where are people, what has happened......none of it explained. There have been positive things said about the post-apocolyptic setting, and its ok. It doesn't feel real or lived in like the last of us. It is a bunch of same looking worn down buildings with green moss on them, thats about it. You are among buildings, in a scrapyard, in a ramshackle town, and in a facility. That's basically it. I didn't find any of them that impressive. The camera zooms in too closely in combat and it is hard to see when people are about to attack you, which is annoying. Another caveat is Trip. Instead of making her like Elle from the last of us, they make here way too feminine and damsel in distress. She needs help all the time, even making you carry her up this tiny ledge she can easily climb. She spends most of the time crying and yelling when enemies attack, even if it is you fighting them and she is nowhere near them, she'll just scream and wail because you are fighting. It gets super annoying and she's so helpless and whiny I felt like she was dakota fanning from War of the Worlds. The platforming is kind of fun, but it is super linear. You jump from one shiny rung or foothold to another. You never have to aim or do anything besides just continually hammer jump, its not like ""drakes uncharted"" where you feel accomplished or like it actually took skill. Sometimes the platforming doesn't work. You will be by the edge and just roll forward against an invisible wall, because you weren't at the perfect spot to trigger the jump sequence, which makes it feel even more linear and hands-off. The game does provide good length though. The DLC is fun and a change of pace, although pigsy is made to be way too slow getting over things, activating abilities, and getting in and out of cover. It does introduce you to the best character of the game, Truffles, who is baller. The ending was sad and the most heartbroken I have been in a game in a while. As for enslaved as a whole, if the upgrade system wasn't boring as hell, the combat had variation or something more than using the same weapon with the same 2 attacks for 8 hours, and weren't fighting the same boring 4 machines with no personality, I would recommend it higher. Right now, 7/10.			"

												Great single player experience, very well written, very good voice acting, well worth a playthrough for anyone who enjoys a good action packed story based game. Did poor on sales on consoles in 2010 and was brought to PC in 2013 and it definitely is a hidden gem. Combat and upgrades are simplified but fun and easy to get used to, sharp and colorful graphics but don't expect anything crazy as it's just another console port with some glitches here and there, definitely read the tweak guide available in the steam discussion forum of the game. If you see this for $5 GET IT!! you will enjoy the playthrough.			"

												It's a melee/platforming game, without much depth to either aspect. You fight robots while a beautiful companion drags you around to fulfill her goals. It's very similar to the 2008 Prince of Persia, but far more linear and less fluid. The core game lasts around 6-8 hours, repetitive scenarios and simplified gameplay make it seem a lot longer.A lot has been made of the acting, but the mo-cappers are over-qualified for the kind of ""go here, push button"" mechanics that drive the narrative action in these type of games, and it ends up feeling heavy handed much of the time given that there's so little to work with.The PC port is poor. I encountered frequent stuttering during cutscenes and ended up having to skip most to watch on Youtube later, further stuttering occurs whenever you hit a checkpoint. A graphical glitch renders shadows on characters poorly, spoiling an otherwise good looking game.I can't recommend Enslaved, while it has some strong suits, they're few and far between the long stretches of climbing in one direction and samey robot brawls. If you must experience it, do so on a console to avoid any potential headaches, or just watch the movie edit on Youtube.			"

												This game does not deserve whatever ratings it got I can tell you that. The game idea is great similar to that of an uncharted game but the problem is with the port. The game has numerous issues that can prevent a player from continuing in the game. Things like enemies not destroying enviorment like they are supposed to  or being unable to jump from pipe to pipe. The fact that of the 5+ hours that I have on the game the last hour alone has been spent trying to get past a single bug that wont let me continue the game is proof enough. The game is riddled with bugs and issues. The game play is fun but the game itself is severally bugged and most of these bugs have been known for over a year.			"

												I haven't stayed up late to finish a game in a long time - E: OthW was a blast!  Just the right mix for me of jumping, bashing, shooting, surfing, puzzles, and story.  Haven't had this much fun since Beyond Good and Evil, which this game made me nostaligc for with the bo-staff fights, hovercrafts, and pig-styled characters.  That said it's a completely different game and much darker story, but still enjoyable and fun to play.  The fight style can be tough, to the point of frustrated cursing at times, but it helps break the simple run through of the jump puzzles and co-op puzzles, which are thoughtful enough to add to the game but not mind breaking.  The decoy feature with your partner is handy, even if you get frustrated with the constant ""Monkey! Go fetch this!"" ""Monkey! I can't jump.""  ""Monkey!  Kill something!"" I also love the characters, Monkey in particular is great and Pigsy is hilarious.  The graphics and detail really bring them to life.  Love also the silly jumping / climbing mechanic whcih grows on you after awhile.  The only thing I wasn't happy with was the ending, which felt cut off after staying up to finish it through, but there's still extra Pigsy content to play and the journey is more satisfying than the destination.  This game is not that pricey, totally worth a few hours of your life.  Buy it!			"

												Enslaved: Odyseey to the West is a solid action game held up mostly by its characters and storytelling. In a distant post-apocalyptic future you play Monkey, who escapes from a slave ship only to be enslaved by a fellow escapee: Trip. From that point forward you're trying to keep her alive during various adventures. I can't really go into it any further than that without spoiling things, but suffice it to say the storytelling and character development is interesting, particularly during the first half of the game.Gameplay-wise you're looking at a fairly standard action-platformer. Monkey jumps and climbs around some crazy - and beautifully colorful - environments. And over time he unlocks more spectacular methods of navigating terrain and taking out enemies. There is an element of collecting materials to upgrade and unlock abilities here, so there's a small amount of customization. That sadly doesn't do anything to prevent the combat from being very simplistic throughout. And even the spectacular boss battles are handled by fairly basic, eventually repetitive, means.Enslaved is an older game, and it shows. The environmental design is beautiful and colorful, but the texturework is frequently hideous and there's not much detail to anything. It looks worse than a game released in 2010 should. Similarly, the audio is far from ideal. There is no separate voice volume slider, which often results in voiceovers being completely drowned out by sound effects. Subtitles are essential.The game loses a little of its focus after the halfway point, but picks it up again shortly before the ending. It ends up being a game that's most-of-the-way to being excellent. Yet it falls flat in terms of execution a few too many times to get all the way there. Some sequences are very glitchy and the combat mechanics / enemy variety could've used some more attention, for example.All DLC is included with this edition, which is a blessing. The character DLC is largely useless, because it only unlocks after playing the campaign through once, and you're really not going to play through it a second time. But Pigsy's Perfect 10 is an excellent example of how DLC can be done right. It takes the main game's formula, but puts a huge spin on the gameplay mechanics and delivers an excellent 2-3 hour linear stealth & sniping mini-campaign. It even serves as a nice self-contained prequel story ... that's best experienced after playing through the main campaign.Conclusion / TL;DREnslaved: Odyssey to the West is an excellent ""experience"". Gamers who enjoy interesting stories, strong characters and amazing environments can't go wrong. But those looking for strong action-platforming mechanics first and foremost will be let down.Technical DroningRequires some ini tweaks to render properly, specifically to fix a Shadow rendering bug and unlock the frame rate.120Hz - Yes, with ini tweaksBorderless Window - NoGraphics Options - DecentTexture Quality - PoorGamepad vs Keyboard - Gamepad, the keyboard controls aren't very goodAudio Balance - Poor.

Introduction: I have the unpopular opinion that this game is not worth the investment, but I shall do my best to explain why. Enslaved is beautiful in graphics only. While the setting of the game is glorious, the story itself is lacking. There are several plot holes, which lack any detailed explanation, and to top it off: it’s consistent use of gender roles is insulting to both men and women. Had there been more thought put into the development of this game, I would recommend it in a heartbeat, but in my opinion it lacks tact and was not at all thought through.Story: The story is set in a post-apocalyptic future, although what happened to the Earth was never properly analyzed nor explained. While this fault alone can be disregarded, the fact that the entire story revolves around one young womans crusade against slavers by the means of her enslaved “Monkey” man proves more difficult to ignore. Basically, the female protagonist is a huge hypocrite who cannot take care of herself and requires the aid of a big strong man. As if the two main characters horribly written fate isn’t enough, the third character that they add in only accents the fact that the woman is viewed as a piece of incompetent meat.Gameplay: There’s nothing particularly wrong with the gameplay itself, if you are the brawler type. Nor is there anything that is innovated, or outside the box. It is a pretty generic, run of the mill creation. The only bit that is even remotely interesting is the skills distribution, and even then, it’s pretty standard. Controls: The targeting is extremely awkward, which adds an unintended level of difficulty. Apart from that, the controls are also rather generic, and there’s nothing more to say about them.Graphics: Phenomenal. In all honesty, the aesthetics of this game are pretty much its strongest selling point. It is an absolutely visually stunning game, with scenery that is worth taking in. Props for an awesome immersive setting.Sound: Unremarkable, but no complaints or compliments.Replay Value: Close to none, unless you really, REALLY enjoy looking at aesthetics. There is new content after beating the game that is opened to you. In my opinion, however, it’s really not exceptionally worth a second playthrough. I can name several games (from the same genre) in my library that will get more attention.			"

												I've updated review after I finished this fantastic game. It made a very strong impression on me, mostly with its story. In a way, it's a sci-fi fairy tale in a shape of a platformer game, with characters so well written they come alive, beautiful landscapes and mind-bending level design. It's got only one drawback - it's a console port, and a buggy one, too. But it's playable, and I highly recommend this game.Pigsy Perfect 10 is a very fun stealth gameplay DLC where you play as Pigsy.

												It's an okay game. Not good, not bad. it's more cinematic than a game actually. The platforming is linear, almost to the extend of an on-rail. It isn't a strech to say that I could close my eyes and still get across to the checkpoint by randomly moving the bottons and thumbstick if no enemies robots were involved. There was no context of story until the end chapter. All along you are  guided  literally from point A to point B and only in the end can you start to see the bones of the plot that I wish they would have expanded on. The realtionship between the characters is at first weak but by the end although still not as developed becomes somewhat cute. I would not play it again but the experience wasn't unpleasant. That's the key point, it's average.			"

Played with 360 controller and recommend controller over keyboard.  Battles got a little repetitive, but story telling was pretty interesting.  To put it short, i own a lot of games and only finish the ones that can hold my attention. It is pretty obvious the budget was large on this one.  There are some guides for improving the graphics and i was able to play at 2560x1440 with no slowdowns on an amd 7970.  You have to edit monkeyengine.ini to do this and the guide is on steam.			"

												Enslaved doesn't start with its best foot forward; the first level is one of the least interesting to look at and the action is constantly interrupted by cutscenes and tutorials. I was ready to quit this game long before it really got started, and that's not a good beginning to any title. Fortunately, some perseverance got me through the rough start and the game did become more enjoyable as it picked up, although I still felt it was flawed right to the very end. An odd combination of third-person platforming, brawling and shooter, it doesn't really do any of the three genres any justice. Its story - a sci-fi retelling of the 16th Century Chinese novel - it also has pretensions to being the next ""Sand of Time"", but fails to recapture the magic of either in plot or characters.On the plus side, the levels are graphically gorgeous, with deeply saturated greens and reds that give the world a very vibrant feel. The brawling mechanics are well done, and the parkour-like exploration is wonderfully animated. Unfortunately, the action is too frequently broken up by cutscenes and with switching to new mechanics; had the game focused on one style of game-play - or just let me do one sort of gameplay for more than a minute or two - I would have had more fun. Exploration is also limited by the incredibly linear level design; there is very little opportunity to go off the beaten path or even to mistakenly jump in the wrong direction (it is, in fact, impossible to leap off any ledge anywhere /except/ where you are expected to leap). Judged by each individual encounter, the game is rather fun but when taken as a whole it is less than the whole of all its elements. "

												Enslaved has some great post apocalyptic scenary unlike I have seen in many other games, it's not open world but you can't help but look at everything around you. The story keeps you hooked and the relationship between the people involved is a believable one, it hardly seems scripted at all. You'll do lot of jumping around and alot of fighting, a few basic puzzles here and there. I have yet to finish the game, but so far, I'm glad i bought it. It has exceeded my expectations.buy it, it's worth it's weight. Don't let my hours put you off, i do play off line quite a bit at times.			"

												11 / 10 - This game is a hidden gem. The graphics are well, the story is gripping, the pace is excellent, and the game play is fun and rewarding. Its like Prince of Persia face planted into a world of mechs.To point out a few things that caught my attention was the voice acting, characters and lip syncing/facial expressions were all done very well. I got this game on sale from its original price but honestly feel it is worth almost double the twenty dollars its posted for.Well worth it.			"

												This game is BEAUTIFUL!! I don't mean the graphics (well, graphically it's beatiful as well), but the atmosphere, the design and the story - they are just BEAUTIFUL. The gameplay is like a lighter Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time with a bit too much climbing, but that's ok. The soundeffects, the music and especially the voice acting are awesome. The only problem this game has is the terrbile controls, the dumbass mouse and camera handling. And they are more frustrating in the Pigsy's Perfect 10 (it's a separate little story where you play as Pigsy - you can find it in the Extras menu). The story seems a bit slow, yet it's not boring at all, not even for a sec (at least to me). The dialogs are well-written, they are funny, sad, touching - so there's everything. And the ending... Hard to not spoil it, so I just tell ya it's damn cool, I really like it.I hate that with full of my heart when a game has bad or worse controls/camera, nevertheless the Enslaved is absolutely worth to play.  And one more thing: I don't quite think she did the right thing...			"

												Was honestly hoping for a better game. After seeing this game on so many ""top 10 most underrated games"" and ""top 10 games nobody played"" lists, I had high hopes. While it wasn't bad, it was really just a little better than average. First off, the good. The story is semi-interesting and the character development and bond between the two characters is fun to watch. The voice and acting is good. The graphics are solid, except for some problems with shadows and shading (had nothing to do with my top of the line comp). The combat could have been much better. You use a light and heavy attack. But unlike god of war or most 3rd person action games, there are no combos. You literally just hit with all light, all heavy, or mix them, but any mixture of the two always comes out the same. You can use a stun attack and a wide attack to move everyone back. You also get a special attack from hitting people, although there is no meter or way to know how it is progressing. You have all that within the first hour. You literally gain nothing else all game. There is an evade attack where you just evade and attack, pretty boring. The game includes a counter ability, but it is the single worst in any game ever. It doesn't even work. You have to be blocking and then press a button at the right time, but the button takes you out of block and gets you hurt. I tried it like 10 times and it never once worked. The upgrade system is boring too. You get increased health, shields, better shooting damage, and thats about it. There is nothing interesting. There are collectible masks but they basically don't do anything besides show a random picture. The other biggest problem is the enemies. The entire game you fight like 4 different (but basically same looking) robots. They have no personality, don't talk, and have no incentive or agenda. There is no entity you are fighting against. So the fighting is uninteresting because the enemies never change and you don't care about them. Fighting endless silent robots the entire game just takes away the fun. The game also doesn't describe the world at all. There are 3 total people the entire game, and it is never explained why. Why were there all these robots with no masters, who controls them, where are people, what has happened......none of it explained. There have been positive things said about the post-apocolyptic setting, and its ok. It doesn't feel real or lived in like the last of us. It is a bunch of same looking worn down buildings with green moss on them, thats about it. You are among buildings, in a scrapyard, in a ramshackle town, and in a facility. That's basically it. I didn't find any of them that impressive. The camera zooms in too closely in combat and it is hard to see when people are about to attack you, which is annoying. Another caveat is Trip. Instead of making her like Elle from the last of us, they make here way too feminine and damsel in distress. She needs help all the time, even making you carry her up this tiny ledge she can easily climb. She spends most of the time crying and yelling when enemies attack, even if it is you fighting them and she is nowhere near them, she'll just scream and wail because you are fighting. It gets super annoying and she's so helpless and whiny I felt like she was dakota fanning from War of the Worlds. The platforming is kind of fun, but it is super linear. You jump from one shiny rung or foothold to another. You never have to aim or do anything besides just continually hammer jump, its not like ""drakes uncharted"" where you feel accomplished or like it actually took skill. Sometimes the platforming doesn't work. You will be by the edge and just roll forward against an invisible wall, because you weren't at the perfect spot to trigger the jump sequence, which makes it feel even more linear and hands-off. The game does provide good length though. The DLC is fun and a change of pace, although pigsy is made to be way too slow getting over things, activating abilities, and getting in and out of cover. It does introduce you to the best character of the game, Truffles, who is baller. The ending was sad and the most heartbroken I have been in a game in a while. As for enslaved as a whole, if the upgrade system wasn't boring as hell, the combat had variation or something more than using the same weapon with the same 2 attacks for 8 hours, and weren't fighting the same boring 4 machines with no personality, I would recommend it higher. Right now, 7/10.			"

												Great single player experience, very well written, very good voice acting, well worth a playthrough for anyone who enjoys a good action packed story based game. Did poor on sales on consoles in 2010 and was brought to PC in 2013 and it definitely is a hidden gem. Combat and upgrades are simplified but fun and easy to get used to, sharp and colorful graphics but don't expect anything crazy as it's just another console port with some glitches here and there, definitely read the tweak guide available in the steam discussion forum of the game. If you see this for $5 GET IT!! you will enjoy the playthrough.			"

												This game is pretty good. It's not the greatest thing I've ever played, but if i didn't own it anymore and needed to buy it again, i would. It doesnt bring anything new to the table, theres nothing i havent seen or done before in this game but its still fun and feels familiar. It's EXTREMELY good for the price i got it for during the Summer Sale, and would still not be a disappointing purchase if i were to pay full price.The thing that stands out the most to me in the game is the level design, it's absolutely beautiful. The city of New York in a post-apocalyptic state overgrown with trees, vines and bushes. The texturing could REALLY use some work though. It all looks great from afar but once up close things arent quite as good looking, although that takes nothing from the game IMO. Gameplay > graphics no matter how you look at it. Theres a LOT of environmental puzzles in a Prince of Persia type of way. Lots of climbing and jumping around on destroyed buildings and other things in the environment. That' one of my favorite aspects of the game, I've always loved that sort of thing. Prince of Persia is one of my favorite game series ever.The storyline in the game is GREAT. I'm really enjoying it. I'm not going to talk about the story though, as i don't want to be the guy dropping spoilers in the reviews, that's always gotten on my nerves when people do that. The writers for this deserve a lot of credit for making this game what it is, because if the story wasnt enjoyable i think i would have already moved on to another game. There is a lot of games with the same style of game mechanics as this one, so a solid story is important in this genre to me.The combat is pretty fulfilling, you have a decent variety of moves and such although it could use a little more. It reminds me a lot of God of Wars combat the way you fight in this game. The combat IS repetitive, though it hasn't felt like it was so far. You have this laser staff type thing, you can use it for melee combat and also to shoot energy projectiles at enemies. So far I've come across two different ammo types, a normal energy charge and then a stun charge but there may be more throughout the game I'm not sure. There is quick time events, but they're not very often and they're usually just a single button to press to finish off an enemy. Speaking of enemies, that's one thing this game could've use, more variety of enemies. You fight the same mechs over and over and over.You collect red orbs which are used to upgrade your health, your shield, your combat abilities and your staff. To me that's always been kind of a generic way to fill in the spaces to give a game more content and another purpose of playing, but the game does not rely too heavily on this so it does not bother me. They are found just layting around in random places and they are dropped by enemies after you defeat them.You have a female character with you at all times that is an integral part of the story, and you have to make use of her abilities to get through some parts of the game. You put her on your back an dcarry her through mine fields, she can create a decoy that attracts gunfire so you can get to places that have turrets watching, you can toss her up to palces you cannot reach for her to help you get where you need to go. Theres also other things you can do with her, but i'll leave that for you to discover.Theres whole seperate campaigns in the bonus content section, i thought that was pretty cool. You can assume the role of other characters in the game and play through their stories. A nice addition to an already satisfying game. Would be great if other games did this also.If i had to describe this game through comparisons to other games, i would say this is the lovechild of God of War, Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed. The game is good enough to be placed next to any of those 3 and stand strong in competition with them, even though this is nowhere near as well known or liked.I havent completely finished the game yet, but i feel I've played enough to give an honest, fair review and right now on a scale of 1 through 10 i would give this game 8.5/10If you are a fan of any of three series mentioned above, you shouldnt hesitate to give this one a try.

												Enslaved is one of my favorite games ever. I had no idea going in to the game that I would enjoy it so thoroughly. I played and beat it originally on the Xbox 360. I never got to play the expansions. Glad to see they're in the PC version. It is a very beautiful game, especially for the time,and even now. It pull's you into the world nicely. I fell for the characters and felt attached to them by the end. Trip (the female lead), is still IMO one of the prettiest game characters ive seen or played. At any rate, great writing for the characters. Loved the relationship between Monkey and Trip, even if it isn't  groundbreaking or super complex.  Good and interesting overall story. The levels are enjoyable through and through. I don't think I remember a level that I did not enjoy, or got bored/frustrated with. Great controls as well. I have been begging Ninja Theory for a sequel on Twitter for a loooong while now. Hehe. They are always nice and reply or comment back to me. Good people there. I do think there may be a sequel in the works, but am not certain. On my own Slug rating system I made up just now, id give it a 9.5 out of 10. Wonderful game, but there is of course always room for improvement.			"

												Everything about this ""game"" is horrible, and when compared to other games in this genre that becomes self evident. There are numerous bugs in the PC version unless you set the graphical settings to maximum, including one where you can't actually leave a boss battle because the game uses high graphics settings for object destruction; and on low settings the wall doesn't break.The ""Gameplay"" is highly repetitive. You are either climbing pre-set handholds with no active engagement from you needed (there's no risk of falling or any skill required), or continuously waiting to be able to actually enjoy fighting. The reason I say this is, the entirety of the game is set up to not only prevent you from being able to enjoy any combat, but to ensure the non-combat segments of the game are as long as humanly possible. You will get to ""enjoy"" mindless climbing, mines, hideously unfair enemy advantages requiring you ""strategize"" in the form of ""hurry up and wait"" while they variously stop firing and lose interest so you can run to the next stupidly miniscule amount of cover.The most infuriating thing about this game is perhaps how highly it's been rated. I can only conclude the people who enjoy this game so much have no idea what ""fun"" is, and when given something vaguely in the appearance of fun will gladly sit at traffic lights turning red all day thinking the ""gameplay"" is to keep track of how many times the light turns green.

												Enslaved's ""green post-civilization"" look is very beautiful and sets it apart. Sure, if you stop and expect some corners of the game, you'll notice a lack of tesselation, textures being on a flat tile, objects not having as many points as they should, but generally, you'll be too busy climbing or fighting to take the microscope to everything. First off, this is no open world game. Like in many climbing games, there is a high degree of linearity, but you don't feel it as much as in Remember Me or, oh shudder, I am Alive. The climbing is fun, the fighting is, for the most part, also fun, and easy mode is actually easy. The world is beautiful (and colorful), the controls are fluid and sufficiently exact (though I'm not sure I appreciate ""press A+X"" type controls, but you only need those if you buy certain fighting skills), and the voice acting is good. The plot is OK -- or rather, you're too busy playing the game to pay too much attention; in fact, the plot and the backstory are a bit meh and confused, and adding quasi-flashbacks in a completely different visual style was a bad decision that breaks immersion when it happens. Your character isn't the most fleshed out ever, but quite serviceable. (Unfortunately, you only get to play Monkey, the man, not Trip, his companion. There is no multi-player either, so Trip is always AI controlled. At least, she has useful skills and isn't the kind of AI that steps in your line of fire, but where she isn't dangerous due to a lack of artificial intelligence, she is as a function of the story -- she is written to get you in trouble, and while her motives are somewhat understandable, she isn't exactly likeable.)In sum, the game feels very arcady -- big sprites, broad strokes, good fun.I bought this at (PC) release, and am not sore for the money.Don't buy if you require open worlds / sandboxes to be happy.

												Enslaved is an action-plateformer with some combat where you play as Monkey, a really agile and really strong guy ""enslaved"" by Trip, a really intelligent girl who needs him to get back to her tribe. It's set in a post-post-apocalyptic world, apparently centuries after a war against machines. Cities have been deserted and plants have grown everywhere, but in the ruins of civilizations, ancient mechs still lurk and do what they have been programmed for : kill all humans.Halfway through the game, after a not-so-surpising plot twist, a third character is added to the duo, Pigsy, a fat, smelly guy kinda obsessed with pigs. He will help Monkey and Trip finding and destroying the Pyramid, a place where all humans captured by mechs are enslaved... or are they ?It's a fun and rather short little game ( maybe don't buy it full price ) combining a lot of easy climbing ( you generally can't die and there is only one path ) and some dynamic fighting, with a bit of shooting and puzzle solving. Monkey has some kind of daibo he uses to kick mech's @sses with, with a light attack, a strong attack, a wide attack and a charged electrical attack. You can also unlock a ""fury"" attack available after the daibo is fully charged by hitting enemies with normal attacks, and you can protect yourself with a shield, well, two shields in fact : one protects you from bullets, the other one you can activate it when attacked in melee.The daibo can also shoot plasma and stun rays, used to deactivate enemies shields and kill them from a distance.In addition, there is one under-used mechanic that only serves a few times in the game : the hoverboard. Called the Cloud ( like the Magical Cloud in Dragon Ball ), it's a really fast disc that Monkey can use at very specific locations to get accross water for example, or fight fast bosses.And then there is Trip. You can't control her directly, but you can give her orders, she can generate a decoy to attract enemy fire, heal you, and she'll mostly be used to open locked doors, hack stuff and put ladders down. She has an EMP to defend herself in case she gets attacked in melee, and overall she's not really a burden ( unlike most games where you have to escort an NPC, I'm looking at you, Ashely from RE4 ), except when she glitches through the floor and you have to restart the whole chapter/zone.PROS :- nice story loosely inspired by the 16th century Chinese novel ""Journey to the West"" ( Dragon Ball was inspired by that too, you might find some similarities ).- nice characters, voice over and facial animations during cutscenes. Monkey is voiced by Andy Serkis, mostly known for Gollum in LOTR.- easy and effective climbing mechanics, it's quick, responsive, and you can't fall to your death- upgradable hero and gear- nice graphics for a 2010 game- light humor after Pigsy joins the group- unlockable costumes for Monkey and Trip when you finish the game- unlockable mini adventure where you play as Pigsy, with its own gameplay mechanics.- nice cutscenesCONS :- the camera sucks most of the time, but especially during combats- some bugs and glitches, Trip disappearing into the environment, scene becoming black when you alt-tab, game crashing when you alt-tab- no real save system. There is a checkpoint system when you die, but if you quit the game or if it crashes/glitches, there is a big chance you'll have to start the whole chapter over- characters are a bit cliché : you have the strong hero, the naive cute girl and the funny sidekick. I'd like to have seen some more ""extreme"" personalities to get more tension between the characters. especially between Trip and Monkey.- not a big variety of enemies : normal mechs, gun mechs, shielded mechs, stun mechs, some stronger versions of mechs and variants and combinations of the above.

SO FAR, that isCan't stop playing this game. I am still shocked that such a polished and fun game was part of such a cheap deal. If you haven't gotten it. Dont't miss out. Graphics and gameplay are amazing. Was not expecting anything like this. 10/10p.s if you run into bugs. turn your graphics from low to high temporarily. That should fix them. It seems like the game turns off some physics by mistake when you are on low graphics. However, this game has really good optimization.. I was playing on low graphics. Turned garphics to high to skip bugs. But it turned out the game still ran smoothly.			"

												Saving - Do not turn off your console.Mark of a good port, 11/10.EDIT: Well might as well turn this into a bit more of an in-depth look at the port. It's... barebones. They added a few bits like the option to turn off motion-blur but apart from that it's the classic ""Low, Medium or High"".The default ""high"" settings are no AA, x4 AF and pretty much just... awful awful textures. You'll want to tweak them in the .ini's or you'll find a looooot of console-textures. There's a fantastic guide right here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/245280/discussions/0/792924952664793625/I've not tried KB/M but I'm sure it's awful as most hack 'n' slashes are with KB/M, I reccomend a controller. As for Optimization... Well... Let's face it, the game was designed to run on a potato so you're going to have no problem with almost any build. A 7970 can run this on High (with graphics options tweaked to the max) at 4K 60fps without breaking a sweat.			"

												Great game if you want good graphics, a good story, good voice acting and fun. If you want something that's going to be a great challenge you might want to play something else. It shares the action of a game like God of War with the level exploration of a game like Uncharted. It's a shame this game didn't get more attention than it did but I can kind of see why, it doesn't really feel like a AAA game but it definitely doesn't feel like an Indie game either, it probably would have done much better if it was initially released as a $20 title instead of a full priced game.After finishing the game and the DLC and getting all the achievements I still enjoy this game, usually I'd be sick of a game by now. The DLC wasn't very good and there were camera problems throughout the game but I really enjoyed the game overall. The ending was interesting but I'm not sure how I felt about it, you'll have to play it to find out what I mean.			"

												Very pretty, very shallow. It's a less involved spectacle fighter than other spectacle fighters.If you're in it for the gameplay, you've got your basic heavy/light staff strikes which are barely different, a low-ammo gun, a finisher move, and not much else to offer besides that. You've also got a 'hold to climb' button used in long climbing sections that test your skill at holding the direction you want to go and pad the game for time.If you're in it for the story of the monkey king, don't bother. This version isn't very interesting. It could've been, and I kept waiting for it to be, but it wasn't. That's the whole feeling I got during this game: it's juuuust about to get good. It's a slow-motion bottle rocket that never goes higher than a two-story home.There's a reason it's overlooked.			"

****This is a 2010 game being reviewed in 2015.****Pros+ Late game humor+ Beautiful colors+ Nice Art style+ Good Voice acting+ I like that Trip isn't just boobs/eye candy. She's intelligent and can be very helpful at times.++++ Pigsy is best character hands down ++++-/+ Story (I personally didn't really enjoy it.)Cons- Short game. I beat it in 9 hours taking my time.- The camera sucks (in and out of battle)- Can't skip cutscenes- Very linear (Even the platforming is linear, everything is predetermined.)- Lots of graphical glitches- Combat is glitchy (I played on mouse and Keyboard)- No enemy variation. You fight like 3 different common mechs and 3-4 different boss mechs.- The main character (Monkey) only disagrees with Trip once then just accepts everything she wants to do.- Battle is too easy. I never once had to get Trip to heal me, more then enough health laying around.This honestly sums up the way I feel about this game. (Escapist Review)			"

												Well... its okI really want to say this game is great but I just cant...First off this game is one of the worst pc ports I have ever played. Three presets for graphics options and terrible visuals. Metal gear solid 4 looks like a next gen game compared to this and that is on the ps3. The story... oh god... the story is just a mess. You play as this charecter named Monkey who is enslaved by this young girl named trip by a slave headband. Despite this Monkey and Trip become friends very quickly and even when they do Trip does not take the headband off. There are other things that happen in the story that lack explenation but I would be spoiling the game if I talked about it. I will just end my explanation for the distaste I have for the story by saying that the ending is very lack luster and you will have questions and you will be dissapointed.But how is the gameplay? Well its really fun but unfortunatley this is very flawed as well. There are these large enemies that have unblockable attacks that they will sometimes use over and over and over again. I would find myself doing really well when all of a sudden I would be facing two or three of these things and lose a huge portion of health due to the difficulty of dodging their attacks. It feels nice to slam Monkey's staff into the enemies but its just so simplistic with very few options and strange camera placement. All in all it is just repetitive I honestly think that Star Wars The Force Unleashed's combat is more compelling at least I can somewhat change my strategy depending on what I decide to upgrade. The shooting is extremely simple to its not even worth going into detail about.Please get this game on sale for 5 bucks like I did. I honestly would not pay more for it.P.S: I have seen the AI running into things and I had a lot of problems with getting Trip to do something as your commends most of the time do not register. There are also some sexual things in this game that are just silly and none of it goes anywhere.			"

												I can't really recommend Enslaved. The background are gorgeous and very original, the music is nice and the actors are top-notch, but the game itself disapoints. The gameplay is something you've played ten times already (and it was begining to be boring the third time) and there are lots of incredibly frustrating imperfections: camera screw, fights lacking subtelty, checkpoints not always well placed and the mouse becomes very unsensitive when you go in shooting mode.Also, for those who care, the characters are pure caricatures of clichés (but you're supposed to care for them). Monkey is the usual sexist depiction of the male hero: far too muscular to be able to jump (but jumps and climbs like a monkey nonetheless), manly grunts each time he makes the slightest effort (like opening a door), comically stupid (except it's not funny). And Trip is the usual sexist depiction of the female sidekick: overly sexy (with special points for the torn tight pants), always in need of help, cries a lot, calls for help a lot, is absolutely useless in everything, runs everywhere when she's been told to stay hidden and is the ""brain"" of the team (meaning she uses hacking to open doors instead of savagely kicking with a grunt).And wait till you meet Pigsy...

												I don't know about whether I will leave a positive or negative recommendation at the end of this review, and since I tend to be quick about writing my reviews that is a bit of a problem. The game feel slike a game I could really get into, if there was more of it. It is long enough to pique my interest, but not long enough to get me heavily invested. The setting, graphics, and delivery are above the par, and the characters are wonderfully animated. Dialogue is well acted, and the even sometimes cheesy lines are delivered in an exceptional way. Combat is a bit shallow and arcadey but does the job well enough for a short game I guess. In fact I think the game could probably be improved by removing some of the combat and replacing it with more world building and character interaction. The vehicle sections with the Cloud are fun but few and far between. The story ends right when it gets interesting, and it left me with lots of thoughts to chew on, the chief among them being ""did I enjoy the game I just finished?"". Which I guess I did, it certianly was not a bad game and if you happen to get a chance to play the game then I recommend it. But I did not enjoy the game enough to recommend anyone buying it for themselves unless at a rediculously low price.  "

												Remember when CD-ROM games started coming out, and they were full of video and not much game? That's kind of how Enslaved is. There is a great story here, with good acting and writing. The gameplay is sub-par. You can't fall during the platforming segments, and combat doesn't really change from your first fight to the last.Also, as usual, the console port is terrible. Menus don't really work. Tooltips tell you to hit the X button. The camera is wonky.			"

There is no depht on it. The platforming is simplistic too, but satisfying. Still, I'm not feeling like finishing it, the story hasn't really gotten into me. Just my opinion. Still, if you're feeling like it, give this game a try. Just be sure that other Ninja Theory games are better than this one.			"

												Steam can't seem to keep track of time spent in this game properly - it was really difficult to post this review because it insisted that I'd played under 5 minutes.Ok, wow...maybe the story makes up for a HORRIBLE graphics, control and camera system.Maybe the story gets better and you won't notice that you're on rails 5 inches wide and actually have almost 0 control of your character.  I doubt it.If you're prone to motion sickness, you might want to look away from my review because you might get queasy just reading about it here...it is THAT bad.  The camera fights you all the time.  Each time you get close to the edge of the 40 foot wide corridor, it yanks you back and tries to force you back to the center.  1920x1080 is the max resolution which is awesome for those with big monitors.  I know some of the settings can be changed via the .ini files:  motion blur can be disabled, AA can be turned on, VSYNC etc but the studios need to put a bit more effort into the PC port.  This is barely a usable PC port.The game itself is at best a 2D+ platformer with open 3D combat areas, the rails I mentioned earlier are so narrow that you might as well be on a side scroller. There appears to be only 1 real way to do any of the ""puzzles"".  I hesitate to call them that because at each handhold, the next jump location is highlighted so you can't miss it.  As you jump, camera control is taken from you and rotated so many times during the climb/jump sequences that it is beyond annoying.The climbing platform sections require 0 (ZERO) ability and are just an exercise in button mashing.  That huge fall below you is actually not a problem because falling wasn't programmed in, you'll just hang on the side of a burning, exploding ship while you make a sandwich...seriously.But you're a crazy hopping climbing monkey right, that's cool - when chicky gets ahead of you up some stairs, you can just jump and catch up!  NOPE.  You have to run around and WALK UP THE FRAKKING  STAIRS.  You're not allowed to jump unless they say you're allowed to jump.  WTF.  That's the silliest thing I encountered, you can't even jump when you want to on a jumping monkey character.You'll also be doing plenty of jumping with chicky riding on your back.  Yes, it's teenage wish fulfillment hour:  the helpless girl climbs onboard while you save her.  The sheer number of rearend screenshots I just encountered while looking at other reviews is just sad.  (It appears that Steam reviews are G/PG because you can't type the synonym for donkey)Maybe I'll finish the other couple hundred games in my library and come back to this one but I doubt it.I cannot believe that this has so many positive reviews.

												This isn't an awful game, but it has annoyances which make me give it a thumbs down. What bothered me the most is how Monkey and Trip interract. As if being named ""Monkey"" wasn't enough, she keeps repeats ""orders"" like ""Monkey, you need to do this"", ""Monkey, get that"", ""Monkey, are you coming"" throughout the game. Sounds condescending to me. She could at least say: ""Monkey, please dance."" :)The second annoying thing is the repetitiveness: the lines said by Trip, the combat (because of a limited variety of enemies), the cutscenes where he lifts a heavy object so she could pass underneath it then drop it as soon as she passes. Repetitive and boring. And finally, there's the lack of choice. The game guides you from start to finish, it tells you where to jump, where to climb, what to do... On the positive side, the story was interesting enough to keep me going until the end.			"

Sure it's fun to beat up some mechs (the enemies of the game) in this apocalypse world but I dont think enough time was brought to the game.It feels very rushed, and you dont really get to the bottom of the world that you have to fight yourself through. You meet close to no other people and these people inspiring and adventurous as they are just did not cut it for me.. Character development, gameplay & story feels so rushed that I never got to truly enjoy the game. The game has potential to be great but just did not do it for me.			"

The game is based off a classic Chinese novel called Journey to the West the main character Monkey is brought to life by Andy Serkis the guy who did golem in lord of the rings and he does an amazing job of making this bruttish ape man awe inspiring and sympathetic.

												Enslaved is a game about looking your big breasted, yet petite, girlfriend in the face and satisfying her needs, every time she nags or cries. It's an adventure game that's quite linear and mundane. The whole game literally revolves around your girlfriend crying. The graphics are quite muddy in some areas and there's no anti-aliasing options, so video card driver options can help. Overall, this games color palette and mundane mood made me feel sick in the stomach during several portions of the story. So be sure to have gotten all your hypeness and energy out before playing as this game is a calm and silent experience. Whoever made this game is quite Emo, as there's no real storyline and it revolves around looking at your girlfriends face and breasts every time something goes wrong. You can safely skip this game, but if you want to play it.. be sure to get it on sale.			"

												Another game that is almost great, but fails due to this fad of making games with terrible camera issues.  As the camera flies around unexpectedly, your direction of travel changes mid movement, which can result in going back where you just came from at which point the camera flips again and you're caught in a wirlwind until you stop moving, go sideways, and move in a way that gets you into the next camera location.  Yes it's that terrible, I have no idea how people tolerate this junk.  This will make a normal person ill, and greatly disrupts gameplay.  If you can get past that, the only issue thus far seems to be that combat moves simply fail half the time for no reason.  You're pretty much limited to your basic attack, because the special attacks don't go off half the time, and when they fail you pretty much fail to do anything and just stand there to get hit.If you get past those issues, the game is actually really great.  While it's true what some say about it being linear, the storytelling is really good, the gameplay (finding your way around) is satisfying, looks and sounds good, and when combat works it works really well.  If it didn't have the terrible camera design issue I'd recommend it.  As is it is not only irritating but nauseating.			"

When I started playing and the camera started going all over the place, I quit, plugged in my controller, and resumed. It does have an option to turn down the mouse sensitivity, but I didn't try it. It's much better with a controller, so I stuck with that. Since it is, it makes me feel this game was really meant for console.The Good:-The graphics are great, and I was playing on all low. I liked the idea of the plot of being a captive slave and escaping. The main character guy cracks me up because he reminds me of a monkey and a big cat cross-breed.-The combat is action-packed, something I normally don't like, but it was so similar to fighting games that I felt right at home. The main character feels a lot like playing Kilik or Seung-Mina from Soul Caliber IV, so if you're good at playing them, the main character will feel very familiar.  He uses a staff weapon just like them, but is more agile and faster than Seung-Mina.-The characters look amazing and cool.-I really liked the main character guy's personality. He seems like a very likable guy, and is caring despite his rough look.The Bad:-Like other reviews, the linear gameplay is very noticeable. -The hand-holding and inability to fail while maneuvering makes it feel like a game for beginners despite the edgy and shiny look (and being on normal difficulty). -The game's save system is based on checkpoints and autosaves without the ability to save at your leisure - and it's game-breaking. As I saw the girl run while escaping, I tried going after her to have my game clunk around and skip-ahead like a skipping DVD when the little autosave icon showed up. I thought it was because it was loading the background and effects since the game is quite detailed, but I was wrong. It does this at every autosave checkpoint, and I have to sudenly stop what I'm doing and wait for it to pass like nausea.-Even with switching to a controller, the camera does as it pleases. You can move around the camera yourself to get a better view, but it still doesn't seem possible to get the angle right without running away from where you want to go, then make a circle, and come back. And it's still facing the wrong direction from where you're trying to go.-The lady companion is annoying. She's always scared,  didn't help the main character when she was able and he had a chance of dying, and then she put a helmet on my guy character that causes his pain so she could control him . Yeah, screw her. :P			"

												DO NOT BUY. The glitches kill this game. Every boss fight results in a glitch or the game hanging so you have to restart from a check point. I have to repeat from the last check point several times before I can finish the fight. Oh and the controls are horrible.			"

												Nat a bad PC port, but then again not a very good one either. It looks pretty and the controls are ok. Although it can be a bit clunky at times. Gameplay would be smooth if it wasn't for the haunting of the console that seems ever still present in Enslaved. There are times when it just seems like you've graduated without learning anything, or rather take on a big ""boss"" without any thoughts or hints on how to gain the advantage. The game will occasionally mention how to use the controls but it wont hold your hand. It's left me to guess work at times (lots of trial & error, mind you). Pretty much just another day in the life of PC ports.			"

												The game seems fun but the bad controls kill it for me. Not only does the game forget what keys I re-mapped to most of the time I restart game, but even after getting into game and remapping them then loading a game it forgets what I mapped them to(only certain key some actually do save lol but not block, distract, crouch etc). Unfortunately you can only map key from the main menu not while game is loaded, so thus vicious cycle. I only got the controls to save properly 3 times (then reset next load). I can not stand the default key setup so game became too annoying for me to play. The game itself is also annoying even when controls do remap properly, it seems to only let you use certain keys when it feels like you should be using them. so I try to block and it thinks I shouldn't be blocking and thus i don't block and enemies pound on me. I guess that could be it selectively forgetting while playing game that I remapped keys...			"

												While the graphics were nice at times, and it was kind of fun to play.  There were two key issues.  1) The camera kept switching from a trailing 3rd person perspective like most FPS's, to odd angles at other times, which often made it difficult to control where the character was going, when you are trying to move forward, but suddenly the camera angle snaps 130 degrees, and you are going left.2) You are typically locked to a single path you can take, But the level appears to have many paths.  Sections of the terrain that your character *should* be able to use, are not usable.  This also makes it confusing when it should be an easy path to your goal, but you can't get there because you can't use your normal abilities here.  The same egde of buildings you use all the time, just doesn't work here.Honestly, had a Played a demo of it first, I would not have bought it.			"

												Don't get me wrong. The storyline is exciting, the graphics are beautiful, the voice acting (particularly that by Andy Serkis, but yes, in general) is fantastic. It's also exciting to know that I'm playing as a character who was mocapped by Andy Serkis. However.This is the one of the worst, and laziest, PC ports imaginable. There are game-breaking bugs throughout the game, the kind that require a walkthrough to find a workaround; and I'm not even to the end of it yet. If you can get it for console instead of PC, I strongly recommend that. However, I would not spend more than five dollars on the PC port. Video handling is atrocious, graphics are much too tightly bound to the same system as controls, and throughout the game, you will face no greater enemy than the freakin' camera angle. It felt worse than DIstrict 9. There were cases where Monkey (that's your hero) would attack at angles that had nothing to do with anything, exposing you to getting torn to shreds by a bunch of otherwise-trivial robots. There were cases in which the camera angle rotated literally 180 degrees, and it took me thirty seconds to figure out how to cross an otherwise insignificant bridge because he kept turning around halfway. There are controller instructions that make zero sense for a mouse and keyboard (I'm still trying to figure out where ""X"" and ""B"" are.) Perhaps most obnoxiously, whoever did game-camera direction seemed to think they were making a major motion picture instead of a game, because a lot of the angles serve literally no purpose other than trying to make you look cool. (While dying, evidently.)And let's not forget the on-again-off-again problems with the scripted AI. There are many occasions in which a plot-essential event won't occur because a character has stopped in the middle of the floor, instead of completing their scripted action. The game's save mechanism is pretty much identical to Price of Persia's, except I'm not aware of any cue that appears when I get to a checkpoint. (If you've played ""Ghostbusters"" by Terminal Reality, think of that system.) So, when one of these disasters occurs, which might relate to something as tangential as your screen resolution, you have to reset to the last checkpoint and do everything again. Additionally, it's worth noting that the cut scenes cannot be skipped with the keyboard, to my knowledge.Serkis deserves better than this.It takes a lot to make me recommend a console over PC, but in this case, it is your better bet. I recommend at least having a controller around, and I do not recommend picking it up for the list price of $20.00; this product is unfinished. Wait to get it on sale, or grab the older version for Playstation. I have little faith that the releaser is making any further updates to the port.			"

												8/10 *Warning* I'm not Native English Speaker.Pros: - Very detailed graphics both characters and environment, especially mechs! mechs look really cool. (10/10)- Great animations (10/10) (especially face movement!)- Great cutscenes, especially Pigsy Perfect 10 (DLC) (10/10)- Great voiceacting (9/10)- Combat system are simple but pretty fun in late game and when fight against Boss (8/10)- Great Soundtrack (10/10)- Enivronment are really beautiful.Cons:- Camera can be annoying.. Imaging you're running and trying to move camera but camera keep pulling back, and what make it worse is you can't HOLD camera. My fix is let them be just think of it as you're playing Resident Evil 1, but sometime I want to look at beautiful environments. :(- Trip (Girl) are so annoying... She look nice and when I start to like her she will do something stupid again. And then when you walk too far away from her she'll kill you... And it feel like she 'Order' you to do things more than 'Ask' you nicely. But I like her anyway :D (*SPOILER*) I like when she broke someone heart. :) (*SPOILER*) - I hate that you have to collect orbs around the map, if they make it drop from enemys only that would be nice. - I feel like a walking&climbing phase are too long in the beginning. I almost stop the game around chapter 3. Climbing, Running, Killing mobs, have only Trip to talk to, Bored. But it got a LOT better when you get back to Trip's village and (*SPOILER*) got another character to join your team. He's funny (*SPOILER*) and enemys get harder, More Boss, Less bull...t,  If only the game are like this at the beginning I would give to 9.5/10 - YOU CAN'T USE DLC COSTUME unless you End a game at least one time. (There's a fix for this in internet) Such a♥♥♥♥♥♥move from dev.16 hrs for End the game both Normal & DLC. It's still a good experience for me. :)			"

												What peaked my interest back when it was released on consoles now finally made it to the PC and I have to say that even after all that time it does not dissapoint. No obvious flaws that you wouldn´t find in any other game of this genre so you can lean back and enjoy some pretty decent gameplay, story and characters. As with many other games here though I wish the game could have concluded a bit more cleanly.			"

												I really liked this game, and no this isn't in jest. If you go in with low expectations you will be pleasntly surprised. I like the whole relationship between trip and monkey. As for the story, it's, well. it's really out there, and the ending makes you go ""wtf did i just watch?"" it was interesting enough to make it to completion when I originally played it on the x360, now with♥♥♥♥♥remasted for pc and we get to play at 1080p +, it really does shine. Except the hair, the hair is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hair tech in modern games is pure♥♥♥♥♥♥anyway. Unless you count Alice, in which case her hair was beautiful. Wait for a steam sale again, pick this up when it's sub $4 if you are a cheap♥♥♥♥♥ if not, pick it up right now if you are craving a "" different"" type of game.			"

												Based on what I had heard, I went into this game expecting to play an action-adventure movie. I was not disappointed.The combat, though enjoyable, can get repetitive; the platforming is on autopilot (you literally cannot jump to your death); and the levels are very linear, with some small side paths to find extra collectibles. The focus is on the story, and it’s a good one. Voice acting is top-notch throughout, and in cutscenes you can clearly see the emotion in the characters’ faces.When I wrote about Tomb Raider, I complained about how much of it felt like I was just watching a movie, but that was in part because my expectations were totally off. With Enslaved, I had a better idea of what to expect, and its story and overall execution were far superior. I really don’t want to talk details about the story, so I’ll just say it’s about two strangers brought together in a post-apocalyptic setting, trying to get home.If you like story-driven and emotive games, and you don’t mind brawler combat against robots, you should play Enslaved. If you can’t stand pressing buttons to smash robots to pieces, you should at least watch a playthrough.			"

												Great graphics for what it was at the time. The gameplay mechanics wasn't great for a keyboard/mouse use as many as mentioned. The ending ended abruptedly and kind of makes the game incomplete. Everything between the start up until  the end was a great journey however. Some bugs here and there that requires restart of the game to get pass.The female character gets pretty annoying about half way through the game with the way she bosses you around.Game can get somewhat repetitve halfwayas well.The new skills you purchase along the way isn't very well explained on how they are used.I would rate it 6.5/10 overall. I wouldn't recommend it mainly because of the ending.			"

SUMMARYI don't recommend this game because it’s not fully optimized for PC.  A gamepad/controller is the way to go. Some rigs (even ones that are competent) may have trouble with stuttering and/or freezing cutscenes. This issue is only temporarily fixed by restarting game client or your computer. **I looked up the cutscene issue and it seems only a handful of people encounter this problem, although I still think it’s an issue worth pointing out.Otherwise, if you’re specifically looking for a lighthearted adventure title that emphasizes on the narrative, good character development and gameplay doesn’t have to be great to keep your interest then I would recommend Enslaved.DETAILSThe game itself, on the other hand, is a ""so close yet so far"" sort of deal. I can see some true potential in this game, but for the most part, it’s an average experience. Overall, the presentation is great, but the gameplay is “meh”.Pros:  The graphics and aesthetics are beautiful and are conceptually strong in design.  Some beautiful and catchy tunes in this soundtrack to set the mood. Characters have a cartoon-like charm (i.e. light-hearted tone, humor and concept design choices). Close attention to behavior and great voice-acting. For example, the subtle gestures make the characters feel more believable.  There is attachment and interest invested in the characters, their interactions and development. The interdependence mechanic between Monkey and Trip is a great concept and well reflects the story. Cons:  Gameplay isn't particularly challenging in any way (including combat). You won’t find yourself dying unless you do something derpy… like surfing into a mine (oops). You will always know specifically what to do and where to go because the game always tells you (via character Trip and highlighted/straightforward climbing objects). The camera view may get somewhat annoying, as it may move around to highlight cool moves/angles rather than allowing you to view your surroundings.Neutrals, both, or depends on preference:  The mystery of the story keeps you engaged, although the ending is... questionable—I’m still not sure what to make of it. The gameplay consists of hack ‘n slash and platformer elements. Neither of these aspects is done considerably well or bad, but it does get repetitive. Unlocking abilities and performance upgrades are what kept my interest in order to try out new things. I think it's worth mentioning that it's a completely linear title.  "

Andy Serkis as the lead (male) character...The characters are brilliant - their realisation and their chemistry works really well. It helps too that this is a variation on the whole ""Monkey"" thing. It's also BEAUTIFUL - it just looks Gorgeous, which really helps as well in terms of getting you into the game.Gameplay: smooth and lovely and nicely varied and intuitive. My only real issue was occasionally with the camera, but to be honest that's small potatoes.I got this game on sale but actually I would do full price for it, in hindsight.

												The game is colorfull and pretty to look at. But the gameplay is really repetetive, and goes like this: You enter an area, and the character that follows you around (called ""Trip"") makes a scan of the area, to show you where the exit is, where your enemys are and so on. Clear the area, and move on to the next one. That probably wouldn't have minded me all that much, if Trip was a more likeable character. But she is whiny, and demanding - and I instantly didn't care about her. The thing is though, that the game is all about protecting her, and get her to the destinations she want's to go.It's a mediocre game, and not good enough for me to recommend.			"

												It's not that great. The gameplay is all the same, and none of it is complex or interesting.The ""puzzles,"" really aren't puzzles, their more like poorly made levels that you have to get around.The story is pretty good, and the characters' faces move in a realistic way.			"

												This game is absolutely worthless, it might be good but what is the point of buying a game that has so many bugs, its a ♥♥♥♥in disgrace and thievery. As for me im stuck at chapter 2 Drawbridge area because the stupid monkey appearntly forgets how to jump to the last hang out spot before touching ground. So i don´t recommend this to anyone, dont buy it just leave it be. forget it			"

												I loved the level and character design but overall this game is boring. The story isn't compelling, there isn't a real threat of danger, and there are too many gameplay glitches that completely halt your experience. Running through, what I think is pretty safe to assume, old New York I jumped down a ledge with the girl on my back only to freeze in mid air. Sorry, but I probably will never finish this game.			"

												I gave this game a really good swing and found it a lackluster flyball in comparison to the all too positive reviews posted for it.  Nitpickingly - it's a console port to PC and there is noticable clunkiness due to that which I'll get into later (outside of displaying prompts as B or Y when the pc hotkeys would be E or F respectly).The storyline is extremely linear and little can be said about the basis which is heavily inspired by another work (The Monkey King and Journey to the east), the character voice acting and animations (especially facial cues) were pretty spot on but overall each one left me very little to grow attached to.  I could see the obvious portryal of tropes but I found the main character too much of a masked Marty Stu which went against the backdrop of the ""badass"" character.  The Extras side option from the main menu called Pigsy's perfect 10 actually found more personality in the main character albeit a bit disgusting but at least humorous one than from the main protagonist.The female protaganist Trip went to almost Navi levels of annoying at times with her nagging but overall not too bad of a partner to have through the long escort mission that is this game due to having some abilities.... but that's where gameplay comes in.There were so many missed opportunities to do something actually interesting with this partnership dynamic that is the center of this story that the few interactions you do get to do (sticking a syringe in my neck to heal me or using holographic decoy) were far outshadowed by the problematic issues of having the funsucking job of babysitting.  Some of the clunkiness comes out in sections where you have to ""throw"" your partner to a platform only to have her scrambling from the ledge due to an inadequate throw - and you having to jump across on a timer in order to haul her up and save her (consequently saving you).  The problem from that example comes when the character refuses to jump in the direction of the platform which is OBVIOUS because you are playing on a keyboard without an analog stick thus having to replay sections just to do the same nonsensical event over again.  This happened throughout the playthrough at least 3x at different sections, which is why it stuck with me at all and also showed itself on time wasting ""platforming"" where you basically push a direction and spam the spacebar.  The last 2(?) levels out of the 14 actually started adding in ""timing"" for these jumps but for the majority of this game it is a complete waste of time and adds no challenge, content or fun to the game outside of padding hours played.  One of my biggest peeves ""WHY CAN YOU NOT SKIP CUTSCENES OF CINEMATICS IN THIS GAME?"" It's not like this was impossible to do technically in the game since you ""can"" skip the epilogue by clicking by mistake and bringing yo uto the then ""unskippable"" credit reel.  Nothing is more annoying than continuing your progress in this game the next day to be subject to the same 4 minute cinematic or if you experience a cheap death or bug (which also happened where Trip wouldn't activate a console to progress the gameplay) that you have to watch the entire cinematic over again... WHY?Combat has some positives - it's reactive there are quite a varied amount of abilities to use but it feels overtly easy at the beginning and progressively annoying at later stages.  The mechs are most annoying when shield types swarm you while you need to complete a specific objective quickly (namely the 12th, 13th and 14th stages) especially if they don't conveniently give you a ""special"" tactical mech in order to exploit (such as an explosive or electrical one).  This only ramps up the difficulty of the game in an unsatisfying way as you sit there repeating the ""cheapest"" of combos in order to overcome these encounters and stifles creativity in the encounters.  Which is what the game comes down to - the combat becomes very very repetitive as you push through it and rarely alleviated by sections where you use a cool ""hover cloud"" (nimbus tee hee) but as enemies and even bosses become repeated over and over again the levels all start meshing together into one ""blah"" experience.While I enjoyed the game at the start - somewhere through the game I felt extremely uninterested by what the game had to offer and found myself wandering away to other games.  I basically forced myself to finish it once I realized the general length of the game was fairly short when I saw the achievement list - and cannot find myself recommending it for the 2014 gamer.

												An incredibly poor and lazy port, the bad omens were there from the very start with terrible keyboard an mouse implimentation in the  start menu, no option to go above 1920x1200 (and will likely crash anyway after selecting it), no graphical options other than ""low"" ""medium"" and ""high"" (no AA, no texture options, no filters). Even on high settings the textures are awful and shadows seem to have a mind of their own. Gameplay is buggy often with textures not appearing at all, and mind numbingly repetitive after only half an hour to the point where I don't even care about the story anymore - Run here kill two mechs, auto platform there kill two mechs - rinse and repeat. I can't see this as anything more than a cynical attempt at money making by releasing it to PC users in a rushed and quite frankly broken state. Just glad I didn't pay full price for it.			"

												Enslaved : Odyssey to the West has an amazing storyline with a beautifull background-Our heros actions take part on a pos-apocalyptic world, just like Fallout but, showing us the opposite of a wasteland. A beautifull world taken over by nature. Sadly the pc port to this game was awfully done, and is one of the reasons I wouldnt recommend this game for the pc. Plus, if you are playing with K&M forget about it.. Seems like they didnt even bother showing the controls, and just showcase the combos for the PC version, with Xbox360 buttons. Plus you'll waste more hours trying to jump around a corner than you will playing the game. I couldnt even get past chapter 4 till i got tired of trying to get around that corner (having already encountered 2 game breaking gliches and another corner i caught before spending 10 min to pass it.)Story 8.5/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 4/10Port 1/10			"

												Mind numbing dumb bullsh*t. Typical braindead console garbage, whit that worthless unreal engine of course. Enemies stucking in corners, impossible camera angles, invisible walls, the protagonist can only walk in four linear directions. Avoid this game, it doesn't worth a penny!The writing seems good, if you interrested in the story, it is worth playing once, but be prepared for nerve-wrecking frustration! Or just watch a walkthrough on YouTube.			"

												I bought it because it has BANDAI NAMCO label, looked good in screenshots and had POSITIVE USER REVIEWS. After near 6hrs of playing though, I'm sooooo bored with it and sick, too (literally, camera movements in this game made me sick. Like I physically wanted to throw up, not metaphorically). But let's begin from the top:ENSLAVED has beautiful graphics, maybe tiny bit too colorful, but still beautiful. Scenery looks awesome, made me stop at times and just look around. That's judging from moments when I had a chance to actually look at it, before camera made me sick by defying me.I like game music, but not from this game. I really pay attention to BGM, when I watch anime or movie or play a game. When some real thing goes on out there, I think to myself ""boy, I've got to get this OST"". But i REALLY don't have anything to say about music in this game. Like it doesn't exist. No memory of it whatsoever. Doesn't stand out at all, all i remember is that it was there. Maybe it's all got to do with me getting sick after 10 minutes into every game session.Gameplay is boring. BOOOORING. I'm actually amazed I put up with it for 6 hours. I just ran around half the time or jumped around the other half - and from one ""jump spot"" to another. All jump points are pre-determined, so you can't catually choose where to jump. You can jump back or forth or sometimes out of the way to collect one of these tech orbs. BTW, wth is a tech orb? Is it edible?!? I understand money is of no value in a post-apocalyptic world, but I could be made to collect food or soda cans for the girl so she could pump up our muscles (or reflexes, or stick), out of gratitude, or something along those lines. But not tech orbs. How does she do that ""upgrading"", by the way, is beyond me.This is probably good time to write what actually made me sick. One of two things is, when I ran around, sometimes camera got pinned to the wall, instead of being 3 meters off my back, and when I got close to the point, where it was pinned, it moved uncontrollably and made the world spin. Fast. And randomly. The other thing is, when I climbed up or down, camera didn't let me observe environment, even the immediate vicinity. I moved it left and released controller, and it would brutally, with donkey's stubborness reposition itself, centered on my character's butt. It's as it would say ""NO, YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT'S AROUND YOU, THAT'S IRRELEVANT, YOU NEED TO SEE THIS NEXT JUMP POINT INSTEAD SO YOU WON'T FALL, I WILL MAKE ALL OF THEM BLINK SO EVEN MORE OF REALISM IS GONE"". I'm used to RPG's, where I go anywhere I want, I'm used to FPP's where I point camera wherever I want, so this repeated deprivation of camera control is just plain ANNOYING! And it makes me sick. Really. People with epilepsy should never play this game. No one should, actually, but maybe that's just my irritation speaking.Oh, and there's fights. They're easy. REALLY. All those bots are just minor obstacle to another set of running or jumping or climbing or maybe gliding on that glowing thing, occasionally. When some bot charges at me, I just charge at it too, and I strike first, 90% of the time. Sometimes there were mini-bossess I needed to put down in a different manner, meaning repeat some sequence of actions 3 or more times until it's down. That's all. It's just tedious. Felt like I put down 10 or 15 normal bots in a row.There's also many weap..... wait... no, there isn't. Just fists and stick, 6 hours into the game, and judging by options the Trip Shop has, there aren't any more than this. So you run around, pick up TECH POINTS and somehow your reflexes, stick power or health or other things get better, when you buy their respective upgrades from the girl (GOD, she's almost almighty, isn't she). Shop is also bugged and reeks of console, but that's just minor annoyance I could catually live with.Anyway, all your running and jumping is interluded by neat cutscenes, which made me think of something:This game should be made a movie. Seriously. I mean, instead of being the game. Make it a movie, like PIXAR. Or 12-episodes-long anime series. Remove running around for TECH ORBS (because that's silly, frankly), throw in some mini-boss battles, instead of having players bludgeoning them with a stick, and that's it. I'd be first to buy the BD disc.All in all, it's one of these games that made me not care how it ends. Big disappointment. I bought it on a discount, so I'm not really feeling ripped off. Maybe I will have my nephew beat it in my stead, when he gets older. Mind you, I've played only 6 hours (by my standards this is really long, for a game that has only visuals as its PROS).			"

												The beginning of this game is captivating and it definitely has the beginnings of a great story, but as a PC port I find the menu and control system intolerable.  I have spent more time editing the .ini files than playing the game (which isn't much time, really) and am now giving up trying to make it functional.  At one point I was asked to press and hold a button which does not work (middle mouse button); went to change the binding in the options menu so that I could comply and discovered that bindings cannot be changed during gameplay, only from the main menu.  This prompted the loss of about fifteen minutes of gameplay which is unfortunate, but fine if it means I can have a good gameplay experience.  It happens.  While out of the game, I also took the opportunity to try to fix some of the more aggravating gameplay issues such as the inability to change the mouse sensitivity in-game (which is set exceptionally low), the abhorrent camera angles and camera controls and the observation that changing the graphics settings in-game has no effect on the graphics.   After an hour of messing around in the initialization files and succeeding only in changing the graphics settings and neither the camera controls or mouse sensitivity, I gave up.To think that a modern game requires the editing of initialization files to effect changes that appear in the menu system but do not function is really mind-blowing.This game looks fantastic, and the story looks great, but I have little tolerance for fighting the controls more than I'm fighting the enemies around me.

												I watched tons of Monkey King in Chinese growing up and loved it even though I didn't understand it.    It was great to see how the staff, cloud, monkey, pig and the even the crown were re-imagined and fit in the world.You start with a whole world where you're trying to figure out who are these people, why are there murder robots everywhere, why did the world ""end""? Unfortunately by the end of the game you don't really know that much more about the people, some plot points felt super blunt while others felt too vague.  The pacing towards the end feels rushed and is probably the worst part of the game.  Nothing really feels really resolved and it was a very deus ex machina ending. Traversal was bearable at first and made sense with the monkey king influences but, after a while it became a boring hold direction/mash jump until you're done.  Even worse than say an Assassin's Creed because most of the climbing sections were linear vs the more open nature of AC.  Using the cloud was great though, it felt good and looked good while using it though transitioning The gameplay kinda followed the story with a solid premise.  An okay Arkham Knight like combat with basic shooting but, as the game went on it the mechanics on top of it didn't feel great.  Offensively the upgrade tree didn't provide much variety or even options.  The limited options it did provide felt super inefficient compared the the standard mash quick attack.Shooting in this game felt pretty unwelcome. It was slow and clunky and unfortunately became more mandatory as the game progressed. There were segments later on in the game where I'm basically <travolta.gif> because I'm being shot at by by enemies I can't melee and ammo is somehow scarcer than health.Honestly I think the game is worth an hour or two of your time but, it isn't worth seeing through to the  end.

												Journey to the West is one of those folktales I've always meant to get around to, specially being a fan of Dragon Ball and having seen the founding members of Gorillaz work on music and art for a stage show version of the fable.  I remember ENSLAVED being hyped up and on shelves back during the early days of the 360/PS3 era, but having no consoles of my own at that stage in the game, I never got around to playing this one.Fast forward a few years and BAM, the whole game plus all the DLC in one package on Steam for a good sale price, I could finally see what the deal was.  The cast is at least semi-star studded, with the whole thing being the brainchild of Andy Serkis (Gollum, Snoke, Caesar, like a ton of other roles in sci-fi and fantasy movies you might have seen) and Ninja Theory (Heavenly Sword).  The sidekick is voiced by Lindsey Shaw, who played Moze in Ned's Declassified on Nick back a few years ago.  So the game at least has star appeal if you're a fan of their past performances.The game apparently had poor sales, and while plans were laid out for expanding with sequels, etc., the whole initiative was scrapped because money.  After having given the game the attention needed to see it through to the end, I'm kind of bummed I won't see anymore of this world the developers and Andy built together.  Enslaved takes place in a post-apocalyptic America (the fallout of some sort of robot revolution...maybe?), and the majority of its competition in the late 00's, is really, really vibrant and full of color throughout its various locales.  From the rocky cliffs, deserts, and crumbling New York City, everything is just so vivid.  This is a future that mother nature is in the process of successfully reclaiming.I think part of Enslaved's problem is that it marketed itself as a third person combat/platformer, but in practice, the combat is not a major highlight or feature of the game (but still manages to look cool, albeit repetitive in some spurts).  Enemy types are changed up with different combinations of foes with varying weak points coming at you in different situations, forcing you to adapt your combat tactics as some sort of puzzle mechanic.  The platforming especially is not the free-world climbing of Assassin's Creed, nor is it the anything-goes hopping-to-your-doom of 90's platformers like Mario 64.  You have to try really hard to find a way to die in the climbing sections of the game, as many times it keeps you from making a suicide leap.  Instead, the puzzle nature comes out in full force, and you as the player are looking for the correct way to navigate the space Monkey is in, while still collecting ammo, power ups, collectibles, etc.  If the game had been marketed more as a puzzle of ""where do I jump to next?"" then maybe early reviewers in the 00's would have known what they were getting into instead of being disappointed by the (at first) seemingly restrictive controls.  The area where Enslaved really shines is the cut scenes and character interactions.  Performances were motion captured, and these nearly decade old characters do a better job at emoting than many AAA NPC's I've seen even in 2016 titles.  There is so much chemistry, subtlety and character interaction going on just in the main trio's body language alone, and these are elements of human communication that games tend to leave on the cutting room floor in favor of more polished gameplay.  That's fine in practice, but it was just so refreshing to see, and the uncanny valley never even became an issue!I mentioned this package includes the console DLC, you also get access to a several hour long campaign starring a different character, with totally different movement and combat mechanics.  This is a nice way to fill in some of the gaps for this character's backstory and habits, and a refreshing change of pace from Monkey's acrobatics and staff abilities.  Plus, hey, extra story content for free!Enslaved is just such a curiosity of its time, and even then only console cycle into the past.  I'm disappointed the plans to take the franchise further didn't pan out, but I still think this game is worth diving into for the things it tried to be different at.  It may not have succeeded on all fronts, but when it does get it right, it really shines through, and you can tell the people behind it put everything they had into making something unique.			"

The graphics of this game are still decent enough to look at and the overall world is good designed. One of the three main characters did go on my nerves but notheless a funny game. It`s probably just not worth 20 bucks. Therefore it`s too short. It can easily be played through within 6-8 hours. But when it`s on sale I suggest you can grab this game.			"

It's also BEAUTIFUL - it just looks Gorgeous, which really helps as well in terms of getting you into the game.Gameplay: smooth and lovely and nicely varied and intuitive.

												Great graphics for what it was at the time. The gameplay mechanics wasn't great for a keyboard/mouse use as many as mentioned. The ending ended abruptedly and kind of makes the game incomplete. Everything between the start up until  the end was a great journey however. Some bugs here and there that requires restart of the game to get pass.The female character gets pretty annoying about half way through the game with the way she bosses you around.Game can get somewhat repetitve halfwayas well.The new skills you purchase along the way isn't very well explained on how they are used.I would rate it 6.5/10 overall. I wouldn't recommend it mainly because of the ending.			"

												Based on what I had heard, I went into this game expecting to play an action-adventure movie. I was not disappointed.The combat, though enjoyable, can get repetitive; the platforming is on autopilot (you literally cannot jump to your death); and the levels are very linear, with some small side paths to find extra collectibles. The focus is on the story, and it’s a good one. Voice acting is top-notch throughout, and in cutscenes you can clearly see the emotion in the characters’ faces.When I wrote about Tomb Raider, I complained about how much of it felt like I was just watching a movie, but that was in part because my expectations were totally off. With Enslaved, I had a better idea of what to expect, and its story and overall execution were far superior. I really don’t want to talk details about the story, so I’ll just say it’s about two strangers brought together in a post-apocalyptic setting, trying to get home.If you like story-driven and emotive games, and you don’t mind brawler combat against robots, you should play Enslaved. If you can’t stand pressing buttons to smash robots to pieces, you should at least watch a playthrough.			"

												I really wanted to try this game but it's impossible. I had to manually enter my monitor's native resolution in an INI-File, ok. But the game absolutely does not recognize my cheap (read: not xbox) controller. If i set up mouse/keyboard controls (have to remap from wasd since i'm left-handed) and start the game, all controls are reset to approx 3 keys which are conseqeuntly at least triple-mapped. Game is absolutely UNPLAYABLE			"

												It's Meant For Console Gaming:Honestly, this game is not meant for PC. When I started playing and the camera started going all over the place, I quit, plugged in my controller, and resumed. It does have an option to turn down the mouse sensitivity, but I didn't try it. It's much better with a controller, so I stuck with that. Since it is, it makes me feel this game was really meant for console.The Good:-The graphics are great, and I was playing on all low. I liked the idea of the plot of being a captive slave and escaping. The main character guy cracks me up because he reminds me of a monkey and a big cat cross-breed.-The combat is action-packed, something I normally don't like, but it was so similar to fighting games that I felt right at home. The main character feels a lot like playing Kilik or Seung-Mina from Soul Caliber IV, so if you're good at playing them, the main character will feel very familiar.  He uses a staff weapon just like them, but is more agile and faster than Seung-Mina.-The characters look amazing and cool.-I really liked the main character guy's personality. He seems like a very likable guy, and is caring despite his rough look.The Bad:-Like other reviews, the linear gameplay is very noticeable. -The hand-holding and inability to fail while maneuvering makes it feel like a game for beginners despite the edgy and shiny look (and being on normal difficulty). -The game's save system is based on checkpoints and autosaves without the ability to save at your leisure - and it's game-breaking. As I saw the girl run while escaping, I tried going after her to have my game clunk around and skip-ahead like a skipping DVD when the little autosave icon showed up. I thought it was because it was loading the background and effects since the game is quite detailed, but I was wrong. It does this at every autosave checkpoint, and I have to sudenly stop what I'm doing and wait for it to pass like nausea.-Even with switching to a controller, the camera does as it pleases. You can move around the camera yourself to get a better view, but it still doesn't seem possible to get the angle right without running away from where you want to go, then make a circle, and come back. And it's still facing the wrong direction from where you're trying to go.-The lady companion is annoying. She's always scared,  didn't help the main character when she was able and he had a chance of dying, and then she put a helmet on my guy character that causes his pain so she could control him . Yeah, screw her. :P			"

												8/10 *Warning* I'm not Native English Speaker.Pros: - Very detailed graphics both characters and environment, especially mechs! mechs look really cool. (10/10)- Great animations (10/10) (especially face movement!)- Great cutscenes, especially Pigsy Perfect 10 (DLC) (10/10)- Great voiceacting (9/10)- Combat system are simple but pretty fun in late game and when fight against Boss (8/10)- Great Soundtrack (10/10)- Enivronment are really beautiful.Cons:- Camera can be annoying.. Imaging you're running and trying to move camera but camera keep pulling back, and what make it worse is you can't HOLD camera. My fix is let them be just think of it as you're playing Resident Evil 1, but sometime I want to look at beautiful environments. :(- Trip (Girl) are so annoying... She look nice and when I start to like her she will do something stupid again. And then when you walk too far away from her she'll kill you... And it feel like she 'Order' you to do things more than 'Ask' you nicely. But I like her anyway :D (*SPOILER*) I like when she broke someone heart. :) (*SPOILER*) - I hate that you have to collect orbs around the map, if they make it drop from enemys only that would be nice. - I feel like a walking&climbing phase are too long in the beginning. I almost stop the game around chapter 3. Climbing, Running, Killing mobs, have only Trip to talk to, Bored. But it got a LOT better when you get back to Trip's village and (*SPOILER*) got another character to join your team. He's funny (*SPOILER*) and enemys get harder, More Boss, Less bull...t,  If only the game are like this at the beginning I would give to 9.5/10 - YOU CAN'T USE DLC COSTUME unless you End a game at least one time. (There's a fix for this in internet) Such a♥♥♥♥♥♥move from dev.16 hrs for End the game both Normal & DLC. It's still a good experience for me. :)			"

												A very simple but competent action adventure. The gameplay falters a bit on virtually unfailable platforming sections and somewhat dull combat. Really there's not much in the way of technical challenge, but the game presents itself well. I'm slightly hesitant to recommend it, but if you're a fan of the genre you'll find something enjoyable in this.			"

												I hate this game so much.  This is a perfect example of what developers should not do in a game.  The most powerful enemy in this game is the camera angle.  Good luck trying to get a decent view of the action or a view of the screen that doesn't completely disorient you.   And the sidekick in the game, is a huge pain in the butt.  She doesn't do anything except ask you to help her get across various obstacles and then she holds you up from completing levels.  She is like the anti-Elizabeth in BIoshock Infinite.   She will get in your way and make you hate the entire dev team for not figuring out a better way to make both of these characters act in concert.   Plus, if you do buy this game, I highly suggest turning off motion blur.  The enabled motion blur in this game is strong enough to make someone sick.			"

												Well...I'll say this. It looks pretty.But the story is kind of weak, the collectables don't really feel like you have any reason to collect or at least it gives you none straight out that I could see. There are numerous moments where (And this is just a personal pet peeve) I could see objects clipping into other ones. I get that it's unavoidable in many situations but it just made many of the objects feel like they weren't solid.The game itself is short and to me, simply easy. You can quite easily rush through this game, just focusing on health and sheild upgrades and then get the staff ones at the end since you can two hit your strongest normal mech enemy with full upgrades, negating the need to actually get close to them towards the end when you have ammo.Overall, I'd reccomend getting this on sale but it's only barely above meh, thanks to the cute little bot that follows Pigsy around in Pigsy's perfect 10.5/10			"

												The game is in the same vein as The Prince of Persia Series. However, the gameplay is extremely linear, repetitive and predictable. There's a tech-tree is that is sub par, and you use a ""buddy-system"" with a NPC which is meh. You issue generic commands or have to throw her across to a bridge to drop a ladder basic stuff and usually annoying. Plot is so-so; however, the voice acting really, drives the story and gets you involved. Andy Serkis, aka Gollum, plays the main character and hits it out of the park. The female lead does pretty awesome too. All-in-all, a fun game that is worth it for a run-though; however, after its won, a pretty forgettable one. Buy it on sale from Steam or something.			"

												What Enslaved has going for it is beautiful environments, great character design, professional voice acting (as in actual actors), good music, all the artistic things. Andy Serkis had a big part in the voice acting and motion capture performance, and you can really see it. But when it comes to actual gameplay, it's not that great. The enemies are very repetitive and the controls on the PC are really wonky. You can tell the controls are meant to be used on a console and the PC port wasn't super smooth. There was one move that I leveled up and couldn't use because the instructions for it were for an XBOX controller. . Getting around consists a lot of jumping from ledge to ledge, which is cool in the beginning but it gets old. you can only jump off specific ledges, and plenty of times you can't jump off a simple small ledge because you can only jump from certain spots. The exception to this is the ""cloud"" which is like an air surfing thingimajig, and it's pretty cool, but you only use it in certain spots, and also it's hard to use. Honestly, this is a really beautiful-looking game. If you just want to play it for the art, I recommend just playing it on easy. There's no real point in challenging yourself with this game. Personally, what kept me going was that I wanted to see what happened in the end, and mostly I just wanted to get it over with.			"

												This game starts off in such an exciting way and sets the scene beautifully. The post apocalypic environments really draw you in. As the story progresses the magic wears off and the game starts to feel repetative. The controls are ok on a controller but feel a bit sloppy  however the combat flows and you can chain attacks in visually pleasing ways. The difficulty is also questionable starting off to feel easy but spiking randomly in places. Lots of climbing and jumping. This is not a bad game at all but could have been so much more. Enslaved looks beautiful in full 3D with Tridef or Nvidia 3D play and Helix patch Still have not completed but may return to this title one day "

												I pirated this game.It ended up being one of those games so good, that you truly want to support the creators (Ninja Theory) so they can make more like it. So after finishing it I rushed off to steam to get a proper copy of it aswell.I've been a gamer for as long as i can remember, and it all started with my sega mega drive 16 bit and sonic.However, the really good games, the gems that stand out are few and far between. I always cherish them when I find such pearls.When you feel empty after finishing a game, sad as thought you lost someone you care about- thats when you know the game was truly great.As i started playing Enslaved, I didn't really think it was all that, but it didnt take long to convince me otherwise. I absolutley Love how Ninja Theory made the characters ""come to life"", i don't know if i have seen anything like it in any other games.The main story (as in Trips needing to go home- then kill pyramid), and fighting was so-so If i must be honest. At best I can call the fighting mechanism clunky, but I never had problems playing because of it.What was captivating was how Monkeys and Trips relationship slowly changed troughout the game. Their story was what made the game stand out- the work with body language and eye-contact made this game what it is. For those of you fearing games with romance parts in it, this is nothing like dragon age or games like that. There is no ""love story"" per se, again- its's the body language of the characters, glances in cutscenes and how they unwind in eachothers presence that shows there is a spark there.And then there is Pigsy:)I didnt discover this game until last week. I cant really say Im sorry about that. makes me wish i could forget I played the game so i could discover it again and again. But alas, i guess I have to make do just replaying it a couple mroe times.As many others, i too hope there will be a sequel at some point, but ive come to understand there are no such plans. i'm crossing fingers and toes that they will change their minds somewhere in the future.

But alas, i guess I have to make do just replaying it a couple mroe times.As many others, i too hope there will be a sequel at some point, but ive come to understand there are no such plans. i'm crossing fingers and toes that they will change their minds somewhere in the future.

												I've put 4 hours into it, and that's about all I can stand.  For starters, it's repetitive and boring.  The game consists solely of bad platforming and horrendously easy combat.  The combat is incredibly easy and basic.  The platforming is equally as boring.  It basically consists of pointing at the shiny spot and pressing jump.  The story, from what I've seen, is a poor excuse to tolerate the remedial gameplay the game throws at you over and over.  The two main characters are a selfish ♥♥♥♥♥ and a huge guy the aforementioned ♥♥♥♥♥ bent to her will under penalty of death.It looks ``àlright`` for a console port, but from what I`ve seen this game does nothing well.  Maybe the story picks up after a while, but I`ll never know, `cause I refuse to play any more of this.			"

												Ten minutes of this game's awful camera made me more nauseous than Super Hexagon, and that's a game where you stare at a flashing, spinning, pulsing, colorshifting strobelight.The graphics were nice, I guess, but nothing hooked me, gameplay-wise. It seems like a lot of the game is supposed to be a jumping puzzle, but there's only one direction to go and items you can grab and jump on are highlighted, so it's basically a matter of holding a direction and pressing space. Not exactly thrilling, console port or not.Combat mechanics aren't bad, but they're also not good.Supposedly the story's pretty good, but story needs to be complemented by half-decent gameplay.Mostly, I couldn't push past the terrible camera. I know it's hard to design a camera for a game like this, but at the very least it shouldn't induce motion sickness.			"

												Well, I really enjoyed it. Solid 3rd person platforming/fighter mechanics with a unique take on Journey to the West for flavour. Occasionally awkward camera repositioning (fixed camera location that might jump to somewhere that looks more cinematic but is also the opposite of the direction you're currently pointing your character so you start running off in the wrong direction).Definitely worth buying. I got it for 75% off, and was great value for $5.			"

												A medicre 5/10. Not worth it if you already have other games waiting in the pipeline.The game is extrmely linear, on rails and everything is repetitive, from combat to acrobatics.  Controls are acceptable, but not tuned for K+M.Still playable at 60fps, but has very dated graphics. Textures are in particular very very low rez.The story/characters are the only redeeming features of the game, although fairly cliche and predictable . Game can be beaten in about 9-10 hours.			"

												Just finished the game and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥i loved it! (there will be no spoilers)From the first moment i saw this title and the charakter models i just fell in love. I began playing and eventhough its a bit buggy it will still take the spot for the best game i have in my library (im at 134 payed games atm) and other than that, I just got it from a bundle for 1 euro! amazing game, just trust me on that one. Its actually rly sad how i completed it after only 1 week eventhough i was trying to do a slow pase progress doing like 1 or 2 chapters a day and picking up evrything. Well like jacksepticeyes letsplay series of happywheels evrything have to come to an end one day. Today was my day.btw effing great ending. Left me speechless a couble of minutes after completing, heck i even watched the whole credits through( which i usually skips :P) cus i was busy being stunned! Recommended alot of friends and therefor i am also writing this. You know... to help people realize how great this is!			"

												Not a game for those that are the sniper-type player. The game itself would be less of an issue if I were not constantly fighting the view. During the game I cant seem to find the right balance between the mouse and the rest of the controles to keep the targets in view for attacks.Turning Monkey around is a slow process making boss fights not easy at all. Same for turning the view to point at enemies for Plasma/Stun blasting is a slugish task.I will try to get to the end but no way will I even attempt to try the game at normal or higher settings.Like others mentioned the artworks is not that bad either.

												A 5/10 i must say. Worth a buy on 75% off. Otherwise stay away.THE GOOD - Graphics (check with your uncle google how to make this game look good its worth it) and world design. Breathtaking post apocalyptic world filled with color and beautiful nature. Music is nice. The woman character is well done (although very manupulative design) and it works.THE BAD - Camera and Controls - absolutely atrocious. Worst i've seen honestly. Combat is clunky and pretty much a button masher. Puzzles are extremely eazy and the game constatly explains you what to do. On top of that everything glows. The platforming is also done for 10 year old kids where u've guessed it - everything glows. Just mash jump and you will find your way. Monkey (the main char) is very boring and has the emotional impact of a stone wall. On the other hand in the last 30% of the game you get a new character named Pig. Yep. He has horrible personality and awful jokes and manages to obliterate the chemistry that was slowly build up between the 2 main characters. To bad because that chemistry and the gorgeous world were the only things holding the game up to this point. The last 30% of the game are  painfully bad. We get a revenge story without a villain  and a romatic story without love.FINAL THOUGHTS  - This game has nothing to do with Journey to the west. They've stolen the names of 2 characters and one of them is wearing a helmet. That's all you are getting. The ending is not bad but its confusing and uncalled for. Everything up to that point is completely predictable and than you get an final that does not fit. They were on the right track with the ""love story"" but the addition of the 3rd character ruined everything and put an end to any kind developement. A disappointingly average game. A rocky journey that starts strong but looses its path in the final third.			"

												Now THIS is what I call an adventure.Pros:+ very good story with good characters, you do care what happens to them+ nice visuals+ nice soundtrack+ good controller layout+ smart leveldesign+ the game throws something new at you every 10 minutes, making it fresh through the whole game+ skills and perks can be purchased+ nice combat, not too overwhelming and not too simple, just the right balance+ climbing is fast and easy, I like that style more+ very interesting world they created+ animations (especially final kills) are fantastic+ a lenghty game well worth the asking price+ additional campaign with a new character and an all new story and gameplay (about 4 hours)+ runs smooth without problems+ checkpoints are placed plenty, to not waste your time with replaying the same stuffCons:- movement can be a little bit clunky, but never too bad- the sound in the cutscenes was way too low compared to the gameplay, often I couldnt understand the characters dialouge in a cutscene (german dub)- there is a counter attack you can purchase, but it just doesnt work. I tried every timing and combination and still I never could get it to work. Throughout the whole game!A criminally overlooked gem. I would even go as far and say that its one of the legends among this genre. Everybody that loves adventure games should get it now.			"

												Without going into spoilers, the game's story is unfulfilling and leaves you with too many questions. Sure, it doesn't broadcast needless information to you every five seconds, but you'll be left feeling empty once all is said and done, and I can't recommend a game that can't even give its player closure. It's rushed and not worth the ~20 dollars for its 6-8 hour experience, longer if you go out of your way to collect things, but there's no point in even doing that. You don't unlock anything extra, unless you count headaches.It's not a bad game by any means, but you could easily spend its asking price on much better and longer experiences. 6/10			"

The problem here is that the game gives almost no warning that you are moving too far away from Trip before she decides to kill you, forcing you to go back to the last checkpoint.  The truely frustrating part about this is that the checkpoints appear to be few and far between.			"

												Enslaved is a mostly overlooked game by the developer Ninja Theory, the same guys who later went on to make the controversial reimagining of the Devil May Cry franchice ""DmC"".It takes its inspiration from a classic Chinese novel, but places it in a post apocalyptic American setting. The premise is certainly intriguing, but the game is in my opinion held back by its weird gameplay decisions and annoying AI characters.The gameplay is a mix between Gears of War style cover based shooting and Prince of Persia style platforming sections. It also has some melee combat for good measure. Enslaved pretty much mixes and matches different elements from different inspirations, but these elements really lack dept. Combat boils down to tapping a few different attack buttons and rolling away, while the platforming sections work with a context sensitive ""platforming"" button. You can complete pretty much 90% of all the platforming by just pressing up on the analog stick and mashing the platforming button. Probably the most refined thing is the cover based shooter mechanic, but it is also the one that feels the most out of place for this type of game.The game is also totally relient on your AI partner characters, and the experience is very much on rails. You always have a partner character yelling instructions at you. This really makes the game feel like you are just a dumb monkey following instructions rather than figuring out stuff for yourself, which is ironic, because in the story you actually are ENSLAVED (get it!?!) by another person and have to follow his orders.A lot of the game areas are decayed versions of actual American landmarks, and that might be memorable if you are American and patriotic or just generally like cool looking video game levels, but I kind of just breezed through all that not giving it much thought. The visuals of the game are very good and especially the character animations during combat look impactful. It looks like a decent PS3/XB360 era game. I had some minor problems with the shadows, but they might have been caused by some graphics card driver incompatibility rather than the game itself.In the end I would probably not recommend Enslaved. It's an interesting game, but more so in a bad way. It has some bizzare gameplay elements that really don't work together and the AI character nagging and the blatant linearity of the game is annoying in an interesting fashion. If you really want to see Prince of Persia and Gears of War come together in an interesting game setting you might want to give this a shot, but the probability of anyone wanting that is quite low.

												In this game you play as Mel Gibson on a journey through a destroyed New York with your mom. The ""About the Game gives a okay description of the story execpt for the part about the complex relationship and uneasy partnership. The female character is pretty much in the game as a love interst(shocking right?!), but not much else.The player controled character is named Monkey since he does all of the automatic climbing in Enslaved. When the game starts you think Trip might be incharge though you soon discover that this game will be like most others where you the male are the boss. If you haven't guessed by the oringinal names the two main characters of Enslaved don't have much going on in the personallity department. I can agree with some of the reviews who say the color palet in this game is  colorful, but the boring enviroments in Enslaved overshadow any pretty paint. The combat in this game is bad, and add to that the one dimesnsional chatacter(yes this isn't me leaving out an s) you get a game that is a real misery to play. Now lets get to some of the annoying mechanics of this game. First is the constant orders from Trip after you are already doing what is require to progress. In additon Monkey can only jump off platforms on occasion, and only from very specific spot, so if you make a mistake you usually have to take the long way around instead of being able to jump back down. I also find it pretty nice how you will be running or walking and get stuck on an invisible objects in a wide clear path. Some may think this review a troll, or that I'm being overly critical of a $19.99 game, but what the people who think that would be forgetting is that this game was originally sold on consoles for $59.99. Thanks for reading.			"

												This game cannot be praised well enough by a pesant like myself but I will atempt to give a decent review of the game. When it comes to telling an engrosing story, very few games come close as this, the environments are breathtaking, the characters are flawed and are portraid as real and emotional. There are moments early on that make you feel resentful for being forced into a caretaker roll on an ""escort mission,"" but that is an important part of the story telling.As the game progresses you start to forget that you are a slave, you become attached to the one who holds your life in their hands, you are afraid of harm beffaling the one person who has taken your freedom, and you choose to be the guardian. This is organic story telling that to some gamers not having choises or playing a linier game takes away the feeling of exploration and freedom.While being a linear game, it does lead one event to another in a fluid and imersive progression.  I would place this game high on a pedastal for the concept alone, and the concept came together in a perfectly voice acted, immersive engrosing story with some of the most mature content in any game I have ever played. This game tells a story of genocide, slavery, the cost of freedome, the fear of isolation, and Stockholm syndrom. It is by far the most original game that has come out in a very long time, and that made so many gamers over look a game that should be in every gamers library.			"

												It seems like a great story, and the graphics are amazing. Sadly I doubt I'll ever see it through because the camera movement  made me absolutely nauseous.  It's obvious that the game was made for console and nothing was adjusted when it was changed to PC. Right down to the 'push start' instructions.The controls (other than for the camera) were fine once I figured out what they were. Strangely the game starts you in a room with no instructions, control information or anything and you have to exit out of the game to go into the control options to find out how to do anything other than the usual movement and jumping. Good premise and I even liked the voice acting. Sadly I just couldn't stomach playing it. Literally.			"

The controls are just all over the place and without any option to change them. To be honest there's not much in the terms of graphical options either. It's basically unplayable without an x360 controller or other Xinput gamepad. Even then the camera just gets in the way of your fun. I'm glad I've bought it for a dollar. The PC port isn't worth much more.			"

												Looks good.  Can't play because I have a birth injury that requires I remap the keys, and key mapping is completely and utterly broken.  Can't map some commands/keys, and even if you do the game randomly forgets all your mappings every now and then.Tried to get my money back, but Steam said no because I didn't try playing it within 2 weeks of purchase.

												This game is absolutely awful. First of all the PC port is a travesty. Weird shadows all over the place, improper lighting, incredibly ridiculous framerate and performance hiccups whenever the game needs to load a new area, and a complete lack of any sort of control over the settings. Frustrating on every level.As for the gameplay, oh boy. First of all it's a 3D combat game with no lock on mechanic. That's already a mistake. Attacks will connect most of the time, but when they don't it's the most frustrating thing ever. On top of this, the combat is incredibly simplistic, which wouldn't be that big of a deal had they at least put an effort into it. I had to look this up since I played this game for less than an hour, but it's a good thing I did because I never intend to come back to this game. Your fighting ability from the start of the game basically doesn't change throughout the entire game. Okay fine, if there's enough meat that could work out, right? Well if there was enough substance to the combat sure, but there isn't. You have two attack buttons, light and heavy, and you have one combo string and two heavy attacks, one for when you do a heavy attack by itself and one for when you do a heavy attack in a combo. Then you have a charge focus attack that can break the enemy guard and a wide attack that knocks enemies close to you away. That's IT. For the entire game this is what you have to work with. Later on you get a perfect guard attack and a perfect roll evade attack, but those are based on the opponent attacking you and not your options to attack your opponent.Now let me explain why this sucks. Besides the combat not having any depth to it, there's no variety to it either. You look at the same attack string over and over and over again with no way to even remotely make things more interesting. Your enemies will block, sometimes I guess, but there's no reason you shouldn't just keep wailing on the light attack button and rolling when someone swings at you. The heavy attack button has no purpose but to do a little extra damage and MAYBE make fights go by faster, but other than that serves no purpose. Also, that focus charge attack that breaks guard? To do that attack you have to hold down the light attack button for about 2 or 3 seconds, then let it go. WHY? What is the purpose of that decision? At the VERY least you could have moved it to the heavy attack button to make that button worth SOMETHING, but as is, it's not a very good use of control mapping. AND it's a terrible move anyways. You have to charge it up for 2 or 3 seconds, leaving you COMPLETELY vulnerable to enemy attack in the mean time. If there are two or more enemies you need to take out, you are NOT charging this attack because you will get hit out of it constantly and you're better off just mashing the light attack button. If there was a LOCK ON MECHANIC like there is in literally every good 3D combat game ever made since Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time made in god damn November of 1998, they could have done something like while being locked onto the enemy you press forward on the control stick and the heavy attack to guard break. Or if you want to make it something people won't do accidentally, while locked on and AWAY from the enemy, which you can do because with lock on you can move away from the enemy WHILE STILL FACING THEM. What a stupid control scheme this is.The main gameplay outside of combat is Assassin's Creed/Uncharted style parkour climbing platforming. Now here's why THAT sucks. Objects that you can climb on flash bright white so you know they are climbable. This ruins any chance at the player having to maybe explore their surroundings and figuring out how to get through an area. Besides that, jumping is done with the same button that is used for rolling in combat. How does the game differentiate between rolling and jumping? Simple, you CANNOT jump unless you are at the edge of a platform, which means that you cannot fall off platforms, which means there is literally no chance of failing to platform, because game overs are a failure of the game designer.  In fact, you cannot fall off of ANYTHING that would kill you, pipes, ladders, suspended beams, there's no threat or involvement with any of this platforming, you literally just wiggle the control stick around and mash the A button until you get to the end of the platforming segment. It's dull, repetitive, and uninvolved. You could accomplish this by just having a zipline or something to take the player to the end of the platform segment, but instead they decide to pad out the length of the game with this impossible to fail uninspired platforming. Trust me, it WILL get tedious to you after about 20 minutes once you realize what is going on.Lastly we get into the story, which is probably the biggest let down of this entire product. The story starts off in what you can quickly deduce is a slave ship hauling people from place to place when all of a sudden one of the prisoners manages to escape and sets the ship up to malfunction and crash. This is the introduction to your ""hero"" who is aptly named simply ""Monkey"", since this is a Journey to the West reimagining. Your hero starts off the story yelling and cursing at everyone and generally just being completely unlikable. I have a hard time caring about or relating to this character when he seems to be incapable of a normal conversation. I don't know why anyone would be invested in the future of this character when he's such an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all of the time. So anyways, Monkey then climbs from the bowels of the ship to the escape pods, where he runs into the prisoner who managed to escape, a tech savvy girl named Trip, who rightly so tries to abandon him after their previous 2 interactions with each other where Monkey was screaming at her and generally looking like he was going to kill her. Monkey manages to hang on to her escape pod though and they both escape from the slave ship right before it crashes. And here's the part where Monkey needs to be coerced with the threat of death to help out another human in need. Trip ends up putting a slave headband on Monkey because he was too violent and belligerent to help without it. This sets up the premise that anything Trip commands, Monkey must obey or he will die. Additionally, if Trip's heartbeat stops, Monkey will die. So not only is the characterization of Monkey becoming abundantly clear, but now the game has turned into an escort mission FOR THE REST OF THE GAME and I don't care how you feel about escort missions, an entire game that is one long escort mission is just abysmal. They try to fill the story gaps with small moments that are supposed to be funny, but almost all of them boil down to Monkey is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and Trip is a nice girl.And that's where I couldn't put up with this game anymore. I wasn't going to put up with this incredibly unlikable main hero who I had no investment in, I wasn't going to put up with these horribly simplistic borderline impossible to fail gameplay mechanics, and I wasn't going to put up with the horrible PC port issues and performance problems. You know what the biggest travesty of all is? The game is actually visually incredibly beautiful despite the age. Some of the areas are really stunning and are quite the marvel to look at. The art direction of the game is just so fantastic, it's such a shame that it's wasted on this horrible tripe. Do not recommend, stay away from this game, if you get this game for free, punch whoever gave it to you.			"

												Mix of uncharted/The last of us and typical hack and slash. I'm near the end and have been playing it all the way through on hard. While combat is a challange and I have died and cursed a lot, The game is pretty easy. The parkour is just tap A while holding the L stick in a certain direction.The story is not original but isn't as badly executed as it could have been. But it is predictable and the characters aren't interesting. As consequence I don't feel invested in these characters at all. This game has nothing innovative about it at all. Furthermore the relationship between the two main protagonists feels artificial.The setting is similar to Borderlands. Post apocalyptic scifi. However, the game is split up between melee, shooting and parkour. So after an intense battle, the game gives you a break. Combat is the typical wave after wave enemies. You can upgrade your ablities via your companion. Orbs are scattered around the level and dropped by enemies for you to collect and use to level up. Melee combat is just block, dodge and attack. You have a couple of combos and a special attack at your disposal. You can shoot projectiles that stun and damage. It's a console port so the graphics are subpar.The music is unmemorable.I don't like to just bash things but this game is unremarkable and just bland.			"

												I can't speak for this game on consoles, but on PC it is a buggy mess. Which is a shame, because the underlying gameplay and story, especially the character interaction, are truly enjoyable. But most of the cutscenes either freeze or the voices get out of synch with the video, and often the game will stutter and slow to a near crawl regardless of settings. It's a shame because I really want to play this game, but after around 4 hours I just can't bring myself to go back.			"

I use keyboard and mouse, and the game keeps resetting my key config to a bizarre setting where left-mouse button is supposedly doing everything, and so I can't fight. I have to quit to the main menu, redo my key config, then reload from last checkpoint. That wil work for 5 mins, then the controls will reset again. Seems to be an incredibly shoddy console port. Can't play it, so can't recommend it. If you want this, make sure you have a controller, and buy it on sale. If I'd paid full price for this I'd have been fuming.			"

												One of the most moving RPG games I've played in a long time. It just sad that it didn't find it's way to the spotlight, and therefor a sequel seems an impossibility. I'm so glad it made it's way to PC.With brilliant motion capture from actors like Andy Serkis (Gollum - Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit Trilogies), the emotions from the characters are very believable, and make your actions that much more meaningful. Great visuals and a fantastic soundtrack add to the story even moreso. The gameplay is great fun, with acrobatic elements and teamwork between Monkey and Trip, meaning a good blend between action and environmental puzzles, which can also come into play during combat, which is a great stress reliever with epic finishing moves and great sound engineering to enhance those ""smashy"" sounds. The only place that the game fell short for me was the staff's ""aim and fire"" feature, although this is only required in a few points of the game, so you won't have to rely on it. That, and sometimes the game would have trouble realising which object to whilst making use of acrobatics; although almost every game with this kind of ""play"" has this issue, so it's quick to learn how to minimalise it with certain camera angling and/or stick pushing.A unique and moving game I strongly recommend to those who love a good story, but still like to smash some robots in the face.

												I love this game, I really really do. It is an amazing science fiction romp with great graphics, acting, music and a fantastic plot. Unforntunately, what kills it for me is the fact when climbing with Monkey, you get stuck a LOT on the ""corner pipes"", not being able to simply jump to the next pipe within reach right on the other side of the bend. This has happened to me countless times. Yes, after several playthroughs, sitting through cutscenes, battling multiple enemies, and other monotany and to get stuck and having to restart multiple times until the glitch lets up and finally lets you jump to the next pipe in order to progress, it gets extremely tedious. They should have fixed this issue a long time ago, and according to the forums, it happens to a LOT of people. Such a damn shame, because the game is so damn good besides this, but for this one simple glitch that could have been remedied, causing multiple restarts and sometimes nearly hours of setbacks rather than progessing because of a stupid jump to another pipe, I can't recommend it. FYI, I have tried getting past these points both with and without a controller, and it has made no difference for me, it will only jump when the game mysteriously ""allows"" it. I will change this review if it is ever fixed.			"

												Key word: Frustrating. I tried so hard to like this game. I really did. However, I've never come across a port which makes a game so frustratingly unplayable. At first it had everything I'd normally love in a game - Breaktaking visuals, a gripping plot from the beginning and a feeling of freedom and fluidity in the movement and combat which is great (despite linear pathing and encounters). Also some of the best voice acting I've come across from a game in a while. The thing that lets it down is the actual 'game' part of it.As many people here have mentioned, this is a port from the xbox. After half an hour of playing around with the mouse sensitivity controls, I accepted that it didn't have a setting which made it usable. A slight twitch and you're aiming the other side of the area, but somehow the mechs still run faster than your deaccelerated aim mode, making the turret sections frustratingly difficult. Further than this, the camera controls have a life of their own and you'll be fighting for control the entire time while being ripped apart by the enemies. Combine this with long checkpoint respawns and having to run around to the ends of the map every time to collect the tech orbs for an ultimate grind.On top of this the port has a number of unpatched bugs, which left me stranded on a pole on the side of the building, unable to jump around a corner no matter what I try or how many times I reloaded (still not sure how I made it past after 30 minutes). The developers didn't even update the control guidelines for the PC, so every time I learned I new move, I had to minimise the game to google the equivilent PC controls.Conclusion: Seems like it could be a great game on the xbox. However, worst port of any game I've ever come across onto PC, making the game unplayable, frustrating and hindered by gamebreaking bugs. DO NOT buy for PC.			"

												Unfortunately, I cannot recommend buying this game on PC, and it's not because it's a bad game. I wouldn't even know if it was, because I couldn't play it at all. Every time I tried to, the game froze. Or a humonguous amount of lag, not just a few seconds, or delay between sound and video. It took me about 20 minutes from the Press Start to begin screen until all the intro cinematic was done and the game started. And then, every time I tried moving, jumping, I got these huge lag spikes/frozen screen. I could not play the game. And I am bummed out because of it. I looked at the game's system requirements, , and while I don't have state of the line PC, it passed the req. Still, no game for me, and therefore I cannot recommend this game on PC. Maybe if you have the latest specs.			"

Boring combat, janky animations, and constantly interrupting cut-scenes for every 10 metres you walk are the smallest of offences.Worse is the on-rails ""let us help you play the game"" gameplay, which is as helpful as ""adjusting"" a surgeons hand while performing a heart transplant. No, I did not want my character to glue myself to that object and jump that way, would you just let me play the game myself? What is WRONG with developers doing this to their customers.			"

												I love this game.  This is one of my favorite games.......on the PS3 that is!  The story is great.  The characters are great.  This game was really developed for the PS3, not the PC.  You can tell they put very little effort into the PC version.  For the PC, the camera is terrible, the controls are terrible, the screen will jump all over the place, etc.  I really do not recommend the PC version of this game.  I do, however, highly recommend the PS3 version of this game.  Also, in the early part of Chapter 2, you will get stuck. Trip will lower a bridge but the other side is stuck.  Monkey climbs around to the other side, however, there is one part where he needs to jump from a pipe to a wall and it just doesn't happen.  I've tried everything, from exiting and restarting, to replaying the chapter many times, to exploring first before climbing, and I always get stuck at the same place and just can't go any further.  So, no, I would definitely not recommend the PC version of this game but if you have a PS3 then absolutely get it!			"

												How something so colourful can be so dull is anyones guess but sure enough thats precisely what you get with enslaved.I had hoped for more but at the very least even the story failed to impress and thus make this a jumbled piece of nonsense that quite frankly cant be considered a game.Its an old story revamped to play out in the future where once again we see the cant be controlled monkey be corralled by a mystical headband which in the future is nothing more than certain death while the monk from the story of old is replaced with a woman called Trip. The pair agree a deal to work together to reunite Trip with her people which while forming part of most of the beginning levels is just a rue for yet another AI romance forged through hardship and toil.As for the game aspect their is none, its all go their do this, do that and repeat, repeat, repeat. You get to collect orbs along the way for upgrade purposes but sadly they feel nothing more than a downgrading of skill level rather than a souping up of arsenal which isnt that diverse to begin with.All in all i was unimpressed and find it hard to recommend this game on any point, even when going cheap in a steam sale so its a thumbs down for me this time			"

												Kind of a mixed bag in this game. On the plus side: it looks nice, it's atmospheric and has good acting. On the negative side: the story is kind of thin, the controls are really awkward (very, very much to blame there is the fact it's a direct console port, with no regard for PC controls). What breaks everything for me though is constantly having to fight the camera. Sure, having certain angles makes things more ""cinematic"" like but it really isn't conducive to smooth gameplay if you are at the mercy of odd, switching camera angles that can hit you often at the most inopportune moments. I've lost progress several times just because of that - having to play through the same part of the story (without being able to skip cutscenes) just because the gamemakers decided to sharply rotate (requiring directional adjustment) or completely swap camera angle in high-action spots ruins the game. It's a common mistake made in these kinds of games, unfortunately.Overall? A mediocre, linear platformer with awkward controls, not offset enough by a story but with nice visuals makes this a game that could be enjoyable to watch someone else play (who already knows what to expect) but not to play yourself. It's a decent buy if you can get a big discount on it and don't mind some frustration, but certainly not being worth the full price.			"

												Port isnt that bad, The highest turn-offs were design of the main character, yeah, I wouldn't like it to be a generic dude either but something more like jak and Daxter would fit much better and gameplay is basicly: Solve puzzle which is about going from point A to point B and pressing something, a combat section about fighting same mechs again and again. climbing from point C to D and repeat. Ending was surpsingly good and a pleasant surprise, but it seemed most of the budget went into it and not into the game itself. It's not bad game by any means, but I really didn't enjoy of it and just got bored.			"

												Just no. The controls are so bad. Maybe better on a controller, but on a keyboard forget it. Mouse sensitivity is ridiculous, need it on max for using a turret but near the lowest setting for walking about. And the camera! Jesus! That thing has killed me and has gotten me lost so many bloody times. The camera focusses on Monkey and not the enemy or the jump you need to make or where you are going. Pure idiocy. I died repeatedly on the bridge level because dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥kept getting stuck on the edge of the bridge instead of running straight. Maybe an issue with a keyboard that wouldn't be a problem with a controller, but that chapter ended the fun for me and made the rest a chore. And I hate that annoying, nagging Trip who kills you if you get to far away exploring. And on that, the orb chasing which for some reason, never explained, can upgrade your abilities: extremely tedious. Because of my OCD I completed this game. But I did not enjoy it and I did not get 100% orb collection because this game gets ONE playthrough; no more.And cutscenes and checkpoints. Checkpoints are stupidly far back. On one occasion I decided to restart because I used too much of very scarce ammo, the bloody checkpoint was not the last significant thing I did, but the whole bloody area! And cutscenes are mostly unskippable. Checkpoints often start with a cutscene so you have sit through that annoying crap over and over. The Epilogue is a movie and I needed to go to the bathroom so I pressed esc hoping that it would pause and if not it would just be unskippable; no harm, right? Wrong! That ONE cutscene is skippable and it went straight the credits, which, of course, ARE unskippable. I had to replay the final mission.F U Enslaved: Odyssey to the West!!!!!!!!Easily the WORST game I have played this year. And the story did not do crap to smooth over the gameplay short comings.In case you missed it: I really, really didn't like this game.			"

												Pretty bad.Avoid buying.The designs are sorta good, its like the 3 main characters, a cutscene epilogue, and like 7 variants of recycled mechs. It just falls short.Adaption wise we get 2 and a half character: Tripka is just name, and no adaption beyond that.Combat is pretty bad, hampered by a camera that keeps resetting itself.Combat itself looks okay, but its hampered by bad decisions:-Iframe Finishers just leave monkey standing around for a few seconds after ending them-""Last enemy"" on the screen allows for a cinematic last hit, but you get really tired of the zoom to angry face effect-The 2 bosses that exist is barely servicable. The Gorilla is a stupid game of waiting for cutscenes for the next combat objective-The Dog boss is done in 3 phases: Permastun into health bar, permastun into healthbar 2, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ chase scene on Nimbus-The scropion robot in chapter 14 deserves a special mention: You could at the least have gotten to fought it in a wild Nimbus battle, but no, it doesn't even happen, instead you shoot its 20 weakspots, and wait for cutscenes to finish killing itThe upgrade system is mostly okay, but generally its just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ padding to get you to collect orbs.Most of the upgrades are pretty bad, except for a few mandatory upgrades to avoid drowning in off screen mechs.The auto-platforming is stupidly stiff, and looks silly when compared to better games, like Assassins Creed.Its also the kind of game where Monkey is stupidly agile, but only when the game allows it. Otherwise it feels like controlling a cripple. This is the character we see effortlessy leap 3-4 meters repeatedly, but we aren't allowed to do that, so we have to look for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ highlighted metal beams to half assedly climb on.The flow of Gameplay is pretty bad as well. Generally you start a level with a cutscene, walk a few meters, a very long cutscene, camera warps, a little combat, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cutscene to highlight the autoplatforming. If its a later level, its a autoplatforming segment where you can instantly die, and you never know if Monkey is going to use his fast or slow animations for the movement.And a lot of short segments leads to you waiting for a object to move(door, wall, junk), so you can start doing another auto climb.Chapter 14 promises a mech fight, but it only leads to a extremely♥♥♥♥♥♥series of climbing and fighting the ranged attack camera.The only good mechanic in the game is Nimbus, mostly for freedom of movement. Its still not used anywhere worthwhile.			"

												This is a 3D platformer/action console port.The plot has you escaping as a prisoner, then enslaved by another prisoner and forced to play Enslaved at her bidding.  Basically a ripoff of the legend of the monkey king (right down to the headband). Graphics might have been quite good but the console port is very minimalist - you get little to no fine control over the graphics settings, so jaggies abound.   You're also limited to lower resolutions - nothing past 1080p, which is reprehensible for a game just 3 years old.The biggest letdown is gameplay itself.  Mostly long, boring cutscenes (typical for a console game) and very limited gameplay as you're tunnelled along on this platformer-on-rails.   Control schemes are terrible and barely ported from the limited console controller scheme - you do get some mouselook but not much as the game forces you to look in certain directions - this is extremely frustrating if you're a PC gamer.  Developers need to learn to stop treating the PC like just another console.			"

												Such an overlooked title. Don't miss out on this one. There are so many positives to Enslaved.==================================================================================Visuals-The world & textures are beautiful-The characters are astounding. From the voice acting to the motion capture & facial expressions. The way the characters display emotion is almost unmatched. There are very few games that do this well & this is by far 1 of the best.==================================================================================Audio-Better than average SFX & some really good BGM==================================================================================Gameplay-At it's core, this is an above average hack & slash with entertaining platforming.-As far as escort missions go, Enslaved does it right. Trip is not completely incompetent. She's not overbearing, she will suggest which way to go 1-2 times & then she shuts up. It also doesn't hurt that Trip is gorgeous. She is seriously 1 of the hottest women in gaming history.-Fun boss battles-Collectables for the completionists==================================================================================Story-Is very interesting & not overdone.I bought this twice (PS3 & Steam) and I would happily buy it again if I had to. Well worth it.My only gripe is that Trip's DLC costume is pretty... meh.			"

												What looks initially like a very pretty action game soon shows its roots as a totally vapid console game with direction and A overcoming most of the games 'challenges'. Over an hour in and so far I've been punished for exploring and have used zero skill in getting this far.It was published on PS3 and XB360 in 2010 and while the graphics have aged gracefully, that gameplay is a thing that must be slayed. It's not even a shooter on rails. I would say this is suitable for 5-7 year olds who don't realise that exploration and puzzle-solving are things that humans like to encounter in games.I got this as part of  a Humble Bundle.

												This game could have been much, much more, it had a lot of potential.But they never used it even once. THE GAME IS BORING. It tells you what to do and when to do, it doesn't even challange you in combats. Another big plus is that the plot is forgettable and doesn't really take a good paste even after a four hours or so. Those four to five hours were agonizing to me. I just couldn't get it through. I bought this game so it would make my spare time better, not worse... It's a shame, because this game could have been A LOT more. :/Really, really not recommending this game.			"

												I cannot give this game a fair review as I have only played two hours of it before experiencing a serious game breaking bug. I have gone to greath length to try and solve this issue, but with no luck. Through a Steam forum, I learned that this is an issue others have experienced with this game. Why the developers haven't released a patch for this yet is beyond me and is very frustrating and disappointing. I even tried to reclaim a refund which was later rejected by Steam due to their poor refund policy. I would not recommend purchasing this game on Steam until a patch is released.			"

												Well, this is a very linear story-based game. I very much liked playing through it.On the downside, the game sometimes likes to force a camera angle on you that you don't want, and it also likes to quickly block off the way back or dropping you into a cutscene and when you get out of it you're somewhere else. This makes exploration for collectibles unnecessarily annoying at times, or outright impossible until you replay the chapter.On the positive side, the bosses are not particularly frustrating (I've seen far worse), although the end-fight seems to drag on forever. The story plays along nicely, although the midgame surprise wasn't much of a surprise. And even though your companion isn't doing much she requires no babysitting, and the game generally pulls off a good feeling of cooperation between the two, at least until the third character joins the team.Didn't like him very much, and I think that it might have been a better idea to either provide some control over him as well, or not add him at all. Basically, the game looses the coop-feeling at this stage.In terms of controls, don't expect any platform puzzling. The game doesn't let you make jumps or climbs that aren't meant to happen, Which is probably a good thing, as the checkpoints are spread out rather thin (and, more annoyingly, you don't really know when the last one was. The game tells you with a little icon when it saves, but I generally didn't notice that. "

												I wonder why this game has so much positive reviews!!!Cons:1- It's a game about plattforming but yet you can't die while doing this!2- The game treats you like a kid or a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it gives you all the detalis for what to do and it's not fun at all, there is a major difference between hints and pure solutions!3- You can't skip cutscenes and you have to watch them every time you die or quit.4- You can't change the difficulty after starting the game.5- The gameplay is very basic and the upgrades are worthless because the game is stupidly easy.6- You can't change the camera position most of the time, because the developers think it's the best way to show you where to go and you don't have to look for yourself!7- All plattforms are highlighted, it was ok at the beginning but at mid game it was just stupid.8- The gameplay is not consistent, sometimes the girl can jump and sometimes she needs you to carry her, and the samething applys to Monkey.Overall it doesn't worth its price at all, and I don't consider it as a game at the first place, it's an interactive story just like telltale ""games"" but in this one the story is fixed and you have to press more buttons, I buy games to play them, with this game I wasn't playing at all.4/10			"

A good amount of scenes aren't skippable, and you're often waiting for your AI partner to catch up with you.The environment textures are a bit dated, and the in-game story doesn't excuse the gameplay since there's only a few good moments.

												I wanted to like this game. I tried but this game was unbelievably bad. I'm surprised I don't see any mention of the horrific characterization in this game. As I'm writing this review I have finished chapter 5. Honestly I'm surprised I made it that far without giving up but as I said I wanted to like this game. The controls were terrible specifically the climbing mechanics. I used a keyboard and mouse. The characters were bland and uninteresting, not to mention the fact that monkey doesn't even care about being enslaved. I found this funny in the beginning seeing as ""the complex relationship"" was what they banked on in the description but it didn't take long for that to become annoying. Maybe I might go back to this game later just to force myself to finish it. The only good things about this game are the history to the game and the graphics. If you are someone who likes interesting characters or a halfway decent story, avoid this game.			"

YouTube™ Video: MOB Review: Enslaved Odyssey to the west Premium Edition 

			Views: 233		

			Enslaved Odyssey to the west Premium Edition claims to be an action adventure game, now on Steam, available here http://store.steampowered.com/app/245280/ Join us at Twitter or Facebook if that is...		

Well I am not impressed with the game, from the camera which takes you on a joy ride as if your on a roll coaster, to the lack of depth in combat. Yes the game looks good for the most part, but the story is pretty weak as 80% of the game is jumping from predetermined spots doing acrobatic tricks, that you really cant fail. You spend your time watching your character jump around than anything else, when your not doing that your watching cut scenes, then small fight here and there. The main char is a big dumb ape, who has to protect the helpless little lady, blah. Thanks for your time, for more reviews be sure to check out the sight here  https://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho "

												Well for me I didn't like this game because the main character is kinda goofy.  That wasn't the main issue though, basically I have a problem with the VSync settings because if you put the graphics on high settings, VSybnc is capped at 144 FPS which I don't want, I want 60 FPS.So I chose medium settings and guess what?  It's capped at 62 FPS...  which means you get a big screen tear scrolling down your screen consistently every 2-3 seconds.  UGH!!!			"

												A massively annnoying and predictable jumping puzzle game with horrible controls and a jerky camera system. All other areas are mediocre. I struggled to keep playing. This has been done better with the tomb raider series. I do not recommend. and did not continue playing.Issues with freezing and tabbing out also created more issues that I was not pleased with. Extremely linear.			"

												""Uncharted/Last of Us/Tomb Rider"" like mix.Cons:- predictable story- stereotyped characters- damsel in distress trope (again and again)- repetitive gameplay- camera issues- puzzles are too obvious- some bugs- rendering texture issues on cutscenes (it may be my video driver)- normal difficulty is super easy- didn't feel like finishing the game after chapter 11 (of 14)- no multiplayer (but I really don't care about it)Pros:- it's enjoyable at first 1 or 2 hours- good controls- combat is fine- hoverboard!- very good and undemanding graphics (2013)- good animations			"

												A compelling adventure that suffers from one critical flaw--making you watch the same damn cutscene over again after you die. This becomes especially frustrating in larger areas with longer cutscenes. If you can look past that, you can find a game that features superb artwork and an interesting setting.			"

												This is the first time I've felt strongly enough about a game to write a review and it's based on only about 20 minutes of gameplay: the story is horrible.  The only way I would play this is if I found out that at some point in the game, I get to gruesomely murder the female for what she does to you in the first 20 minutes of the game.  An ""uneasy partnership"", says the game's description; I've never heard enslavement referred to as an ""uneasy partnership"".  I could have excepted that, though, but within half a second of being told that he is now her slave, the protagonist basically says, ""Cool; let's go.""  After spending 20 minutes fighting to escape a slave ship, with this woman actively trying to leave him for dead in her wake, he's suddenly cool with having a slave headband put on that will torture him if he disobeys her or kill him if she dies.  ""I guess I have no choice,"" were his words when she wants him to help her...you always have a choice: fight.  He should have killed her and died free instead of suddenly becoming cool with the idea of being a slave.  With writing like this, I wouldn't have been surprised if they had started having sex before the first hour was done.  I won't be finding out, though, as I've uninstalled the game.  If you don't care at all about the story, you might enjoy this, but if you're a fan of good storytelling, skip this game.			"

												Follow a gripping, surprise-filled journey as two dissimilar characters form an uneasy partnership in order to survive through a perilous, post-apocalyptic America. 150 years in the future, war and destruction have left the world in ruins with few humans remaining and nature having reclaimed the world. Mysterious slave ships harvest the dwindling population and take them out west, never to return. Trip, a technologically savvy young woman has been imprisoned by a slave ship but manages to escape using her mental prowess. Monkey, a strong, brutish loner and fellow prisoner also gets free by virtue of his raw power and brawn. Trip quickly realizes that Monkey is her ticket to freedom and is her only hope to survive her perilous journey back home. She hacks a slave headband and fits it on Monkey, linking them together. If she dies, he dies and her journey has now become his. ENSLAVED centers on the complex relationship between the two main characters. Players take on the role of Monkey, utilizing a mix of combat, strategy and environmental traversal to ensure he and Trip survive the threats and obstacles that stand in the way of their freedom.

												I don't understand why people rave so much about this game, yes it has a very interesting story, but if all I wanted was an interesting story I would read a book. Truth is that the monkey king legend has been used in many many  games so many that even the story is not that original. The legend even includes the head band that pains the monkey king if he disobeys or tries to hurt the monk. the monk is weak and needs to be protected by the monkey king whose weapon is a staff made of celestial metal. so honestly the story wasn't even theirs. The controls just suck donkey gonads. the camera is jerky and blurry. I thought maybe I can decrease mouse sensitivity, it did absolutly nothing. The crashing and freezing almost couldnt make it over a spot because it was time sensitive and the controls werent responding fast enough. Your character can jump huge distances cant step over a  small boulder. It sucks because I really wanted see the story develop but the game mechanics suck so hard that I can play it for maybe 5 minutes before I log off in digust.			"

												Unfortunately this game is a terrible port. It crashes on launch from time to time, crashes when I change the control layout and most importantly it crashes when I load a previous save. Coupled with jerky animations and terrible optimisation I can't recommend it. Especially at it's current price.I waited a long time for the PC release of this because the voice acting and visual design are excellent. It's crying shame that Namco Bandai weren't as enthusiastic about their game as I was and released what is probably the laziest port of a game I've ever paid for and not managed to play.			"

												The gameplay mechanics are very fun. The story is mostly predictable but is well told, and the characters are generic but are well acted and pretty likeable. There are some game-design choices that I personally found annoying and unnecessary, like for example having to backtrack to where a cutscene started (assuimng the characters move during the cutscene) just because there are some collectables back there that are necessary for upgrading yourself and you can't pick them up during the cutscene.There were defintely some points where I thought ""♥♥♥♥ this game"", but overall I enjoyed the experience and would recommend giving it a try			"

												Very enjoyable. Although it took its time coming to PC, we also receive the bonus content and DLC with the base game which is a nice trade off. On release there were quite a few technical problems with certain PC builds, so before purchasing be sure to check the forums/discussions for your parts just to be sure that you won't have any surprises. The game itself is refreshing enough to keep you interested for the 5-6 hour story. The puzzles are about the same that you would expect froma  Tomb-Raider game, and aren't challenging. The story really shines with superb voice acting and deep characters. The gameplay itself is pretty fun too, with combat being fluid and enjoyable. Not a bad way to spend a few hours, but there are better games out there for the money.			"

Gameplay is fun.  Your combat abilities and equipment are upgradable by collecting orbs around the environment.  Another cool feature is the ability to use a hover disc to get around in places.  There is alot of platforming similar to Assassins Creed games, as well.  Overall, this has been one of the better games I have played recently.  Well worth $20.			"

The graphics/art are very nice. I'm not too far in, but on easy, it's nicely paced.  I can see where I might turn the difficulty up a little though.ADDED 1/12: Take the time to do the ini file tweaks.  The resulting visuals are so much better.  It makes the game really pretty.I'm even more impressed with this game as I've passed the halfway mark.  The storyline is really good and while the beat 'em up mechanic remains, light puzzle solving has been introduced.  I am also quite impressed with the method of giving you a tool, getting you used to using it to get through particular situations, taking away that tool and presenting you with the same situation again.  It can be challenging to have to re-think your strategy.I very much recommend this game.			"

												Another underrated (if not mildly flawed) gem by the Ninja Theory folks. The team took what they learned from Heavenly Sword and added in serious gameplay enhancements. The real charm in the game is the story and characters, but the gameplay is far more fun than Heavenly Sword as well. The acting is well done and the facial animation got a lot of love. This is the same team that made the recent Devil May Cry (another I definitely recommend -- and I don't even like the DMC series). They add character to whatever they tackle.

												Beautiful mastered story, though it feels a bit short. Also the prologue wasn't quite what I was hoping for.Still worth every penny. impressive grahpics and fatastic voice overs. Do not skip on the Pigsy storyline its as big as the main one. Very nice surprise, though was sold seperatly as DLC on the console.Inluding the DLC good for about 11 hours on normal mode. Play hard mode or replay to get all the collectables to raise that.Warning: High risk of falling in love with characters ;).			"

												Beautiful console port with likable characters, simplistic but fun console style combat and climbing and a linear but engaging story that keeps you interested. A bit short, but for the story and gameplay it offers it is exactly the right length, any more and it would start to get dull. In other words a welcome little diversion, and such a pretty green apocalypse that makes you want to learn more about the world, with character dynamics that make sense. I found that a gamepad controller gave the best experience as that is what it was designed for. Also quite kid friendly as the violence is confined to smashing robots and playing Monkey makes you feel like a very capable and likable hero with even a few juvenile jokes thrown in.			"

												Cinematic, in a word. I played this with a controller and had no problems, can't speak for M+KB. It took me around 10 hours to finish on Normal, and I wasn't in a hurry, nor collecting every last thing. I'm gonna talk about some things now. It's pretty. The early environments are the lush flavour of post-apocalyptic, with greenery sprouting from concrete and lots of colour. Later on there's a scrapyard where you should pay attention to the background, and some machine-y places that have a lot of working parts, all worthy of sightseeing in. The character designs are very nice, but what really shines is the animation, especially of the protagonist. He feels agile and swift, and there's a real rightness to his Monkey moniker. He's even got a little sash in lieu of a tail, and his idle animations and just how he behaves are so very right. Another animal-themed character later in the game has not quite but close to the same level of polish, but that's fine since he's an NPC and not the center of attention all the time. Cutscenes are very obviously not meant for 1080 playback, but I can forgive it due to the in-game closeups, which feature impressive facial animation and absolutely beautiful eyes. I'm serious, I couldn't stop staring into those limpid pools. It's showing it's age in places nowadays, but I still thought it was pretty and well playable indeed. The gameplay is fun, and many parts are very classic videogamey. By that I mean it's got a lot of things that made me reminisce fondly about ye olden days: Running towards the camera from a deathwall? Non-awful vehicle segments? Turret manning? You betcha, it's got all three and they're all nicely paced and set up. There's always something new and interesting going on, and I wasn't bored or left hanging very often. Some of these segments are remixed a little later in the game, adding another element to what you already know, and I have to praise the pacing and level design for that. A little bit of a collect-a-thon, not quite Banjo-Kazooie levels, but enough to keep obsessives busy for a bit. The chapter select screen provides running totals for each uh, chapter, so that's a welcome touch. The combat isn't particularly nuanced, but there are enough unlockable moves and variations of enemies to keep things interesting. Every so often a new enemy type is added to the pile, and then they start getting thrown at you in interesting combinations and in greater numbers. Simple stuff, but it works so very well. Again, I have to praise the animation department here, as though the moves are somewhat slim, the end of every encounter is marked by a dramatic camera angle and extreme slomo, and though they were all standard attacks, not once was I unimpressed by it. Another point of note is the takedowns, executed by a single button press, but so very violent and satisfying to do that it's worth aiming for them. Of course, there's advantages of doing these to certain enemies, beyond how ultra cool they are, but you can find that out for yourself. There's a lot of ""♥♥♥♥ youuu"" moments when you're finishing off enemies or taking out someone particularly tough, and that's immensely satisfying when you do it right. Also, you can actually roll between their legs and backsmack them, which is the tightest♥♥♥♥♥♥The platforming is... not, really, but that's okay! It's more of a ""follow the glowy bits to get somewhere"", but what it means is the environments can play with multiple levels and verticality and interesting routes without being frustrating. Monkey won't actually fling himself off a ledge unless he can do it safely, so you're free to experiment (by that I mean run around mashing jump) until you find the right route. Think more God Of War than Assassin's Creed, in a nutshell. They're more like some sort of non-QTE than true freedom, but I'm okay with it. There are some timed jumps and other stuff, but mostly it's fun to watch Monkey swing around like his namesake and admire just how acrobatic he is. The story and writing is a little by the numbers, and I expected quite a few of the big reveals, but it's okay because it's not a super duper 11/10 literature game, and it doesn't bill itself as such. The world is cohesive and interesting and the banter between characters is great. Praise upon praise for the voice actors, and also the mocap facial animation, as both really sold some of the moments in the game for me. I'd like to visit this particular post-apocalyptia again, if only to see more environments and ideas that were thrown out there. Cinematic to a tee, there's a lot of stuff that wouldn't feel out of place in a summer blockbuster, and I found that very enjoyable indeed. Trip herself doesn't feel like dead weight, so the devs avoided that pithole pretty well. Some co-op jumping and puzzles where you have to tell her what to do were pretty neat, and I really liked the dynamic between her and Monkey. She's got her own backstory and her own path, and I quite enjoyed her as a companion. Plus, even if she does run slower than you and walk faster, you can always just pick her up and plonk her wherever she needs to be. Or maybe you just want to carry your waifu always, but who am I to judge? In closing: + Pretty environments Great animation Engaging characters An actual plot It was fun! - Camera can be a little claustrophobic Slightly anemic moveset and enemy variation Somewhat predictable plot Lack of sales killed the sequel Is it worth full-game price? I'm not sure. Is it worth the current price, or even on sale? Definitely, if you want a decent campaign run-through, tight gameplay mechanics and a good uh, read? I'm not sure what the word is, but as single-player fighter/platformers with a story go, I thought it was well worth my time.  "

												I finished off Enslaved:Odyssey to the West yesterday.  Overall I found it marginally enjoyable!  After thoroughly enjoying Ninja Theory's work on the DmC reboot, I was excited to come into this, but it's a very different game, and doesn't sport anything close to the highly technical, challenging combat system of DmC.  In fact, to be quite critical for a moment, most of it's gameplay systems felt pretty shallow.  The combat is fairly simple, and the platforming is context-sensitive.  It also does this annoying thing where it litters collectable items in nooks and crannies, items that you want because they'll provide currency to upgrade your character.  This is usually fine, but devolves into the stupid when they're still present during moments of high drama or time pressure in the storyline.  Your NPC companion yelling for help, and you're rooting around in a trash bin in an alley for upgrade currency.I'm also torn two ways on the context-sensitive jumping.  On the one hand, I'm not sure the gameplay would have been enhanced at all with the ability to fall to your death and then having to restart sections of the game.  On the other hand, as you go through yet another sequence of holding directions and tapping 'A', you sort of find yourself wondering what the payoff is.  Certainly it allows you to have more confidence in trying things, because you flat out aren't allowed to if it would mean your death, but it kind of neutralizes any sense of satisfaction about the successfully traversing the level.However its atypical plot, colourful, post-apocalyptic U.S. setting, and service-ably written/acted characters bring it up a bit.  Also it clocks in at a perfect six hours.  Surprisingly, the game was co-directed by Andy Serkis who provides both the voice and mo-cap for the main character, with excellent results.If you want a character action game that's a bit different from the rest, I recommend checking it out.

												This is a great Action/Platformer.  It boasts some of the best characters I've ever seen in games.  Play it in Hard difficulty because the game is otherwise too easy.  The combat is great and provides awesome audio/visual feedback based on your actions.  There are no frustrating jumping puzzles.Pigsy's Perfect 10 is a really well done DLC that provides a fun twist on the core gameplay and you get more Pigsy -- the true hero of the story.Make sure to edit the video settings in MonkeyEngine.ini to get better graphics.

												Play it on hard difficulty the first time through....I played it on normal and never really had any issues.  Even so, I'm playing through again on hard and I've started out with all of the upgrades, plus I get to use the ninja skin Monkey that gives me unlimited ranged ammo.  All in all, it's even easier now, especially since I know exactly what to do.  Yet I'm still playing it again. It's beautiful, it feels good to control.  The combat is satisfying.  The last fight is pretty darn epic.  The story isn't cheesy or forced.  It's just too short and a little too easy.If you haven't heard of this game (which I know many people haven't)  I'd easily say if you can pick it up for under $10, you won't be disappointed in the least.

												I just finished the main campaign...It was awesome.  Great story and characters.  Pigsy is a hoot.  I began to care about the characters; and the story near the end had me on the edge of my seat.  I liked the ending.  The facial animations are very well done.  Character textures are great too.  Gameplay is fun.  Your combat abilities and equipment are upgradable by collecting orbs around the environment.  Another cool feature is the ability to use a hover disc to get around in places.  There is alot of platforming similar to Assassins Creed games, as well.  Overall, this has been one of the better games I have played recently.  Well worth $20.			"

												What can I say?Awesome game. Nice ""western"" take on some eastern (oriental) legendary characters.Below average port from console. Not the best. Definitely not the best. Mind you I have this installed in an SSD hardrive and man does it still have terrible stuck ups during loading, cutscenes, and gameplay. But luckily, in my case, it has not hanged yet. Though its stuck ups sometimes feel like its hanged.Its keyboard and mouse control instructions are incomplete at best. Like its focus attack is activated by pressing the ""E"" and ""F"" keys on your keyboard. Found that out by googling it.And what about its counter-attack being activated by a successful shielding followed by pressing the ""B"" button? Gamepad ""B"" button, not the ""B"" button on your keyboard?Also, its mouse resolution seems to be stuck on high when you are on a turret or carrying a gun.If you can be patient with all these ""distractions"" that a ""not so optimized"" port from console to PC, then, its a good game.

												Enslaved was a really beautiful game with great story telling.  Would recommend at anything under $20.Pros:1)  The voice acting is literally perfect2)  The story is adult, with mature themes that aren't quite as simple as hack/slash.3)  The animation is beautiful, the characters have emotions and you will become attached to them.4)  The environments are GORGEOUS.Cons:1)  With all of that, the gameplay isn't very fun.  It would have been an absolute thrill of a Sci-Fi movie.  It's a thrill of a game to play the story, but the mechanics just aren't there.  Combat is boring and repetitive.  The platforming is unimaginably stale.  Level design is pretty tame.  It's like you're pressing buttons so that you're participating in a cut scene. "

												I saw this game on a ""Best Unreal Engine"" list and had it on my wishlist until I could snag it for $5 during a Steam sale.  After just finishing the game I can say I'm very impressed with it.The game is a few years old so the graphics are not cutting edge but they are beautiful and super smooth on my machine (2500k & 660GTX).  I started out the journey with a keyboard and mouse but switched to a controller after a couple hours and must say it was much more enjoyable to me with the controller and it seems like it was meant to be played that way.  This allowed me to just sit back and get sucked into the game.The game is a 3rd person adventure with a lot of fighting, platforming and a few puzzles thrown in.  The story is pretty generic along the way but there are enough snippets to make you get attached to the main characters (Monkey and Trip) and the ending is really awesome.  I found the fighting and platforming smooth and addictive and could not stop playing.  I played through the game in 2 sittings and spent about 8 hours on it.  I will probably go back and play some more and check out the DLC since I got the premium version.I would not have been disappointed had I spent $20 on it but for it's age and short play time I think anywhere is the $5-$10 range is much more acceptable.  For a genre that has a lot of generic games that rinse and repeat the formula, I thought Enslaved stood out and very much enjoyed it as a whole.  My experience with the game was overwhelming positive and I very much recommend it!!!			"

												""would follow Trip across the wastelands again"" - 8.5/10Enslaved: Odyssey to the West (EOW) is a mixed bag. On the one hand it is  visually stunning, well written, action adventure and on the other it is a lazy port with repetative gameplay.I think it is fair to say that if the two main protaganists and their relationship do not grab you from the start then there is little point you playing any further. If however, like me, you find yourself genuinely enjoying the characters as they struggle their way across some rather lovely post apocolyptic cityscapes then this game is well worth seeing through to the end.The strong points of this game are the main characters (and Piggsy, when you meet him) and they way you have to use both of them to progress. Trip (the girl) is not a playable character but instead functions much the same way as Elizabeth in Bioshock: Infinite. She is on hand to hack doors, climb through small gaps that Monkey cannot, and offer advice on progression. She never feels like a lame duck and having her along for company is  most enjoyable.Monkey himself is a joy to control and even with mouse and keyboard it is easy to perform some precision acrobatics and fighting skills.The world itself is really well presented and there are some wonderful set pieces throughout.Unfortunately it is at this point that many of the games flaws become apparent. Firstly, the camera; it hates you. It wants to b helpful by turning every moment into a cinimatic 'mood shot' but all it does is frustrate and annoy.The combat, though satisfying and responsive, is repetative to the extreme. There is little variety in the animations and moves and the lack of diversity in mobs becomes tedious all to quickly.The puzzle levels are a breath of fresh air after the combat and I would have preferred more of this.The graphics are great when you ar standing still but on the move, even on my gaming PC behemoth, there is screen tear and lag aplenty. Likewise the areas, though very pretty, also become repetative.It is such a shame that the game mechanics get in the way of what is arguably one of the best story driven experiences to have on PC. I do recommend you buy this game (i got it for £3 in a sale, bargain) but i would treat it more as an interactive adventure than  a full game.With a bit more variety and polish this could have been great. The story and character relationship kept me coming back but there is little incentive to revisit.9.4 hours to complete is hardly epic either. "

												While it doesn't bring anything new to the action adventure genre, this game is fun to play through nonetheless. -The story is the perfect mix of sadness and humor, but it does suffer from being a bit predictable. This game has character! All 3 characters that you meet in the game have awesome chemistry and their interactions cover the full range of emotions.-The port over from Xbox hasn't been kind to the game. The in-game tutorials tell you which Xbox button to press instead of which button on the keyboard, and if you're not playing the game in widescreen the visuals are messed up. I got around this by simply plugging in my Xbox 360 controller and reducing my resolution. -The visuals are great. In particular, the facial animations are an absolute joy to watch.I definitely recommend you pick this up when it's on sale if you enjoy a good action adventure game, you have a wired Xbox 360 controller, and are willing to play in widescreen.

												This game has some wired camera issues, but besides this it is a charm. The game often takes control of the camera and you are not able to look around freely. This is kind of annoying but as soon as you stop fighting it the game shows its beauty. It tells its story in a very sensitive way and the gameplay may be described as a mix of Darksiders 1 and Tomb Raider 2013. Trip alone is worth watching and listening. Her beauty in shape and character is amazing ... just a dream. I bought it 3 days ago, play it in hard mode using a mouse and keyboard and enjoy it. The fights are tough, the environment colorful and lively and the story is very lovely. If you enjoy puzzles, finding hidden stuff, challenging fights and a well told story then you should consider buying this game. For me it's a small gem already.			"

												I was a big fan of this game on the PS3 but after an hour or so of playing this game on Steam I am fustrated. It has the option in the game settings for controlling setting but no luck. Steam version of this game is just... not the same.. I do enjoy the story line. for those that don't mind not being able to asign skill points dew to limited actions of the keyboard and mouse then I will give the game a thumbs up.			"

												If you like Beyond Good and Evil style game then Enslaved is far better game, Fighting style awesome, Game story is cool, facial emotions are great and could touch you easily, and finally this game adds lot of humor in last stages with a charachter added similar to the pig in Beyond. I recommend it indeed.			"

												Pros- Great visual graphics and jungle scenary- Gameplay is varied between both traversing and combat- Likeable characters with personalities that have been well thought out by the developersCons- Story is has some plot holes which doesn't get addressed during the game- Combat mechanics can at time feel slightly repetitive- Linear mission structure is predictable			"

												A pain to get running optimally. A lot of guides available for it. Other than that, it's a standard 3rd person brawler with an above-average story. I got it on sale for very cheap and recommend that a purchase comes under $10. Once you get past those qualms, this game can be a next-gen looking game with the right hardware, and it has a ton of fun levels. The fighting has a good amount of depth to keep it from getting boring and the enemy types and platforming sections keep it varied. The pacing is all there and the characters are well-written. I had no idea that Andy Serkis (guy that did like every CGI character since Gollum) played the main character until the end, and that makes a lot of sense.			"

												Another hidden gem, found while rooting trough my library searching for something to play, while I don't have enough money for Nier.IntroductionI have actually been having this game on my radar for years, ever since I saw it on the cover of a danish free gaming magazine. I never really looked into what it was, and was solely interested in it because of the few screenshots/art I saw. I heard about it again when it was ported to PC, and then again when it was in the Bandai Namco Humble Bundle, where I bought it, but I didn't actually play until now. Fun fact: I started playing it because I was playing around with In Home Streaming, and have been playing this game from start to end via that service.Design and world buildingThis I feel is this games strongpoint, although I'd say it's not enterly lacking in all other points. Its some years old now, and it defenitly shows, but I really enjoyed the concepts of the world, from how the mechs took on this very mechanical look with giant cogs, to how characters and the environment is designed. If you are interested in post-post-apocalypse this game doesn't do a bad jobof building a nice world, and designing some cool characters and enemies to inhabit it. With that said, I feel like the standard mechs, were a little out of place, looking slightly too round and designed, but that is entirely my opinion.The giant mech, the leviathan, at the end of the game is very cool. Also loved the design and animation of the guy Trip kills in the very endGameplayThe gameplay is pretty decent character action, which I'm normally not fond of, because I suck major balls at it, but combat felt nice and fun, with (mostly) interesting enemies, and a few button combos. If character action is your jam, this game does a good job. Personally I think enemy variation was very sparse, and could have benefitted by doubling the amount of standard enemies, or at least creating varying looks for them.The end boss was pretty lame, turn valve, shoot stuff, fight adds, shoot more stuff, just kinda boringCharactersHere comes one of the worse points about this game in my opinion. I really liked Monkey's character, though he's the mandatory gruff-guy lead, but he was at least believeable and sensible, also probs to the voice actor he did a great job. Trip on the other hand I found to be a boring onesided stereotypical woman character. As a gameplay element she was cool, but her character was only ""shes the weak woman, also shes smart but we just think shes silly"". I expected her character to evolve more trough the story but I found she stayed pretty much in the same role.Now, Pigsy I really didn't like. He was designed to be comical relief, but was just unfunny, and whole thing with him liking Trip and being jelous at Monkey was cringeworthy at best, and just made him come off as creepy. Pigsy died at the end of the game, and that was supposed to be this hero-death, but it felt a little forced, and I found it hard to really care about him.StoryThe story was pretty okay, nothing great, and I certainly dont expect to remeber it as something great I experienced. I'm glad I played trough the game, but if you are in it to experience a great story, then take a pass, I would recommend playing Bioshock or Half Life 2 for something simillar (typical I know).I saw some people complaining about the end, and I can see where they are coming from, I didn't mind it, but that was only because it was as mediocre as the rest of the story.MusicI don't remeber the music, which probably means it was merely passable, to say something intlligent about it, I'd need to go back and play again, but I can't be arsed.In conclusionI enjoyed the game, it didn't outstay it's welcome, and it defenitly wasn't bad. The gameplay is very competent, and the story is fine, didn't care for the characters much though. If you are looking for cheap-ish character action you wouldn't go wrong with Enslaved. Also if you are looking for cool designs and a nicely designed post-post-apocalyptic world, Enslaved has it for you as well.TL;DR: Competent Character-Action, bland story, bland characters, buy for gameplay.If I were to give it a score I'd give it a very solid 6/10.

												Pluses: good sunny graphic and pretty post-apocalyptic environment. I liked rich story and characters and despite problems with button auto remapping bug, game is very good and interesting.Minuses: parkour was waaay too easy (except when camera rotated at some skew angle and movements needed weird button combinations), enemies were not too hard and different from each other, I really would like if there were more hitting combos.

												The game is quite beautiful, and because of its artistry it ages well.The story is strong, but the female lead is often reduced to an overly emmotional 'helpful damsel'.  Her portrayal could have been much stronger and more independant.  The paralels with the original ""Journey to the West"" myth also seemed mostly superficial until the end, which paid off better than I expected.The gameplay is passable, with good platforming and decent combat.  A lot of missed opportunities.The weak point is the camera, which sometimes fights with you, and sometimes lies to you about where you need to go.  The camera can also be a little jittery sometimes, even with a super high framerate the jumping of the camera sometimes gave me eyestrain when playing for more than an hour.			"

												Frustrating game to review. This game has so much going for it-- stunning art direction, great learning curve and solid combat upgrade system, and decent to good acting and story (a little weak, forced, and abrupt ending imo)-- but the thumbs down (one of my first on Steam) comes from the quality of the PC port. The flaws aren't terribly obvious at first, but the boss battles really expose INCREDIBLY frustrating problems with camera angles,  hit detection and timing.  It's less about skill and timing than it is about ""will the AI cooperate this time (finally)?"" The frustration reaches an apex with the rhino boss chase following its defeat. What should be a simple and fast pod-racer style pursuit is dampened by the seemingly arbitrary environment effects that don't give you a clear reason of why you've slowed down. I haven't played this game on consoles, but I strongly suspect the problem is in the quality of the port, and that many of these problems would go away in those versions.			"

												Saw this game when it came out, I had no idea it was actually good. It plays out kind of like a cross between ""The Last Of Us"" and ""Uncharted""The game features only 3 characters for the most part, the rest of the game taken up by the thousands of ""mechs"" that need to be disposed of. My only personal qualms with the game were that the acrobatic puzzles got to be a little exhausting after awhile (Jump here, climb that, pull that lever, etc.) but these are parts of the game that seemed to be most enjoyed by others.The voice acting in the game was phenomenal with a leading performance by Andy Serkis (Gollum from Lord Of The Rings, you won't realize it's him) as the tough perpetually angry 'Monkey' and Lindsey Shaw holding her own as his reluctant captor. Watching the voices from the trailor for the first time is what convinced me to buy the game and it's what made me play all the way through. I recommend the game just for the voice acting.My biggest grip with this game and one I felt could have improved on the game A LOT, was that there was simply not ENOUGH of the voice acting. The game is chalk full of dialogue and banter, but games like Mass Effect and The Last Of Us have shown us that if you think you have enough dialogue during the ""gameplay"" sections of the game, you should probably just quadrouple it. After playing the game through to the end, I was happy with where the character development ended up at, but more dialogue throughout the game would have improved the plot significantly especially during puzzle sequences... and probably more during the combat ones as well.All in all a great game that I believe only suffered because of the way it looks. The cover art for the game, while appropriate and well put together doesn't do it very much justice in the advertising department as it gives the game a very ""generic"" look and feel when it's far from that. If you like games like Uncharted or The Last Of Us and value excellent voice acting and story paired with ""pretty good"" combat and game mechanics, play this game.			"

												Overall it's a pretty good game. If you know the story of Journey To The West at all, (or Dragonball, which is probably what most people will compare it to) you will see the similarities very quickly.The characters and plot are enjoyable, and the game design itself is beautiful.I found that there were a lot of flaws though, and some really gave me problems during the game.The biggest of these were the controls; the camera, though controllable through a lot of the game, becomes automatic for certain sequences in the game, usually important ones like boss battles. I found myself constantly battling the camera to see what i wanted to see, and ended up dying countless times because it swung around just when i had got it into place, and meant i couldn't see where the giant mech was charging at me.This is exacerbated by the level design. Often the major battles end up being in circular arena-type areas, and when you get close to the edge, it automatically faces outwards, so you can't keep an eye on the boss while you're collecting plasma or health around the edge of the arena. Extremely frustrating.Equally frustrating was the platforming, which i found rigid and fiddly. I don't know if it's down to the port, but i can't remember the number of times i was trying to vault a barrier, jump a gap on the cloud or jump between handholds at speed, and ended up watching as Monkey shook his head in refusal, did a roll instead, or just straight-up dove head first into the hole. There were a few more rage-quits than there needed to be, purely because of clunky controlls.That being said, i played through first time on hard, and the chapters seemed to go from virtually impossible because of the crappy controls and bad camera, to surprisingly easy because of an easy layout and limited number of enemies; it seems like perhaps the difficulty levels weren't successfully executed.In terms of plot, the overall story is compelling, but doesn't quite go deep enough. The ultimate antagonist (Pyramid) is really a non-entity until the very end of the game, you have no real understanding who they are or what they do, and no idea why anyone would even know what they were called or that they existed until basically 3/4 of the way through. All of that said, overall, i would probably give this game a 6.5 in spite of the problems i was having. It really is beautiful to look at, and very atmospheric. It's also super satisfying to watch Monkey and his gigantic arms tear huge machines limb from limb. It has some really funny moments, and the central characters have good chemistry. It could perhaps do with an update to some of its mechanics, but i enjoyed it, and completing the highest difficulty is pretty satisfying after being killed So. Many. Times.I'll probably play the DLCs and other difficulties in the future.			"

												I had previously purchased this in 2014, played it for awhile, and stopped. I only eventually finished the game just today.Prior to the Steam Summer Sale 2014, I had never heard of this game before. The combat and puzzles tend to be a bit lackluster and eventually feel a bit linear. There are some situations where the camera becomes fixed and the viewing angle becomes troublesome, but definitely not a deal breaker.The champions of this game are the story, the character development, and the voice acting. Most probably don't know that the story is loosely based on the Chinese tale, Journey to the West. The environment is such a mystery – a world long after some unnamed apocalypse, where vegetation has reclaimed the once polluted, noisy urban setting. Somewhere in the vast expanse of this world are clues to what’s really going on. There are subtle hints of some place out west, where slaves are taken and never return.The simple yet believable dialogue conveys intriguing moments of real emotion between Monkey and Trip, and combined with their surprisingly human expressions, gives weight and depth to their characters which tends to be rare in videogames nowadays. In addition, the game doesn't seem to give justice behind it's writer Alex Garland (28 Days Later.)The character development would not have been complete without it's voice actors, specifically the protagonist's, whose voice was recorded by none other than the great Andy Serkis.All of the aspects I've mentioned come together in a way that makes Enslaved feel not quite like anything I've played before. Sure, the gameplay in itself isn't exactly original, but by adding substance through characterization, a world full of history, and those small moments that pull you in to the story, it turned out be something quite special.

												Combat: I think the combat is best described as solid. It offers enough attacks and enemy-types to keep you entertained, but it is a bit simplistic. There is really not much more to say about it.Climbing: On the positive side the climbing is very well animated and the sceneries look good. Unfortunately, it is impossible to die. This somehow takes the tension out of the climbing-sections and more than ones i caught myself just mashing the jump button until I hid the correct direction. So climbing is basically a distraction from the action-based combats.Camera: Maybe you wonder why the camera is its own bulletpoint. The reason is: the camera control/movement is awful. The camera is way too close behind the character, there is no lock-on mechanism and most of the time it feels like the camera is delibarately moving away from the enemy you are attacking. In the sum it is near impossible to have an overview of the battlefield or even to aim for one specific enemy. Even most games in the late 90's (when 3D-gaming was something new) had better camera movement than this. Seriously, who ever decided the game can be published with this camera should never be involved in game developement ever again. Yes, it's that bad.Graphics/Presentation: I like that instead of modeling a brownish desert-like wasteland the developers were going for an overgrown-by-plants like wasteland. So everthing looks really nice and colorful. Another thing that has to be mentioned is that the animations are very well done. Especially, the faces of the characters show an impressive amount of emotions.Story: For me it is a mixed back. The overall story is interesting enough and its presentation is, as mentioned before, really good. Unfortunately, the story shifts its tone half way through the story and trys to introduce some goofy/cheesy humour, which imho doesn't work out very well. Another problem is that there are to many cut-scenes in-between the battles. For me it just broke the game-flow if fights are constantly interrupted.Summary: Enslaved is a casual game with a good presentation. Casual here is ment without any negative connotation. So if you are looking for a nice distraction and can live with the atrocious camera behaviour I think I can give a recommendation. Just don't expect too much.			"

												It is obvious they ported this game from console.It is so obvious when you buy an upgrade it doesn't show you its keybord buttons but gamepad buttons even you are playing with a keybord.Monkey is a very athletic man who can jump to only specific places.That restricts you from falling down but most of the time it forces you to find the correct spot to be able to jump.It is not a bad game but I can't really recommend it.

												Actually my opinion is somewhere in between Yes and No. short version is this: it may be alright 5 years ago but it isn't a decent game in 2015, and definately doesn't worth the full price. [ONLY GO FOR THIS GAME IF IT'S ON SALE AND YOU ALREADY HAVE PLAYED DEVIL MAY CRY AND CASTLEVANIA. (EVEN DARKSIDERS1 OR OTHER GOOD GAMES OF THE GENRE)]PROS:+ the story and connection between monkey and trip makes enough motivation to end the game.+ solid voice acting and facial animations of the main charracters makes them very believable.CONS:- graphics (weak usage of UE3, green filtering and poor lighting)- poor artistic level design (usage of same textures and 3d models over and over. and the large areas feels pretty empty and desolated)- poor technical level design (actually this is caused by low variety of materials in the hands of level designers. the result is dull and predictable levels (specially in the second half of the game) and secrets are pretty easy to find)- low variety in enemies and no human enemy in the game (actually there are only 4 kinds of enemies, 1 kind of turret and 4 kinds of bosses. thats all for the whole game)- no kind of combos (unlike other games in the genre like Devil may cry or Castlevania, which I recommend to play, this game lack of fighting combos is very annoying. there is only a light attack and a heavy attack. thats all. thanks to that the fightings are pretty simple and boring)- the ending isn't satisfying.

This super tech expert girl follows you around and you can use her abilities to help sneak around or create distractions. It's a cool game. I couldn't beat it but I might try again in the future.

												Story is not as interesting as the characters who were written and performed very well.  Unlike most of the games where you basically have Mad Max world recreated, Enslaved presents a fresh view on post apocalypitic world where colorful still life dominates. Combat is simple, there is no depth which can be found in games like Devil May Cry. Invisible walls here and there make platforming quite irritating from time to time. DLC with Pigsy is boring, it is like a bad shooter and even worse stealth game.			"

												While it can be fun and pretty the glitches and other flaws make this a hard buy. The audio kept glitching out. Want to get the orbs on the btidge in the minefield in chapter 2? Goodluck finding a way down. This game also features invisible walls designed to keep you on the path. A take one step contol option would have been useful but he always takes a couple of steps getting you killed. Your ""partner"" can decide to kill you without warning if you get too far. Think you've gotten past a hard part? Well think again, because you aren't in control of your saves and the game saves haphazardly, and I've never seen the indicator that it's saving. The command that might call your partner to you is greyed out most of the time even when it's safe. I stepped off a ledge I couldn't climb back up, couldn't call my partner to me received one of the rare warnings she was about to kill me, decided to start from the last checkpoint and found it was on the other side of a long hard battle I had just fought. The gsme has only one save ""slot"". I found the game lost my save once, and you can't choose new game without losing your save. I don't know how I beat the first boss, and if you're too busy fighting the boss to collect the orbs in the boss area, too badd, because you can't go back. they have cut scenes in the middle of battles. I got killed once because I was getting hit while a cutscene was playing. I was in a shop menu when I ALT-TABbed over to something else and when I ALT-TABbed back it was back in the battle. Sometimes monkey will jump or climb over stuff, sometimes he won't. It also seems like they put orbs it nearly inaccessable areas just to taunt you. This game can be fun so I recommend it a little bit if it's on sale but it comes with a lot of flaws you may not want to put up with.This version does not have the TriOviz 3D graphics mode of releases on other platform(s). Also, I was unable to navigate menus at times with the mouse.			"

												Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a fun and enjoyable game if you make certain considerations. It is a beautiful game with some really cool 3D platforming events, though that is its primary strengths. It is not the best action game, the story could have used some work, the combat is simplistic and repetitive. I suppose this all helps to enjoy the visuals.As this is a port, there were some really annoying times when the screen really ""juddered"". First I thought it was my PC struggling to keep up, but other reviews also complained about it not being so streamlined for PC. Mercifully the platforms and levels were expertly designed, so you will never accidently fall of a ledge (which would have been over and over and over had the screen juddering and sticky camera anything to say about it. The platforming is well crafted. As the combat is basically stun stun stun slam, you'll spend more time climbing and jumping than anything else. Every now and then you'll also be able to shoot stuff, but the aiming and mouse sensitivity are horrendous. Set the sensitivity as high as possible. Even then, with the screen juddering, you'll never shoot anything if you cannot help it.The story did manage to pull me in, to make me care about Trip and Monkey, yet the ending could not have fallen flatter had they tried to make Mass Effect 3's ending bad. You sit there thinking, dafuq did I just do all that for??All in all, I reommend this game on a special. Not worth the full price, at least not for the PC port.			"

												Combat: I think the combat is best described as solid. It offers enough attacks and enemy-types to keep you entertained, but it is a bit simplistic. There is really not much more to say about it.Climbing: On the positive side the climbing is very well animated and the sceneries look good. Unfortunately, it is impossible to die. This somehow takes the tension out of the climbing-sections and more than ones i caught myself just mashing the jump button until I hid the correct direction. So climbing is basically a distraction from the action-based combats.Camera: Maybe you wonder why the camera is its own bulletpoint. The reason is: the camera control/movement is awful. The camera is way too close behind the character, there is no lock-on mechanism and most of the time it feels like the camera is delibarately moving away from the enemy you are attacking. In the sum it is near impossible to have an overview of the battlefield or even to aim for one specific enemy. Even most games in the late 90's (when 3D-gaming was something new) had better camera movement than this. Seriously, who ever decided the game can be published with this camera should never be involved in game developement ever again. Yes, it's that bad.Graphics/Presentation: I like that instead of modeling a brownish desert-like wasteland the developers were going for an overgrown-by-plants like wasteland. So everthing looks really nice and colorful. Another thing that has to be mentioned is that the animations are very well done. Especially, the faces of the characters show an impressive amount of emotions.Story: For me it is a mixed back. The overall story is interesting enough and its presentation is, as mentioned before, really good. Unfortunately, the story shifts its tone half way through the story and trys to introduce some goofy/cheesy humour, which imho doesn't work out very well. Another problem is that there are to many cut-scenes in-between the battles. For me it just broke the game-flow if fights are constantly interrupted.Summary: Enslaved is a casual game with a good presentation. Casual here is ment without any negative connotation. So if you are looking for a nice distraction and can live with the atrocious camera behaviour I think I can give a recommendation. Just don't expect too much.			"

												Decent game, the graphics are pretty blurry and it only looks good if you play it with a controller, which means as long as you stay far from the display the ugly textures won't bother you. The clunky controls and camera will get on your nerves halfway through the game when it starts getting harder, but I think overall the story and acting made the game worth playing.The port is not great, there's minimal graphic and control configuration (no remapping!) but at least it runs smoothly.7/10			"

The platforming controls may not be the best in the world (it does work for what the game is), but the story and combat are more than satisfying, and worth going throught the 7-8 hour campaign. 14 chapters of great writing, great level design, and excellently crafted puzzles and bosses.Also, there are sections where you get to ride a hoverboard around over water and through robot junkyyards. Easily the best parts, in my opinion.			"

												3.5/5Got it on the Humble Bundle.  Had heard about it a couple of months ago, torrented it to see if it was worth buying, and ended up deleting it without trying it because I lost interest.  Pops up on the HumbleBundle, so I pick it up with DarkSouls Prepare to Die Edition, and a handful of others, for $10.  I figured it couldn't NOT be worth it, and I was right.  It's very linear, so the story moves along at a nice pace - think SpecOps - The Line [I think that's the name], except with more God of War.  Some of the textures are blatantly scaled for console, and even the intro tells you not to turn off the ""Console"" while the game is saving.Pros - -Sweet animations-Fantastic voice acting-lots of cinematic moments, reminiscent of Uncharted series at times-Gameplay and charater control feels fairly tight*, one thing I've noticed new titles [WITCHER 3 COUGH COUGH] have failed miserably at.*[with the exception of the turrets, and no raw mouse input though I used 360 controller]-It's late, that's all I can think ofCons - -Almost ZERO visual options-motion blur is stuck on, causing nausea at higher fps.  Motion blur works fine for hiding stutter in 30fps, but 60fps makes it look like you're drunk and nauseates.-Several crashes in the first 2 Chapters, freezing on loading, and bugs where the environment failed to load, and my character fell into infinite abyss.That's basically it, other than that it's a really fun game with an intriguing story line and dynamic environments.

												Wanted to play Enslaved for years, ever since it came out. Didn't really live up to my teenage expectations but still a decent game. Gameplay is in general responsive and fun; it really feels like you're jumping around giant mechs in this distopian world. It is however quite linear as it's segmented into chapters which play from A to B with the same mechanics. It did feel repetative at times which is why I didn't play this game in one go, even though it is entirely possible given the 10h story. Just was more fun playing in 2h burst to me, since the chapters switch as followed:  Parkour - Melee - Shooting Range - Boss Fight.The story is a nice take on the Journey to the West. I liked the post-apokalyptic setting and the animation as well as the charakters grew on me... expect of Pigsy... oh god, he's just so repulsive...It has its ups and down, pretty generic and to me littered with a lot of outdated sensibilities but the quieter scenes and especially the two protagonist and their performance did sell it for me. The ending was very sudden, would have liked a bit more build-up but as I said, all in all it's still a solid story. If you're in for a action packed Hollywood story and decent gameplay I guess I would recommend it. Give it a go when on sale or not if that prior scentence really spoke to you. PS: There's a second game included which stirs up the gameplay and ups the stealth. Haven't played through that yet but until now it's quite okay. Still not very fond of that game's protagonist though...			"

												This game is beautiful, but very simplistic.The NPC companion will literally nag you to do everything, even obvious things like flip switches. The game UI also assumes you constantly forget what button to press to interact with things, or won't know what direction to go without big glowy signs. Sure, jumping and climbing through the environment looks cool, but it's all button mashing and it's virtually impossible to fall off ledges or fail in any way (you need to push a button to drop off a ledge even if you want to -- and you can't actually jump very high unless there is a pre-set acrobatic handhold already there for you to look fancy using). Interacting with your NPC companion has a couple interesting ideas (like being able to distract enemies and direct them to cover in firefights) but she's mostly just hysterical baggage with plot-important hacking skills. Combat also has more options / upgrades than it actually needs, since it's mostly button mashing since enemy AI is fairly dumb. No point in a game trying to have special attacks or tactics if the gameplay itself doesn't require them.This is the typical AAA mash-button-get-cutscene video game -- lots of style and narrative but weak on actualy gameplay substance. It can be an enjoyable timekiller / interactive movie, since the setting and story are interesting, but as a game it's fairly mediocre.			"

												For $5, it's a great ride! The story and gorgeous environments are what make this game shine.  However, if you're looking for deep gameplay or replayability, look elsewhere. Linear platformer with combat and puzzle solving. Pros- Gorgeous environments- Engaging story, characters, and excellent voice acting- Twist ending- Modern near-AAA platformer (a rarity in this generation of games)- Upgrade tree (if a bit shallow)- Boss Fights (call me old fashioned, but I like this)Cons- Shallow gameplay (it's no button masher, but definitely not complex)- Lack of enemy variety- Zero replayability (definitely story-driven, no multiple endings or changes for multiple playthroughs.)- Weak DLC- Some minor graphical issues (banding) in certain cutscenes when played at 1080p. Can be easily fixed and only a little distracting. Overall a great port.)			"

												This looks like it could be a pretty decent adventure game except for some iffy shadow striping which is retentively easy to fix and some over zealous camera work which isn't. It's a shame the camera and control are yanked away from you so often because otherwise I'd recomend this game.			"

												9.5/10As a third person action game, you need a controller. Without a controller it can be frustrating. But if you have one...This game is a masterpiece. Why? Because it has a great story to tell, one of the bests. It has nice gameplay (with a controller of course). Visually it's gorgeus. Lead characters; Monkey, Trip and Piggy cannot be forgotten for very long time. In short terms, it is a blast, a game that everyone should play. Story and gameplay is awesomely mixed, every second of the game has something to do or tell. You cannot be bored.Doesn't this game have a flaw? Yes, it does; camera. It can be frustrating at sometimes but it doesn't affect negatively overal score.It is a must-buy game!			"

The platforming and clambering is a little simple, and occasionally it's a little unclear where the next objective is, but the setting grabs you from the first level, and the interaction between the two main characters is very well acted. I got a bit of an Ico feel from it. Also, the main character Monkey is played by Andy Serkis, who was King Kong, and the head honcho chimp in the Planet of the Apes movies.

												Wonderful! It is a loss that games like this go under the radar, it is fun to play and I had a very enjoyable experience. Though it isn't long (I finished it in about 12 hours), it is rewarding to acomplish the goal of the story. It felt like a movie, a sci-fi/fantasy one, the main character didn't feel shallow, he is a barbarian but not a savage. It is a good adventure/action game, and the end of the story was a real surprise to me.You can play with keyboard and mouse, but it is easier to do with a controller. Graphics are not the best (and shadows look bad on cinematics), but that doesn't carry you away from the action nor from enjoying the game.Not all the people like hack & slash games, or console ports, I usually play other type of games, but I'm happy I bought this one, I bought Enslaved on discount, but now that I finished it I would have paid more for it.Added bonus, the female character is very pretty :P			"

												Another underrated (if not mildly flawed) gem by the Ninja Theory folks. The team took what they learned from Heavenly Sword and added in serious gameplay enhancements. The real charm in the game is the story and characters, but the gameplay is far more fun than Heavenly Sword as well. The acting is well done and the facial animation got a lot of love. This is the same team that made the recent Devil May Cry (another I definitely recommend -- and I don't even like the DMC series). They add character to whatever they tackle. If you enjoy platforming/action/adventure titles, give this one a go.			"

												First off I'm going to say...this game is gorgeous. The attention to detail really shows. The story is intriguing and voice acting is believable. The combat is done well and I like the incorporation of parkour in the game. The lack of open world is a minus since the environment in the game is so massive. It just begs to be explored. When played with a mouse and keyboard you do run into wonky camera controls which can sometimes hinder combat so I highly recommend using a controller. Not a completely ""mindless"" game since there are some bits of puzzle solving but very entertaining none the less.			"

												I originally played this on the Xbox 360 when it came out a couple of yeara ago. Thought it was very underrated by the press at the time and never sold as well as it should. Brilliant that;s it's finally been released on the PC, a definite purchase.The game follows the original story that the 70's tv series Monkey did, although set in an apolocoilyptic future where mechs have taken over. You follow Monket and a young women called Trip (Tripitaka in the original tv series). togetehr you have to navigate througha derelict but beautifully overgrown New York city and beyond. The graphics are truly beautiful if a little dated by today's AAA titles but certainly good enough to give the right feel to your journey.Thouroughly recommend this title, especially at the very low price it is on Steam (origainlly paid £40 for the Xbox version!)

												Шикарнейшая игра, прохождение которой на ПК вызывает зависть к тем, у кого есть консолька и они сделали это еще в 2010. Отличное приключение, потрясающие виды заросшего постапокалиптического Нью-Йорка, талантливейший Энди Серкис в роли главного героя (если вы понимаете, что может этот мужик с технологией Mo-Cap), просто чумовые персонажи (хоть их всего трое) и диалоги между ними. Рекомендую всем  и в срочном порядке, играется крайне бодро и проходится запоем. И искренне жаль, что в свое время такая игра провалилась на рынке из-за недостатка рекламы, и еще больше жаль - что это никого ничему не научило, и на ПК ее выпустили одновременно с таким распиаренными гигантами, как Batman: Arkham Origins и скорый Assassins Creed 4.

Gameplay is fun.  Your combat abilities and equipment are upgradable by collecting orbs around the environment.  Another cool feature is the ability to use a hover disc to get around in places.

Even so, I'm playing through again on hard and I've started out with all of the upgrades, plus I get to use the ninja skin Monkey that gives me unlimited ranged ammo.  All in all, it's even easier now, especially since I know exactly what to do.  Yet I'm still playing it again. It's beautiful, it feels good to control.  The combat is satisfying.  The last fight is pretty darn epic.  The story isn't cheesy or forced.  It's just too short and a little too easy.If you haven't heard of this game (which I know many people haven't)  I'd easily say if you can pick it up for under $10, you won't be disappointed in the least.

												Enslaved: Odyssey to the West as an action/adventure platformer developed my Ninja Theory. Not being a very well known developer, this release was quite a surprise, and a delightful one if I may say myself.At first glance, Enslaved appears to be quite an obscure release, with no major first party push or advertising. However, while it may lack a bit of polishing, it does contain strong mechanics, a great script, fantastic voice acting, and also a unique look to make Enslaved quite a satisfying package.Set on a post-apocalyptic Earth, you play as Monkey, a loner who grew up in the wilds. After being captured by Slavers, Monkey is freed in the midst of another prisoner's escape. After crashing, Monkey finds himself enslaved by a young woman named Trip. Binding Monkey's fate to her using a control headband. She demands his aid to take her back home. With the control headband on, if she dies, so does he. And so the journey begins...The colour palatte is well placed with mostly greens and browns to show the once cityscape, being taken over by lush vegetation. The character design is quite good and definitely very unique. The characters (particularly monkey) being based off of Chinese fables of the Monkey King, mixed with a futuristic setting makes for an interesting character set, and with the well done voice acting, makes for a satisfying game.In relation to actual gameplay, there can be some hiccups. Such as some graphical issues here and there, and sometimes framerate drops. Luckily they aren't too common. Console versions are quite solid, but the PC port's keyboard and mouse controls are quite terrible, and it is very much recommended you use a XBox Controller.Even though there are some small graphical and mechanical mishaps, Enslaved's fighting mechanics and platforming is quite exceptional. With the mix of some basic teamwork with Trip, and some puzzle solving here and there, it definitely makes for a fun experience, although quite linear. The combat is solid, although at times can be a bit boring.The game can most likely be finished in 10-11 hours although with the Premium addition, there is an extra campaign where you get to play as Pigsy, another character within the game, which may add another couple hours, and has some new mechanics to keep the gameplay interesting. The best part is definitely the unique story, and characters to go with it. The voice acting and facial animation keeps you captivated and invested in the characters. Even with its many flaws, it is definitely a welcome addition, and brings sometihing fresh to the gaming industry. If you can look past its flaws, Enslaved might surprise you...Story: 8.5/10Graphics: 8/10Voice Acting: 9/10Gameplay: 7/10Overall: 8/10			"

												I finished off Enslaved:Odyssey to the West yesterday.  Overall I found it marginally enjoyable!  After thoroughly enjoying Ninja Theory's work on the DmC reboot, I was excited to come into this, but it's a very different game, and doesn't sport anything close to the highly technical, challenging combat system of DmC.  In fact, to be quite critical for a moment, most of it's gameplay systems felt pretty shallow.  The combat is fairly simple, and the platforming is context-sensitive.  It also does this annoying thing where it litters collectable items in nooks and crannies, items that you want because they'll provide currency to upgrade your character.  This is usually fine, but devolves into the stupid when they're still present during moments of high drama or time pressure in the storyline.  Your NPC companion yelling for help, and you're rooting around in a trash bin in an alley for upgrade currency.I'm also torn two ways on the context-sensitive jumping.  On the one hand, I'm not sure the gameplay would have been enhanced at all with the ability to fall to your death and then having to restart sections of the game.  On the other hand, as you go through yet another sequence of holding directions and tapping 'A', you sort of find yourself wondering what the payoff is.  Certainly it allows you to have more confidence in trying things, because you flat out aren't allowed to if it would mean your death, but it kind of neutralizes any sense of satisfaction about the successfully traversing the level.However its atypical plot, colourful, post-apocalyptic U.S. setting, and service-ably written/acted characters bring it up a bit.  Also it clocks in at a perfect six hours.  Surprisingly, the game was co-directed by Andy Serkis who provides both the voice and mo-cap for the main character, with excellent results.If you want a character action game that's a bit different from the rest, I recommend checking it out.

I tried various resolutions, and some where better than others, but largely the mouse does not line up correctly with any of the menus.

												Good game but rather short. Count on about 10-12h to finish it.The story is quite classical but the end is very reminiscent of old SciFi movies. Gameplay is console-type, with combat from a gamepad, with possible combos/chains. Character development is nil aside from upgrading your attacks.You actually only get to play Monkey and you have a limited control, only occasionally over Trip.There is no real choice and no sotry branching. The rare decision you have to make is ""do I try to sneak those mech or do I rush and fight them ? ... considering sneaking them will likely fail and I will end fighting them anyway ?""Special mention to the crashes during chapter transition. It happened to me four times. Fortunately, it crashes *after* saving your chapter completion. But it's still annoying.So why did I like it ? The visual are real nice. The post-apo world has its own identity, the feeling of having survivors tracked by relentless mechs, slavers. I actually enjoyed the two main characters. They are cute on their own, strange way.The game is built like you would watch an action movie. The story unfolds, you are going through it. Objectives on timer are probably the most entertaining because you have to do it fast. Combat against bosses is also entertaining because you never have to simply bash through a bag of hitpoints (you actually can't defeat them that way), there is always something to defeat them, strengthening the ""action movie"" aspect.The story is finally well summarized by the title : a journey to the west. Which is a promise to find answer, or to get revenge, to give sense to all of this.It's good entertainment while not stellar. If you can grab it at a low price, on sale, it's worthy.			"

												Pluses: good sunny graphic and pretty post-apocalyptic environment. I liked rich story and characters and despite problems with button auto remapping bug, game is very good and interesting.Minuses: parkour was waaay too easy (except when camera rotated at some skew angle and movements needed weird button combinations), enemies were not too hard and different from each other, I really would like if there were more hitting combos.

												Great Game!  It really is just a good time.  Once you get it sorted out, it's also very playable with a mouse and keyboard.  I really think everyone should play this game, because although it has a story, it really is a very fun excuse to do acrobatics and hit stuff!BTW, Steam, why do you tsay suddenly I have 5 hours on record?  How did I finish the game, which takes a minimum of 12?  How did I get hald the achievements?  Unbelievable.			"

												Another hidden gem, found while rooting trough my library searching for something to play, while I don't have enough money for Nier.IntroductionI have actually been having this game on my radar for years, ever since I saw it on the cover of a danish free gaming magazine. I never really looked into what it was, and was solely interested in it because of the few screenshots/art I saw. I heard about it again when it was ported to PC, and then again when it was in the Bandai Namco Humble Bundle, where I bought it, but I didn't actually play until now. Fun fact: I started playing it because I was playing around with In Home Streaming, and have been playing this game from start to end via that service.Design and world buildingThis I feel is this games strongpoint, although I'd say it's not enterly lacking in all other points. Its some years old now, and it defenitly shows, but I really enjoyed the concepts of the world, from how the mechs took on this very mechanical look with giant cogs, to how characters and the environment is designed. If you are interested in post-post-apocalypse this game doesn't do a bad jobof building a nice world, and designing some cool characters and enemies to inhabit it. With that said, I feel like the standard mechs, were a little out of place, looking slightly too round and designed, but that is entirely my opinion.The giant mech, the leviathan, at the end of the game is very cool. Also loved the design and animation of the guy Trip kills in the very endGameplayThe gameplay is pretty decent character action, which I'm normally not fond of, because I suck major balls at it, but combat felt nice and fun, with (mostly) interesting enemies, and a few button combos. If character action is your jam, this game does a good job. Personally I think enemy variation was very sparse, and could have benefitted by doubling the amount of standard enemies, or at least creating varying looks for them.The end boss was pretty lame, turn valve, shoot stuff, fight adds, shoot more stuff, just kinda boringCharactersHere comes one of the worse points about this game in my opinion. I really liked Monkey's character, though he's the mandatory gruff-guy lead, but he was at least believeable and sensible, also probs to the voice actor he did a great job. Trip on the other hand I found to be a boring onesided stereotypical woman character. As a gameplay element she was cool, but her character was only ""shes the weak woman, also shes smart but we just think shes silly"". I expected her character to evolve more trough the story but I found she stayed pretty much in the same role.Now, Pigsy I really didn't like. He was designed to be comical relief, but was just unfunny, and whole thing with him liking Trip and being jelous at Monkey was cringeworthy at best, and just made him come off as creepy. Pigsy died at the end of the game, and that was supposed to be this hero-death, but it felt a little forced, and I found it hard to really care about him.StoryThe story was pretty okay, nothing great, and I certainly dont expect to remeber it as something great I experienced. I'm glad I played trough the game, but if you are in it to experience a great story, then take a pass, I would recommend playing Bioshock or Half Life 2 for something simillar (typical I know).I saw some people complaining about the end, and I can see where they are coming from, I didn't mind it, but that was only because it was as mediocre as the rest of the story.MusicI don't remeber the music, which probably means it was merely passable, to say something intlligent about it, I'd need to go back and play again, but I can't be arsed.In conclusionI enjoyed the game, it didn't outstay it's welcome, and it defenitly wasn't bad. The gameplay is very competent, and the story is fine, didn't care for the characters much though. If you are looking for cheap-ish character action you wouldn't go wrong with Enslaved. Also if you are looking for cool designs and a nicely designed post-post-apocalyptic world, Enslaved has it for you as well.TL;DR: Competent Character-Action, bland story, bland characters, buy for gameplay.If I were to give it a score I'd give it a very solid 6/10.

Interesting story and characters, engaging combat system, beautiful graphics will not leave you indifferent. ENSLAVED is a very interesting depiction of the novel Journey to the West by Wu Cheng'en.

All in all while it does have its kinks you will find yourself fall in love with the beutiful and suprisingly colorful scenery of this post apocolyptic wasteland.			"

												Not far into the game yet but I love how it's set up. You have to get used to controls but once you do, it's much fun. The game is based on a Chinese novel (which I haven't read yet). Maybe that's the reason why the world simply works out great. But maybe it's also the lovely made characters or the beautiful and dynamic (stress is on dynamic) level design. It's a shame it took me four years to notice the game at all!			"

												This game is AWESOME! A great adaptation based on the book 'Journey to the West'. Great Characters and development. It was a shame that this game really didn't get the notice or the props it deserved. It is one of the most wonderful stories told in computer games. The tale of Trip and Monkey takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where they must escape to Trip’s home. Bound together they must learn to survive each other and with each other as they cannot survive alone. Traversing the environment is a mix of puzzle and platforming that requires the pair to work together or die.Right NOW it's $5. $5 fracking dollars! Do yourself a favor and get it. Beautiful, thoughtful and full of personality and fun, this game is most definitely in my top 10 Favorite games of all time. "

												Enslaved – Odyssey to the WestEnslaved is one of the most underrated games ever. I really have no idea why this game  performed poorly sales wise. The only thing I can think of is that it was inadequately promoted – Namco Bandai pretty much acknowledge that too.Anyway don't let the fact that you heard little about it put you off - I can tell you it really is a great game - one of the best games I have ever played IMHO.


Enslaved Odyssey to the West -- Premium Edition - PC   The Escape 
A Video of 
By: SnQQpy

			Enslaved Odyssey to the West - PC - Cutscene Shadow Fix This a long video that includes all of Chapter One. The main reason for doing the video was to highlight the Cutscene Shadow Fix that I implemented All settings...		


The game was loosely based on a Chinese Novel but differs from the the original story which set a fantasy version of ancient China, to a post-apocalyptic world some 150 years in the future where human existence is sparse and hard. Only scattered residues of humanity remain but left over war-mechs roam the land, still active from the previous global conflict. The plot revolves around Trip (Tripitaka) a captured slave (and tech wizard) who forces the help and protection of a warrior type 'Monkey', who himself is enslaved. They both escape a sabotaged slaver air-ship and 'Monkey' the protagonist you play as, quickly finds himself at the mercy and control of Trip. Incidentally 'Monkey' is excellently voiced and performed by Andy Serkis (of Gollum fame) who was also Performance Director on the project. In fact all characters in this game are outstandingly portrayed and consequently very believable, this adds to the immersion of the game and story.Anyhow, you discover Trip is wanting to return to her remote community and requires nay needs Monkey's help to get her there. There's an important twist here, as Monkey, you have little choice in the matter - you can discover the detail of why for yourself – and you are tied to her in an interesting way. You find that you often have to piggy back her to difficult to reach places and physically throw her to ledges and across gaps. Its sounds strange but its actually a neat mechanic. My small beef was there ought to have been even more requirement to control and this would have enhanced the experience and tightened the relationship you have with them as characters. I would also have preferred that you could have had an extended command structure both ways but like I said it is a minor niggle.The fight mechanism is quite extensive and there were many ways I found to complete tasks and defeat enemies and the overall feel was rewarding and that goes for the Boss Fights too. While the story and scope to explore is limited it never really felt that way as in certain areas you had quite a bit of freedom to do things in your own style. Anyway visually, its great to look at too and all movement and animations are solid and fluid. For me, after only a short while you easily get to grow to like these characters and there's a real affinity you get for each of the characters plight.I highly recommend this game and if you happen to see it in Steam Sales, I suggest you get it. I'm sure you wont be disappointed!			"

												So i finished the game a few minutes ago and ive gotta say i was relatively impressed. not the greatetst console port ever made but it definitely was worth the 5 bucks i paid for it.Pros- great graphics-good gameplay , doesnt feel stale and nasty after sitting at it for an hour or so.- OK story, wasnt super awesome, but that may have to do with the act that i generally pla vdeo games with hte sound off so i cna watch tv shows. this game had teh sound of fringe going to it. -free running is always awesome-Awesome homage to an awesome tv show, even if it has been done eredone and reedone some more a million times. (Monkey if you didnt know)-some hilarious dialogue between monkey and pigsy. ""get your hadn off my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; alawys wins a few laughs (no sound but always play with subtitles)Cons-Crazy short. way too short. even the DLC (which comes for free with the game was super short)-horrifying camera angles- No Sandy (pls let me know if there is somethign i missed)- ending was super lameSPOILER!!kill giant scorpion and find out you acutaully are teh bad guy, credits.All in all a very decent game, very pretty and good gameplay.7.7/10 "

												Ok. I have to agree with so many others. This game has great visuals and a really cool story line. Get it quick for $5.00! Best $5.00 I've spent in awhile. (Personally, I think it's worth $19.95, too!The controls took a little while to get used to. There is a tendancy from other games I've played to keep trying to look in certain directions. This game wants you to see things from the perspective they place on you. I mean, sometimes when you are running in a direction, the point of view will suddenly change, which can be momentarily disorienting. I loved the game. I was sick this week and this helped me get through.			"

												While it doesn't bring anything new to the action adventure genre, this game is fun to play through nonetheless. -The story is the perfect mix of sadness and humor, but it does suffer from being a bit predictable. This game has character! All 3 characters that you meet in the game have awesome chemistry and their interactions cover the full range of emotions.-The port over from Xbox hasn't been kind to the game. The in-game tutorials tell you which Xbox button to press instead of which button on the keyboard, and if you're not playing the game in widescreen the visuals are messed up. I got around this by simply plugging in my Xbox 360 controller and reducing my resolution. -The visuals are great. In particular, the facial animations are an absolute joy to watch.I definitely recommend you pick this up when it's on sale if you enjoy a good action adventure game, you have a wired Xbox 360 controller, and are willing to play in widescreen.

												A pretty good game with a compelling story and a great twist at the end. However I wished the combat was a bit more deeper rather then ´´press X to light attack and Y to heavy attack´´. Still, give it a try when it is discounted.			"

												While it doesn't bring anything new to the action adventure genre, this game is fun to play through nonetheless. -The story is the perfect mix of sadness and humor, but it does suffer from being a bit predictable. This game has character! All 3 characters that you meet in the game have awesome chemistry and their interactions cover the full range of emotions.-The port over from Xbox hasn't been kind to the game. The in-game tutorials tell you which Xbox button to press instead of which button on the keyboard, and if you're not playing the game in widescreen the visuals are messed up. I got around this by simply plugging in my Xbox 360 controller and reducing my resolution. -The visuals are great. In particular, the facial animations are an absolute joy to watch.I definitely recommend you pick this up when it's on sale if you enjoy a good action adventure game, you have a wired Xbox 360 controller, and are willing to play in widescreen.

												Good game with fantastic visuals of a post apocalyptical world. Puzzle solving from easy to mild difficulty. Plays great with controller. Fantastic voice over work.Sometimes the shading was off durring cut scenes. Very unrealistic action, however it didn't bother me much. This wasnt very challenging to play, and not much replay value, yet still well worth buying when on sale!			"

												This for me has been a hidden gem, I knew nothing about this game other than a friend had played it and said she had enjoyed it.First let me say if you like platformers with a hack and slash feel then this game is for you, if you like well developed charicters then this game is for you, if you like post disater/apocalyptic then this game is for you if you like games that are well written and have a good story then this game is for you.So far I have found only a few bug bears with this game.1 You need a game pad, keyboard and mouse just wont cut it.2 The fixed point camera that comes in to play at certain points can and does cause some issues especially when you get disorianted and Monkeys control band kills him.3 No manual save, game saves at fixed points4 Some Graphical GlitchesSaying that No game is perfect and these for the most part are dealable once you get used to them.I recomend adding this title to your collection.

												Wow only on chapter 5 and I'm extremely satisfied. A linear game that offers great characters, amazing scenery, and a whole lot more. It feels like I am Goku from the Dragonball series (play it and you'll see why). **I have only played 2hours so far so my review is solely based off of what I have seen so far** 8/10 Graphics 10/10 Artistic styleGameplay is simplistic and the ""boss""(unsure if there are more boss battles or if there just stronger enemies) battles are strategic, makes me feel like I'm playing a classic PS2 game eg. Ratchet and Clank, Jak and Daxter etc. On occasion you can get slighty stuck on a peice of the environment causing you to take unnessessary damage. The fighting is alot of fun, smashing enemies around with your pole. It's not so easy that you can just mash, enemies do block so you have to be stategic about when you attack, aswell as having to dodge the enemies attacks. 9/10 Gameplay 8/10 FightingStory is somewhat cliche but still enjoyable and the chemistry between the two characters draws you in. 8.5/10 Story 9/10 CharactersThe graphics arent amazing but the game is still very good looking. The atmosphere is interesting, doesn't always feel like a post apocalyptic world with the vibrant colors, but the ruins of buildings and roads makes it feel like it. 7.5/10 Atmosphere 8/10 Graphics 10/10 Artistic styleFINAL THOUGHTS: If you're looking for a nice game with good story and enjoyable characters pick up this game!

												Absolutely wonderful game. It takes a lot to get me to stick with a game, but this one had me glued to it so much I finished it in a single sitting. The character developement was, in my opinion, very well done. The gameplay COULD have been done a bit better, but it's not that bad. The scenery was beautifully breathtaking, from New York, the the mountains, to a rusty old factory it was very addicting to look at (so was Trips behind). My only realy complaint is I just don't feel satisfied with the relationship between Monkey and Trip, and I know I'm not the only one who wanted to see them grow romantically. I am greatly saddened when I looked up to see if there ever would be a sequel and learned they would not be making one, due to the fact this game just didn't sell, and I'm really surprised it didn't. Overall I really enjoyed this game and I crave more, but there is none left for me to experience, save the thought of Monkey finally making a move on Trip. All in all, it's in my top 10 favorite games and I VERY highly suggest buying this game, it would be a crime not too.			"

												I had never heard of this game before I recently saw it on sale for $5. It seemed to have a generally warm reception and looked fun enough, so I picked it up. Turns out, I didn't regret it.I liked the developing dynamic between Trip and Monkey. She can be a tad annoying at times, always asking you for help to cross a gap, but it didn't bother me too terribly much. Andy Serkis is great at being grumpy as Monkey. Dialog is actually not bad between the two characters, and some moments between the two really felt genuine.Gameplay-wise, I had a lot of fun. Monkey is a beast in combat, with a number of upgrades to add more moves to your arsenal like counters, etc. The camera can tend to be a bit wonky at times, but I, personally, only had minimal trouble with it in actual combat. The climbing controls felt pretty good, as you could just leap to the next handhold in the middle of leaping to the current one, so it felt smooth...didn't have to wait for his mounting animation to finish on horizontal poles, etc. The enemies are varied enough to keep things interesting at any given moment; some will have shields, some are ranged, some stun you...each of which you have to take a bit different approach to get them vulnerable.The story length and pace feel right; not too much sidetracking. Took me about 6 total hours to beat the first time. I did feel that the end of the game was a bit abrupt, and not showing what happens after the fact (furiously trying to avoid spoilers) was a bit disappointing, but I still liked it well enough. The climactic fight was well done in making you feel that it was the end...epic and all that.Overall, I do recommend this game. I've seen worse PC ports of console games, and I really did enjoy myself playing it. I give it a score of 8/10			"

												Finished Enslaved today, Nov 19th, 2014, and I will tell you.   This game had moments where it frustrated the heck out of me.  Not due to anything other then simple mechanics of the game that took me awhile to get use to.   That's not to say the game was difficult, but my only play through was on the hardest setting and i had moments where i definately wish i would have chosen an easier setting.   Now that im done ♥♥♥♥♥ing... ""The game.""  The game was fantastic, a real action filled adventure that never bored me for a second.   Great story, beautiful scenes, landscapes and maps, just purely enjoyable.   It was such a good game it almost shamed me that I only became interested when it was on sale.   One of those games that didn't catch the attention it merits.   If you are on the fence with this title, don't be.   Its worthy of its sleeper hit title.  A true masterpiece.  Get it!			"

												A good game. The story is pretty interesting and the characters are memorable. The world is visually attractive. The gameplay reminds me of a cross between Uncharted, meets God of War, meets the Last of Us, with a fairly timing oriented hack and slash melee combat. The climbing mechanics look almost identical to an Uncharted game, which is a good thing in my opinion. You have an upgrade system which adds a little more replayability to the game. The premium edition comes with a whole seperate story-line with completely different game mechanics to really change things up as well as some unlockable buffs to the main story.My biggest issue with the game, would be that the controls don't seem very optimized for mouse and keyboard. They're perfectly functional as I played the entire game using only the mouse and keyboard, however the mouse acceleration is a little funky and the some of the game's context menus on give button combinations in terms of an Xbox controller rather than mouse and keyboard. If you're ok with using a controller, then you'll have no complaints however. The camera angles were the second biggest issue, with some scene forcing you into somewhat awkward camera angles which could make doing certai nthings difficult. 95% of the game however, most of the camera angles were fine in my opinion.

												I love this game!  Or perhaps the story and visuals more than anything else.  The camera sucks, and fighting can get repetative but the story, the growing relationship between Monkey and Trip, the artwork...Its adictive.  I havent felt so compelled to finish a game in a long time.  I even like Monkeys acrobatics a lot.  Its pretty fun(although fairly easy) to find a way to jump, swing, and climb around all the obstacles in your path.  The game is also linear but, like I said, the story and its very fleshed out, realistic characters more than make up for any drawbacks.  There are a couple of bugs in the game but none that I didnt easily figure out how to deal with on my own.  For example, the wrecker mek in the fish tank area hit a wall and just kept running against the wall and you cannot progress until you beat him.  Easity fixed by taunting said mek before he ran for the wall.  A lot of it has to do with timing.  Anyway, I overwhelmingly recomend this game.  I never even knew that it existed before it went on sale.  Im so happy that I have it now.			"

												This game is a pretty interesting take on the old Chinese tale: Journey to the West. It takes quite a few liberties with the story but the adaptations and changes aren't bad in my opinion.Pros:-Great voice acting-Good Story Telling-Incredibly colorful and pretty environmentsCons-Combat is boring as heck-Story really drags on after a while-Platforming is really basicThis game's strength lies in its story telling ability....not its gameplay. It's competent in a lot of its core gameplays but I wouldn't describe the actual playing of the game as very fun. What IS entertaining is watching the characters interact and seeing the story progress. It eventually became a matter of springting through most of the level in order to see the next cutscene. Overall: 6/10 Not a waste of money, but definitely better to wait till it's on sale.			"

												Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a nice game, and it is worth getting if you can get it, and its DLC, on sale.Enslaved is a above average game, it isn't going to change your views on action adventure, or make you obsess with the source material (it is a reimaging of Journey to the West). But it is a fun experience that is easy to get into.  The main thing holding this title back is that for everything that it does right, it also kind of does it wrong.Starting off the story for the game is a mix bag. On the positive side you have fun characters that play off each other fairly well. They have playful banter and the audio for them is good. On the negative the overall story is thin and never really explored. At best you'll have a vague idea of what is going on, why you are doing something, or what the point is. Which is a shame, since it seems like the story might have been interesting if they had bother to explain it.Next the combat for the game is enjoyable, but very simple. You have two attack buttons and two ammo types for your staff gun thingy. And after the 3rd or 4th level, you pretty much know everything that you need to know about combat in the game. That isn't to imply that there aren't specialty moves like countering, but for 95% of the encounters in the game, you can get through them with a minimal amount of effort. The game's environments looks nice, but most levels feel too long, like the developers were trying to increase the game's length without factoring in what they would do to it quality.  This is a common problem that a lot of games have, since pacing is hard to do.  What makes this noticeable worst is the lack of challenge on most levels. With a simple combat system, and a very simple platforming system (you push jump to pretty much do everything, and there only one correct path, so can just mindlessly push jump towards the next platform most of the time) eventually enemies and puzzles become annoyances that just slow you down. In the end, if it was only the main game, I wouldn't recommend this title to others. But what pushes it up, is one of the original DLC pieces, Pigsy's Perfect 10, which comes standard in the steam version, so I am factoring it into the review (since it is now part of the base experience).  This DLC is several hours long and focuses on the side character Pigsy. It has different gameplay (3rd person shooter), an unique story (takes place during the main game events, but before the main cast meets Pigsy), and a different overall theme from the main game (Friendship, loneness, and lost). And while the last level in it goes on for way too long, I would argue that overall it is better than the main game, and makes the ending to the main game more significant and meaningful. Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a nice game that does some things right and some things wrong. I wouldn't say it a must play title, but if you can pick it up on sale for cheap, then you should.

												I picked this game up when it was on the 360 and gladly did so again because I forgot how it ended.  Criminally overlooked game.  I think it came out at the same time as some AAA title, I can't remember what though.  Was no marketing behind it and it was planned to be a trilogy, but alas, I don't think that will ever happen outside of some crowd funding.  Definitely a great story and single player experience.  People get mad at the camera angles.. grow up.. it's for the cinematic feel.			"

												Really great piece of ""Monkey's King"" alternative path. Very good level design, characters are funny and believable, also the bigger fights doesn't get you frustrated often. Oh, and the postapocalyptic world! It reminds me awesome piece from 2008 - Prince of Persia, which had (not only) carpets THIS THICK! I can tell you, it is worth the money. Yea, and do not forget on Pigsy's Perfect 10 Extra adventure! :)			"

												While the game brings nothing really new to the genre, it succeeds at being fun and entertaining, which is the point after all.Combat is simple button mashing one on one, but things escalate quickly with multiple shielded enemies, requiring uses of CC moves and other unlockables.Well acted, fun characters and engrossing story (very loosely adaptated from the ""Journey to the West"" medieval Chinese novel, where there's muchless mechs ;-) and Tripitaka is a monk, not a hot redhead).

												So i finished the game a few minutes ago and ive gotta say i was relatively impressed. not the greatetst console port ever made but it definitely was worth the 5 bucks i paid for it.Pros- great graphics-good gameplay , doesnt feel stale and nasty after sitting at it for an hour or so.- OK story, wasnt super awesome, but that may have to do with the act that i generally pla vdeo games with hte sound off so i cna watch tv shows. this game had teh sound of fringe going to it. -free running is always awesome-Awesome homage to an awesome tv show, even if it has been done eredone and reedone some more a million times. (Monkey if you didnt know)-some hilarious dialogue between monkey and pigsy. ""get your hadn off my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; alawys wins a few laughs (no sound but always play with subtitles)Cons-Crazy short. way too short. even the DLC (which comes for free with the game was super short)-horrifying camera angles- No Sandy (pls let me know if there is somethign i missed)- ending was super lameSPOILER!!kill giant scorpion and find out you acutaully are teh bad guy, credits.All in all a very decent game, very pretty and good gameplay.7.7/10 "

												What can I say? This is one of those games that somehow slipped between the cracks and fell into obscurity . The main story is based on a Chinese tale and retold in a post apocalyptic setting the characters and setting are well done, not your typical brown and grey world most games of this type are set in, this one has life, you see nature retaking the world man has left behind.The game is not without its issues though, the main one being the camera has a bad habit of not being in the best spot with no way to adjust it can become a pain. Its a minor gripe in my book but not one that was game breaking. Combat can be a bit repetitive but not to the point where it bothered me much, the interesting story is what hooked me in and kept me playing. For the regular price its worth the buy, but if you can catch it on sale its even better.			"

												This game is AWESOME! A great adaptation based on the book 'Journey to the West'. Great Characters and development. It was a shame that this game really didn't get the notice or the props it deserved. It is one of the most wonderful stories told in computer games. The tale of Trip and Monkey takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where they must escape to Trip’s home. Bound together they must learn to survive each other and with each other as they cannot survive alone. Traversing the environment is a mix of puzzle and platforming that requires the pair to work together or die.Right NOW it's $5. $5 fracking dollars! Do yourself a favor and get it. Beautiful, thoughtful and full of personality and fun, this game is most definitely in my top 10 Favorite games of all time. "

												Enslaved – Odyssey to the WestEnslaved is one of the most underrated games ever. I really have no idea why this game  performed poorly sales wise. The only thing I can think of is that it was inadequately promoted – Namco Bandai pretty much acknowledge that too.Anyway don't let the fact that you heard little about it put you off - I can tell you it really is a great game - one of the best games I have ever played IMHO.


Enslaved Odyssey to the West -- Premium Edition - PC   The Escape 
A Video of 
By: SnQQpy

			Enslaved Odyssey to the West - PC - Cutscene Shadow Fix This a long video that includes all of Chapter One. The main reason for doing the video was to highlight the Cutscene Shadow Fix that I implemented All settings...		


The game was loosely based on a Chinese Novel but differs from the the original story which set a fantasy version of ancient China, to a post-apocalyptic world some 150 years in the future where human existence is sparse and hard. Only scattered residues of humanity remain but left over war-mechs roam the land, still active from the previous global conflict. The plot revolves around Trip (Tripitaka) a captured slave (and tech wizard) who forces the help and protection of a warrior type 'Monkey', who himself is enslaved. They both escape a sabotaged slaver air-ship and 'Monkey' the protagonist you play as, quickly finds himself at the mercy and control of Trip. Incidentally 'Monkey' is excellently voiced and performed by Andy Serkis (of Gollum fame) who was also Performance Director on the project. In fact all characters in this game are outstandingly portrayed and consequently very believable, this adds to the immersion of the game and story.Anyhow, you discover Trip is wanting to return to her remote community and requires nay needs Monkey's help to get her there. There's an important twist here, as Monkey, you have little choice in the matter - you can discover the detail of why for yourself – and you are tied to her in an interesting way. You find that you often have to piggy back her to difficult to reach places and physically throw her to ledges and across gaps. Its sounds strange but its actually a neat mechanic. My small beef was there ought to have been even more requirement to control and this would have enhanced the experience and tightened the relationship you have with them as characters. I would also have preferred that you could have had an extended command structure both ways but like I said it is a minor niggle.The fight mechanism is quite extensive and there were many ways I found to complete tasks and defeat enemies and the overall feel was rewarding and that goes for the Boss Fights too. While the story and scope to explore is limited it never really felt that way as in certain areas you had quite a bit of freedom to do things in your own style. Anyway visually, its great to look at too and all movement and animations are solid and fluid. For me, after only a short while you easily get to grow to like these characters and there's a real affinity you get for each of the characters plight.I highly recommend this game and if you happen to see it in Steam Sales, I suggest you get it. I'm sure you wont be disappointed!			"

												A solid game...that's also very lazy. The characters are very likable and the story is decent. In fact, it's what kept me playing even when the rest started to become a little tedious. The post-apocalyptic setting is well done with some nice locales mixed in.Unfortunately, those were the only outstanding aspects to me. The rest was just mediocre. The combat, while moderately challenging on hard, is very barebones. It has a very basic moveset that doesn't get expanded upon very much. That means that you're stuck with the same 3 attacks (light, heavy, aoe) for the most part. It could've used a more fleshed out skill progression system where you actually unlock new stuff to do. What makes the combat worse is the lack of enemy variety. There are 4 enemy types that get thrown at you and that's pretty much it. The 2 bosses that get recycled over and over again throughout the game don't help much either. It's not like there wasn't enough room to be creative, since the enemy are supposed to be mechs of all kinds and sizes.The ""platforming"", while cool to look at, didn't contribute much to the gameplay. It's basically climbing and parkour stuff along a very streamlined path with 0 danger of failure. I didn't mind this very much, but it could definitely have been more.I still recommend this since I enjoyed the overall experience, but only at a discount (picked it up for 5€).			"

												Just finished it. I think the actual gameplay took me about five hours with a few more while the pc was running while i was doing other stuff. At €5 that's like 1 euro per hour, you dont get that kind price per hour per entertainment from a dvd even.The story alone is worth it, the gameplay itself is little more than azura's wrath-style 'press-the-button-when-we-tell-you-to"" but this post-apocalyptic visually stunning  story-drive interactive animated movie with strong and well-designed characters dint bore me for a second. A very heroic hero, a sexy 29 year old pretending to be a teenage girl. Self-sacrifice, love, violence.... what more would one want. Trip is probaby one the nicest collection of polygons in a game one could hoped for and the story actually never comes to a standstill or a grind. At €5 a must pick-up			"

												A severely underrated game. Pros involved an interesting plot, fascinating translation of setting (compared to the original material), nuanced characters and very, VERY good performance acting (voice and motion included). The combat is repetitive, but I found it to be acceptable. My one complaint about the game would be that the world and action is far too often interrupted by small unskippable cutscenes to further the puzzle/platforming in the areas. Normal, pre-rendered or plot-based cutscenes were fine, but continually halting my gameplay just to show me where an obvious switch was or the path I needed to take to progress was got to be a bit disappointing when I was trying to enjoy the game and immerse myself.That small negative aside, the game truly is a hidden gem. It's soulful, has a lot of heart, and will grab you within the first 10min of gameplay (if it doesn't, then maybe it isn't the game for you). Purchased this with zero expectations since I had never heard of it and was absolutely blown away by the quality of writing, production, and entertainment. While there has been multiple confirmations that there is likely to be no sequel, I strongly hope that the cult following the game has garnered might help revive the effort. Your purchase of this product will help show (hopefully) that this critically acclaimed (but commercially unsuccessful) game has not gone unnoticed, and definitely not unloved.			"

The level design is tunneled, but it is really well made. The story is good, even if a bit cliche at times, but at least it does not take it self too seriously. Then there is the cloud, a freaky hoverbordish floatin disc, that the main character get to use from time to time, and each time it is really fun.

												Шикарнейшая игра, прохождение которой на ПК вызывает зависть к тем, у кого есть консолька и они сделали это еще в 2010. Отличное приключение, потрясающие виды заросшего постапокалиптического Нью-Йорка, талантливейший Энди Серкис в роли главного героя (если вы понимаете, что может этот мужик с технологией Mo-Cap), просто чумовые персонажи (хоть их всего трое) и диалоги между ними. Рекомендую всем  и в срочном порядке, играется крайне бодро и проходится запоем. И искренне жаль, что в свое время такая игра провалилась на рынке из-за недостатка рекламы, и еще больше жаль - что это никого ничему не научило, и на ПК ее выпустили одновременно с таким распиаренными гигантами, как Batman: Arkham Origins и скорый Assassins Creed 4.

Even so, I'm playing through again on hard and I've started out with all of the upgrades, plus I get to use the ninja skin Monkey that gives me unlimited ranged ammo.  All in all, it's even easier now, especially since I know exactly what to do.  Yet I'm still playing it again. It's beautiful, it feels good to control.  The combat is satisfying.  The last fight is pretty darn epic.  The story isn't cheesy or forced.  It's just too short and a little too easy.If you haven't heard of this game (which I know many people haven't)  I'd easily say if you can pick it up for under $10, you won't be disappointed in the least.

Gameplay is fun.  Your combat abilities and equipment are upgradable by collecting orbs around the environment.  Another cool feature is the ability to use a hover disc to get around in places.  There is alot of platforming similar to Assassins Creed games, as well.  Overall, this has been one of the better games I have played recently.  Well worth $20.			"

												I finished off Enslaved:Odyssey to the West yesterday.  Overall I found it marginally enjoyable!  After thoroughly enjoying Ninja Theory's work on the DmC reboot, I was excited to come into this, but it's a very different game, and doesn't sport anything close to the highly technical, challenging combat system of DmC.  In fact, to be quite critical for a moment, most of it's gameplay systems felt pretty shallow.  The combat is fairly simple, and the platforming is context-sensitive.  It also does this annoying thing where it litters collectable items in nooks and crannies, items that you want because they'll provide currency to upgrade your character.  This is usually fine, but devolves into the stupid when they're still present during moments of high drama or time pressure in the storyline.  Your NPC companion yelling for help, and you're rooting around in a trash bin in an alley for upgrade currency.I'm also torn two ways on the context-sensitive jumping.  On the one hand, I'm not sure the gameplay would have been enhanced at all with the ability to fall to your death and then having to restart sections of the game.  On the other hand, as you go through yet another sequence of holding directions and tapping 'A', you sort of find yourself wondering what the payoff is.  Certainly it allows you to have more confidence in trying things, because you flat out aren't allowed to if it would mean your death, but it kind of neutralizes any sense of satisfaction about the successfully traversing the level.However its atypical plot, colourful, post-apocalyptic U.S. setting, and service-ably written/acted characters bring it up a bit.  Also it clocks in at a perfect six hours.  Surprisingly, the game was co-directed by Andy Serkis who provides both the voice and mo-cap for the main character, with excellent results.If you want a character action game that's a bit different from the rest, I recommend checking it out.

												Wonderful! It is a loss that games like this go under the radar, it is fun to play and I had a very enjoyable experience. Though it isn't long (I finished it in about 12 hours), it is rewarding to acomplish the goal of the story. It felt like a movie, a sci-fi/fantasy one, the main character didn't feel shallow, he is a barbarian but not a savage. It is a good adventure/action game, and the end of the story was a real surprise to me.You can play with keyboard and mouse, but it is easier to do with a controller. Graphics are not the best (and shadows look bad on cinematics), but that doesn't carry you away from the action nor from enjoying the game.Not all the people like hack & slash games, or console ports, I usually play other type of games, but I'm happy I bought this one, I bought Enslaved on discount, but now that I finished it I would have paid more for it.Added bonus, the female character is very pretty :P			"

												Enslaved feels like several of my older favorites wrapped up into one fresh game.Okay, let me tell you first what this game is like. Regular gameplay mostly consists of light to medium challenge level platforming with controls and puzzles that send me straight back to the first Jak and Daxter. Combat is very fast paced and all about balancing blocking and combo attacks, so in the heat of all of it you end up somewhere between God of War and Dynasty Warriors. Boss battles each have a different trick to beating them that lies somewhere in your arsenal of attacks and abilites, much like Ocarina of Time boss battles. Inbetween all of this, you've got pockets of well-placed and well-paced storytelling set in a harmless-looking world that can trip you up if you're not careful; this is what makes this game feel so nostalgic despite being relatively new.So when you put all of this together, you're left with this unshakeable feeling the whole time you play; You're having FUN. Not stupid, mindless fun. Not epic, over-the-top fun. Just good, plain FUN that hearkens back to a lot of good classic titles.Now, this game is of course not without fault but I truly can only complain about two things. Unlike many games, Enslaved is actually too easy at points, particularly when it comes to the platforming. There are a few real challenges, but many times you are left wondering if you did something right or if it really was just that easy. Secondly, you can really feel the engine behind this game. Unreal has had many good games across all of its iterations, but unfortunately I have found that most titles that use it end up being fairly archetypal in presentation; Enslaved does not break the mold.In the end, I still give Enslaved a solid 8/10; It's a unique, satisfying game with an old soul.

												Just such a pretty game. Enslaved OTTW is a classic hack-n-slash format produced to an exceptional, slick standard with background vistas that verge on breathtaking.This game doesn't hold the challenge of titles like Ninja Gaiden or God of War. Whilst some may find this to be a negative (I myself love a really difficult challenge and am looking forward to another Tomonobu Itagaki title) the quirky nature of the legend of Monkey and the compelling characters in this story make up for it and in fact having a slightly easier skill requirement allows the narrative to flow more fluidly.I really enjoy the spin this title put on Monkey and I especially like the idea of his ""cloud"". Zooming around on a spinning light disc was fun and made for an interesting change of pace. All the other futuristic reimaginings of the old tale often made me smile, the designers somehow managing to retain a sense of humour whilst also being techno cool.The two main protagonists in this game are undoubtedly cliche. One a gruff, super strong and agile hero with a temper problem. The other a smart, deep down resiliant but often scared heroine, ""Trip"", with some tantilising rips in her trousers who clearly starts to get moist for the hero once he saves her a few times and demonstrates just how much of the king gorilla he really is. But this erotic dynamic is still pleasing somehow and I found myself still being entertained by it, perhaps not least because Monkey is just such a cool dood it's understandable that anyone would end up having a crush on him.The combat is free flowing and works well as a mechanic, even though I would argue it is not deep enough to offer much difficulty for the hardened combo basher. The enemy types are just varied enough to keep it interesting and the difficulty builds with a decent gradual curve. There are also other game mechanics which are thoughtfully crafted, such as each new stage getting a panning camera overview via the scan of a ""dragonfly"" camera drone released by Trip. Monkey can only use his ""cloud"" when he is areas where it can draw energy from. It's also almost impossible for Monkey to fall by jumping off random edges. These little addtions hide typical transitions, which can often feel clunky other games, keep the game paced well and increase the level of immersion into the story.One little niggle for me was the fact that this game really needs a controller and you can forget it if you think you can use your wireless 360 contoller. It just simply wouldn't work at all. Soon as I plugged in a wired controller, that one worked just fine though. No idea why but I noticed that I have this problem on other Unreal engine games too. You may want to check online before you buy that your controller of choice is going to work ok.All in all a well polished and enjoyable experience. 82%			"

												Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is suprisingly good. It has an interesting story adapted from the ancient Chinese ""Journey to the West"". I'm not familiar enough with the story to recognize all the parallels but the ring on Monkey's head is a clever example of adapting the story to a futuristic setting. Having said that, the pacing is pretty bad and the ending seemed pretty ridiculous.The gameplay was quite fun aside from some bad level design (very annoying mines and other cases where a simple mistake makes you repeat a lot of what you just did) and camera controls that drive you mad about 30% of the time. The upgrade and combat systems are simple and fun.Lastly, the bugs need to be mentioned. I think it is exclusive to the PC port but there are several parts in the game where you get stuck if your graphics settings aren't correct. I ended up needing to increase the graphics settings to high to get through those parts which was annoying to say the least.			"

												I am extremely dissatisfied with this game.  Not because of the game itself mind you, I have played it on ps3.  However the port over to Steam is HORRIBLE.  After starting second chapter, where I have to climb over first pipes to let down the other side of the gate, it won't let me past the pipe just after you hear mechs, and trip asks you, ""what was that?"". I have tried all sorts of things, checking cache, rebooting, reinstalling.  It just won't work, and its frustrating.			"

												A random 3rd person action game I picked up because of praises by single reviewers (even though the average ratings were, well, average). It's an entertaining melee/climbing sort of thing with solid enough combat mechanics and a fluid climbing system where you mostly just chill and watch the acrobatics (generally you can't fall). It has a decent story as random action games go, and the dialogue/acting is rather good (e.g. Andy Serkis plays the protagonist). The setting is postapocalyptic, but this time it's not a barren wasteland - you find New York overtaken by lush plant life, for instance. Some of the enviroments are beautiful despite its age (it's a PS3/X360 game from 2010).The game plays better with a console controller, except for the shooting parts (you get a ranged attack with very limited ammo), which become a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ There's also a couple of annoying chase sections. Generally it's an easy game.So nothing revolutionary, no replay value (fully linear), but it's a good somewhat cinematic title with respectable writing and acting, good for a playthrough. I recommend it if you like the genre in general.The ""Premium Edition"" on Steam comes with 3 DLC skins that give significant passive buffs (but can only be used after finishing the game once, unless you edit some .ini files yourself) and a shorter story mode with a more comical tone where you control a side character from the main game.

												I am on chapter 9 with 5 hours played, I like this game.One problem i have with this game are due to the controls, which are not surfaced for some moves, for instance i had to google how to use the stun hit, because it doesn't say in game. And sometimes the controls not responsive. Sometimes i would be in a fight and try to run and my analogue stick ( i use a xbox controller ) would not respond for a second.My other problem, is more with the climbing, which this game relies on heavily, they do highlight the polls, and some climbable objects, but not all of them. They also do not highlight them too well, its a shiny effect type of thing from the original uncharted. I wish they would have used a eagal vision type of thing.My third, very minor, nit pick problems are the camera angles change your controls sometimes, this also happens in DmC: Devil May Cry, which i see as a more analogue comparison, seeing as Ninja theory made both. The pre-rendered cutsenes look like they were made with 3d software from 1999, and rendered to a gif. Also sometimes the animations arnt very smooth, this isn't usually a problem until the game makes you zoom into your 'AI partner' ( not reallyan AI partner, more of a highly scripted partner ) and you see the animations up close.What i like about it...This game has deep characters, which i think Ninja Theory actually dose very well. Their seems to be a character arch, but seeing as im only on chapter 9, i cant tell you how it ends.The world they created is interesting, and i want to find out where it ends. As much as they chalk up to 'Video Games' AKA a magic hoverboard that only works sometimes,it all works within the story, and they are very good at propositioning my questions, such as 'why dose that only work here'.The Story is good, no spoilers.Overall, I usually don't finish games, I actually might finish this one.EDIT:After finishing this game at 8 hours, i want to say, i still agree, with my earler review, the boss fights can be frustrating when they make you jump around, and the story is OMG worth it.

												I had heard of this a few years back when it was still fresh on the shelves, but I was talked out of getting it because the store clerk said it had some pretty bad reviews. Since it was cheap with the Steam Summer Sale, I figured I wouldn't really lose much if it really was. The fact is, I really, really enjoyed this game.The number one reason why I really enoyed it? It's based on the same story that Dragonball is, and the nostalgia factor alone made this game awesome for me. You've got your Goku, complete with a Power Pole and Flying Nimbus; you've got your Bulma and all her hacky, science-y ways; and you've got your Oolong, lecherous and...well, a pig. Throw all this together, add some high-octaine violence, neat mechs, and a gorgeous environment and you've got yourself a fun game!The environments are beautifully crafted and it's tempting to just stand around and oggle them for hours. The story is pretty decent too, and the voice acting and motion cap is as to be expected with Andy Serkis on board. The combat is a bit lacking; it's just your typical hack and slash, reminiscent of God of War with the special moves when enemies are weakened. You can basically beat the entire game by spamming left click and the odd ""E"" in combat. There's also an upgrade feature that I pretty much didn't use beyond extending my sheild abilities (seriously, who bothers to upgrade the staff?). And, to extend the gameplay, there's your token hidden trophy collection element.All in all, very good game in this gal's opinion!			"

												Beautiful console port with likable characters, simplistic but fun console style combat and climbing and a linear but engaging story that keeps you interested. A bit short, but for the story and gameplay it offers it is exactly the right length, any more and it would start to get dull. In other words a welcome little diversion, and such a pretty green apocalypse that makes you want to learn more about the world, with character dynamics that make sense. I found that a gamepad controller gave the best experience as that is what it was designed for. Also quite kid friendly as the violence is confined to smashing robots and playing Monkey makes you feel like a very capable and likable hero with even a few juvenile jokes thrown in.			"

												TL;DR: This game is really cool and you smash giant robots and stuff.I bought this game without high expectations to be honest, it was an impulse buy because I was tired of playing CS:GO on the same maps over and over again. It was a really refreshing and fun experience. The gameplay isn't anything really new or exciting, but the story and scenery make up for it. I have always liked post-apocalyptic themes, and this game really gets it right. Some people have complained about it's last-generation graphics, but for me it didn't really have a factor in how cool the setting is. I didn't actually realize that the graphics were outdated until someone pointed it out in the community hub. I was interested through the entire game, and there are several really exciting boss battles. I felt like a total badass destroying gigantic war mechs with just a staff. Nobody I know has played, or even heard of this game, which is kind of sad considering the high quality of it. It took my 7 hours to complete the game. I played with controller, I didn't try keyboard/mouse controls. Thumbs up.			"

												I'm rather positive about this game. It is one of the very few story games I could play hours on end without getting tired of the gameplay or taking frustration breaks. I actually finnished the game in a few subsequent evenings of intensive playing. The characters are very likeable and the game itself and story have a nice flow to it. The game is challanging enough that you can't always do certain parts in one go but I have never before had a game where I would happily retry the same part 4 or 5 times to get on with the story and still enjoy myself in the course of it. I like that it's just a notch above simply  beating the crap out of things and actually involves some tactics. (even if simply trashing stuff is very enjoyable too) The game does follow a set trajectory and I do admit I wish it was longer and that more was revealed about the characters' history but it did enjoy it very much and the lack of  beforementioned things means that it has left me wanting for more of the same. And that is good. As far as the porting of this game goes I've only experianced one single bug and that was fairly easily fixed. (I couldn't jump where I should have been able to but changing resolution to the lowest setting fixed my camera angle and after the jump I simply undid the change.)			"

												This game REALLY reminded me of the Jak franchise on Playstation 2. The characters were so similar in concept and the ruins and enemies gave me childhood memories. The mechs reminded me of the gladiators that you fight in the arena when you first go into the desert region of Jak 3, the slavers were just like the government in Jak 2, hell even the protagonist, Monkey, looks like Jak.As mentioned before, the game just gives me constant childhood memories. Collecting orbs that upgrade you, beautiful environments that leave memories in your head forever, quirky voiceacting, and such similar platformer-styled parkour jumping and fighting.I've only gotten through around 3-4 chapters out of a possible 14 and it's taken me under 2 hours of gameplay. Although there a few graphical errors (odd shading, characters hovering a 10 millimetres from the ground), the game looks beautiful on the Unreal Engine. It's never too hard or too easy, and you're not spoonfed by the developers. It's rather linear and has lack of exploration in certain portions, but you tend to forget about it once you get into the game.Also, Andy Serkis, voice of Smeagol and the Witch-King from LOTR, is the voice of the protagonist, how ♥♥♥♥ing cool is that?

												Perhaps the most beautiful and coloful post-apocalyptic game you will ever play.  As you've probably read in a thousand other reviews, ENSLAVED is a retelling of the classic tale Journey to the West. If you play video games solely for the input-> output reaction and gameplay then this probably isn't the game for you. If, however, you can appreciate a good experience then ENSLAVED will take you on a journey you won't soon forget. VisualsThe game is absolutely gorgeous, with heavy themes of nature reclaiming civilization. Any working technology looks pieced together and rather junky. SO many colors! Great contrasting visuals and a rather interesitng, slightly cartoonish arstyle. Sort of remeniscent of Jak and Daxter10/10GameplayThe combat sections are fun at first but due to a lack of depth become pretty repetitive by the end. Platforming and climbing are a bit too easy, but the smooth animations give it a very fluid and satisfying feel. Trip offers some tactical options and certain segements let you skip combat in favor of climbing your way around. The gamplay isn't stellar but it was by no means bad. The Cloud was ♥♥♥♥ing awesome though.6/10CharactersTrip and Monkey are both dynamic, round characters with whom you can't help but fall for. Seriously Trip is straight waifu material (especially sexy robot Trip hnnngh) and Monkey is  husbando tier as well. The voice work is top ♥♥♥♥ing notch and the Mocap is fantastic. Trip and Monkey's relationship is realistic and organic in all the best ways. Their interactions are some of the games highest points.10/10StoryThe story starts very well, giving you a general idea of the purpose but focusing almost entierly on the here and now. The end chapters are a bit..odd and seem to not fit so well with the rest of the game but really the cast holds it together. It's also rather short (7~8 hours) but I feel like it was a good length overall8/10 PerformanceRuns really well on my system (a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop) and other than some ocassionally big stutters when loading a new area the game ran like a dream on high. Motion blur should be turned off right away though.♥♥♥♥♥♥is disgusting9/10All in all, I really loved this game. It is unique and charming and I really fell for the characters. One of the best games I've expeirienced in quite some time. SOLID 9/10 "

The adventure is awesome, the story is great, the music is good and the action is worth it. Other players don't like this game, I don't care about their designs, let them be targeted by the machines. If by any chance they release a sequel for this game that is longer and new characters to be played with, I will not even hesitate to buy the game, not even once. I’ll give this game a 9.9999999999999999999/10.			"

												This is for all you 3D nvidia vision users out there. This is a game that came out on the consoles some years ago, I actually have a PS3 copy. The game is a beautiful, nice romp, through a postapocolypic world, with a well acted and funny story.  All i can say is this was underated when it was released on the consoles, and quite frankly a sleaper hit on the PC. you will need to apply the helix mod, which really makes the 3D world come to life. I will add most of the combat is fairly straightforward, not as deep as some other AAA action titles out there, but it really makes up for it in narrative and sheer beauty of the world. The boss segments are also well done. If there were more 3d titles like this out there, it would be a sheer joy in gamers paradise. Definately worth the play through again even if you have the PS3 version to behold this world in 3d is truely beathtaking.			"

												It's an Xbox port, and it's a bad port. The controls are confusing and some suggestions appear telling you how to play on your controller (wtf, this is a keyboard, there's no joystick here).Apart from that it's a pretty good game, with a good story and great voice acting (Andy Serkis plays the main character, and that's enough to convince me). The levels are maybe too linear, but still enjoyable enough to make a good game.			"

												I thought it was fun. I little repetitive but still fun. the story does grab you but the ending seems to take a little too long and just isn't really good... Gameplay is fine. A little trouble with the camera and figuring out where to go but nothing to make your bloodpressure rise. Not a lot of variation in the enemies but there's some variation in the gameplay so that kinda makes up for it for a little bit.All and all, I bought and played in on the Xbox and bought and played it again on Steam so I like it enough for that. Voiceacting is sublime I think, and the facial animations are really awesome when you think about when this game was made			"

												This is a REALLY fun game!It has similar game mechanics to Prince of Persia and it's very much a jumping game, but I got hooked on the story more than anything. The main guy, Monkey, reminds me of a tattoo artist I had do some work on me. but better looking and MUCH smarter! lol!The gamer itself isn't hard from the start, though there are challenging parts that pop up here and there. There's enough cheese to it so the emotional grabs aren't too intense, but you will fall in love with the character dynamics the plot offers. It delivers until the very end and it's ""game +"" style replay value make it one worth keeping in your collection.			"

												I bought this game months ago, and honestly until this recent sale I completely forgot about buying it.  The downside to buying a ton of games during the big sale events.  The story for this game is a gem, and the bonus story isn't too bad as well.  Honestly, the DLC I know some have knocked; I will not be one of those.  The DLC was different then the game and for what it was and coming with the Premium Edition already it was well worth playing.  Pros:Great story!Combat was fun!Platforming in this game is hand holding, but it still was fun.Graphics!DLC is like a whole different game, just not quite as long.Cons:Controls can feel a little clunky at times.Invisible walls.Open world feel, but really linear.

												The camera angles are just horrific; very often I'm left with the camera facing the wall, whilst the enemies attack from behind the camera. Controls are hopeless too. Trying to aim with the staff just takes too long as the camera moves too slowly. This often ends up with enemies calling for more reinforcements.The difficulty doesn't scale well. I'm caught with waves of enemies, and no way to upgrade my attacks because Trip is nowhere to be found.  "

												A really fun game. I always love my post apocolyptic games. The fighting mechanics and climbing were better then average. It had a nice flow and didn't feel choppy or glitchy. Only thing is that the climbing mechs were kinda meh...but still alright. It was a little to easy to climb if that´s worth mentioning, like really childproof easy. All in all i rly liked the game, loved the story, the characters. Saru (Monkey) and Trip is a great pair and the chemistry between them worked splendidly, especially when the awesome Piggsy arrived on the scene, gotta love that guy.

												Very satisfying and brutal anti-robot combat, except for the twitchy camera. I didn't enjoy paying for DLC which enhances the game... which can only be activated after completing the game - kind of an assumption that I'll want to play through however many hours four times to see all of the DLC I've paid for. After that frustration, I didn't make it past the second level - I got to a minefield and kept dying... not because of the mines, but once because I went exploring looking for the pretty red floating things and wandered off too far away from the person I was escorting (somehow, instant death with no warning) and another time because I did exactly what the game told me but it punished me with a random death anyway... each time, putting me back a few minutes of gameplay which I didn't want to play through again. This made me realise that I wouldn't want to play through the whole game again, even with the paid-for DLC. So, I quit. Very disappointing!			"

Good Characters, intriguing story, interesting world, solid gameplay mechanics and just overall a very enjoyable game to play. I'm surprised how often this game gets looked over, as in my opinion it's one of the best games to come out of the PS3/X360 generation.Ninja Theory are yet to let me down.

												I remember this game was an instant buy for me when it came on Xbox 360. Only because I loved the adventures of Nariko in Heavenly Sword (previous game by the same developer) and because Alex Garland, the guy who wrote the story for this game, also wrote my favorite contemporary book, The Beach (the movie adaptation didn't do the book any justice, by the way). Just recently I was thinking of replaying this gem on my 360 and now I don't have to suffer through 30 FPS. Bought the game the moment I saw it today. Now I don't even know what to play first, Arkham Origins, or this. This one I know is good.			"

												TL;DR: This game is really cool and you smash giant robots and stuff.I bought this game without high expectations to be honest, it was an impulse buy because I was tired of playing CS:GO on the same maps over and over again. It was a really refreshing and fun experience. The gameplay isn't anything really new or exciting, but the story and scenery make up for it. I have always liked post-apocalyptic themes, and this game really gets it right. Some people have complained about it's last-generation graphics, but for me it didn't really have a factor in how cool the setting is. I didn't actually realize that the graphics were outdated until someone pointed it out in the community hub. I was interested through the entire game, and there are several really exciting boss battles. I felt like a total badass destroying gigantic war mechs with just a staff. Nobody I know has played, or even heard of this game, which is kind of sad considering the high quality of it. It took my 7 hours to complete the game. I played with controller, I didn't try keyboard/mouse controls. Thumbs up.			"

												As a scholar of East Asian culture and Journey to the West, I was eager to see how this game adapted the classic novel. It was nothing like I expected. Instead of ancient, it was futuristic, and instead of animal companions, everyone looked human and modern. It's similar to how Akira Toriyama handled his own adaptation of Journey to the West in Dragon Ball, where Xuanzang is a woman who uses technology instead of a man who uses faith. So if you're familiar with the source material, then it's a great game from that perspective.What weighs Enslaved down is the repetitive game design. Once you've finished the first level, you've experienced about 90% of the game. That is to say, running, jumping, climbing, and attacking robots. This rinse and repeat process wears you down and will make you want to stop playing after a couple of hours. As a result, you play it like you would a book: reading a couple chapters and stopping. The reason you pick it up again is because the story is so compelling. What saves this game and makes it worth playing is the writing, voice acting, graphics, music, and few stellar moments of memorable gameplay. Push through the countless robots and you'll find it was a positive experience. The DLC is much longer and polished than I expected it to be, and almost rivals the main game. I hope the creative team behind Enslaved make a sequel or a new series in a simlar style.			"

												(writing this about halfway through the game, I think. Completed through chapter 7.)There's a few glitches, but most of them aren't gamebreaking. I've had to restart a checkpoint a few times.The sparsity of checkpoints is actually my main complaint. When hunting for all of the tech orbs, sometimes I have to go back several minutes to try a segment again. I believe the game saves what you've picked up when you restart such a checkpoint, but it's not consistent for me - I kept having to pick up the same orb behind me during the final shootout in chapter 7.Auto-targeting is another problem. I can't seem to keep focused on one enemy to finish them off. Luckily, a stun lasts for a set period of time and isn't broken when I use a regular attack, but it's aggravating in some of those frantic multi fights.Graphics: eh. I played a lot of DmC, so the colors/aesthetics feel kinda samey. If you *haven't* played DmC, it's lush, and beautiful. Sometimes it's too bright and colorful for me to find the next platforming segment. Trip's pants make no sense, but whatever.Also: not very good with alt-tabbing. There's no windows/no border option in the graphics, so it's crashed a few times. Beware!The story is great so far. I think I've really become a fan of how Ninja Theory does their character relationships. Even though Monkey is the controlled character, is more experienced, and does all of the fighting, Trip is treated as an equal.I picked this up because of a passing interest in Journey to the West, and the story is roughly paralleling what I know about the original plot, but in futurepunk ways. It's neat to guess what's coming next!The platforming works. Wonky platforming controls aren't too bad, because the game will only let you jump to valid locations. So that's nice.This feels like it's mostly detailing my complaints, but I'm always eager to continue to the next chapter, to see what happens next.			"

												Good game with very good sci fi story and characters and good looking post apocolyptic sci fi setting. Sometimes changing camera angles create some confusion, but not so bad. Interaction with Trip is enjoyable as I certainly enjoyed being enslaved by her, carrying her and throwing her to those hard to reach places. Pigsy is also a good character providing some humor. Pigsy's Perfect 10 plays differently than the Odyssey and nicely timed auto saves provide for planning and preparing for what is needed to be done in some of the more difficult combat sequences. Both are definitely worth playing and certainly woth picking up on sale, no doubt. I would score Odyssey around 85 and Pigsy's Perfect 10 at around an 80 on the metacritic scale.			"

												Just such a pretty game. Enslaved OTTW is a classic hack-n-slash format produced to an exceptional, slick standard with background vistas that verge on breathtaking.This game doesn't hold the challenge of titles like Ninja Gaiden or God of War. Whilst some may find this to be a negative (I myself love a really difficult challenge and am looking forward to another Tomonobu Itagaki title) the quirky nature of the legend of Monkey and the compelling characters in this story make up for it and in fact having a slightly easier skill requirement allows the narrative to flow more fluidly.I really enjoy the spin this title put on Monkey and I especially like the idea of his ""cloud"". Zooming around on a spinning light disc was fun and made for an interesting change of pace. All the other futuristic reimaginings of the old tale often made me smile, the designers somehow managing to retain a sense of humour whilst also being techno cool.The two main protagonists in this game are undoubtedly cliche. One a gruff, super strong and agile hero with a temper problem. The other a smart, deep down resiliant but often scared heroine, ""Trip"", with some tantilising rips in her trousers who clearly starts to get moist for the hero once he saves her a few times and demonstrates just how much of the king gorilla he really is. But this erotic dynamic is still pleasing somehow and I found myself still being entertained by it, perhaps not least because Monkey is just such a cool dood it's understandable that anyone would end up having a crush on him.The combat is free flowing and works well as a mechanic, even though I would argue it is not deep enough to offer much difficulty for the hardened combo basher. The enemy types are just varied enough to keep it interesting and the difficulty builds with a decent gradual curve. There are also other game mechanics which are thoughtfully crafted, such as each new stage getting a panning camera overview via the scan of a ""dragonfly"" camera drone released by Trip. Monkey can only use his ""cloud"" when he is areas where it can draw energy from. It's also almost impossible for Monkey to fall by jumping off random edges. These little addtions hide typical transitions, which can often feel clunky other games, keep the game paced well and increase the level of immersion into the story.One little niggle for me was the fact that this game really needs a controller and you can forget it if you think you can use your wireless 360 contoller. It just simply wouldn't work at all. Soon as I plugged in a wired controller, that one worked just fine though. No idea why but I noticed that I have this problem on other Unreal engine games too. You may want to check online before you buy that your controller of choice is going to work ok.All in all a well polished and enjoyable experience. 82%			"

It's based on the same story that Dragonball is, and the nostalgia factor alone made this game awesome for me. You've got your Goku, complete with a Power Pole and Flying Nimbus; you've got your Bulma and all her hacky, science-y ways; and you've got your Oolong, lecherous and...well, a pig. Throw all this together, add some high-octaine violence, neat mechs, and a gorgeous environment and you've got yourself a fun game!The environments are beautifully crafted and it's tempting to just stand around and oggle them for hours. The story is pretty decent too, and the voice acting and motion cap is as to be expected with Andy Serkis on board. The combat is a bit lacking; it's just your typical hack and slash, reminiscent of God of War with the special moves when enemies are weakened. You can basically beat the entire game by spamming left click and the odd ""E"" in combat. There's also an upgrade feature that I pretty much didn't use beyond extending my sheild abilities (seriously, who bothers to upgrade the staff?). And, to extend the gameplay, there's your token hidden trophy collection element.All in all, very good game in this gal's opinion!			"

												The port from Playstation to PC is a little clunky, but worth soldiering through. If you can handle what the camera tries to do while you play you will find a compelling story, interesting, well-voiced characters and beautiful environments. In my opinion it's wholly under appreciated and absolutely worth a play through.			"

												I had never heard of this game before I recently saw it on sale for $5. It seemed to have a generally warm reception and looked fun enough, so I picked it up. Turns out, I didn't regret it.I liked the developing dynamic between Trip and Monkey. She can be a tad annoying at times, always asking you for help to cross a gap, but it didn't bother me too terribly much. Andy Serkis is great at being grumpy as Monkey. Dialog is actually not bad between the two characters, and some moments between the two really felt genuine.Gameplay-wise, I had a lot of fun. Monkey is a beast in combat, with a number of upgrades to add more moves to your arsenal like counters, etc. The camera can tend to be a bit wonky at times, but I, personally, only had minimal trouble with it in actual combat. The climbing controls felt pretty good, as you could just leap to the next handhold in the middle of leaping to the current one, so it felt smooth...didn't have to wait for his mounting animation to finish on horizontal poles, etc. The enemies are varied enough to keep things interesting at any given moment; some will have shields, some are ranged, some stun you...each of which you have to take a bit different approach to get them vulnerable.The story length and pace feel right; not too much sidetracking. Took me about 6 total hours to beat the first time. I did feel that the end of the game was a bit abrupt, and not showing what happens after the fact (furiously trying to avoid spoilers) was a bit disappointing, but I still liked it well enough. The climactic fight was well done in making you feel that it was the end...epic and all that.Overall, I do recommend this game. I've seen worse PC ports of console games, and I really did enjoy myself playing it. I give it a score of 8/10			"

												Finished Enslaved today, Nov 19th, 2014, and I will tell you.   This game had moments where it frustrated the heck out of me.  Not due to anything other then simple mechanics of the game that took me awhile to get use to.   That's not to say the game was difficult, but my only play through was on the hardest setting and i had moments where i definately wish i would have chosen an easier setting.   Now that im done ♥♥♥♥♥ing... ""The game.""  The game was fantastic, a real action filled adventure that never bored me for a second.   Great story, beautiful scenes, landscapes and maps, just purely enjoyable.   It was such a good game it almost shamed me that I only became interested when it was on sale.   One of those games that didn't catch the attention it merits.   If you are on the fence with this title, don't be.   Its worthy of its sleeper hit title.  A true masterpiece.  Get it!			"

												A good game. The story is pretty interesting and the characters are memorable. The world is visually attractive. The gameplay reminds me of a cross between Uncharted, meets God of War, meets the Last of Us, with a fairly timing oriented hack and slash melee combat. The climbing mechanics look almost identical to an Uncharted game, which is a good thing in my opinion. You have an upgrade system which adds a little more replayability to the game. The premium edition comes with a whole seperate story-line with completely different game mechanics to really change things up as well as some unlockable buffs to the main story.My biggest issue with the game, would be that the controls don't seem very optimized for mouse and keyboard. They're perfectly functional as I played the entire game using only the mouse and keyboard, however the mouse acceleration is a little funky and the some of the game's context menus on give button combinations in terms of an Xbox controller rather than mouse and keyboard. If you're ok with using a controller, then you'll have no complaints however. The camera angles were the second biggest issue, with some scene forcing you into somewhat awkward camera angles which could make doing certai nthings difficult. 95% of the game however, most of the camera angles were fine in my opinion.

												I love this game!  Or perhaps the story and visuals more than anything else.  The camera sucks, and fighting can get repetative but the story, the growing relationship between Monkey and Trip, the artwork...Its adictive.  I havent felt so compelled to finish a game in a long time.  I even like Monkeys acrobatics a lot.  Its pretty fun(although fairly easy) to find a way to jump, swing, and climb around all the obstacles in your path.  The game is also linear but, like I said, the story and its very fleshed out, realistic characters more than make up for any drawbacks.  There are a couple of bugs in the game but none that I didnt easily figure out how to deal with on my own.  For example, the wrecker mek in the fish tank area hit a wall and just kept running against the wall and you cannot progress until you beat him.  Easity fixed by taunting said mek before he ran for the wall.  A lot of it has to do with timing.  Anyway, I overwhelmingly recomend this game.  I never even knew that it existed before it went on sale.  Im so happy that I have it now.			"

												Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a nice game, and it is worth getting if you can get it, and its DLC, on sale.Enslaved is a above average game, it isn't going to change your views on action adventure, or make you obsess with the source material (it is a reimaging of Journey to the West). But it is a fun experience that is easy to get into.  The main thing holding this title back is that for everything that it does right, it also kind of does it wrong.Starting off the story for the game is a mix bag. On the positive side you have fun characters that play off each other fairly well. They have playful banter and the audio for them is good. On the negative the overall story is thin and never really explored. At best you'll have a vague idea of what is going on, why you are doing something, or what the point is. Which is a shame, since it seems like the story might have been interesting if they had bother to explain it.Next the combat for the game is enjoyable, but very simple. You have two attack buttons and two ammo types for your staff gun thingy. And after the 3rd or 4th level, you pretty much know everything that you need to know about combat in the game. That isn't to imply that there aren't specialty moves like countering, but for 95% of the encounters in the game, you can get through them with a minimal amount of effort. The game's environments looks nice, but most levels feel too long, like the developers were trying to increase the game's length without factoring in what they would do to it quality.  This is a common problem that a lot of games have, since pacing is hard to do.  What makes this noticeable worst is the lack of challenge on most levels. With a simple combat system, and a very simple platforming system (you push jump to pretty much do everything, and there only one correct path, so can just mindlessly push jump towards the next platform most of the time) eventually enemies and puzzles become annoyances that just slow you down. In the end, if it was only the main game, I wouldn't recommend this title to others. But what pushes it up, is one of the original DLC pieces, Pigsy's Perfect 10, which comes standard in the steam version, so I am factoring it into the review (since it is now part of the base experience).  This DLC is several hours long and focuses on the side character Pigsy. It has different gameplay (3rd person shooter), an unique story (takes place during the main game events, but before the main cast meets Pigsy), and a different overall theme from the main game (Friendship, loneness, and lost). And while the last level in it goes on for way too long, I would argue that overall it is better than the main game, and makes the ending to the main game more significant and meaningful. Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is a nice game that does some things right and some things wrong. I wouldn't say it a must play title, but if you can pick it up on sale for cheap, then you should. The overall experience from the main game and the DLC is fun, and who doesn't like having fun.			"

I think it came out at the same time as some AAA title, I can't remember what though.  Was no marketing behind it and it was planned to be a trilogy, but alas, I don't think that will ever happen outside of some crowd funding.  Definitely a great story and single player experience.

												Overall it's a pretty good game. If you know the story of Journey To The West at all, (or Dragonball, which is probably what most people will compare it to) you will see the similarities very quickly.The characters and plot are enjoyable, and the game design itself is beautiful.I found that there were a lot of flaws though, and some really gave me problems during the game.The biggest of these were the controls; the camera, though controllable through a lot of the game, becomes automatic for certain sequences in the game, usually important ones like boss battles. I found myself constantly battling the camera to see what i wanted to see, and ended up dying countless times because it swung around just when i had got it into place, and meant i couldn't see where the giant mech was charging at me.This is exacerbated by the level design. Often the major battles end up being in circular arena-type areas, and when you get close to the edge, it automatically faces outwards, so you can't keep an eye on the boss while you're collecting plasma or health around the edge of the arena. Extremely frustrating.Equally frustrating was the platforming, which i found rigid and fiddly. I don't know if it's down to the port, but i can't remember the number of times i was trying to vault a barrier, jump a gap on the cloud or jump between handholds at speed, and ended up watching as Monkey shook his head in refusal, did a roll instead, or just straight-up dove head first into the hole. There were a few more rage-quits than there needed to be, purely because of clunky controlls.That being said, i played through first time on hard, and the chapters seemed to go from virtually impossible because of the crappy controls and bad camera, to surprisingly easy because of an easy layout and limited number of enemies; it seems like perhaps the difficulty levels weren't successfully executed.In terms of plot, the overall story is compelling, but doesn't quite go deep enough. The ultimate antagonist (Pyramid) is really a non-entity until the very end of the game, you have no real understanding who they are or what they do, and no idea why anyone would even know what they were called or that they existed until basically 3/4 of the way through. All of that said, overall, i would probably give this game a 6.5 in spite of the problems i was having. It really is beautiful to look at, and very atmospheric. It's also super satisfying to watch Monkey and his gigantic arms tear huge machines limb from limb. It has some really funny moments, and the central characters have good chemistry. It could perhaps do with an update to some of its mechanics, but i enjoyed it, and completing the highest difficulty is pretty satisfying after being killed So. Many. Times.I'll probably play the DLCs and other difficulties in the future.			"

												I did not know what I was getting into when I got the game. It was actually suprising.  A port from the PS3, it is actually very well done.  I only encountered two bugs during the 8 hour playthrough where my character froze in the classic cross pose and would not respond.  I have yet to play the piggsy extra.  The game overall reminds me a little of Uncharted/Left Behind with the two characters talking with each other as you explore the old ruins with some very easy platforming and hand to hand combat thrown in for the action.  I really should not call it platforming as you can never really fall to your death and only on a few levels are there moving cogs and stuff that can actually kill you but it is very fluid and well done. There is some stealth thrown in but I found it much easier to just kill eveyrthing.  There is ussually a boss at the end of a level with some mid bosses half way through but they are fairy easy do defeat.  The graphics are suprisingly good but if not to your liking you can always use some sweetFX to fancy them up a bit.  There are some good community guides for helping tweek some of the more common graphic complaints.  The overall game is a little short.  The story while good, leaves more questions than it does answers specifically with the setting.  There are some funny bits of comedy thrown in the mix.   A good game if you want something fun and short.   "

												I played this game primarily for the story, I heard it was interesting. Let me tell you I certainly wasn't dissapointed in the slightest on that front. My devotion to the story was so great that when i accidentally skipped a cutscene at the end of a chapter, I replayed the entire chapter to see the cutscene again. I also rewatched the epilogue a couple of times because  philosophy was going through my head, and I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything. Great storyThe game was certainly limited in terms of controls, I had to open up the ini files to figure out some of the key bindings for the ol' mouse and keyboard. I recommend a controller, it would work better I think.Combat is a little shallow, especially if you didn't look up some of the key Bindings, but it can be fun and challenging, and the bosses are good. Its a good game with a great story that satisfied me, therefore I recommend it.			"

												A playable on rails platformer, 'puzzle', beat em up. I quite enjoyed it actually, 5 years of graphics changes have not been kind, but it's not an ugly game. The voice acting is actually quite good and not cringe worthy. The puzzle element may only tax a 6 year old, but it did add a bit of nice pacing. Climbing around is really quite fluid, but nothing spectacular. With it being on rails (IE, you are not gonna fall off a platform) you can get stuck on the odd railing or object for a second, especially in places where the camera changes - yes, it has sections of fixed cameras. These often have you accidentally backtracing for a second till you revert back to the camera change point. The variety of enemies could have been expanded and a few more weapon options could have been added, the combat is not too shabby, but it's a standard ""3 hit then heavy blow"" till later on. The upgrades while useful are not all necessary to continue the quest - I was using basic moves till late on. 8 hours to pass the time. Grabbed in a bundle or for peanuts, you shouldn't regret picking it up - I didn't.			"

												Combat: I think the combat is best described as solid. It offers enough attacks and enemy-types to keep you entertained, but it is a bit simplistic. There is really not much more to say about it.Climbing: On the positive side the climbing is very well animated and the sceneries look good. Unfortunately, it is impossible to die. This somehow takes the tension out of the climbing-sections and more than ones i caught myself just mashing the jump button until I hid the correct direction. So climbing is basically a distraction from the action-based combats.Camera: Maybe you wonder why the camera is its own bulletpoint. The reason is: the camera control/movement is awful. The camera is way too close behind the character, there is no lock-on mechanism and most of the time it feels like the camera is delibarately moving away from the enemy you are attacking. In the sum it is near impossible to have an overview of the battlefield or even to aim for one specific enemy. Even most games in the late 90's (when 3D-gaming was something new) had better camera movement than this. Seriously, who ever decided the game can be published with this camera should never be involved in game developement ever again. Yes, it's that bad.Graphics/Presentation: I like that instead of modeling a brownish desert-like wasteland the developers were going for an overgrown-by-plants like wasteland. So everthing looks really nice and colorful. Another thing that has to be mentioned is that the animations are very well done. Especially, the faces of the characters show an impressive amount of emotions.Story: For me it is a mixed back. The overall story is interesting enough and its presentation is, as mentioned before, really good. Unfortunately, the story shifts its tone half way through the story and trys to introduce some goofy/cheesy humour, which imho doesn't work out very well. Another problem is that there are to many cut-scenes in-between the battles. For me it just broke the game-flow if fights are constantly interrupted.Summary: Enslaved is a casual game with a good presentation. Casual here is ment without any negative connotation. So if you are looking for a nice distraction and can live with the atrocious camera behaviour I think I can give a recommendation. Just don't expect too much.			"

												Enslaved: Oddyssey to the West is a passable Action-Adventure game. It does most things right -- but shines in none.STORY:It's passable. The game is supposedly inspired by the Chinese novel ""Journey to the West"" published in the 16th century -- but from what I've heard saying the game even ""inspired by it"" is making it far-fetched. Hey, well actually the characters names are the same.Basically this girl named Trip has you locked on killswitch so that you'll agree to escort her west over a post-apocalyptic America infested with robotic Mechs and Slavers. Even though the game is basically one big escort mission Trip doesn't get herself killed much and is actually somewhat useful as she gives you some extra skills that are mostly used in puzzles.The thing that bothered me the most though was the lack of any clear villain through the very linear story. Sure, there was the mechs and some faction called the Slavers... but neither of them were really introduced or explained at any point. Yes, there is a driving reasoning for it all and yes, there is drama -- but really it all serves for just simple backdrop for a adventure no more complicated than a saturday morning Transformers episode.COMBAT:I'll point this out first! Gamepad is recommended if not required for this game! I highly recommend Xbox or any similar controller that uses Xinput drivers -- since the game supports them natively.The combat is simple - you got your basic light and heavy attacks with takedowns and dodges and blocks, plus some unlockable special moves. So don't expect any God of War style combos. For the most part the combat flows nicely but the dodge move feels a bit clunky and short ranged -- and sometimes the camera can give you a bit of a trouble but nothing too bad because the game is REALLY easy. (I played on medium difficulty, on hindsight I'd pick Hard.)OTHER GAMEPLAY:Well the other main focus of the game is platforming. Well - if you can call it that. The game is VERY linear and on top of that the platforming is contextual -- meaning you point to a direction and press jump and your character jumps to the next point, so there is absolutely no chance of missing jumps.Other than combat and platforming there are some very simple puzzles in the style of ""Push button A -> Pull lever B -> Door opens"" or ""Distract the robots"". It's simple but handles itself well enough.Oh, and it barely needs mentioning. But yes there is a VERY rudimentary system of unlocking skills and enhancments for your character... however, most of it is locked away throughout the game and when the upgrades finally unlock you can afford almost everything - so there is hardly any customization or choices to make. So what's the point?TECHNICAL ISSUES:I've heard some people have had some issues with this game however I haven't had any problems. I'd highy recommend checking out pcgamingwiki.com's article on this game. They have some really simple fixes to manage the most common issues.As for the port itself -- well it's really a half♥♥♥♥♥PC port. The options menu is laughable at best, simple resolution change and some minor settings. Nothing flashy.-------Well is the game any good? It's ok. If Steam had something inbetween 'Recommend' and 'Don't Recommend I would click that.I wouldn't pay full price for it but if you get it for like five bucks and get a few beers then you can finish this game in a weekend.

												Solid game. Beautiful setting, smooth flowing combat, and great voice talent for the characters. This game has an almost Jak & Daxter vibe. 3rd person, simplistic but engaging combat, and the cloud is totally the hoverboard from Jak II. Haven't seen any bugs except for the occasional hiccup with the A.I. pathing. Definitely worth a play and I highly reccomend it.			"

												This a an overlooked gem that I was happy to have played. It's linear, but it's never a bad thing as the game propels you forward to tell a stoary involving three unique characters. I highly reccommend this to anyone looking for a single player experience that continually grows on you to the end credits. It even has a side mission with Pigsy what is surprisingly long and has its own gameplay style separate from the main game!			"

												Enslaved is without a doubt one of rare and often overlooked gems from that failed to get the proper recognition it sorely deserves. Drawing inspiration from one of the greatest Chinese epics ever written and giving it a delicious modern flair, Enslaved, gives a jaw dropping performance in terms of visuals and acting. This is in no small part due to Andy Serkis' masterful performance as Monkey, delievering a performance that captures the player's attentions from start to finish. The narrative is also masterful written in a way that honors its source material, while at the same time giving it just enough of a modern touch that makes the story all the more engaging. I would highly reccomend this to anyone familiar with Journey to the West and who is also of video games as an art form and as a form of story telling.			"

												A lot of people crank down the games just because of the graphics and well they aren't the best but they work and the game is still from 2010, but it's not only for the looks of a game you buy it right?I like the story of the game and how well everything actually connects, the game has an very intresting storyline, unique characters and a very well done enviroment.People also crank down on the camera views but i've played the through it and i've only had one glitch where i couldn't get my camera to follow me so i just loaded the last checkpoint and it was solved.My experience with the game was actually over what i expected, i bought it on sale and i can say that this is one of very few games i've played through in one sitting. 7.5/10 from me, like and recommend it.

												i cannot recommend this game enough. do not let the hours fool you that i have on steam. i have played this many times on console, and i am currently about 1/2 way through it again. sure, its old and dated and his is problems.and trip is annoying at the best of times.  best played with a controller. But oh, man that story and the beauty sometimes just catches you. with a good computer you might just find yourself surprised. It is one of those game i think everyone should play atleast once. if you are just looking for something to chill and lose yourself in a great story. (the reimagined version of Monkey  magic) then this game might just be for you.			"

												This game is hands down the most underappreciated titles I have ever come across. I found out about this game on an obscure website after finishing the Uncharted series, wishing to find more games like it. Bought it in a deal for $5 and received exactly the kind of game I anticipated. It's not without it's minor flaws but all in all if you're looking for a solid story driven action game similar to the likes of Uncharted or the recent Tomb Raider reboots (albeit with a melee focus rather than gunplay) look no further. I give it 8/10			"

												So i finished the game a few minutes ago and ive gotta say i was relatively impressed. not the greatetst console port ever made but it definitely was worth the 5 bucks i paid for it.Pros- great graphics-good gameplay , doesnt feel stale and nasty after sitting at it for an hour or so.- OK story, wasnt super awesome, but that may have to do with the act that i generally pla vdeo games with hte sound off so i cna watch tv shows. this game had teh sound of fringe going to it. -free running is always awesome-Awesome homage to an awesome tv show, even if it has been done eredone and reedone some more a million times. (Monkey if you didnt know)-some hilarious dialogue between monkey and pigsy. ""get your hadn off my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; alawys wins a few laughs (no sound but always play with subtitles)Cons-Crazy short. way too short. even the DLC (which comes for free with the game was super short)-horrifying camera angles- No Sandy (pls let me know if there is somethign i missed)- ending was super lameSPOILER!!kill giant scorpion and find out you acutaully are teh bad guy, credits.All in all a very decent game, very pretty and good gameplay.7.7/10 "

												A solid game...that's also very lazy. The characters are very likable and the story is decent. In fact, it's what kept me playing even when the rest started to become a little tedious. The post-apocalyptic setting is well done with some nice locales mixed in.Unfortunately, those were the only outstanding aspects to me. The rest was just mediocre. The combat, while moderately challenging on hard, is very barebones. It has a very basic moveset that doesn't get expanded upon very much. That means that you're stuck with the same 3 attacks (light, heavy, aoe) for the most part. It could've used a more fleshed out skill progression system where you actually unlock new stuff to do. What makes the combat worse is the lack of enemy variety. There are 4 enemy types that get thrown at you and that's pretty much it. The 2 bosses that get recycled over and over again throughout the game don't help much either. It's not like there wasn't enough room to be creative, since the enemy are supposed to be mechs of all kinds and sizes.The ""platforming"", while cool to look at, didn't contribute much to the gameplay. It's basically climbing and parkour stuff along a very streamlined path with 0 danger of failure. I didn't mind this very much, but it could definitely have been more.I still recommend this since I enjoyed the overall experience, but only at a discount (picked it up for 5€).			"

												Just finished it. I think the actual gameplay took me about five hours with a few more while the pc was running while i was doing other stuff. At €5 that's like 1 euro per hour, you dont get that kind price per hour per entertainment from a dvd even.The story alone is worth it, the gameplay itself is little more than azura's wrath-style 'press-the-button-when-we-tell-you-to"" but this post-apocalyptic visually stunning  story-drive interactive animated movie with strong and well-designed characters dint bore me for a second. A very heroic hero, a sexy 29 year old pretending to be a teenage girl. Self-sacrifice, love, violence.... what more would one want. Trip is probaby one the nicest collection of polygons in a game one could hoped for and the story actually never comes to a standstill or a grind. At €5 a must pick-up			"

												A severely underrated game. Pros involved an interesting plot, fascinating translation of setting (compared to the original material), nuanced characters and very, VERY good performance acting (voice and motion included). The combat is repetitive, but I found it to be acceptable. My one complaint about the game would be that the world and action is far too often interrupted by small unskippable cutscenes to further the puzzle/platforming in the areas. Normal, pre-rendered or plot-based cutscenes were fine, but continually halting my gameplay just to show me where an obvious switch was or the path I needed to take to progress was got to be a bit disappointing when I was trying to enjoy the game and immerse myself.That small negative aside, the game truly is a hidden gem. It's soulful, has a lot of heart, and will grab you within the first 10min of gameplay (if it doesn't, then maybe it isn't the game for you). Purchased this with zero expectations since I had never heard of it and was absolutely blown away by the quality of writing, production, and entertainment. While there has been multiple confirmations that there is likely to be no sequel, I strongly hope that the cult following the game has garnered might help revive the effort. Your purchase of this product will help show (hopefully) that this critically acclaimed (but commercially unsuccessful) game has not gone unnoticed, and definitely not unloved.			"

The level design is tunneled, but it is really well made. The story is good, even if a bit cliche at times, but at least it does not take it self too seriously. Then there is the cloud, a freaky hoverbordish floatin disc, that the main character get to use from time to time, and each time it is really fun.

It tells its story in a very sensitive way and the gameplay may be described as a mix of Darksiders 1 and Tomb Raider 2013. Trip alone is worth watching and listening. Her beauty in shape and character is amazing ... just a dream. I bought it 3 days ago, play it in hard mode using a mouse and keyboard and enjoy it.

												Angry ape child wonders why frightened intelligent girl puts a slave band on his head to keep him from hurting her.  Despite her position of control, he still ends up ordering her around. I didn't know much of anything about the game, but I had some suspicions about its story when the ape child pulled out a staff as his main weapon. Move like an ape and swing a staff, there's really only one character he could be based on. When the names are revealed, yup, that explains the whole ""Odyssey to the West"" bit.This game shows promise. Its got decent graphics. The story its based on is classic. When you have no idea what world you're in and suddenly you pass a ruined Statue of Liberty, you get one of those rare ""woah, cool"" moments in gaming. However, it is deeply marred by its controls, especially the janky camera work. Sometimes you are moving fast. Sometimes slow. Sometimes the camera seems to follow you. Then it takes agency away. You think a jump join is a certain direction only to find out its the opposite. It creates frustration, but not quite enough to kick the game to the rubbish bin.			"

												Enslaved is the kind of game you never knew you wanted. How many people waited for a new Beyond good and evil that never happened? I did, as many other. What I did not know at the time, is that this game, would scratch that itch.The game's good. I mean it. Some moments are epic, I would dare to say some of them felt a little like the Uncharted series.The characters are funny, but mostly likable. Voice acting is pretty good and makes the whole experience very believable.The world and artstyle are beautifull. The whole world felt vivid and bright for a game about mechs.

												This game had been here and I just played it, what can I say is this is one great game. The story is good, sound, I even like the voice acting.The key configuration is the only this that is not perfect, but which I suggest to assign keys on keyboard. Just don't add mouse shortcut key then you're good to go. Only use the left and right mouse button. Reassign the middle mouse because its crappy for this game.Don't miss this out. This is a very great game!			"

												This game is beautiful on every level. It's a little gem that deserves more credit.The graphics are stunning and hit you in the eyes  with amazing colours and the overall high quality of the design.The great voice acting and the perfect facial animations help to connect with the characters of the game.The game itself is challenging and fun, It never felt to me boring or repetitive.The gameplay is actually an ""Escort"" type one, you have to take care of the NPC ""Trip"" all along the journey, but this characteristic is so well implemented that never feels like a boring burden to carry.It's instead defined by the story and functional to it and the gameplay benefits from this.It won't take long to beat the game, but the journey is worth it and emotional.And by the way, who said that a longer gameplay makes a better game?

I liked rich story and characters and despite problems with button auto remapping bug, game is very good and interesting.Minuses: parkour was waaay too easy (except when camera rotated at some skew angle and movements needed weird button combinations), enemies were not too hard and different from each other, I really would like if there were more hitting combos.

												Another hidden gem, found while rooting trough my library searching for something to play, while I don't have enough money for Nier.IntroductionI have actually been having this game on my radar for years, ever since I saw it on the cover of a danish free gaming magazine. I never really looked into what it was, and was solely interested in it because of the few screenshots/art I saw. I heard about it again when it was ported to PC, and then again when it was in the Bandai Namco Humble Bundle, where I bought it, but I didn't actually play until now. Fun fact: I started playing it because I was playing around with In Home Streaming, and have been playing this game from start to end via that service.Design and world buildingThis I feel is this games strongpoint, although I'd say it's not enterly lacking in all other points. Its some years old now, and it defenitly shows, but I really enjoyed the concepts of the world, from how the mechs took on this very mechanical look with giant cogs, to how characters and the environment is designed. If you are interested in post-post-apocalypse this game doesn't do a bad jobof building a nice world, and designing some cool characters and enemies to inhabit it. With that said, I feel like the standard mechs, were a little out of place, looking slightly too round and designed, but that is entirely my opinion.The giant mech, the leviathan, at the end of the game is very cool. Also loved the design and animation of the guy Trip kills in the very endGameplayThe gameplay is pretty decent character action, which I'm normally not fond of, because I suck major balls at it, but combat felt nice and fun, with (mostly) interesting enemies, and a few button combos. If character action is your jam, this game does a good job. Personally I think enemy variation was very sparse, and could have benefitted by doubling the amount of standard enemies, or at least creating varying looks for them.The end boss was pretty lame, turn valve, shoot stuff, fight adds, shoot more stuff, just kinda boringCharactersHere comes one of the worse points about this game in my opinion. I really liked Monkey's character, though he's the mandatory gruff-guy lead, but he was at least believeable and sensible, also probs to the voice actor he did a great job. Trip on the other hand I found to be a boring onesided stereotypical woman character. As a gameplay element she was cool, but her character was only ""shes the weak woman, also shes smart but we just think shes silly"". I expected her character to evolve more trough the story but I found she stayed pretty much in the same role.Now, Pigsy I really didn't like. He was designed to be comical relief, but was just unfunny, and whole thing with him liking Trip and being jelous at Monkey was cringeworthy at best, and just made him come off as creepy. Pigsy died at the end of the game, and that was supposed to be this hero-death, but it felt a little forced, and I found it hard to really care about him.StoryThe story was pretty okay, nothing great, and I certainly dont expect to remeber it as something great I experienced. I'm glad I played trough the game, but if you are in it to experience a great story, then take a pass, I would recommend playing Bioshock or Half Life 2 for something simillar (typical I know).I saw some people complaining about the end, and I can see where they are coming from, I didn't mind it, but that was only because it was as mediocre as the rest of the story.MusicI don't remeber the music, which probably means it was merely passable, to say something intlligent about it, I'd need to go back and play again, but I can't be arsed.In conclusionI enjoyed the game, it didn't outstay it's welcome, and it defenitly wasn't bad. The gameplay is very competent, and the story is fine, didn't care for the characters much though. If you are looking for cheap-ish character action you wouldn't go wrong with Enslaved. Also if you are looking for cool designs and a nicely designed post-post-apocalyptic world, Enslaved has it for you as well.TL;DR: Competent Character-Action, bland story, bland characters, buy for gameplay.If I were to give it a score I'd give it a very solid 6/10.

												Finished this around 8 hours and I must say this was a sleeper hit for sure. Great story, voice acting, sound/music and the graphics were really good with great use of colors. There were some technical issues regarding remapping controls and resolution but they can be fixed with ini tweaking and 3rd party tools (razer software for me). No FOV slider but that can be fixed with widescreen fixer. The melee combat could have used a little work and I wish it had more variety but it did not hamper the game at all, using the Cloud device was fun as hell too. Platforming was done very well with very little chance to actually ♥♥♥♥ up a jump or fall to your death, you character pretty much snaps to anything he grabs onto and you just have to steer him in the right direction. No quick saving or manual saves but a very good checkpoint system was in place. There were a few times I had to fight the camera system and I did get a little nauseous a couple of times with how much it moves around.I highly recommend this game to anyone			"

												Really enjoyed the game. It has nice interesting story and setting, graphics is beautiful, although looks a bit dated in 2016, but as a whole it's a total win and the gameplay includes some variety. A lot of action and yet not too hardcore, so a pleasure to play, i.e. although the game contains several challenging parts this is not a kind of work to do repeating the same tedious checkpoints thousand times like in some other games.Only one negative point -- required some hacks to apply to fix graphics rendering issues (glitchy shadows).

												HELL YES I RECOMMEND THIS GAMEI mean, its pretty old now, but holy hell they dont make them like this any more. Apart from the fact that Trip is a total B and that basically the entire story revolves around a massive miscommunication, a trope I personally find entirely sucide worthy, the actualy gameplay is phenominal. Action, adventure, robotic droids trying to blow your face off... it doesnt even matter that the graphics and the quality is dated, the story is so powerfully compelling you dont even notice.That said, things do start to get a bit weird when Monkey, the character you play, starts having these flash back Hallucination type vision things, but, again, the story is so well developed and fleshed out by that point that it doesnt even matter. Even the end, which is truly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Neon Genesis worthy, its completely acceptable because by the time you reach it your whole mind is blown all over your face anyway, so why the hell wouldnt it end like that you know?In fact, Im thinking im gonna have to play this again some time soon. I wasnt expecting much the first time around but my god did it deliver.			"

												Nice game.  I was intrigued by it as I love the Journey to the West story of Sun Wukong (the Monkey King).  There are a few analogues in terms of characters and equipment but I kind of wish there were more analogues to the story (i.e. kicked out of heaven for causing trouble/stealing the peaches of immortality, being imprisoned under a mountain for getting on the wrong side of Buddha, breaking into the underworld to free his monkey buddies etc.) .Gameplay is ncie, fighting is failry basic but doesn't feel limited or repetitive (as fighting is not really the focus of the game).  The climbing feels very slick when you get the timing right and the puzzels are enough of a challenge to make you think but not hard enough to make you frustrated.My only real annoyance with the game is that it is quite easy to bipass loot and then not be able to go back and pick it up again.  For example, you could jump off/climb up a ledge only to realize that you had missed out on picking something up but then you can't retun to that spot to get it.  However, this is maybe just a problem with my OCD which wants me to complete every part of the game/collect everything and wouldn't be a problem to someone of more reasonable mental outlook :)			"

												I played this game primarily for the story, I heard it was interesting. Let me tell you I certainly wasn't dissapointed in the slightest on that front. My devotion to the story was so great that when i accidentally skipped a cutscene at the end of a chapter, I replayed the entire chapter to see the cutscene again. I also rewatched the epilogue a couple of times because  philosophy was going through my head, and I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything. Great storyThe game was certainly limited in terms of controls, I had to open up the ini files to figure out some of the key bindings for the ol' mouse and keyboard. I recommend a controller, it would work better I think.Combat is a little shallow, especially if you didn't look up some of the key Bindings, but it can be fun and challenging, and the bosses are good. Its a good game with a great story that satisfied me, therefore I recommend it.			"

 An Unexpected, if Mixed Journey to the West(Full disclosure: I bought this game on impulse during a sale and had it sitting in my library for almost two years before I played it)Inspired by one of the most well-known of the four great classics of Chinese literature, Journey to the West, Odyssey to the West plays fast and loose with much of its source material in interesting ways. As someone who isn't particularly interested in the source material, I wasn't terribly bothered by its deviations, though history geeks will have a field day ripping it a new one.Odyssey to the West's shining achievement is its story and the relationship between Trip and Monkey. Trip herself is a gold mine of interesting character interpretations: is she just a teenager using whatever tools she can to survive in a world gone mad, even if it involves enslaving a man? Or does she seriously lack empathy and is willing to break promises for the sake of revenge? .Monkey's no slouch either, being much more than just a muscular, snarking, angry anti-hero. The way they play off each other is fantastic, and with the exception of one scene near the end of the game, I was completely enthralled by how their relationship progressed. The authenticity of Monkey and Trip's relationship brings to mind the best partnerships in gaming, such as Joel and Ellie from The Last of Us, or Link and Midna from Twilight Princess. Unfortunately, there are no other ""real"" characters besides these two, which makes the game feel empty. The two named characters that are introduced besides them , Pigsy and Pyramid,  fall flat due to the former's irritating mannerisms (with few redeeming moments, though they are meaningful) and the latter's lack of screentime. The war that tore the planet is barely talked about, reducing much of its significance since there's effectively zero information about the world before it was destroyed, or what destroyed it. The lack of audio logs, codexes, or other information-giving collectibles would have alleviated this, but the only collectibles are those used for upgrades, and masks, which are effectively meaningless until the end of the game.Though the game suffers from some loading glitches and framerate drops, the game is still gorgeous, with a richly detailed post-apocalyptic world that reminds me of, yet again, The Last of Us. Destroyed mechanical titans lay in scattered heaps on overgrown, damp city streets, and giant junkyards made of cobbled-together mechanical parts offer safe passage over dangerously oily water. The world is full of color and light. The animation work is excellent. While not yet crossing the uncanny valley, facial movements are accurate and impressive. Monkey's movements in particular are a sight to behold, as he dodges, clambers up ledges, and even holds himself in an accurately simian manner.The music is surprisingly good, reminding me a bit of the Metroid Prime games in a good way, and the voice acting is impressive and nuanced.Unfortunately, the gameplay is more of a mixed bag. While combat is satisfying, it quickly grows repetitive due to the very limited pools of moves available and the lack of enemy variety, since all enemies are just robots that fall into one of five categories and feature various states of rust or disuse. The ability to exploit flaws in your enemies' design is interestng, on the other hand (for example, ripping open a decayed power cell on a scout to turn him into a walking bomb), opening up opportunities to turn the tide in unexpected ways.Boss fights are a letdown. While a few early ones are interesting, they gradually drop in quality due to overly large health bars, poorly-scripted phase changes, or the recycling of previous bosses.Upgrading Monkey requires currency that can be found around the world or gathered from enemies, and while most don't drastically change your playstyle and are of varying usefullness, filling out Monkey's skill trees is still fun, if irritating due to how hard it is to find tech orbs after you've cleared a level.The few vehicles sections handle well and don't overstay their welcome. Monkey has a  Cloud (actually a disk, but you know what they were going for)  that he busts out for some bosses or watery areas, and it's a blast to rocket around on it.Traversal feels remarkably similar to Infamous in all the best ways. Monkey can grapple, climb, jump, or swing from impressively high or complicated structures, and the movement itself can almost become an engaging sort of puzzle.Speaking of puzzles, some of the environment-based ones are quite entertaining, though not on the level of a dedicated puzzle game. An encounter in a dilapidated opera house that requires you to manipulte props, scaffolding, and lighting is particularly interesting.Unfortunately, the camera is your constant enemy, rapidly changing orientation when you round a corner or failing to indicate where to go next when grappling around. In combat, it can often fail to properly display where enemies are, and its sluggish movement makes the (thankfully rare) shooting sections incredibly frustrating.While I won't detail specifics, the final level tries too hard to wrap up loose ends and feels anticlimactic in comparison to previous stages. The ending in particular is sudden and confusing, attempting to introduce elements minutes before the credits roll.ENSLAVED: Odyssey to the West is not a bad game. The story, characters (all two of them), sound and visuals are almost universally excellent, and some of the combat, puzzles and exploration can be fun. However, the overall lack of variety or depth in the combat, letdowns in terms of the story, and some truly terrible camera angles, shooting sections, and boss fights keep this back from achieving true greatness in all respects.Also, seriously, Trip, please put more clothes on. Pros: Trip and Monkey's relationship is the highlight of the game Excellent music and voice acting Colorful, interesting world design and characters Upgrade system is satisfying Puzzles and movement are engaging Vehicle sections don't take too long Cons: Repetitive, shallow combat The god-damn camera No interesting characters besides Trip and Monkey, or really any, for that matter Visual bugs and framerate drops The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera Shooting sections are frustrating because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera Boss fights are lackluster Ending leaves much to be desired The GODAMN CAMERA Seriously, Trip, please put something else on. No, not the ""Sexy Robot Trip"" outfit, that's worse. "

												This is a REALLY fun game!It has similar game mechanics to Prince of Persia and it's very much a jumping game, but I got hooked on the story more than anything. The main guy, Monkey, reminds me of a tattoo artist I had do some work on me. but better looking and MUCH smarter! lol!The gamer itself isn't hard from the start, though there are challenging parts that pop up here and there.

												I thought it was fun. I little repetitive but still fun. the story does grab you but the ending seems to take a little too long and just isn't really good... Gameplay is fine. A little trouble with the camera and figuring out where to go but nothing to make your bloodpressure rise. Not a lot of variation in the enemies but there's some variation in the gameplay so that kinda makes up for it for a little bit.All and all, I bought and played in on the Xbox and bought and played it again on Steam so I like it enough for that. Voiceacting is sublime I think, and the facial animations are really awesome when you think about when this game was made			"

												Good game with very good sci fi story and characters and good looking post apocolyptic sci fi setting. Sometimes changing camera angles create some confusion, but not so bad. Interaction with Trip is enjoyable as I certainly enjoyed being enslaved by her, carrying her and throwing her to those hard to reach places. Pigsy is also a good character providing some humor. Pigsy's Perfect 10 plays differently than the Odyssey and nicely timed auto saves provide for planning and preparing for what is needed to be done in some of the more difficult combat sequences. Both are definitely worth playing and certainly woth picking up on sale, no doubt. I would score Odyssey around 85 and Pigsy's Perfect 10 at around an 80 on the metacritic scale.			"

The story is very moving. Game has excellent replay value because you get to keep all the skills you have unlocked and you can start any chapter again. The evolving relationship between Trip and Monkey is awesome! Highly recommend this if you like action RPG.			"

												After playing it, Ebslaved became one of my favorite games. It is simply fun to play, bright, and entertaining: very much a 'video game' rahter than an 'experinece' or a 'revelation' that some games have become recently. The game has a great sense of progression, fluent gameplay, and still very good visuals with surprisingly good facial animations. If you just want something fun to play through and be left satisfied, Enslaved is likely a great choice.			"

												7/10This game has alot of things going for it.  I'd  really been wanting to play it since it's console release, but even though I owned the PS3 I never picked it up. Keeping my eyes opened for a port over to pc it finally got released and it's a great trip.The game Starts out not giving you much detail about the world and one of the biggest faults is you really never learn much more then what you start off knowing. The story is all about the current journey being taken by Monkey and Trip thoughout the game you will learn mostly nothing other then a war happened and now humans are all but extinct. That is not to say the game dosen't give you a great story  actully it makes since the world has long moved on and the porblems from hundrends of years ago are lost amongst the ruins of the world that once was.Combat in the game is smooth, but pretty much what you can do  from the first few levels is it nothing new is added  into the game.The pacing of the game is the shinning aspect the team that put this together knew what was important with the lack of indepth combat and the levels that are really linear. This game taken as a full package is a great game. The characters story thoughout the game is really enjoyable. The overall story is well told. The graphics still hold up to many current gen games so do the character models. The combat and the linear levels hold this game back the most, but is still a fun journey thoughtout and with the pacing you will be switching just at the right time from combat to platforming.			"

												First off, the story involves you escorting an NPC to her home village. Off the bat that sounds like it is going to be a bad game. Actually, Trip is a bit smarter than most AI characters and tends to not get in the way to often.The graphics in this game are really well done. They took a good amount of time to show how the jungle toke over most locations. As you progress you slowly see the environment transition into the next area. As the wind blows you can see various objects flutter by just adding to the realism and desolace of where you currently are.The music in this game is not anoying and compliments the gameplay quite well. The voice acting is great. Dialog however can be quite absurd at times. The combat is your standard hack and slash with mini quicktime events for certain enemies. You have your standard attacks and your shooting atacks. The movement is very standard and quite responsive. The camera angles every so often will get in the way but for the most part allow you to see what you are doing.To add to the storyline, there are items that show parts of the past. At the beginning these seam to be just jibberish. As you get towards the end, they start to make sence on what is going on. Which leads to the ending. Without spoiling it, the ending is quite different and a bit far fetched,This is one of those good games that got overshadowed by to many titles coming out around its time. Definitely a game worth playing.			"

												A surprising gem of a game, and underappreciated.  I'm heartily impressed by the visuals, and the interplay between the characters and steady drip-drip of the story elements are fascinating.  The gameplay also is quite fun.  the mix between puzzle platformer and simplistic combat keeps the game entertaining without being frustrating. I can see how the combat can become or feel repetitive, but I'm okay with that, since the work of getting to the enemies is really where the game shines.  The puzzle platformer side.The cons to it, perhaps, is that you cannot fail a jump. Don't expect to fall tragically to your death, ala Assassin Creed franchise.  If the jump isn't possible, he won't try.  However, it makes up for it with certain sections requiring you to jump in rapid sucession to survive.  The secondary con is the camera.  The game itself rotates and moves it around, the idea being to help the player it appears and give the game a somewhat cinematic feel.  It didn't bother me most of the time, but a few times it was in an awkward spot.Generally though, I'm heartily impressed. I'd recommend this game, and with it currently on sale in the steam store 75% off, a relatively cheap ""risk"" if you buy it.			"

You will need to manually change settings in the .ini, but besides a few annoying bugs, it can still be fun and the story is worth it.  The DLC mission is less fun but at least its included.			"

												The good: Colorful scenery, good voice acting, good pacing, loved Piggy and Truffle. Low impact gameplay for those times where you don’t want to get too involved. The bad: Gameplay gets repetitive after a while. Requires a controller.  Combat is very shallow with a light attack, a heavy attack, and a few special moves thrown in. The platforming is way too easy; just hold direction and press button on controller. The plot is pretty thin and predictable. Platforming hand holds and drop downs can get lost in the environment leading to frustration on where to go next or what the path forward is. 6/10. Recommend getting during a sale.  "

												Enslaved has defenitely made it into my top favorite games! Its story is touching, the charcters lovable (well, maybe not Pigsy) and the fighting is fun. There are so much more different facial expressions than I've ever seen in a game before. You always know how the characters are feeling.The small bossfights are fun, and really, who doesnt want to fly around on a mechanical cloud and do cool stunts? I disliked some things, like the Machine Gun defense games, where you just have to stay on one point an shoot everything, but luckily, there are not too many of those. I also disliked Pigsy, but thats maybe just me.So whoever wants to play a game with a great story, and amazing scenery, I recommend this to you!			"

												The gameplay mechanics are very fun. The story is mostly predictable but is well told, and the characters are generic but are well acted and pretty likeable. There are some game-design choices that I personally found annoying and unnecessary, like for example having to backtrack to where a cutscene started (assuimng the characters move during the cutscene) just because there are some collectables back there that are necessary for upgrading yourself and you can't pick them up during the cutscene.There were defintely some points where I thought ""♥♥♥♥ this game"", but overall I enjoyed the experience and would recommend giving it a try			"

												I did not know what I was getting into when I got the game. It was actually suprising.  A port from the PS3, it is actually very well done.  I only encountered two bugs during the 8 hour playthrough where my character froze in the classic cross pose and would not respond.  I have yet to play the piggsy extra.  The game overall reminds me a little of Uncharted/Left Behind with the two characters talking with each other as you explore the old ruins with some very easy platforming and hand to hand combat thrown in for the action.  I really should not call it platforming as you can never really fall to your death and only on a few levels are there moving cogs and stuff that can actually kill you but it is very fluid and well done. There is some stealth thrown in but I found it much easier to just kill eveyrthing.  There is ussually a boss at the end of a level with some mid bosses half way through but they are fairy easy do defeat.  The graphics are suprisingly good but if not to your liking you can always use some sweetFX to fancy them up a bit.  There are some good community guides for helping tweek some of the more common graphic complaints.  The overall game is a little short.  The story while good, leaves more questions than it does answers specifically with the setting.  There are some funny bits of comedy thrown in the mix.   A good game if you want something fun and short.   "

												I played this game primarily for the story, I heard it was interesting. Let me tell you I certainly wasn't dissapointed in the slightest on that front. My devotion to the story was so great that when i accidentally skipped a cutscene at the end of a chapter, I replayed the entire chapter to see the cutscene again. I also rewatched the epilogue a couple of times because  philosophy was going through my head, and I wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything. Great storyThe game was certainly limited in terms of controls, I had to open up the ini files to figure out some of the key bindings for the ol' mouse and keyboard. I recommend a controller, it would work better I think.Combat is a little shallow, especially if you didn't look up some of the key Bindings, but it can be fun and challenging, and the bosses are good. Its a good game with a great story that satisfied me, therefore I recommend it.			"

												so..its really hard to rate this game.it is probably the most epic in scope and story that i have seen in years before and of recent. Picking up where Prince of Persia began to stumble, and birthing a fight system that stares deeply into the eyes of God of War and Beyond Good and Evil, it would seem like perfection. STUNNING envionments, multiple upgrades, multiple play styles, enviro-puzzles, cloud surfing, Mechs, a female protaganist that will make your pants feel too tight every second she is on the screen; it really is mind-blowing.but then there was the camera. all said, this is also of the more frustrating games i have played to date (and there have been some rough ones). almost ALL deaths will revolve around losing the camera, missing a strike in the combo system, and being butt♥♥♥♥♥♥♥due to not being able to face the opponent. the rest will probably invole the controls not responding at key moments for jumps/ bosses and causing rage-inducing retrys.i mean the acting in the cut-scenes alone make this worth playing...and it carries a DEEP cult feel a la Beyond Good and Evil...this could have been my favorite game...but its not. if you have patience, try it out.

												To be hounest, when I first started playing this I used a mouse and keyboard, didn't like the control, tried it with my cheap logitech controller but I normally only use my controller for racing games, platformers or fighting games like Mortal Kombat.  So it didn't feel right to me and stopped playing after an hour or so.A year later I decided to try it again but this time I had a steam controller and I must say it went so much better, It took a while for me to get the right configuration for me but once I liked the way my controller was set up I really enjoyed the game. It's not spectecular but the characters feel real, the facial animation, their behaviour, the way they talk, it all feels genuine and that's the greatest strenght of the game. If you like third person action games you will probably like this if you don't mind using a controller. I recommend the Steam Controller if you're not used to it.			"

												Overall it's a pretty good game. If you know the story of Journey To The West at all, (or Dragonball, which is probably what most people will compare it to) you will see the similarities very quickly.The characters and plot are enjoyable, and the game design itself is beautiful.I found that there were a lot of flaws though, and some really gave me problems during the game.The biggest of these were the controls; the camera, though controllable through a lot of the game, becomes automatic for certain sequences in the game, usually important ones like boss battles. I found myself constantly battling the camera to see what i wanted to see, and ended up dying countless times because it swung around just when i had got it into place, and meant i couldn't see where the giant mech was charging at me.This is exacerbated by the level design. Often the major battles end up being in circular arena-type areas, and when you get close to the edge, it automatically faces outwards, so you can't keep an eye on the boss while you're collecting plasma or health around the edge of the arena. Extremely frustrating.Equally frustrating was the platforming, which i found rigid and fiddly. I don't know if it's down to the port, but i can't remember the number of times i was trying to vault a barrier, jump a gap on the cloud or jump between handholds at speed, and ended up watching as Monkey shook his head in refusal, did a roll instead, or just straight-up dove head first into the hole. There were a few more rage-quits than there needed to be, purely because of clunky controlls.That being said, i played through first time on hard, and the chapters seemed to go from virtually impossible because of the crappy controls and bad camera, to surprisingly easy because of an easy layout and limited number of enemies; it seems like perhaps the difficulty levels weren't successfully executed.In terms of plot, the overall story is compelling, but doesn't quite go deep enough. The ultimate antagonist (Pyramid) is really a non-entity until the very end of the game, you have no real understanding who they are or what they do, and no idea why anyone would even know what they were called or that they existed until basically 3/4 of the way through. All of that said, overall, i would probably give this game a 6.5 in spite of the problems i was having. It really is beautiful to look at, and very atmospheric. It's also super satisfying to watch Monkey and his gigantic arms tear huge machines limb from limb. It has some really funny moments, and the central characters have good chemistry. It could perhaps do with an update to some of its mechanics, but i enjoyed it, and completing the highest difficulty is pretty satisfying after being killed So. Many. Times.I'll probably play the DLCs and other difficulties in the future.			"

												I had previously purchased this in 2014, played it for awhile, and stopped. I only eventually finished the game just today.Prior to the Steam Summer Sale 2014, I had never heard of this game before. The combat and puzzles tend to be a bit lackluster and eventually feel a bit linear. There are some situations where the camera becomes fixed and the viewing angle becomes troublesome, but definitely not a deal breaker.The champions of this game are the story, the character development, and the voice acting. Most probably don't know that the story is loosely based on the Chinese tale, Journey to the West. The environment is such a mystery – a world long after some unnamed apocalypse, where vegetation has reclaimed the once polluted, noisy urban setting. Somewhere in the vast expanse of this world are clues to what’s really going on. There are subtle hints of some place out west, where slaves are taken and never return.The simple yet believable dialogue conveys intriguing moments of real emotion between Monkey and Trip, and combined with their surprisingly human expressions, gives weight and depth to their characters which tends to be rare in videogames nowadays. In addition, the game doesn't seem to give justice behind it's writer Alex Garland (28 Days Later.)The character development would not have been complete without it's voice actors, specifically the protagonist's, whose voice was recorded by none other than the great Andy Serkis.All of the aspects I've mentioned come together in a way that makes Enslaved feel not quite like anything I've played before. Sure, the gameplay in itself isn't exactly original, but by adding substance through characterization, a world full of history, and those small moments that pull you in to the story, it turned out be something quite special.

												I have to say in terms of beauty, characters and overall acting this game is one hell of an awesome trip. The scenery is awesome, the characters believable and well written. The overall story is gripping and entertaining. However, this game also has some serious issues. First the combat is so-so, but the wonky mouse/keyboard controls, and the weird camera angles and shifts make the combat outright horrible. Secondly, the cutscenes cannot be skipped. If you struggle a bit - like me - you might have to watch some scenes a couple of times, without having a way to abort them. Come on folks, it's 2016. I have to give the game credit for the take down animations without quick time events. The climbing parts are fun and fluid, with only a few places suffering from the dreadful camera movement. Overall I'd recommend the game, just be prepared to be frustrated by the controls and the camera.Overall I rate 8/10, the nature of this game is irrepressable!			"

												Completed the game on hard with 100% achievements.Dislikes:Controls are very clunky. Playing with mouse and keyboard would be a pain. I played with the Xbox 360 controller, but it still felt like it could use some polishing. Probably because it was ported from console platform.Gameplay was bland at the best. Fighting sequences were too easy and repetitive: your run-of-the-mill press X to attack, Y to attack stronger, A to evade and b to block.Platforming was simple yet messy. It takes a long time to get used to it because it doesn’t move smoothly. Don’t expect Assassin’s Creed’s smooth climbing in this game. No matter how properly you are lined up to jump to the next platform, you find yourself doing flips at the edge instead of jumping over.Boss fights were generic yet frustrating (although I did play on hard).I got the game mostly because I was interested in the story. It didn’t turn out to be the best plotline, the voice acting seemed forced and unnatural, and character development was cheesy.Visuals are bit outdated, Even for its time. Textures are blurry, and it is really hard to believe they used motion capture for the actors, because the character movement and model seemed really shabby.Likes:This game is definitely not for everyone. If you get impatient with the things I mentioned above, you won’t likely last through the first two chapters.  Nevertheless, if you are tired of playing hard-core games and are looking for a break in a casual platformer with interesting world setting and a story driven adventure, it’s not a terrible game. I am guessing you could finish the game in 10 hours through a casual run. Grab it when it’s on 75%+ sale.Other:I spent so much time on the game because I like completing games with 100% achievements. This game was especially tough, because there are these collectables called orbs (in-game currency for upgrades) that are nearly impossible to find all 100%, and they aren’t even that rewarding for in-game content (there is plenty of extra orbs from fights). But if you don’t care about achievements, moot point. "

												As a scholar of East Asian culture and Journey to the West, I was eager to see how this game adapted the classic novel. It was nothing like I expected. Instead of ancient, it was futuristic, and instead of animal companions, everyone looked human and modern. It's similar to how Akira Toriyama handled his own adaptation of Journey to the West in Dragon Ball, where Xuanzang is a woman who uses technology instead of a man who uses faith. So if you're familiar with the source material, then it's a great game from that perspective.What weighs Enslaved down is the repetitive game design. Once you've finished the first level, you've experienced about 90% of the game. That is to say, running, jumping, climbing, and attacking robots. This rinse and repeat process wears you down and will make you want to stop playing after a couple of hours. As a result, you play it like you would a book: reading a couple chapters and stopping. The reason you pick it up again is because the story is so compelling. What saves this game and makes it worth playing is the writing, voice acting, graphics, music, and few stellar moments of memorable gameplay. Push through the countless robots and you'll find it was a positive experience. The DLC is much longer and polished than I expected it to be, and almost rivals the main game. I hope the creative team behind Enslaved make a sequel or a new series in a simlar style.			"

												Angry ape child wonders why frightened intelligent girl puts a slave band on his head to keep him from hurting her.  Despite her position of control, he still ends up ordering her around. I didn't know much of anything about the game, but I had some suspicions about its story when the ape child pulled out a staff as his main weapon. Move like an ape and swing a staff, there's really only one character he could be based on. When the names are revealed, yup, that explains the whole ""Odyssey to the West"" bit.This game shows promise. Its got decent graphics. The story its based on is classic. When you have no idea what world you're in and suddenly you pass a ruined Statue of Liberty, you get one of those rare ""woah, cool"" moments in gaming. However, it is deeply marred by its controls, especially the janky camera work. Sometimes you are moving fast. Sometimes slow. Sometimes the camera seems to follow you. Then it takes agency away. You think a jump join is a certain direction only to find out its the opposite. It creates frustration, but not quite enough to kick the game to the rubbish bin.			"

												So far I have just about 3 1/2 hours on record in this game. But it wont take anyone that long to see just what a great little game this is for your free time Between Assassins Creed and FarCry4 or what ever life throws your way. I am just about through with Chapter 3 and this game has kept a smile on my face the whole time. The Resolution at first was a problem as it is locked in the settings in game menu. But after reading the forums on how to change it, I was up and going in less then 2 minutes with this beautiful gem. The story is interesting and keeps you laughing but also drags you deeper into actually caring to protect your female companion even if she did strap what is basically a mine to your head that is attached to her heart beat. If you can go beyond the little effort it takes to proceed in this game and just enjoy the adventure of the game you will not be disappointed. From a reponcive combat system to even wake boarding on a ""Cloud"" device this game is a cool ride.  I had gotten this game for $5usd on a Steam sale but compairing this to a game I just bought for $90.00 (Gold Edition) that stutters has frame drops and is just a hot mess this one runs flawless even in SLI @ 2560X1440. I look forward to finishing the story and trying out the highly recommended Mini games that are a nice present in addition to the main story. DaddySadFace's Verdict: 2 Thumbs up!			"

												Enslaved was a nice surprise, even though I had never heard of this Playstation 3 port before, it is worth a look. While the gameplay is not overly complex there is a nice variety of different types of activities in this game. Graphics are nice for being this old of a game, nothing spectacular mind up but pleasant enough. The levels are interesting and well layout, but what most games forget this game has plenty of, fun. This game is fun, nice voice acting, and a nice story to go along with this hidden gem. I would definably play this game with a gamepad, that’s what the game was made for and I believe that is the best way to have fun with this game.			"

												Too much glitching to be able to play :(While the story isimmersive, the environments beautiful, the characters memorable, the game is unplayable due to all the glitches.Your AI partner ""Trip"" does just that. At times she seems to just fall through the ground endlessly which forces you to restart. I currently cannot pass the 2nd ""boss"" no matter how many times I've reloaded the game because he's supposed to enter the area to start the battle by smashing through a wall, but instead he slowly walks THROUGH the wall and you cannot finish the battle because of it.It's a damn shame that such an epic game is filled with such epic fail which has made it unplayable........I'm still suggesting that you buy this game in hopes that one day they fix it.

												Definitely requires a controller, that aside, i really enjoyed it. The story was well told, the characters were genuinely likable and the combat with smooth and fluid. I played on normal mode difficulty and to be honest that was a little on the easy side. The lack of ammo was an annoyance more then anything, i would have liked to have seen at least the red ammo regenning over time, even if that was something you would have to unlock. It would also be nice to have more of the co-operative action between you and trip, but i did enjoy the game. definitely one of those missed gems that really should have done better.			"

												TL:DR pretty good game with a decent story and likeable characters in Trip and Monkey. The gameplay revolves around climbing and close combat that isnt too bad itself but gets a bit boring towards the end of the game. Enslaved is loosely based on the Chinese story Journey to the West. Its set in the future where most of humanity has been wiped out and the survivors live in fear of mechs who capture or kill people. The main character Monkey finds himself imprisoned on a slave ship at the beginning of the game when the games other main character Trip, attempts an escape. The ensuing chaos allows Monkey to also attempt to escape as the ship crashes. Monkey awakens to find Trip has fitted a slave headband that will kill him if he doesnt do what she says. Her only order for Monkey is to get her back to her home. The game has you playing as Monkey with Trip as an AI controlled companion. Most of the game revolves around climbing structures and platforms, quite similar to the climbing in the Uncharted series, with a bit of combat against the mechs where Monkey uses a retractable staff. I quite liked the story and Trip and Monkey are also both likeable characters as their initial uneasy alliance blossoms into a friendship.This game was overlooked a bit (a bit undeservedly) on its initial console release but it is a pretty good game even though the gameplay gets a bit stale towards the end though. This edition also features the DLC Pigsy's Perfect 10 which is also a decent add on where you play another character from the main game Pigsy with a more stealth focused type of gameplay.Good points:- Enjoyable story and Trip and Monkey are both likeable characters.- the companion AI for Trip is actually quite good. Games with an AI companion can be hit or miss but they get it right here.- I loved the level design particularly the earlier levels in the ruins of New York. Rather than go for the grim dark crumbling ruins of other post-apocalyptic games the ruins in Enslaved are full of colourful plant life as nature reclaims the city and it does lookreally nice.-The Pigsys Perfect 10 dlc story is quite a good add on which mixes up the gameplay from the main game with a bigger focus on stealth.Bad points:- There is very little variety of enemies particularly bosses. Most of the bosses are the same couple of mechs which you'll fight a few times throughout the game.- Combat mostly boils down to button bashing with the fast and heavy attacks. You can unlock other attacks but theres never much cause to use them.- The camera is a bit finicky at times as it will suddenly snap to a new angle as you move around a level and it can be a bit disorientating.

												Wanted to play Enslaved for years, ever since it came out. Didn't really live up to my teenage expectations but still a decent game. Gameplay is in general responsive and fun; it really feels like you're jumping around giant mechs in this distopian world. It is however quite linear as it's segmented into chapters which play from A to B with the same mechanics. It did feel repetative at times which is why I didn't play this game in one go, even though it is entirely possible given the 10h story. Just was more fun playing in 2h burst to me, since the chapters switch as followed:  Parkour - Melee - Shooting Range - Boss Fight.The story is a nice take on the Journey to the West. I liked the post-apokalyptic setting and the animation as well as the charakters grew on me... expect of Pigsy... oh god, he's just so repulsive...It has its ups and down, pretty generic and to me littered with a lot of outdated sensibilities but the quieter scenes and especially the two protagonist and their performance did sell it for me. The ending was very sudden, would have liked a bit more build-up but as I said, all in all it's still a solid story. If you're in for a action packed Hollywood story and decent gameplay I guess I would recommend it. Give it a go when on sale or not if that prior scentence really spoke to you. PS: There's a second game included which stirs up the gameplay and ups the stealth. Haven't played through that yet but until now it's quite okay. Still not very fond of that game's protagonist though...			"

												HELL YES I RECOMMEND THIS GAMEI mean, its pretty old now, but holy hell they dont make them like this any more. Apart from the fact that Trip is a total B and that basically the entire story revolves around a massive miscommunication, a trope I personally find entirely sucide worthy, the actualy gameplay is phenominal. Action, adventure, robotic droids trying to blow your face off... it doesnt even matter that the graphics and the quality is dated, the story is so powerfully compelling you dont even notice.That said, things do start to get a bit weird when Monkey, the character you play, starts having these flash back Hallucination type vision things, but, again, the story is so well developed and fleshed out by that point that it doesnt even matter. Even the end, which is truly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Neon Genesis worthy, its completely acceptable because by the time you reach it your whole mind is blown all over your face anyway, so why the hell wouldnt it end like that you know?In fact, Im thinking im gonna have to play this again some time soon.

												Aside from an odd graphical glitch from time to time, causing a sort of banding in the shadows on character surfaces, the visuals in Enslaved are stunning.The combat is as you'd expect from this sort of title, mildly frenetic, not particularly deep, can be achieved mostly through button mashing, but more control yields better results.The voice work was fantastic in my opinion. Really believable characterisation with little nuances here and there that make each one unique.Storywise, it drops you right in with little explanation but that's not really an issue as things are explained fully as you progress.Oh, and the version I got (possibly all versions) came with what was for me an extra 4.5 hours of gameplay in the form of an extended mission set with a different protagonist to the main game. The extra missions were the same playstyle, but with different tactics, which was very refreshing. In fact, I played the extra missions through in one sitting, often thinking ""Cor, I'd have thought this would be over by now given it's an added extra, but it's still going...""All in all, highly recommended for anyone who enjoys third person combat and platforming of the roughly Prince of Persia vein.

												Nice game.  I was intrigued by it as I love the Journey to the West story of Sun Wukong (the Monkey King).  There are a few analogues in terms of characters and equipment but I kind of wish there were more analogues to the story (i.e. kicked out of heaven for causing trouble/stealing the peaches of immortality, being imprisoned under a mountain for getting on the wrong side of Buddha, breaking into the underworld to free his monkey buddies etc.) .Gameplay is ncie, fighting is failry basic but doesn't feel limited or repetitive (as fighting is not really the focus of the game).  The climbing feels very slick when you get the timing right and the puzzels are enough of a challenge to make you think but not hard enough to make you frustrated.My only real annoyance with the game is that it is quite easy to bipass loot and then not be able to go back and pick it up again.  For example, you could jump off/climb up a ledge only to realize that you had missed out on picking something up but then you can't retun to that spot to get it.  However, this is maybe just a problem with my OCD which wants me to complete every part of the game/collect everything and wouldn't be a problem to someone of more reasonable mental outlook :)			"

												I bought this game months ago, and honestly until this recent sale I completely forgot about buying it.  The downside to buying a ton of games during the big sale events.  The story for this game is a gem, and the bonus story isn't too bad as well.  Honestly, the DLC I know some have knocked; I will not be one of those.  The DLC was different then the game and for what it was and coming with the Premium Edition already it was well worth playing.  Pros:Great story!Combat was fun!Platforming in this game is hand holding, but it still was fun.Graphics!DLC is like a whole different game, just not quite as long.Cons:Controls can feel a little clunky at times.Invisible walls.Open world feel, but really linear.

												First off, forget the play time, that's not accurate.Enslaved was a game that first caught my attention years ago when I saw the preview in a GameInformer magazine. It was a time when the first person shooter was kind of the gaming industry, and the different gameplay caught my attention as well as the highly stylized visuals that were striking and bright in an era of browns and grays. Unfortunately at that time I didn't have a PS3 or 360 to pick the game up, so my memory fell to the way side.Cut to 5 years later when I have a PC that can actually do some gaming and I notice that Enslaved is now on Steam, and for cheap, too! I picked it up on a Christmas sale (or maybe a Humble Bundle) and let it sit for many months; finally, I mention to a friend that I had bought it and he looks at me and and says ""You need to play that game, it's fantastic."" This friend happened to be my professor in Game Design (which I went to school for), and I knew if he was saying something, then it needed to jump to the top of my priorities list.The first thing I noticed about the game other than the visual style was the controls. They felt a bit clunky and strange for keyboard controls and it was immediately obvious that this was a pretty straightforward port from the console version, as opposed to a redefined experience with a different control scheme. At first, some of the button placements for various moves felt awkward, but as I made my way through the first tutorial level, I began to get the flow of everything, and the seemingly strange buttons started to make sense. Don't get me wrong, I would definitely recommend playing this on a controller, but if you must use a mouse and keyboard, it grows on you.After tackling the controls and coming out on top, I finally manage to let myself become engrossed in the story and atmosphere of it all, and that's where this game really shines. The story itself is fairly straightforward, but not boring. It's interesting, and when it is coupled with the fantastic world around it, then it begins to flow well. This is a different post-apocalypse, a brighter one. One that is less grit, and more grease. Everything shines, and when you're not in a lush city being retaken by nature, you're in a junkyard fortress, or some other fantastic environment. The thing is, even when the game gets deep and shadowy, it never truly gets visually dark, a post-apocylptic aesthetic that is rarely seen nowadays. The closest I can really get is somethinng like The Last of Us with less smog and spores, and fresh air instead.As great as the environment is though, it's the characters that really make this game. Trip, Monkey, and eventually Pigsy are fantastic characters that grow over the course of their adventure, and have ended up becoming some of my favorite game characters of all time. It's not so much their adventure that drives this game, but their development as people during it. And possibly the most important part to making these characters come alive are thier voice actors. Andy Serkis as Monkey, Lindsey Shaw as Trip, and Richard Ridings as Pigsy give these characters life through their dialogue in only the way a talented voice actor can. All three are fantastic, but I believe that Serkis is easily the standout of the group, and his portrayal of Monkey is absolutely wondrous.All in all, this game is a fantastic journey, and one I believe that any gamer who appreciates games as an art should partake in. It has impressed me in a way very few games have managed, and I feel that I've learned much as a gamer, developer, and writer from it.TL;DR - Play it, iz real good.			"

												Wanted to play Enslaved for years, ever since it came out. Didn't really live up to my teenage expectations but still a decent game. Gameplay is in general responsive and fun; it really feels like you're jumping around giant mechs in this distopian world. It is however quite linear as it's segmented into chapters which play from A to B with the same mechanics. It did feel repetative at times which is why I didn't play this game in one go, even though it is entirely possible given the 10h story. Just was more fun playing in 2h burst to me, since the chapters switch as followed:  Parkour - Melee - Shooting Range - Boss Fight.The story is a nice take on the Journey to the West. I liked the post-apokalyptic setting and the animation as well as the charakters grew on me... expect of Pigsy... oh god, he's just so repulsive...It has its ups and down, pretty generic and to me littered with a lot of outdated sensibilities but the quieter scenes and especially the two protagonist and their performance did sell it for me. The ending was very sudden, would have liked a bit more build-up but as I said, all in all it's still a solid story. If you're in for a action packed Hollywood story and decent gameplay I guess I would recommend it. Give it a go when on sale or not if that prior scentence really spoke to you. PS: There's a second game included which stirs up the gameplay and ups the stealth. Haven't played through that yet but until now it's quite okay. Still not very fond of that game's protagonist though...			"

												Really, astoundingly pretty to look at. Particularly in the early chapters, every single frame is gorgeous. Characters are well written, likeable and hateable (as appropriate) and the voice acting is sublime. Gameplay is pleasant throughout. You're doing a large variety of different simple things that are all fun. I especially love the way that the dynamic between Trip and Monkey evolves through the course of the plot.			"

												Really enjoyed the game. It has nice interesting story and setting, graphics is beautiful, although looks a bit dated in 2016, but as a whole it's a total win and the gameplay includes some variety. A lot of action and yet not too hardcore, so a pleasure to play, i.e. although the game contains several challenging parts this is not a kind of work to do repeating the same tedious checkpoints thousand times like in some other games.Only one negative point -- required some hacks to apply to fix graphics rendering issues (glitchy shadows).

 An Unexpected, if Mixed Journey to the West(Full disclosure: I bought this game on impulse during a sale and had it sitting in my library for almost two years before I played it)Inspired by one of the most well-known of the four great classics of Chinese literature, Journey to the West, Odyssey to the West plays fast and loose with much of its source material in interesting ways. As someone who isn't particularly interested in the source material, I wasn't terribly bothered by its deviations, though history geeks will have a field day ripping it a new one.Odyssey to the West's shining achievement is its story and the relationship between Trip and Monkey. Trip herself is a gold mine of interesting character interpretations: is she just a teenager using whatever tools she can to survive in a world gone mad, even if it involves enslaving a man? Or does she seriously lack empathy and is willing to break promises for the sake of revenge? .Monkey's no slouch either, being much more than just a muscular, snarking, angry anti-hero. The way they play off each other is fantastic, and with the exception of one scene near the end of the game, I was completely enthralled by how their relationship progressed. The authenticity of Monkey and Trip's relationship brings to mind the best partnerships in gaming, such as Joel and Ellie from The Last of Us, or Link and Midna from Twilight Princess. Unfortunately, there are no other ""real"" characters besides these two, which makes the game feel empty. The two named characters that are introduced besides them , Pigsy and Pyramid,  fall flat due to the former's irritating mannerisms (with few redeeming moments, though they are meaningful) and the latter's lack of screentime. The war that tore the planet is barely talked about, reducing much of its significance since there's effectively zero information about the world before it was destroyed, or what destroyed it. The lack of audio logs, codexes, or other information-giving collectibles would have alleviated this, but the only collectibles are those used for upgrades, and masks, which are effectively meaningless until the end of the game.Though the game suffers from some loading glitches and framerate drops, the game is still gorgeous, with a richly detailed post-apocalyptic world that reminds me of, yet again, The Last of Us. Destroyed mechanical titans lay in scattered heaps on overgrown, damp city streets, and giant junkyards made of cobbled-together mechanical parts offer safe passage over dangerously oily water. The world is full of color and light. The animation work is excellent. While not yet crossing the uncanny valley, facial movements are accurate and impressive. Monkey's movements in particular are a sight to behold, as he dodges, clambers up ledges, and even holds himself in an accurately simian manner.The music is surprisingly good, reminding me a bit of the Metroid Prime games in a good way, and the voice acting is impressive and nuanced.Unfortunately, the gameplay is more of a mixed bag. While combat is satisfying, it quickly grows repetitive due to the very limited pools of moves available and the lack of enemy variety, since all enemies are just robots that fall into one of five categories and feature various states of rust or disuse. The ability to exploit flaws in your enemies' design is interestng, on the other hand (for example, ripping open a decayed power cell on a scout to turn him into a walking bomb), opening up opportunities to turn the tide in unexpected ways.Boss fights are a letdown. While a few early ones are interesting, they gradually drop in quality due to overly large health bars, poorly-scripted phase changes, or the recycling of previous bosses.Upgrading Monkey requires currency that can be found around the world or gathered from enemies, and while most don't drastically change your playstyle and are of varying usefullness, filling out Monkey's skill trees is still fun, if irritating due to how hard it is to find tech orbs after you've cleared a level.The few vehicles sections handle well and don't overstay their welcome. Monkey has a  Cloud (actually a disk, but you know what they were going for)  that he busts out for some bosses or watery areas, and it's a blast to rocket around on it.Traversal feels remarkably similar to Infamous in all the best ways. Monkey can grapple, climb, jump, or swing from impressively high or complicated structures, and the movement itself can almost become an engaging sort of puzzle.Speaking of puzzles, some of the environment-based ones are quite entertaining, though not on the level of a dedicated puzzle game. An encounter in a dilapidated opera house that requires you to manipulte props, scaffolding, and lighting is particularly interesting.Unfortunately, the camera is your constant enemy, rapidly changing orientation when you round a corner or failing to indicate where to go next when grappling around. In combat, it can often fail to properly display where enemies are, and its sluggish movement makes the (thankfully rare) shooting sections incredibly frustrating.While I won't detail specifics, the final level tries too hard to wrap up loose ends and feels anticlimactic in comparison to previous stages. The ending in particular is sudden and confusing, attempting to introduce elements minutes before the credits roll.ENSLAVED: Odyssey to the West is not a bad game. The story, characters (all two of them), sound and visuals are almost universally excellent, and some of the combat, puzzles and exploration can be fun. However, the overall lack of variety or depth in the combat, letdowns in terms of the story, and some truly terrible camera angles, shooting sections, and boss fights keep this back from achieving true greatness in all respects.Also, seriously, Trip, please put more clothes on. Pros: Trip and Monkey's relationship is the highlight of the game Excellent music and voice acting Colorful, interesting world design and characters Upgrade system is satisfying Puzzles and movement are engaging Vehicle sections don't take too long Cons: Repetitive, shallow combat The god-damn camera No interesting characters besides Trip and Monkey, or really any, for that matter Visual bugs and framerate drops The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera Shooting sections are frustrating because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera Boss fights are lackluster Ending leaves much to be desired The GODAMN CAMERA Seriously, Trip, please put something else on. No, not the ""Sexy Robot Trip"" outfit, that's worse. "

												Nice game.  I was intrigued by it as I love the Journey to the West story of Sun Wukong (the Monkey King).  There are a few analogues in terms of characters and equipment but I kind of wish there were more analogues to the story (i.e. kicked out of heaven for causing trouble/stealing the peaches of immortality, being imprisoned under a mountain for getting on the wrong side of Buddha, breaking into the underworld to free his monkey buddies etc.) .Gameplay is ncie, fighting is failry basic but doesn't feel limited or repetitive (as fighting is not really the focus of the game).  The climbing feels very slick when you get the timing right and the puzzels are enough of a challenge to make you think but not hard enough to make you frustrated.My only real annoyance with the game is that it is quite easy to bipass loot and then not be able to go back and pick it up again.  For example, you could jump off/climb up a ledge only to realize that you had missed out on picking something up but then you can't retun to that spot to get it.  However, this is maybe just a problem with my OCD which wants me to complete every part of the game/collect everything and wouldn't be a problem to someone of more reasonable mental outlook :)			"

												Surprisingly entertaining title, especially if you get it during a sale. Simple, fast paced, gripping, funny characters.However, it suffers from the controls which are not so well ported to PC, and the graphics that are somewhat sub-par for 2015. But despite those niggles and some issues with configuring the graphics settings in the .ini file, it's still a game you might want to try if you get it on sale.Can't really recommend it, though. The PC port feels as if done by a drunken intern hating his job. Plenty of bugs, such as when you're chased by a robo dog and supposed to run through a pipe through which the (giant) dog can't follow... but it simply does? Also, single-Checkpoint games are a legacy idiocy from console games 20 years ago. Today, it's just nonsense - and for games that are such buggy ports that the single save is easily broken, lost, or destroyed... It basically means - don't waste your time, you may have to redo the whole game at any point in time. Just lost all stuff I bought with tech orbs. Simply gone after restarting the game. No older save available.Crap.			"

												Just completed this game for the second time and it is still an incredible experience. Technically, the gameplay is fantastic. The platforming is amongst the best I've ever played (and I was playing on keyboard and mouse, which has recieved mixed reviews from other reviewers). Very fluid controls with a satisfying upgradability feature. The enemies are very well done and the challenge does ramp up towards the end (though it's a very easy playthrough on Normal -- next time I'll definitely play it on Hard mode because Normal doesn't provide any challenge whatsoever in my experience). But what you should play this game for is the story. It's very rare I've found a game that is so expansive (for a linear game, at any rate). The environments are varied and the game never gets stale from the opening chapter to the very end. Some deadly boss battles too, which is a great plus and keeps it engaging. But, the story is just breathtaking. There are few games that've left me speechless and fewer still that've left me thinking about whether or not I did the right thing at the end. This is definitely one of them. It's a game that leaves you thinking.Highly recommended for all fans of platforming, action, and above all story-driven games. 10/10			"

												ENSLAVED presents us with quite a conundrum.  It entertains us very well.  The characters, environments, animation and voice acting are excellent.  The plot is sparse and cliche, but it's no worse than many movie plots.  But that's the conundrum: it isn't really a game.  It's more of an interactive movie.  You move the thumbstick and hit button A over and over again to make the movie continue, but at no point is there any decision to make.  The only part that is a game is the combat, but this is mostly so simple that it would never stand up as its own game without the rest of the movie-parts.I'm not sure how I feel about this new form of entertainment.  Yes it's good while you're experiencing the content, but the development cost must have been equivalent to a blockbuster movie.  I'm not sure if that is worthwhile given it has no replayability.  There are many games with low budgets and little content that manage to provides hundreds of hours of entertainment by virtue of the gameplay.  For games, fun is almost like an emergent property, not directly proportional to how much effort the developers took.  I wonder if this would have been as good or better as a movie or mini-series.

Top notch talent is not without a top notch script. The game's writer? Alex Garland. Yes the same Alex Garland who wrote Ex Machina and 28 Days Later. So tell me one more time....

												Story is not as interesting as the characters who were written and performed very well.  Unlike most of the games where you basically have Mad Max world recreated, Enslaved presents a fresh view on post apocalypitic world where colorful still life dominates. Combat is simple, there is no depth which can be found in games like Devil May Cry. Invisible walls here and there make platforming quite irritating from time to time. DLC with Pigsy is boring, it is like a bad shooter and even worse stealth game.			"

I beat it all in one go, and I have to say parts of the story, truly scared the hell out of me, while others actually invoked tears of rage and disgust, this game has the most colorful art I've seen in my life, and I've been looking forward to playing it for a long time, until it recently came out in a humble bundle. I would recommend this game to anyway who truly needs to be ""enslaved"" for a period of time to escape the true reality of life.			"

												Well, if you've read or watched Journey to the West you should be familiar with the story. This just barely resembles it.Monkey (Sun Wu Kong) is ENSLAVED™ by Trip (Xuanzang) to Journey to get the sacred Buddhist scrolls in India. Cough* I mean get the girl back home... "

												2 hours in and I am realy enjoying the game. The setting is cool and the dialogues and the reaction of the characters are realistic. Also if played on hard the game puts up a real challenge not like other adventure games (looking at you assassins creed series). The only negative thing was that the shadows were a bit odd but I easily fixed that by following ""Enslaved Improvment Guide"" here on steam wich also game me improved shaders to make the game look better. It also works great with a controller (using a xbox 360)			"

												My opinion of this game has varied throughout, and I'll do my best to explain how that's gone.After the first chapter (or thereabouts), I was pretty sure that I was playing a generic action game, starring Generic Angry White Man and Irritating 'Can't Do Anything Myself' Girl. The story seemed to be littered with Deus Ex Machina after Deus Ex Machina, and I was not expecting much more than a mindless fight-the-robots romp. But during the game, this completely changed - I'm not sure whether the game got better or if I suddenly 'got' something I hadn't noticed before, but I started to really enjoy it.The story got a lot stronger as it went on, and the character development is perfectly paced. As I learnt more about the characters, I became more fond of them, and by the last couple of chapters, I was completely invested in them. The actors did a fine job with the voice work, and even though there are only three characters in the entire game, it doesn't suffer for it in the least. The story itself was excellent, with humour balancing the more emotional parts nicely. My only complaint is that the epilogue felt a little bit rushed as an end to the story, but it did tie things up nicely.Combat in the game is a great mix of hand-to-hand and shooting with Monkey's staff, and the flow between each style is really good. While the hand-to-hand reminds me a little of Remember Me, it's nowhere near as complex, and it can often be the best option to button mash until you defeat the enemies. The one thing that I really didn't like was the parkour-style elements. Sure, it looked nice, and hopping between hand-holds, bars and other things was fluid, but I would have liked a bit more freedom. There seems to always be one way, and one way only, to reach where you are going, and most of the time you are railroaded into that way by being completely unable to even try and jump anywhere else.I'm honestly surprised that I hadn't really heard of this game before I played it - it's got some big names behind it, and it's so well-made. Definitely worth playing.			"

												This is the sort of the game that will not win any game of the year awards, and yet, I still have a blast with it. The action is not deep, but it is just satisfying. The crunch and clanging of metal as you beat up mechs just sounds good. The little parts where you fly on your ""cloud"" are a blast. The game also looks gorgeous. I have never seen a post-apopalyptic game look so damn colorful. The broken down New York is full of greens and reds. It also has a sense of humor, with only a total of 3 characters in the game. Do you want to spend 30+ on this? Probably not, but catch it on sale and you will have spent your money well.			"

												(writing this about halfway through the game, I think. Completed through chapter 7.)There's a few glitches, but most of them aren't gamebreaking. I've had to restart a checkpoint a few times.The sparsity of checkpoints is actually my main complaint. When hunting for all of the tech orbs, sometimes I have to go back several minutes to try a segment again. I believe the game saves what you've picked up when you restart such a checkpoint, but it's not consistent for me - I kept having to pick up the same orb behind me during the final shootout in chapter 7.Auto-targeting is another problem. I can't seem to keep focused on one enemy to finish them off. Luckily, a stun lasts for a set period of time and isn't broken when I use a regular attack, but it's aggravating in some of those frantic multi fights.Graphics: eh. I played a lot of DmC, so the colors/aesthetics feel kinda samey. If you *haven't* played DmC, it's lush, and beautiful. Sometimes it's too bright and colorful for me to find the next platforming segment. Trip's pants make no sense, but whatever.Also: not very good with alt-tabbing. There's no windows/no border option in the graphics, so it's crashed a few times. Beware!The story is great so far. I think I've really become a fan of how Ninja Theory does their character relationships. Even though Monkey is the controlled character, is more experienced, and does all of the fighting, Trip is treated as an equal.I picked this up because of a passing interest in Journey to the West, and the story is roughly paralleling what I know about the original plot, but in futurepunk ways. It's neat to guess what's coming next!The platforming works. Wonky platforming controls aren't too bad, because the game will only let you jump to valid locations. So that's nice.This feels like it's mostly detailing my complaints, but I'm always eager to continue to the next chapter, to see what happens next.			"

Actually the characters and their reaction to unfavorable situations are more believable than most action television shows and movies. Coming from a computer game, that's impressive.			"

												I totally recommend this game! I didn't know much and bought it on sale. Worth every pennie! The only thing I wasn't thrilled about in the beginning was the controls/keybindings. In the upgrade section they don't clarify the keys (they only say ""to do this press B + X"" - those are for Xbox, for pc they meant E + F), and the controls seem a little floppy until you get the hang of it. Other than that, 5 stars! The story is so rich, the enviroment is beautiful, the fight is pretty good, it has good puzzles, it's honestly a really good game. Totally recommend! I'm sad it seems there won't be a sequel, 'cause I sure would pay to have it!			"

												  A very easy game to play for relaxation.  Graphics are very nice with a very lush post apocalyptic setting that will make lovers of scenary very happy.  The gameplay itself is uncomplicated, fast to grasp.  This might be a let down for some as most of the game, the parcour side, is telegraphed and leave no room for failure.  the combat, wile easy, give you enought options to not be a total bore.    the strong point, beside an interesting story, is the evolution of the 2 protagonists' relation.    This game is not for people who need a challenge.  but if you want a casual experience, this is it.  And if you manage to find it at less than 10$, it will be worth your money.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game, but I would tend to the side of positivity.Good points:+ There is a great story being told here, which was adapted from an ancient story, interestingly enough. This really is the high point for the game.+ The graphics can look very good if you configure them correctly+ The game has a good balance of action, suspense and humour, with some good characters to help this along. I think the game gets very good when you come across the 'pigsy' character. Having more people+ The gameplay when you are allowed to use the 'cloud' (a kind of hoverboard) makes the game much more funBad Points:- The gameplay can be a bit repetitive/button-mashy with long fight scenes- The whole jumping around bit seems a bit scripted and ""on-rails"", all you have to do is press the jump button abunch of times, there's no real involvement in this part of the gameplay.- The graphics require a lot of tweaking of text conifg files			"

												Recently finished this game and really loved it. That said, if you're more interested in combat, creative puzzles or platform challenges, this may not be for you. The game is heavily story-driven, and the gameplay can get boring pretty quick if you're not invested in the narrative. Also, I'd highly recommend using a gamepad controller. I started this game using mouse and keyboard, and abandoned it because it was so awful. Only when I gota  gamepad and tried it out again did I discover how much fun it could be. The ending was great, though rushed, and I would highly recommend the game to anyone who loves narrative-heavy games. 8/10			"

												Enslaved is without a doubt one of rare and often overlooked gems from that failed to get the proper recognition it sorely deserves. Drawing inspiration from one of the greatest Chinese epics ever written and giving it a delicious modern flair, Enslaved, gives a jaw dropping performance in terms of visuals and acting. This is in no small part due to Andy Serkis' masterful performance as Monkey, delievering a performance that captures the player's attentions from start to finish. The narrative is also masterful written in a way that honors its source material, while at the same time giving it just enough of a modern touch that makes the story all the more engaging. I would highly reccomend this to anyone familiar with Journey to the West and who is also of video games as an art form and as a form of story telling.			"

Exciting story and gameplay, great to look at, no wonky controls, decent upgrade system, combat is fun, and riding the cloud is fantastically enjoyable. The music brilliantly done, too.Seems it could use a patch - there are a few threads floating around about good rigs having bouts of freezing, often during cutscenes. Is it annoying? Yes.

												I'll be honest. I am only a little way into chapter two, not very far along at all. Yet the game definately has me intrigued. It is aa dynamic combination of storytelling and platform style gaming with plenty of jumping, climbing and navigating through difficut terrain, and of course, combat. You play primarily as Monkey (a character is aptly named due to his nimbleness in how he is able to jump and climb) but also occassioanlly direct Trip. There is plenty of action in this game but with some nice cutscenes here to make it interesting for a player like myself, whose primary intrest in gaming is actually RPGs. I'm not a 'hardcore game' who makes evaluations of combat sstyles and such, so I won't go into that, other than to say that for me at least, the combat is difficult enough to be enjoyable, without being overwhelming.  My only complaints are that the game autosaves with no player save options. You have to go along until you hit a save point, or you will loose your progress. Also, there is no pause button (that I have discovered yet anyway) so if the dorbell  or phone rings in the middle of a sequence, you have to either not answer, or let the game do what it will, and hope your last save point was not too far back (this actually happened to me during my first play through in th emiddle of a demanding sequence. I had to bite the bullet and let Monkey die to go answer the door...) So far though, I am REALLY enjoying this game and it is a nice break/distraction from WoW.			"

												Interesting game and story concept, but falls short with cheap game mechanics.I've played very few games that are as predictable as this, game-play wise. You can literally call out what's going to happen next based on what your character can or can't do, or the task you've been assigned. What baffles me the most about this game is you play as this extremely strong and destructive character, and yet (probably because of the plot line) you take an alternate route and get yourself into a mess because you can't jump up a ledge or crawl under something...no reasons why really...you just can't. (Oh and if you can't figure out where to jump, just spin the left stick and mash ""A"", since you can't misstep (and die) he'll only go where he's allowed to.)The female protagonist/partner? Nah she's OK, she has her own private walkway to take unlike you. It's not like they'd give her a weapon or something right? Hey hurry up you slacker, she's waiting for you to catch up. No, stop playing with the deadly robots. It upsets me that her character was so useless in the entire game, aside from needing an extra pair of hands or comic relief.But the story does save it, and it's a unique one as far as I'm concerned. The worlds are also beautiful given what they had to work with (thanks consoles, for your limitations). The characters actually speak and hold conversations both in and out of cut-scenes.Pick this up on sale.			"

												It's not awful, but its many issues prevent it from being excellent. Overall ~7/10.-The combat is dull, repetitive, and a lot of button mashing (but so are the majority of action games)-The platforming is mindless and nearly impossible to mess up, aside from a few areas toward the end-Music and sounds are alright, but nothing to write home about (I have no idea why people tagged this as having a ""great soundtrack"" when it was mostly forgettable background music)-To call them puzzles would be insulting to actual puzzles (although to be fair most actions games nowadays do this too), but they were fast enough that they felt more like elements of the platforming rather than contrived timewasters-Fairly short at ~10-13 hours (length felt about right to me, YMMV) -If you're a completionist and you miss any of the collectibles/achievements you'll have to replay the entire chapter (no manual saving, points of no return occur every ~5-10 minutes)-The colors and art really brought things to life, and are some of the game's stronger points-Voice acting was excellent-Repetitive level design with no real changes to mechanics (gaining the ability to shoot plasma out of your staff (no innuendo) hardly qualifies)-Despite its predictability and lack of content the story was alright...until the last chapter. They decided to royally♥♥♥♥♥♥the bed there for god knows what reason; enough of a ♥♥♥♥-up to consider giving it a thumbs down. Without spoiling anything, the story's background became increasingly shaky and farfetched in the last third or so (but tolerable), and had a horrible, unsatisfying ""conclusion"" that made no sense in the story's setting. The presumed attempt to be dramatic and thought-provoking resembled an adolescent's fan fiction, or anything from M. Night Shyamalan. It didn't really give a proper conclusion, but left some room for a sequel, and wound up in a purgatory where it neither fully finished the story nor made a continuation necessary.-Main character is the hellspawn of Superman and a gorilla, so his inhuman physical abilities can frequently give the false appeareance of Trip being a damsel in distress-This type of game feels a lot like games made 10-15 years ago, and it would have been right at home amongst them. However, following an (outdated) cookie cutter action game design is not going to make you stand out.It didn't really do anything unique, and with gameplay/story elements ranging from mediocre to slightly above average, it's hard to say that this game is underappreciated. Collecting magical orbs, jumping on platforms, and pressing x like a monkey whenever you're in combat just isn't that stimulating, or maybe I'm just too old. Despite everything wrong with it, I can't articulate why I still enjoyed it. It had a nebulous quality that made it fun to play and want to see through to the end; might have been my nostalgia for older action games. It wasn't bad, and I don't regret playing it, but if you're looking for something amazing, you can do better.			"

												The game is so glitched. Trip keeps going through walls and continuously freefalls out of the game (Guess that's why they shortened her name to Trip). Keyboard and mouse controls are terrible especially when using a gun - I've adjusted the mouse sensitivity levels and it's still difficult to put crosshairs on a stationary mech.  Controller is no different when aiming, and it makes it difficult just to go through a doorway. Really  takes the fun out of a colorful game.  Camera angles can throw the gamer off too, I hate that I can't manually lock in to the enemy closest to me so I can attack it.  Fighting style reminds me of Darksiders 2 where it just becomes painfully bad the longer I play it and lose interest to a rather good story.			"

												Wow for an old game and a console port no less this is a wonderfull game that still holds its own 6 years after it first came out. This is the most vibrant and lush post apocolyptic game I have played. The voice acting is fantastic and the character acting is really good. Sure it has old console mechanics and the camera gets bit annoying, but the game more than makes up for it.Great story. All these wonderful small visuals that barely hint at what happened, keeps you interested. New York City is stunning.Why oh why is there not a sequel.			"

												PRO:+ Great graphics+ Great main characters + Good fight mechanics+ Good enough plotCONS:- When 3rd character enters, kills the chemestry of main characters- Camera- Parkour controls sometimes are messy- You need Trip for heal and level up, but she is not with you most of the final act- Abrupt lame endingFull review:Great game with action and good characters. Protecting Trip even though she ""enslaved"" you doesn't seem like a shore and she is actually more useful and resourceful than you would think (in the late game when she is not with you, you start to miss her), not to mention the interaction between the characters is pretty cute - until a pig enters the picture. Anyway, reminds of the high-quality Sony Square-Enix games.On the gameplay front, a not-so-good port. You will spend A LOT of time fighting the camera (which will sometimes stick to some very strange angles that make moving hard), and the controls in some parts get confusing on the parkour parts because of the camera changing angles and all of the sudden ""UP"" (W) will make you jump back because you had to know (right?) that this time, to go up you need ""UP+LEFT"" (A+W). But that is mostly on the ""parkour"" moves (think Tomb Raider).I will, however, say two things about the plot (no spoilers): When the ""Pigsy"" character shows up, the story goes downhill fast, he is literally a third-wheel. And the ending ... abrupt and leave you hanging.Other issues: There is a bug on the shadows that require some .ini tweaking, but nothing serious. And the menus are REALLY weird and unresponsive sometimes (adding upgrades sometimes is a pain. Anyway, as mentioned, port issues), but the game itself is really great.8/10 - if the camera was better and there were no pig, would be a 10/10			"

												Enslaved has defenitely made it into my top favorite games! Its story is touching, the charcters lovable (well, maybe not Pigsy) and the fighting is fun. There are so much more different facial expressions than I've ever seen in a game before. You always know how the characters are feeling.The small bossfights are fun, and really, who doesnt want to fly around on a mechanical cloud and do cool stunts? I disliked some things, like the Machine Gun defense games, where you just have to stay on one point an shoot everything, but luckily, there are not too many of those. I also disliked Pigsy, but thats maybe just me.So whoever wants to play a game with a great story, and amazing scenery, I recommend this to you!			"

												This is a lot more fun than some people gave it. The combat is easy to get a hang of but it delivers a challenge in some situations depending on difficulty.. On Normal I had enough of a challange to be entertained. Story is pretty interesting, I like games that kinda just drop you in the middle of a timeline and you work out what happened before you ended up there while you progress and figure out whats going to happen next so story telling is done well. Also the environments are very intriguing.. It's probably the hipster to other post cyber apocalypse games... Although I'm sure there are other games with similar concepts that outdate this one. Still cool though.			"

												So I bought this game at least two years ago. I had trouble getting to it with other games I felt I would have more fun playing. I felt ashamed it took me this long to play this game. A fantastic story mixed with lovable characters. The combat wasn't all that challenging but I played it more for the story and characters. I was never bored of the combat but it just wasn't hard. The best part is that I could quit or pause whenever I wanted to and get right back into later on. There isn't that many games that although that nowadays. At one time I took a hiatus of at least a week or two from it. I came back and was able to pick right up where I left off. The story was memorable enough so that I didn't forget and the mechanics are easy enough to pick up right away. I can't praise this game enough for everything it does right, highly recommend it! "

												This game joins 'Metal Arms: Glitch in the System' in my category of games that are so unknown and overlooked that it's heartbreaking. When I saw this on sale I had to grab it - I hadn't even realized it was on Steam!  Exciting story and gameplay, great to look at, no wonky controls, decent upgrade system, combat is fun, and riding the cloud is fantastically enjoyable. The music brilliantly done, too.Seems it could use a patch - there are a few threads floating around about good rigs having bouts of freezing, often during cutscenes. Is it annoying? Yes. Does it detract from the gameplay? Maybe. Should it stop you from buying this game? Not on your life.			"

												As the tag suggested, this game is indeed a post-apocalyptic game. Unlikes the Fallouts, the setting suggests something much like a Borderlands and Darksider-like apocalypse. What, I presumed, a player would really like about this game is that the gameplay/combat. Unlike some of the game I played before like Kingdom of Amalur or Elder Scroll Skyrim, this game promotes other way of approaching combar. Combat aside, let's move onto the characters. In the main game, you as a Monkey, somewhat like  in the Chinese myth - Journey to the West, you are accompanied by a lady named Trip. The characters interactions are really intriguing, lively and somehow warm. And in the DLC, I would say, is an icing on the cake as it allows you to enjoy and feel even more connected to the world. However, this game has flaws, flaws like glitch n bugs are understandable, but flaws like the game is devoid of player-character interaction is what really bugs me. There are times I really wish there would be an option like, press E to talk with companions, something like this, in my opinion, will definitely paint the world in a way that makes it more colourful so that we, as a player, would have a better experience or memory of this fine art. I'm not going to talk about the story ,in the end, it is still up to you as a fellow gamer to judge it. This is really an underated game, thus I'm willing to nominate the unnoticed gem in the 'I THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS COOL BEFORE IT WON AN AWARD' award. Yes, double award. Unless there's a choice for 'Quite Underated Game' or 'I Wish It Were IRL So I Could Hit Up That Astonishing Lady' award and I would much prefer the latter.			"

 Great game, lots of funAfter having read tons of reviews here on Steam I decided to give it a go and got it during one of the innumerable crazy-for-whatever-reason-on-steam-sales. Then it got stuck on my library for ages until I found the time to actually play it (which was the past week during autumn vacation) - and I loved almost every part of it. I'm not a fan of console ports and usually avoid them. This game was clearly designed with controllers in mind and when you fire it up, you get a nice welcome message remembering you ""not to shut down the console, because this game saves automatically"". PC gamer pride aside and some initial struggle playing with mouse & keyb I quickly fell in love with it. It's basically a sci-fi hack'n'slay with a nice plot and some AC badass climbing (with pre-fixed anchor points you can't miss mind you) in a Mad Max'isch environment. The characters are likeable though I lack the background information about the universe, the past of it, how everyone got where they are and who they are basically. Think of entering LOTR on the last chapter, where you figure the Ring is evil, you understand who's good and bad and you know it has to be destroyed - you just don't know how everyone got there.Pro's The fights are fun though there aren't real combos You have a series of finishing moves and one allows you to take a mech as shield or throw him The environments change, you can take cover and figure out how to approach the next fight Likable characters, though the girl is utterly vulnerable Nice plot - probably part of a larger story Extra: The pigsy plot line will add an extra story (though tiny) and different moves (grapple hook) with extra gadgets such as EMP's, friendly mechs, mines and decoy bombs once you have finished the main story. Pigsy, instead of Monkey, uses a sniper rifle and no hand-to-hand combat at all - so it's a different playCon's Nice plot - but lacks some sophisticated background story (I would have liked to understand more Camera behaviour had me almost puke sometimes At some spots it wasn't all clear how to proceed in the otherwise completely linear levelsI would recommend the game at any time. Despite some minor flaws it was just plain fun and diverse and never really felt repetitive. Though from a graphical perspective it doesn't live up to today's standards, it's an utter delight in colors and fireworks.			"

												The good: Colorful scenery, good voice acting, good pacing, loved Piggy and Truffle. Low impact gameplay for those times where you don’t want to get too involved. The bad: Gameplay gets repetitive after a while. Requires a controller.  Combat is very shallow with a light attack, a heavy attack, and a few special moves thrown in. The platforming is way too easy; just hold direction and press button on controller. The plot is pretty thin and predictable. Platforming hand holds and drop downs can get lost in the environment leading to frustration on where to go next or what the path forward is. 6/10. Recommend getting during a sale.  "

												Enslaved is a very underrated gem. Pretty much every aspect of the game is well done. The story is pretty cool and interesting as well as the characters themselves with some very well done character development and voice acting. The action set pieces are memorable and help keep the game interesting. There is a lot of variety in the level design and the environments which also help keep the game fresh. The combat is basic but it remains fun throughout the whole game as well as the platforming, I also loved the addition of the hoverboard for a few sections in the game. 9/10 (Amazing)			"

												Great game, story, facial animations, gameplay, world and environment.Some issues however 1. is the ledge detection, its not the greatest and can lead to a few deaths for no reason. 2. Camera, it does a good job for the most part but can interefere in a few too many areas, also the charge stun attack for some reason puts the camera facing monkeys back so you can't see a damn thing when the enemy is attack (no idea how this got past quality testing...).Other than that its a great game with a great story, some of the best facial animations and expressions ever, as with all ninja theory's games, Just wish the ending was slightly more fleshed out and more satisfying. Perhaps giving a little more about the world after the epilogue part and the relationships that they were building throughout the game.  "

												I'm gonna go with a YEAH - OH HELL YEAH - on this one.As a guy who was spoon-fed the old-school cartoon version of The Monkey King as a child, (the one that was too ugly to be called anime,) I was somewhat skeptical on this reboot. And, though I will grant that the whole post-apocalypse-robots-wasteland-deal took a while to grow on me, I must confess, in the end: The story, (it took forever after the opening Action Sequence too get REALLY interesting,) quite simply DRAGS you into it, (kicking and screaming if it has to,) and if you have ANY knowledge of the original story I mentioned earlier, you can't help but contemplate the complexity of the concept, once you've finished the game. (noooooo WAKE UP... Not Even One spoiler! - Once you've finished the game y'all might even get that joke.)Right, so... The game itself - (I'll leave the story with you for evaluation.) The controls are actually so easy you have to make an effort to get it wrong, (granted it'll take you a while to learn to trust that fact.) Other games could learn something from these Devs. I'm not saying this platform of control or key configuration is the best ever, cause it's not. It's just that the controls are SO responsive that you actually have to be CAREFUL not to jump the gun. (You'll understand soon enough. Half of the game IS a 3D-Platformer, after all...)The Graphics are utterly beautiful, spectacular and fantastic. (Granted, there are a few ""gaps,"" where you go WTF because the beauty goes right out the window. But it's not that big a deal. The Game never really loses touch with it's background scene, so it works even without the sparkles on it.)The extras are... - extra. I don't really know how else to put it. You don't really need it. You don't really need to go through the game again with a new ""mod"" turned on, but if you wanna replay, and re-experience the stunning story with a completely ""weird"" or ""ridiculous"" outfit or other mods, you can. I personally didn't. (But then, I spent a good long week, after completing the game, reasoning out all the story-lines shout-outs to the Original Story; the philosophy; the multitude of morals implied in the game; and how absurdly many White Rabbits there are sprinkled around the entire storyline.)Combat System: Oh for the love of pete... - I know I said the controls are fabulous, (cause they are, repsonse-wise) but the combat/shooting system is REALLY flawed. Multi-target tracking is TOO DAMNED SLOW. (You'll get why later on in the game, when multiple enemies begin to become a stable fixture.)Puzzles - Well, they're not Mensa-Crackers but they WILL annoy you, if nothing else, because they take time to complete. - (You WILL be happy once you're finished with one, and curse the Devs whenever you find the next one...) But that's the way with puzzles in a 3D platform game, isn't it?Funfactor... - Meh...! It's fun the first time. But It's kind of an adrenaline-based thing. Run over here. Move this. Up, down, right, bla bla bla. Kill this, hack that, hurry, move this way - OOPS blocked, find another way. All the while, usually with a ""hurry or your companion will die!"" kind of thing hanging over you. It works, once. I found it hard to engage properly during the second playthrough, but I'm thinking it was just too soon. I've since left the game on the shelf a while to age a bit. I'm thinking when I dust it off again and play it once more, it'll be fun again.So Overall?Pros 7/10 - Good Game; Great Story;  Interesting Characters (they actually grow with the story! thumbs up for the writers!)  ; Great Graphics, SOOOO MUCH Better Than Average Controls, everythings explained, everythings understandable and generally doable, (just mind your timing,) ; the multiphasing platforming (and that's as far as I'll go towards spoilers,) works very well, even if it's a little confusing at first; Great, Scenic, Rich 3D Environments for a Platformer! - I DO hope that other Devs are taking notes. Depth Matters!Cons 3/10 - The Combat/Shooting System (see above) is without a doubt the most frustrating problem in the entire game. I died more times during ""that"" phase than I did in the rest of the entire game; Replayabillity; I love your game, Devs and I love your effort, but it's a little heavy to pick up a second time in short order, when you know the score and how it all plays out - (F-Y-I, a couple of mods won't change that. I WILL play again, but it won't be because of the mods.) ; Finally - Not enough FUN-Factor. The game, while certainly a great re-boot of the Monkey King lore, a great take on the 3D-multi-Platformer, a gorgeous piece of art, graphics-wise - it's all good, really - but there's a lack of good clean fun. (Oh I DID laugh quite a bit during the development of the story and the characters, but it was all soooo serious. I get it, I do, The Monkey King was big on High Drama. But it was funny too. So if you're gonna revamp it, why not do the funny as well? I'm not asking for Crash Bandicoot fall on your bum Fun, or witty one-two-or-three-liners. Just give us a reason to like PLAYING the game, besides getting it out the way so we can get to the next cut-scene?)So... - Good game. Very Pretty. Great Story. Fun, but not tons of it. I'd reccomend it to Story-Lovers, whether they know or like The Monkey King saga, or not. Oh yeah, and just so you know, (I like this, but I'm guessing some people don't,) from a gamer's point of view, this game is LOOOOOOOONG! So bring patience, lean back, and enjoy.			"

												I didn't expect to like this game as much as I did. Obviously I expected to like it, or I wouldn't have bought it, but while I expected ""okay"", I got ""pretty great actually"".I've completed the main story at time of writing, but there are still extra things to do so I'll still be playing for a few more days. Maybe even a second run to complete achievements. The main story is about twenty hours long (on hard) if you don't make too many mistakes, and it's pretty damn linear.""Linear"" never used to be my thing, but Enslaved does it well. It has a story to tell and it tells it, and in my opinion the cutscenes, voice acting, and general characterisation are great. They really brought the game up from ""worth playing"" to ""you should play this"". Be warned, though, if you're looking for a faithful retelling of Monkey's Journey to the West, you will be sorely disappointed. This is the definition of loose adaptation. If you know the original story, you will see clever little references, but if you don't this is not the way to learn it. This is, in fact, a completely original story that happens to contain elements from Journey to the West.I recommend playing with a controller. I don't often say this, because in 90% of cases KB+M is always going to be better, but this is definitely one of those remaining 10%. Platforming and combat are incredibly awkward, but not downright impossible, without a joystick of some kind.And, yes, the other reviews are right. This is a bad port. Fortunately, most of the major issues can be fixed by tweaking inis, and there are plenty of guides right here on steam on how to do that.Much more fun than expected. Marginally more feels than expected.EDIT: Pigsy's Perfect 10 is surprisingly challenging, and I love his ""crouch"".			"

												So i first played this game on PS3 when it came out and loved it very much. When i got a new PC and saw that it was on steam i bought it right away to se if it still held up and i am happy to say that it still does so i nominated this game for the ""Still holds up"" award. This is one of my favorite games of all time and i highly recommend it.			"

												As the tag suggested, this game is indeed a post-apocalyptic game. Unlikes the Fallouts, the setting suggests something much like a Borderlands and Darksider-like apocalypse. What, I presumed, a player would really like about this game is that the gameplay/combat. Unlike some of the game I played before like Kingdom of Amalur or Elder Scroll Skyrim, this game promotes other way of approaching combar. Combat aside, let's move onto the characters. In the main game, you as a Monkey, somewhat like  in the Chinese myth - Journey to the West, you are accompanied by a lady named Trip. The characters interactions are really intriguing, lively and somehow warm. And in the DLC, I would say, is an icing on the cake as it allows you to enjoy and feel even more connected to the world. However, this game has flaws, flaws like glitch n bugs are understandable, but flaws like the game is devoid of player-character interaction is what really bugs me. There are times I really wish there would be an option like, press E to talk with companions, something like this, in my opinion, will definitely paint the world in a way that makes it more colourful so that we, as a player, would have a better experience or memory of this fine art. I'm not going to talk about the story ,in the end, it is still up to you as a fellow gamer to judge it. This is really an underated game, thus I'm willing to nominate the unnoticed gem in the 'I THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS COOL BEFORE IT WON AN AWARD' award. Yes, double award. Unless there's a choice for 'Quite Underated Game' or 'I Wish It Were IRL So I Could Hit Up That Astonishing Lady' award and I would much prefer the latter.			"

												A really good adventure game were you play as the monkey king basically. I really liked the story, it was just the right length.If you are looking for a good sci-fi post apocalyptic adventure you should give this a try, and nowadays it seems to be on sale often. I did not have much faith in the game when I bought it but it really surprised me.			"

												This is one of those under the radar games that everyone should play. It has a good story, great game play, colorful and unique landscapes.  It's not the best port on PC, it plays fine, but lacks graphics options. You can at least adjust things using the .ini file. Definitely pick this game up on the next Steam sale.			"

												The gameplay is lacking but the story and the way it is presented more than makes up for it's flaws. However, the slow start may put people off but the story truly does pick up. The character cast may be small but the craftsmenship put into developing them is apprant and very well done. By the end of the story, I wanted to know more about the game's universe. Sadly, storytelling is no longer a selling point in today's gaming industry.			"

												I've only just started playing, but I can already tell I'm onto a winner here...This game has the best Intro chapter I've played in a long time. Fun, amusing, thrilling and gorgeously detailed.I love the setting of a post-apocalyptic USA too - makes me think of Shannara Chronicles!Lastly... IT HAS ROBOTS.EDIT: Whooooaaaa. What an ending. What a game. Still got 'Pigsy's Perfect 10' to go also!			"

												Short review: Graphics 4.5/5 stunning and incredible and thats just on medium settingsGamePlay 4.5/5  tight-ish controls if you've played any of the batman arkham series you will get to grips with it fastStory 4/5 Post apocolyptic retelling of the classice story journey to the west. A couple of meh moments with the story but overall amazing4/5 overallindepth reviewGraphics. 4.5/5 Incredible graphics while i do have a gaming pc its not the most powerfull and didnt want to take my chances playing on high graphics but even on medium the game looks outstanding, stunning scenery in the newyork level looks breathtaking in both beauty and shock. amazing job with monkey to look like the monkey king ( as he should) but also at times can look like an actual monkey with a slightly sloped posture and bare feet and slight jutting of the lower jaw.  Motion capture and voice for monkey being done by andy serkis ( gollum and ceasar)  so you know you're in for a treat there but i honestly couldnt tell it was him i was getting the vibe of a differnt actor with how he looks  a more Sean Pertwee ( lestrad in elementary) and another vide with the voice acting cant quite place my finger on it.Story 4/5 Post apocalyptic retelling of the chinese classice journy to the west while ive not read or seen the original i certainly will be after this. While i was already familiar with the persona of the monkey king from other media i quickly picked up on who monkey was meant to be right around the time he got his staff ( big give away to be honest). The story is great a couple of moments that honestly seems meh in my opinion but overall has been keeping my interest im only up to chapter 11 but im loving every bit of it and looking forward to delving deeper in to this post apocalyptic worldGameplay 4.5/5 Now this is what ive got the most to talk about. Like i said in the short review if you have played any of the batman arkham series you will quickly get to grips with the controls as the movement and combat system work very similar to them including some of the cons such as if you get caught on the very edge of a corner/barricade it can be awkward moving around it.The free running is amazing While it can feel slightly unresponsive sometimes but i chalk this up to me trying to rush it too fast. it is very fluid and incredibly fun, I got a slight simpler version of assasins creed feel going at the free running climbing moments the slight glow to the objects you can climb make it a lot easier to see them in the dense enviroment but not so much as to be glareingly obviouse.The combat. Oh boy now i can imagine a lot of people who have a problem with this game might be with the combat as you can very easily get overwhelmed by the mechs youfight and have your health dropped very quickly as well as it feel like you have to struggle with every fight. and honestly while for most other games this could be a problem i found it worked very well for Enslaved due to the story and what you are fighting every fight feels like you are facing something that can easily kill you but not to a dark souls point just enough to give you the feel of having to pay attention to what you're doing or at least be aware as to where all the mechs are. That being said once you upgrade your stun attack fights quickly become much easier to deal with. But the combat always felt very satifying to do, I would of liked to see more combos and special moves you could unlock/upgrade to spice things up a little more. over all this game is a very solid 4/5  and while i got this from the recent bandai namco humble bundle now that ive paid it i would gladly say £15 is a fair price for such a well made game			"

												This is one of those flawed games that you can play and wonder about how a few little things could have made it better. Controls aren't good, it's very picky about the place where you can jump from, and when you are climbing you must point the stick in the direction of the next spot but it isn't always where it seems to be onscreen (also keyboard configuration is atrocious and onscreen all cues are displayed showing gamepad buttons). The story is not great either, but the dialogs and face expressions are good (also short, no exposition) and convey what the characters are feeling (largely unused in video games: telling with facial expressions).The combat becomes tedious and some aspects of it exist but are almost useless unless you upgraded them, like the shield, for instance. It is weak, too weak when you start, but if you upgraded a couple times it becomes useful. So you must pick if you want to hit harder or to be harder to kill, because in one playthrough you won't be able to get all the upgrades. But if you play the chapters again you play with all your upgrades from the previous playthrough, so you start overpowered even if you move from Medium to Hard difficulty.It is about 12 hours long and you have the premium version you can also play Pigsy Perfect 10 (check the Extras menu), it is more focused on platforming and gadgets than in melee combat and gives you another 3 hours of gameplay. It's also a stand alone story, not related with the main game's.Nowadays, with all the sales, you can buy it for cheap, and if you have time to spare it'll give you a decent time.			"

												So, my feelings on this game are mostly positive but there are some pretty big caveats.  Let's start with the good: even older, this game's design from a visual standpoint still holds up.  The levels are varied with some interesting twists, the enemies are mostly the same design but still look good, bosses are simple, but still look good.  The aesthetic still holds up well and does something different than the usual post-apocalyptic thing (closest I've seen recently would be trailers for Horizon: Zero Dawn).  The voice acting is superb, especially between the two primary characters.  The combat feels good - impact feels nice and heavy, and while there isn't a lot of depth, it still feels satisfactory.  Bonus, my steam controller worked immediately with only tweaking needed, so I was happy with that.On the downside, the camera SUCKS.  Easily the worst camera on a third person game that I've played in a long, long time.  You'll die from things off screen, you'll get hit in combat from not being able to move the camera fast enough to see the enemies - it is REALLY frustrating.  Thankfully, the in-game checkpoints are plentiful, so there's never more than a couple minutes to move through again.  The other gripe I have is that the story is phenomenal, but it doesn't really end - there's no setup for a sequel; the story just kind of ends without any real feeling of finality or closure.  It doesn't take away from the rest of the journey, so to speak - but it does kind of sour some satisfaction with it.Still, worth five bucks on sale.  If you're looking for an adventure beat'em up, it's not bad at all.  Also good for people getting used to a Steam Controller.			"

												I didn't expect to like this game as much as I did. Obviously I expected to like it, or I wouldn't have bought it, but while I expected ""okay"", I got ""pretty great actually"".I've completed the main story at time of writing, but there are still extra things to do so I'll still be playing for a few more days. Maybe even a second run to complete achievements. The main story is about twenty hours long (on hard) if you don't make too many mistakes, and it's pretty damn linear.""Linear"" never used to be my thing, but Enslaved does it well. It has a story to tell and it tells it, and in my opinion the cutscenes, voice acting, and general characterisation are great. They really brought the game up from ""worth playing"" to ""you should play this"". Be warned, though, if you're looking for a faithful retelling of Monkey's Journey to the West, you will be sorely disappointed. This is the definition of loose adaptation. If you know the original story, you will see clever little references, but if you don't this is not the way to learn it. This is, in fact, a completely original story that happens to contain elements from Journey to the West.I recommend playing with a controller. I don't often say this, because in 90% of cases KB+M is always going to be better, but this is definitely one of those remaining 10%. Platforming and combat are incredibly awkward, but not downright impossible, without a joystick of some kind.And, yes, the other reviews are right. This is a bad port. Fortunately, most of the major issues can be fixed by tweaking inis, and there are plenty of guides right here on steam on how to do that.Much more fun than expected. Marginally more feels than expected.EDIT: Pigsy's Perfect 10 is surprisingly challenging, and I love his ""crouch"".			"

												I'm gonna go with a YEAH - OH HELL YEAH - on this one.As a guy who was spoon-fed the old-school cartoon version of The Monkey King as a child, (the one that was too ugly to be called anime,) I was somewhat skeptical on this reboot. And, though I will grant that the whole post-apocalypse-robots-wasteland-deal took a while to grow on me, I must confess, in the end: The story, (it took forever after the opening Action Sequence too get REALLY interesting,) quite simply DRAGS you into it, (kicking and screaming if it has to,) and if you have ANY knowledge of the original story I mentioned earlier, you can't help but contemplate the complexity of the concept, once you've finished the game. (noooooo WAKE UP... Not Even One spoiler! - Once you've finished the game y'all might even get that joke.)Right, so... The game itself - (I'll leave the story with you for evaluation.) The controls are actually so easy you have to make an effort to get it wrong, (granted it'll take you a while to learn to trust that fact.) Other games could learn something from these Devs. I'm not saying this platform of control or key configuration is the best ever, cause it's not. It's just that the controls are SO responsive that you actually have to be CAREFUL not to jump the gun. (You'll understand soon enough. Half of the game IS a 3D-Platformer, after all...)The Graphics are utterly beautiful, spectacular and fantastic. (Granted, there are a few ""gaps,"" where you go WTF because the beauty goes right out the window. But it's not that big a deal. The Game never really loses touch with it's background scene, so it works even without the sparkles on it.)The extras are... - extra. I don't really know how else to put it. You don't really need it. You don't really need to go through the game again with a new ""mod"" turned on, but if you wanna replay, and re-experience the stunning story with a completely ""weird"" or ""ridiculous"" outfit or other mods, you can. I personally didn't. (But then, I spent a good long week, after completing the game, reasoning out all the story-lines shout-outs to the Original Story; the philosophy; the multitude of morals implied in the game; and how absurdly many White Rabbits there are sprinkled around the entire storyline.)Combat System: Oh for the love of pete... - I know I said the controls are fabulous, (cause they are, repsonse-wise) but the combat/shooting system is REALLY flawed. Multi-target tracking is TOO DAMNED SLOW. (You'll get why later on in the game, when multiple enemies begin to become a stable fixture.)Puzzles - Well, they're not Mensa-Crackers but they WILL annoy you, if nothing else, because they take time to complete. - (You WILL be happy once you're finished with one, and curse the Devs whenever you find the next one...) But that's the way with puzzles in a 3D platform game, isn't it?Funfactor... - Meh...! It's fun the first time. But It's kind of an adrenaline-based thing. Run over here. Move this. Up, down, right, bla bla bla. Kill this, hack that, hurry, move this way - OOPS blocked, find another way. All the while, usually with a ""hurry or your companion will die!"" kind of thing hanging over you. It works, once. I found it hard to engage properly during the second playthrough, but I'm thinking it was just too soon. I've since left the game on the shelf a while to age a bit. I'm thinking when I dust it off again and play it once more, it'll be fun again.So Overall?Pros 7/10 - Good Game; Great Story;  Interesting Characters (they actually grow with the story! thumbs up for the writers!)  ; Great Graphics, SOOOO MUCH Better Than Average Controls, everythings explained, everythings understandable and generally doable, (just mind your timing,) ; the multiphasing platforming (and that's as far as I'll go towards spoilers,) works very well, even if it's a little confusing at first; Great, Scenic, Rich 3D Environments for a Platformer! - I DO hope that other Devs are taking notes. Depth Matters!Cons 3/10 - The Combat/Shooting System (see above) is without a doubt the most frustrating problem in the entire game. I died more times during ""that"" phase than I did in the rest of the entire game; Replayabillity; I love your game, Devs and I love your effort, but it's a little heavy to pick up a second time in short order, when you know the score and how it all plays out - (F-Y-I, a couple of mods won't change that. I WILL play again, but it won't be because of the mods.) ; Finally - Not enough FUN-Factor. The game, while certainly a great re-boot of the Monkey King lore, a great take on the 3D-multi-Platformer, a gorgeous piece of art, graphics-wise - it's all good, really - but there's a lack of good clean fun. (Oh I DID laugh quite a bit during the development of the story and the characters, but it was all soooo serious. I get it, I do, The Monkey King was big on High Drama. But it was funny too. So if you're gonna revamp it, why not do the funny as well? I'm not asking for Crash Bandicoot fall on your bum Fun, or witty one-two-or-three-liners. Just give us a reason to like PLAYING the game, besides getting it out the way so we can get to the next cut-scene?)So... - Good game. Very Pretty. Great Story. Fun, but not tons of it. I'd reccomend it to Story-Lovers, whether they know or like The Monkey King saga, or not. Oh yeah, and just so you know, (I like this, but I'm guessing some people don't,) from a gamer's point of view, this game is LOOOOOOOONG! So bring patience, lean back, and enjoy.			"

												Let me start off by saying I usually hate linear games because I have no free will to enjoy the game how i desire which is why I will only every buy free roam games when they are full price and not fps or forced campaigns. Other games just don't seem worth it. However this game leading up to that horrible ending of course has atleast improved my thoughts on the linear field of games.

												This game may not be well known or be a great one, but it's still a pretty good game. ENSLAVED is a bit generic action adventure game, with some platforming which is almost always on auto-pilot. The combat is fluid, but a bit simplistic, without complex combos and with only a few extra gadgets. But honestly, this game doesn't need those. The game focuses on it's story and characters, and while the story isn't that great (but good), the characters, the voice acting and their interactions are really well done. The game lasts around 10 hours, which is normal for this genre. The graphics and music are also good. There's also a DLC mini-story, that although has a different style of gameplay, i also enjoyed it, slightly less that the main game. I recommend this game on sale.			"

												Cute game with rather stale gameplay that is outweighed by beautiful art design. Features 2 button fighting system with upgrades and simplistic platforming. Story is kinda of dumb and with plenty of plot holes, but the characters make up for it. Surprisingly, the DLC  - Pigsys Perfect 10 is very good and outshines the base game a due to variety of gadgets and interactions between them.			"
