								I used to be a SCUBA diver.  Can't do it anymore.   There are days when I miss it all so bad it hurts.  The freedom.  The solitude.  The Unknown...    It's all out there, hidden beneath the waves. Subnautica is the game I have been waiting for.  In a strange way, it feeds the sea-hunger inside me somehow.  Can't quite explain this sensation without having it sound corny and contrived, but that's how it works for me.I stumbled onto Subnautica purely by chance while browsing YouTube gaming clips.  Ever seen that *one* game that stops you dead in your tracks?  I did. Definitely got my attention, as I recall.  It was an Early Access release, so I could expect all kinds of unforeseen digital weirdness happening inside the game itself.  My PC's operating specs were a tad on the light side too, but it didn't matter.  I wanted that game.  Badly.I bought it.  I played it.  I built things and survived. I enjoyed every minute that I spent 'underwater' again.    It's an alien ocean on an alien world.  Curiously, the sights and sounds around you might seem strangely familiar, in spite of the bizarre shapes Life has taken in this place.  There is indescribable beauty to be found here, side by side with terrible dangers that are either innocently disguised or glaringly obvious.  It takes a certain mindset to fully appreciate this world,  as well as considerable restraint to avoid blindly lashing out at every shadow that flits past your facemask.      Remember.  YOU are the intruder down there. Take a deep breath and immerse yourself completely.  Welcome to Subnautica.			"

								Everyone talks about how it's early access, bugs, blah blah blah. If you're reading this review, you know about all that. I recently realized I am a huge fan of survival sandbox games, and I have played quite a few in the last months.  Here is my personal impression of this one.Graphics are incredible. I know everyone has said this, but it needs repeating. On the lowest settings, it still looks awesome! Some clipping and such, but it never really bothered me much.It's very fluid (no pun intended) to get into it. I agree with most other reviews that recommend no using guides and such and just jump into the deep water (pun intended) and learn to swim on your own. It's a very friendly interface that gives just enough explanation to make you feel like you can do it on your own, but not enough to make it boring.Edit: I forgot the most important part (to me at least.) The metabolism for food in this game is very nice. In plenty of other games like this you have to eat every two minutes or face death from starvation. In this game, keeping hydrated is the issue. While this is rather ironic while being surrounded by water, it makes a lot more sense. I get away with eating once every day or two depending on my activity. Dehydration keeps me drinking daily, but not constantly. Considering dehydration kills you faster than starvation, I feel this is the most realistic representation I have seen in one of these games thus far. Here is what any new player needs to know:Expect it will hurt you until you prove to yourself that it can't. Explore. Even the dark and scary areas. They usually have the best loot.Storage cubes cannot be used indoors (as of the writing of this review.)Predators are everywhere and you are not one of them. If it can eat you, it will.If it can eat you, it's usually in a scary area.You WILL get snuck up on and jumpscared. Give it at least an hour before you start looking up stuff online, and once you do, do it very sparingly. Discovery is an awesome feature to this game and the more you have to figure out, the more valuable this game will be.			"

Early Access Review
								After 41 hours, I feel like I'm ready to say my piece about this game.  It's important to specify that I'm playing in survival mode where you have to constantly worry about food and water.  The game will be very different depending on which mode you play, because in the sandbox mode you can freely build and explore without every having to stop what you're doing to gather nourishment.  In hardcore, you have to be extra careful, because once you die you have to start over.  At this point, I'm glad I did not pick hardcore, because there are ways you can die that just aren't forseeable.  There also occasional bug in the game which results in your death, like the all too common diving reel malfunctions.First Impressions:This game is amazing.  That can be, and is, said about many games.  But there is nothing like Subnautica.  I had been waiting for 19 years, ever since playing the crap out of the incredibly immersive, fun, but ultimately flawed Sub Culture.  Finally, we have a game that surpasses Sub Culture in every aspect except the storyline.  With that said, Subnautica has flaws.The Bad:In all it's glory, there are a few nags, some of which make the game increasingly difficult as you get further into the game.  First, I'm going to get it out of the way that there is a startup bug that made me almost request a refund even before getting into the game. Subnautica doesn't always start, because the game menu screen frequently refuses to fully load.  This is probably some sort of GPU initialization issue that prevents the graphics from displaying properly.  In any event, I have to exit out of the game and restart it in Window mode to get the game to finish loading at all.Also, The learning curve is very steep.  There are no instructions for anything, and the information given on any device in the crafting menus tell you nothing worthwhile about what stuff does.  There are some basic descriptions, but they're very poor.  For example the current generator says it generates current.  When I started playing I had no idea what I would want to create a current for.The third thing is the max depth of the in game vehicles.  There is much debate about the actual depth of the game.  Some say it goes on forever.  Others have quoted that the game crashes out at 60,000 meters.  Some have said 20,000 meters.  Others have said there is a secret world in the greatest depths, which sounds pretty epic.  In any event.  The ocean goes deeper than I feel comfortable thinking about.  The problem here lies in the fact that the vehicles seem to have a max depth of 200 meters.  (I've since found the Cyclops can go to approximately 900 meters at the expense of power efficiency.  I believe the Seamoth can also go to a comparable depth.)Fourth, the hunger and thirst meters drop far too quickly.  This seems nitpicky when you consider I did pick the survival mode, but the problem with this system is that you have to spend hunger and thirst to find food that becomes increasily more difficult to find as the game goes on.  As a result, you might find yourself spending almost half your time gathering food and supplies to make water.  Which leads me to the next problem in the game.Fifth, scarcity of food and supplies for making water.  At first, everything is plentiful and readily available.  Salt, while a challenge to find when you don't know what you're looking for, seems to respawn readily and limitlessly.  Coral, while seemingly limitless at first, begins to disappear rapidly after many hours of gameplay.  Moreover, I have seen no indication that it respawns.  Food, which pretty much comes from the natural fish stocks, can disappear amazingly fast from an area.  After 41 hours of gaming, I have effectively cleared all of the initial shallows of the ocean, plus the surrounding depths of fish.  It's amazing how fast they diminish.  The only solution seems to be to put respawning, or faster reproduction, of the fish in the game.  I have not seen any indication that the fish respawn at all, which seems clear by some of the dead zones I have in my current save.  There are some pretty heated debates about this in the discussion groups.  Naysayers claim the supplies are unlimited, and all you have to do is look further.  My answer to that is that you begin to spend a lot more thirst and food meter, energy, and other resources to find food.  Because of this there is a rapidly diminishing return on the value of food and water in the game.  The devs claim it causes people to explore more.  I'm not satisfied with that response, because the reality is this:  if people have no motivation to explore.  If they just stick to the shallows and eat and drink, they aren't going to have the attention span to stick with the game for the long term anyway. Apparently, a fix is being tested in the experimental mode, but it's coming all too slow to a stable build.Sixth, and my final gripe, and this is definitely as glaring as the fifth, scarcity of resources.  Copper, Quartz, Acid Mushrooms are plentiful at first, but become ridiculously difficult to come by as the game goes on.  Quartz is practically used in everything, because you need it for glass and rubber, which you need for building and making Power Cells to power your vehicles.  Each Power Cell takes a vast amount of resources, which would not be as much of a problem if they didn't deplete so rapidly.  Even with the power efficiency mod only a small expedition can use 6 power cells and leave you scrambling for resources.  Many users have defaulted to the same argument they have given to the food shortage problem, that there's plenty in the depths.  The problem is that it takes more and more energy, food, and water to farm this stuff.  You end up trapped in a cycle of more and more rapidly diminishing marginal utility on all of your resources.  This really need to be fixed or users will basically be driven out of their own game by scarcity. Both of the last two problems have people vehemently defending the current scarcity, with the argument that resources are scarce in real life.  I would like to point out, however, that one person alone in a wilderness does not leave vast expanses of land void of any life.  Certainly these rich biomes should be able to support just one person.  Also, if the player were able to hunt for shellfish and crustaceans in the game, diversity of foods might help lower depletion rates.  The player should be able to find oysters and dig for clams.  The Good:Based on my criticisms, some might get the idea that I don't like the game.  That couldn't be more wrong.  Subnautica is, hands down, simply the best underwater game ever made.  There's no competition.  The environment is rich, full of wonder, and among the most immersive games I've ever played.  The world is packed full of fascinating creatures, beautiful vegetation, and unparalleled undersea effects.  The graphics are complimented by some of the most incredible sound you could possibly imagine.  All of it adds up to a game that makes you feel like you're living rather than playing.It's one of those games that comes along and really changes things forever, at least among those who have played it.  In my opinion, the game hasn't gotten nearly the recognition it deserves.  The amount of stuff you can do in this game, and the painstaking attention to detail are mindblowing.  Those are things I hope never change with Subnautica.  Many early access games are dumbed down in later iterations.  Unknown Worlds Entertainment seems to have a good attitude about adding new features instead of taking them out, like some other developers of early access releases have done in the past.  I just hope they maintain the trend.Subnautica is an oustanding game, worth its price about three times over.  It comes with my highest recommendation. In it's current state, I would give Subnautica a 9/10.			"

								After being interested in what I saw on steam, I followed this up with some gamer reviews on Youtube.Several notable game reviewers and let's play's later I was hooked.Right off the bat, most basic functions were intuitive.Movement was the standard WASD, I quicly figured out TAB opened my PDA, etc...Off I went.  Nearly drowning myself within a minute.A few minutes later I got too close to something that didn't agree with my presence.A few minutes after that I realised I needed some food.And so my adventures in survival began.Since then I made several mistakes in base design or venturing too far.I still remember the time I stranded myself in my seamoth(minisub) at about 600 meters, at night and my sub ran out of power.  I wont repeat the word I said.But that is the sort of situation which captivates and maintains my enjoyment.  You trully are responsible for your survival.  Once you get a hang for how things go, you can quickly get a base going within 10 minutes.  Have a minisub in less than an hour.  But it is not a race.  It is a sandbox experience to enjoy in all its beauty and depth.  (pun)As the game progresses you must venture away from the safety of shallow waters for materials.The revamped Day/Night cycle and newer water graphics are breathtaking.  Nighttime is both visually beautiful and terrifying.  Daytime can be deceptively safe by comparison.I eagerly await each major update and new content the developers add.  Each time, I cannot resist diving deep into subnautica.  I hope you all enjoy it as much as I have so far.Highly recommended, especially for what it will cost.  If still unsure, give youtube a look.Happy gaming!			"

								Wow. This game is amazing. Pros-The graphics are sharp. -The controls are smooth and intuitive.-The crafting system is simple.-The Creatures are Diverse-There is lots to explore-That little Red Puffer Fish with the Funny Sounds in the Caves, I like him.Con-Thirst and Hunger increase kind of fast, with so much to explore I want to spend my time exploring or building, not collecting fish for food and water, it gets repetitive.-Items don't stack. Maybe they are going for realism but I'll give you and example of why It doesn't really matter. Mushrooms for example, if you fill your inventory with them and then drop them all somewhere you will see that carrying that many Mushrooms that size is not realistic to begin with, so why not just make them stack. -Also one more thing to add. It gets lonely, really lonely. Maybe give us some kind of robotic companion drone, or something like that.Kifflom.			"

								There is no other game like this on steam and once you begin to play you'll never be able to stop. Beautiful immersive world that sucks you in with its bright colors and delightful sounds then scares the crap out of you with its shaped teethed creatures who may or may not swollow you whole. Hunt for teasure and loot, discover the mystery behind the crash and the missing crew, explore the vast ocean from friendly cheerful coral reefs of the Safe shallows to the dark deep underwater caves of the Blood Kelp and the Jelly Shroom caves. Make your own underwater base and set up your new home on the alien world. Grow underwater crops inside and outside your base, make a aquarium and collect or breed fish for food or jus to keep them as pets and much much more.Has active devs that give the game tiny updates about once a month so you never have to wait half a year or more to get new content and a very nice and helpful  steam community.To put it simply this is the best undersea adventure you'll ever have.

								So this is what happens when good devs make a single player survival game. Amazing. I've put in 90 hours in one week, and  my only regret is my bodies weakness for sleep and food. My game started to lag real bad around 10 hours in. I learned about deleting CellsCache and CompiledOctreesCache and most of my lag problems were solved. I repeat the process every 5 hours or so, depending on how much exploring I do (cumulative exploration makes this worse for some reason). This created an unintentional side effect of resource nodes respawning and my base is now glorious and full of beautiful windows:

								This is why I love this game:I remember starting up minecraft for the first time, when I was 13 years old. Everything felt exciting and scary but interesting, I forgot everything around me and was immersed in the world for hours on end. No other game gave me that same level of immersion, that same feeling of wonder, for years.  Until this game came a long, right from the first minute I was transported back into the mindset of a 13 year old kid, exploring and learning in awe.So I wholeheartedly would suggest subnautica.			"

								No Game Does *Exploration* Survival Like SubnauticaThere are buttloads of Survival games to choose from - okay this is *underwater* Survival but the survival aspects are nothing new - eat, drink, heal.  Where Subnautica excels is in the exploration.  There's no in-game map so even when you've been in an area many times before, you're still going to find that little cave or tunnel you've never seen before, and inside it?  A new lifeform or plant you've never seen before!But Exploration is only fun in a gaming sense when there's some danger involved, right?  Okay, take your pick: aggressive sea creatures, aggressive plants, or suffocation.  So you're pushing out into an area you've never been to before right?  You've just upgraded your air tanks so you've got 100 seconds of oxygen.  You start your dive....still can't see the bottom...hearing extremely creepy sounds coming from the depths...passing the tops of the Creepvines now....70 seconds of oxygen...you can see the bottom now...why is the sand all stirred up down there?....let's investigate...are those giant mushrooms...glowing?...50 seconds left...WOW LITHIUM!!!

								As a marine biologist, I think the creators of this game should get an award only for their beautiful ideas of marine xenobiotic life. I hope for more and more interesting new lifeforms to get invented, because it keeps me hooked on researching and disovering the game. Maybe it would be possible to program some npc-interactions in order to make the artificial environment more alive. If you need some ideas about that or for general scientific questions just feel free to contact me. The game itself is at a good stage for an early alpha and one can see the continously work of the programers. The graphics are beautiful and the game is fluently playable. The implanted bug-report-system is quite helpful and keeps the development close to the community. I think this is another milestone in game-developing they have made. I just hope the development of the game will not be dropped after finishing the beta....This game has the potential of becoming a real milestone in game history if it is treated right. Just imagine all the possibilities... Thumbs up and keep up with this good work! :-)			"

								""Oh that's pretty!"" ""What the hell is that?""""That place looks scary, I ain't going down there.""""WHY DID I SUDDENLY LOSE HEALTH?""""WHAT THE FG#$@#&*(@  IS THAT?"" -Quotes you will find yourself saying when you play Subnautica.  One of the best survival/exploration games currently on Steam with an active development team. Pros:>Beautifully detailed ocean world, ranging from shallow reefs to deep dark scary underground ravines brimming with alien life. Sound design is brilliant albeit can be refined in certain places.>Awesome base customisation options, letting you assemble your own underwater base from a list of parts which you can add to via research. You can build add interior decorations such as aquariums and fill them with fish and plants you found, furniture, bulkhead doors and many more which I won't spoil. You also have to build means of producing power in order to power your base.>Research fragments scattered through the world force you to get out of your comfort zone and descend into the depths in search of new technologies to research. This ties in great to the exploration mechanic. I mentioned that Subnautica is one of the best exploration games I've ever played. I actually am quite afraid of what's lying in the depths of the world's oceans and this game honestly gave me a sense of fear that you don't usually get in these types of games.>Pretty awesome databank on all the life forms you've encountered and scanned with your research scanner. I eagerly await this feature to be implemented further.>Some downright incredible creature designs. Scary sharks on crack, big octopi with translucent heads. MAKE MORE SPOOKY CREATURES! The person(s) who designed the sea creatures and monsters deserves a pat on the back and an expensive chocolate cake for their work.>Surprisingly easy inventory management. I was not a fan of the inventory system at first, but got used to it pretty quickly. Instead of dragging items from one screen to another, the game does it for you and puts each item together. It saves you the trouble of looking through bogged down chests, dropping and dragging items. >Simple crafting. As long as it's in your inventory you can craft it. The crafting system is simple yet effective. Open up the fabricator, select what you want to craft and it'll do it for you. At this present time there really isn't really anything technical that you can craft. Craftable items like the Cyclops just require a healthy quantity of expensive crafting items. I hope they add more technical crafting in the future.Cons:>A rather unintuitive base building mechanic, similar in some ways to the old Rust or Unturned where you have to move your character around until the base part snaps into position. It can be frustrating, especially with parts like the Scanner Room. >Unrefined combat makes it difficult for you to actually hit any vile sea-demon that's following you. Generally you'll get hit first and manage to land a single hit on their body as they swim away. Without the stasis rifle it's really not that great.>Nothing to do. Once you build the Cyclops, go on the Aurora and explore the deepest dankest depths you're basically done. I know the Devs have some glorious things planned and I really hope they implement them soon. Furthermore, it sucks to admit that Subnautica (in its present state) doesn't have much replay value. I will admit that my first playthrough took me roughly 10 hours to complete (That's getting all the blueprints, building the Cyclops, going on the Aurora etc.) After that, I really was not compelled to start again. Overall, Subnautica is a game with massive potential. It's come a long way yet it has an even longer way to go. I really can't wait to see what the developers have in store for Subnautica, and what the final game will look like.  In its present state it earns an easy 7/10. A lack of content and some bugs and glitches here and there bring's the game's score down, but some grease can easily bring this to a 9/10.			"

								I have been burned by early access. Developers that spurn their own customers, and games that become vapourware. On that note, I've been in a chat room, actively chatting to the developers and other players over the weekend, having only bought it on Saturday. I've never seen a dev team more engrossed in their own player base, from helping people with crash problems, to taking on board suggestions, to talking about planned features, they're completely open. There are stable releases every few weeks, and (three times a day) experimental developer builds to keep folks sated. I can without a doubt say that this game is made with passion, and as such, I think it'll go far.The game itself? In its current state, it is highly enjoyable as an exploration game. I'm rarely one to enjoy a purely scenic experience, but with the sound design and asthetics, more often than not, I found myself just buildng a base somewhere pretty and pressing my face to the glass. There isn't a huge amount to do at the moment, collect resources, build the mini-sub, and larger submarine, build a base (though without much to put in it yet), considering this only came out on steam 4 months ago though, it's coming along at break neck speeds, and is astoundingly polished already.I was worried I'd spend 2 hours and experience everything and be done with it, now I'm having to pull myself away less I spend another 5 hours today swimming around petting carnivorous fish.

								First off this is a great game you just need to look at a lot of other reviews to know that so I wont go into all of that in depth.I have spent a lot of time travelling around this game and have gotten lost a few times which cause most of my deaths while I haven't spent much time in survival I preferred to go with Freedom mode (no food or water needs) and there is a lot more to discover with a lot of potential.Pros: - Great Graphics - Great Music - Great design of flora and fauna (I haven't encountered it all and I have encountered some weird things) - Game mod options - Simple crafting system and easy to use. - Nice vehicles and I cannot wait to see more - Underwater Bases (coming soon and look amazing) - Land (Yes you read that right and I know it's all about the underwater but there is land out there and yes you can go on there and your helmet comes off and you do actually walk on it. However there isn't much to do on it) Getting there is the hard but I needed the Cyclops to get there.Cons: - Some resources are damn hard to find. - The map can a bit small with vast empty areas although there are some things out there. - Same map every time - No Tutorial (having to figure all this stuff out can be hard for a new comer and I had to go to the internet to find the materials I required) - Predators can be a little too easy to fight and avoid. - No BIG sea monsters (I wanted to see a massive sea monster a creature that rules the oceans there might be one thing that qualifies but I am yet to see it) - There is no progression in some sort of story which I would love to see cause while I love this planet but it gets lonely. - A few bugs are around (there is no edge to the map and I once encountered a hole and I got to about 2K down in depth before my sub finally ran out of power)Suggestions: - Start building a colony (it was your mission after all) - Have more to do on the land - More vicious predators (I feel like I want to be stalked by a predator every now and again)FINAL SCORE8/10It is in need of more content but all in all it is a great game that has so many options for expanding and I will look forward to seeing it all. I hope so see the closest thing the a sentient species on this planet and the possibility of alien technology (You cannot be the other race to crash here)			"

Early Access Review
								This is a fantastic game. It has had some amazing upgrades since the beginning of its early access, demonstrating that the devs are invested in the completion of this game. Not sure if you want to buy it?- When you start Subnautica you begin in a futuristic survival dingy. The graphics are somewhat cartoony, but in a way that's easy on the eyes. This is tempered toward a more serious tone. The water effects are amazing. If you've ever gone scubadiving or serious snorling this game's going to bring some strong nostalgia. - The main objectives of the game are not here yet. 2015. Updates are frequent though. Several a month or just one big one per month. - Right now, the things you'll be doing are gathering resources and building things. 1This is far from the boredom of most survival games. The things you can build are truly unique. There's also a lot of advantage to building a base besides storage. The devs listen to what we've asked for and a lot of module components to be bases have been given that are purely to allow you more aesthetic and functionality options that look incredible. No grunge here. This game gives you sleek, clean, and beautiful everything.2Modules. This is a big part of Subnautica. As you advance in your understanding of resource gathering and building various architecture you'll find yourself coming upon "" fragments "". These things are debris from your crashed ship that can be analyzed using a specialized device. After the analysis is complete you'll be able to build more advanced bases, submaurines, and components to your everything. 3Wild life. Recently a bunch of new wild life has been added to the game that are rather awesome. The wildlife was already awesome, but now as you explore you're much more conscious of just where you are. 4Conscious of your environment. This game is the first to make me very conscious of the different environments I'm in. Lighting changes dramatically depending on a number of circumstances, but altogether the effects are such that you begin to realize you must develop a strong presence of mind. Sometimes it is oxygen that is a real challenge. Sometimes electricity is the greater struggle. In short, if you're into survival games and you aren't playing this you're smoking the wrong stuff.

								Subnautica is an underwater survival game set on an alien planet that is currently available through Early Access. Your ship, the Aurora, has been struck by a mysterious energy pulse and you have been forced to crash land on an unknown alien planet. You are the only survivor after managing to escape in a life pod which has landed in the world's ocean and know you must find food and water to survive.Subnautica is a game I had my eye on for a while and was extremely excited to play, but I must admit, for what is currently available in the game I am slightly disappointed. After only 4 hours of playing there's not much left for me to do other than explore.+Nice graphics+Incredibly well designed flora and fauna, all of the creatures in the game are wonderfully unique and interesting to look at, particularly the predators+Simple crafting system+Quite a lot of craftable items+Very relaxing+Great sound effects which are very immersive+A number of different biomes+The sea floor uses a voxel terrain system which can be dug up and manipulated+Different levels of rarity for resources +Large cave systems which are fun to explore+Very frequent updates+Soon you will be able to build underwater seabases (currently available in the experimental build)-Vehicle batteries deplete ridiculously quickly. Take for example the sea glide (a DPV), it's battery only lasts for one minute and it cannot be recharged, only replaced and this is the same for both of the submersibles-The map is relatively small and some areas feel very empty-The map is always the same, the game would really benefit from some sort of procedural map generation system-Nutrition and thirst levels deplete ridiculously quickly meaning you spend a lot of time hunting for food and water supplies-From what I can tell once you've built the large submersible there's not much to do (there may be craftable items I haven't yet discovered how to make)-The game slows down a hell of a lot when loading a new areaVerdict:7A fun experience that has a lot of potential and has great design but currently has a serious lack of content and depth so only buy it if you wish to support its development.El K.

								Super awesome game with not only tons of potential, but tons of potential already realized.For those with performance issues try this:In your Steam library right-click Subnautica, select Properties, on the first tab open the Set Launch Options, type or copy paste without the quotes: ""-window-mode exclusive"", save and launch.That will fix the severe FPS/stuttering on not only this game, but any modern Unity based game.

Early Access Review
								Subnautica is an absolutely beautiful game. Even though it is still in early access, the developers have done a very nice job with what is available as of yet. The fact that the game constantly encourages you to report bugs (which so far are pretty rare, surprisingly) allows me to trust that this game is only going to get better. Not only that, but some of the features/creatures that are planned for future updates (check out the Subnautica Wikia to see what I mean), have got me absolutely giddy.The good:-I love survival games, and while I would probably enjoy most of the popular survival games available on Steam, Subnautica managed to really stick out for me. Subnautica takes place (98% of the time) submerged underwater, which is really a brilliantly fresh approach to a survival game.-Subnautica takes place on an alien planet, full of fascinating life forms. This really appeals to me, probably because I've always been a huge fan of games such as Pikmin (Gamecube), that are stocked full of unfamiliar biologies. The creatures in Subnautica aren't too cheesy though, esspecially the larger ones... The larger one's are either stunningly magnificent and/or terrifying.-The environment is beautiful, and yet equally eerie. There are multiple biomes that make up the planet of Subnautica, and each biome has a unique ecosystem for the player to discover. Some of these biomes are cut-off from early game becuase of how deep they are, meaning that you have to craft things such as a spare oxygen tank or even a submarine to reach.-Instead of being able to eventually upgrade your character to fight off the larger-scale hostile creature(s), Subnautica currently has a bit of realism to it. Of course you're not going to try and fight off a giant angry serpent with claws pertruding from it's face. Any normal human is going to NOPE the ♥♥♥♥ out, which brings a bit of a horror-feel to it. (Currently there is really only one creature that is like this, but the developers are working on animating new creatures that are way larger, and/or waaay more terrifying)-With the above said, the player is able to fight off most hostile creatures as they are smaller and more practically killable. Still, even these creatures tend to attack out of no-where which gives a nice element of surprise.-There is plenty to craft and it's not exceedingly annoying to do so, either. Instead of being stranded with just the clothes on your back, the player is left with some advanced technologies left over from the ship-wreck that allow you to craft complex things (such as a battery or high-tech machineries) out of basic materials found in the ocean.-Also, underwater bases. Currently the bases you can make are pretty simple. On the exterior, they are basically just tubes with the option of adding windows, but I've seen pictures of bases some people have made in the Experimental Mode that look amazing, so it's appearant that bases with much more complexity will be brought in soon.The bad:-Not much to be said here honestly. I guess one thing I would like to see is a better indication of a hostile creature losing health. Maybe not a health-bar, but something. I find myself having to continuosly knife things that may have been dead a while ago. I mean, I know they aren't going to drop to the ground because they are underwater, but it would be nice if there were some sort of death animation.-Also, another thing that bothered me during one of my playthroughs is the radiation. The ship that you ejected yourself from before the start of the game explodes pretty early in the game which causes a huge radiation leakage in the surrounding waters. A few of my playthroughs this wasn't a problem, and you can craft a radiation suit and even stop the radiation leakage altogether with the proper equipment, but in one particular playthrough the radiation instantly surrounded my escape-pod before I even had a means to craft a radiation suit or build a new base. I'm not sure if this was intended, as it seemed to be a one-time occurence for me.Other than that this game has been great thus far. I even feel as though this is going to be one of those games that I will obsess about. If you like survival games, but are bored of fending off wolves or zombies, this is a great alternative and I would recommend it to anybody.Can't wait for the final product. :)			"

								One of the main things I find most interesting about this game, is the fact that you are practically at the bottom of the food chain. In most survival games players usually have the advantage of being able to craft weapons for killing off an enemy, just not in this game. In Subnautica, you have practically NO means to kill or harm predators, and this alien planet is teeming with all sorts of things that want nothing more than to pick your bones. Beng human on earth, we take comfort in the knowlege that we are the #1 predator. Now let us put a human in an alien ocean that is filled with massive marine predators that have no true enemies. That combined with a lack of weapons gives players an insight on what it feels like to be prey.Pros of subnautica. great open-world environment. easy to follow plot. great diversity of creatures. atmoshperic environments. realistic graphics (in experimental). tests player's ability to manage resources. non-offensive survival Cons of Subnautica. can get boring in between updates. loading screen may take some time. some pcs are not compatable with this game. (currently) plant and animal resources do not regenerate. there are some texture bugsI still would like to give this game a YES to those who enjoy survival, crafting, aliens, underwater, and open-world games. Please keep in mind that this game has a lot that needs to be added and fixed. Subnautica has a lot of potential, and I look forward to seeing the final product.			"

								This game is horrible... why is it horrible??? Because of this game I can't sleep at night, why cant I sleep at night you say??? Because all I can think about is how fun this game is and I can't wait to play it again tomorrow. So thanks Devs of Subnautica!!!!Lets be honest people... there are some bugs Iv'e noticed while playing, but that's extremely normal for such a new game, Just look at it this way, the more people who buy this game and support Subnautica the better it will become in the future. Just make sure to ""F8"" and report any bugs or glitches you may find, and help this team of four out. I almost never recommend games unless they grab my attention, and Subnautica did. PRO: - Graphics are beautiful, its almost as if you crashed your ship on the avatar planet Pandora. The sea life is creative and like nothing you have seen before.- Exploration never gets boring! The sea floor is huge and would take forever to explore every inch of it. And It's only growing larger with future updates with more unique animals and biomes - My computer is a potato and yet i can still run this game smoothly with around 80 frames.- The crafting system is fair and reasonable and even the biggest NOOB can understand how to use it.- Music is awesome, from peaceful to ""OMG THERE'S SOMETHING BEHIND ME!!!!"" CON: - A few minor bugs from here to there.I seriously recommend this game, and I will assure you that you won't regret it.WARNING: May cause happiness and a permanent smile.			"

								This game is genuinely terrifying. Not jump scare terrifying. Not blood and gore terrifying. No, this game triggers fear in me on a primal level. Something mammalian buried deep within me that I didn't even know I had. The immersion and the feeling of being underwater in Subnautica can be very real, and the pitch black depths quite daunting.

Early Access Review
								Subnautica casts you as the lone survivor of a colony mission, stranded on a faraway ocean planet. It being Early Access means there's no real story or goal here other than survival, but there's plenty to see and do as you putter around the seas. Your escape pod has a basic crafting device and some storage to serve as a home base, so your first steps will be scavenging materials off the ocean floor and building essentials like knives, flippers, oxygen tanks, and food. Basic recipes for these things appear by default in the crafting interface, and more appear as you find new materials, so it pays to grab at least one of everything. There are a few hangups in the crafting progression, like figuring out how to make lubricant or finding enough silver to break into advanced crafting, but on the whole it's clearer and more engaging than most crafting systems.One major draw of the game is the ability to build undersea bases, and thankfully that's one of the first things you can do. Basic building components generally require only the most common materials, so you can have your own sealab up and running within 15 minutes if you know what you're doing. They're very much worth building, too, because you can set up water purifiers, submarine docks, storage systems, and a couple cosmetic options like aquariums and picture frames that display your screenshots. There's some kind of structural integrity system I don't get yet that limits how big you can build them, but I've seen screenshots of sprawling underwater complexes so there must be a lot more to it.The progression seems to be to build a base, build an analyzer to get new blueprints from the wreckage you find, and then build vehicles to let you travel further. The map is not procedurally generated but it is huge, with many different environments to explore. Alien sealife is extremely varied and serves as one of the ways to limit you, as it can be hard to tell what's hazardous, and you'll need components from the wildlife too. Parts of the ocean are also irradiated from your ship's crash, so that's another gate to overcome. Even after three hours I've only explored a tiny section of the ocean, but that's included coral tube caves, seaweed forests, an abyss filled with glowing polyps and quartz, and an actual island with some very unpleasant inhabitants.If you can't tell from the screenshots, the game is gorgeous. Despite being an alpha, everything that's been put in the game is extremely polished, with only a few placeholders for item pickups that I've noticed so far. The flora and fauna are very well animated, though fish can get hung up on geometry pretty regularly. The sea floor is actually deformable, both through your base construction and just digging through sand, and I've found a few hidden caves that way. Movement is swift and responsive, the interface is clean, and the sound design is on point. There's not a ton to do besides build bases and submarines and explore the ocean, but there's a lot of ocean to explore, and Subnautica is built well enough to make it a very, very fun journey.			"

								Yes. Just Yes.This is the perfect example of what an EA title can achieve when it isn't wasting resources trying to be an MMO during development.If you enjoy playing survival games, and can appreciate the atmosphere\setting of being stranded alone on an ocean planet - I highly recommend you pick this little beauty up.The scavenging and crafting system is unique and fantastic to use. No remembering recipes - you are a technologically advanced humanoid - blueprint database and fabricator for you from day 0! (This doesnt make it easier btw)In order to survive and progress, you must scavenge the resources available to you - sand, rocks, minerals, metal scrap (from your crash landed ship) aquatic fauna & flora etc. You must eat & drink to survive, and this is done by hunting the local fauna. Be careful though - not all are harmless!Certain ""fish"" will allow you to fabricate different resources. For example the bladder fish allows the extraction of drinking water when returned to the fabrication systems. Other fauna grant a certain amount food, as well as either an increase or decrease in thirst depending on the species.Once you have established a method of staying alive, its time to build your submerged base and really start exploring the massive ocean & underwater cave systems. Better resources are often at greater depths, meaning you must equip yourself with enough O2 to make your dive. This can be as simple as an o2 tank on your back, or perhaps you can find enough resources diving to build a sub and go even deeper?Overall, plenty to see and do. The game looks and feels superb, and is hard to fault in its current version (h20 update).I cant recommend this enough.			"

Early Access Review
								I have a very love/hate relationship with Subnautica. As an avid lover and player of survival games, I of course had to try out this game, though not without some serious hesitation because the ocean absolutely terrifies me. However, I am very glad that I forced myself to conquer my fear, because this game is incredible.I will be honest: the game does have its fair share of bugs and glitches, and at times the lag can be almost game-breaking, but there are ways to work around it and even temporary fixes that people have found. Probably the most terrifying and obnoxious glitch is constantly sinking through the ground when walking in your PRAWN suit. However, the sheer beauty of this game is more than enough to keep bringing me back, not to mention the actual playstyle. Subnautica has this incredible ability to stir a vast range of emotions within me, and often in only a two minute span.- Curiosity: What's in this cave; is this even a cave?! I need to know more about the precursors! - Awe: This... is... incredible. So beautifully detailed that it feels absolutely real. - Excitement: Yes, finally! I gathered enough titanium and stalker teeth to make my cyclops! - Anxiety: Oh god, I know I'm almost out of oxygen but I need this moonpool fragment so badly...- Terror: Oh no, no no no no no don't eat me OH GOD. Warper please just go eat that infected fish and not me...- Anger: That leviathan was literally NOWHERE NEAR ME. RIP seamoth.If I'm being absolutely honest, this game 100% terrifies me. I have to watch YouTubers explore the deep grand reef or inactive lava zone before I do it myself. I have to convince myself every single time that I have to go into a zone with Warpers that I can evade them - and they still creep up on me, teleport me out of my vehicle, and induce a panic attack. While the developers may not have intended Subnautica to be a horror game, if you have even the most remote, tiny fear of the ocean or its creatures - welcome to this survival horror gem. The music alone will give you goosebumps and make you realize how utterly alone - yet not alone - you are on this alien planet.Some of my favorite aspects of this game include:- The detailed lore of just about every single thing in the world of Subnautica. It really makes you want to scan every mushroom, every monster, hell even the leviathan just to be able to understand the world you're stuck on just a little better. Also, I just find it incredibly fascinating, which is a good thing because it entices me to explore every area which brings me promptly out of my comfort zone (aka the safe shallows...)- The base building. While the construction system can still be a little glitchy at times, I just love the freedom players are given to create a truly cool and unique base in any part of the game, whether you build right under your lifepod in the safe shallows or the deepest part of the inactive lava zone. I especially love the farming system! I have countless little colorful gardens just for me to view little parts of all the different biomes safely from my own home.- The variety of flora and fauna. While the majority of Subnautica's fauna terrifies me, I do have to appreciate the effort the developers have made to really make this planet feel as beautiful and terrifying realistic as possible - and trust me, they have succeeded.- The storyline. Oh man, does the storyline of the game hit you in the feels. I live with such high anticipation for every new update they release, just so I can get my hands on the next piece of the puzzle, so to speak. It's entertaining, interesting, and well written and developed.- The graphics. I know I've mentioned this several times now, but this game is utterly gorgeous to the point of realism. There are so many different biomes, each featuring their own unique design that's either beautiful, horrifying, or both. It's usually both. So, if you're on the fence about whether or not Subnautica is worth it, allow me to give you the confirmation you're looking for: IT IS. This game just keeps getting better and better with each new update they put out, and soon enough the main focus will turn to bug fixes and optimization. This game is in great shape for an early access, and I literally cannot wait for what they have in store for us next!10/10 will continue to be utterly terrified by warpers.			"

Early Access Review
								Long story short, this game is amazing.I bought this game before the PRAWN update. Back then the Seamoth upgrades and moonpool had only just been added. Blueprints for the cyclops were much too easy to find. Within 10 hours of gameplay I had both of my subs. Already then, it was an extremely emersive game. But now, with the storyline nearing completion, and rebalanced gameplay, it is totally fabulousLet me clarify with a classic pro-con list.PROS:Emersion - the music, the feel, the fog, the wildlife, colors, lighting, the whole shabang, make this game not only play nice, but also feel nice. This is where Subnautica distinguishes itself most from other open-world games. The joy of discovery, the wetness of the water, and the fear of the depths are downloaded to your mind along with the 6GB of disk space this game consumes.GUI - simple to operate, minimalistic futuristic crafting and inventory management. The inventory is large, but you are unable to stack items, meaning you don't get much inventory clutter caused by unstackables, because nothing stacks, and everything takes up equal space, accept for those items that are larger and take up multiple slots. There is no way I can really describe the feeling of awe this game instills upon me. Open world and storyline -  while you are free to explore the world, and it is definately encouraged, there also is a storyline to this game. Unknown Worlds has created a fine balance between the player's independence and predetermined actions.Graphics - this game looks the part. The graphics, especially if your PC can handle them maxed out, but even if it can't, are absolutely stunning. No Grind - the most dreaded part of most games is largely absent in Subnautica. The resources are balanced so that resource collecting doesn't feel like grinding, nor is it tiring because of the sheer level of emersion. CONS:Requirements - my sole problem with Subnautica is that it takes quite the computer to play. I have an i5-6200U @2.30 GHz with turbo to 2.80 GHz, 8 GB DDR4 RAM, and an Intel HD520 graphics card. When I play this game my computer starts to impersonate a jet engine, and my FPS is ~30 with lag spikes when I'm in my cyclops sub. The load time is ~1 min, though this has been improved in the short amount of time I've been playing this game.Bugs - of course this game, like every other, has its fair share of bugs. PRAWNS like to fall through the ocean floor (though since the Infected update I haven't been seeing this, so that's potentially fixed). Sometimes when you try to exit your base it spawns you inside it, but in the water. When you load a game saved when you were within a PRAWN or Moth your sub gets launched away from you. Wrecks have this nasty habit of not loading in, a bug I have not found a solution to. It is possible to get into the aurora before crafting a prepulsion cannon, but not to get out of it. So be sure to have your prepulsion cannon *before* you get yourself stuck in there. Just save frequently, and before stuff goes wrong. Sustenance - I've read a few other reviews, and none I read made mention of this, but the hunger and thirst meters seems to deplete just a tiny bit fast for my liking. To give an example, I was in my PRAWN exploring a biome, and just as I reached my destination I heard the dreaded message announcing my water was at 20%. Already. It was about 50% when I went in, and, without me having to sprint or anything, it ran out in about fifteen minutes. That's a very minor thing though, and doesn't really effect gameplay, as getting food is easy. FINAL VERDICT:For 20 bucks, late stage early access, you can't go wrong. If this review doesn't say enough, maybe Subnautica's '92% of reviews positive stat' will convince you. If you're into survival and exploration games this is one of the best.  "

								My first attempt at this game (February '16, survival mode) went like this:Started in the life pod, eventually found out how to keep the player character fed and hydrated, was captivated by the game's incredible visuals and audio. I gathered resources and made some tools (but had to read the wiki and forum posts to get me started), then built a small underwater base just below the surface and a small submersible vehicle. Most survival games make you stare at crafting menus for hours and Subnautica is no exception - But uniquely, you can get to look at a pretty backdrop of your choice while doing so: In my base, I put my crafting station on a window overlooking a nearby coral reef and an unusually-shaped rocky outcrop.Eventually I made friends with a shark-like thing in the nearby kelp forest, then accidentally ran it over in my submersible and felt bad about it afterwards - Until I lost 2 submersibles later to a larger fish while trying to explore the sunken space ship wreck and barely escaped with my life both times, taking the long swim of shame back to my base. Karma in action?With my third submersible I started exploring a cave system when I hadn't yet got any vehicle upgrades (like the visual ""sonar"", which displays a transparent wireframe of the nearby terrain to help you navigate) - I ended up getting very lost, panicked a bit, then eventually died of dehydration before I could find my way out because I didn't pack enough potable water. :P Subnautica is a very immersive and beautiful looking alpha in which you can lose yourself really easily, even in its current late development state (at time of writing) - Buying into early access titles can be risky, but the devs are pretty transparent about their future plans for the game and actively update it, while it already has several hours worth of replayable content. Survive (or go creative mode with invincibility), build bases and vehicles, explore a hand-crafted alien ocean, view awesome sights, avoid hostile flora and fauna. Incredible stuff. :)			"

Early Access Review
								    I've owned this game for two days at the time of this writing and it has nearly consumed my life (19 hours sence I bought it). This game is a borderline horror game at times because of how scary the deep sea is, especially and alien one. The sense of exploration in this game is amazing, the map is huge and you never know whats around the corner. The crafting is similar to minecraft but doesnt feel like a chore. As this is an early access game there are some bugs and texture pop ins here and there but they are minor and to be expected. Something that I think is amazing of the developers and something that I use whenever possible is a button in the pause menu that takes a screen shot of the game and sends it to the developers to show them any bugs or glitches you come across, this needs to be in EVERY early access game. Overall my only issue with the game at the moment is that once yo uget everything settled and you get a feel for things the sea becomes less scary (until a reaper shows up and scares the effing crap out of you).     Pros:   -good exploration   -cool fishes    -cool ship designs   -beatiful graphics   -best water physics ever   -button in menu that lets you show the developers bugs in the game  Cons: -little to no tutorial. (I only knew what to do at the start because I watched so many lets plays of this game) -map kinda feels small once you start exploring more   Ideas for developers: -more gentle giants -more fish, big or otherwise,  -a map -multiplayer - more submarines, theres two in the game and I think one or two more would add more to the game -tameable predators, you can kinda do this with stalkers and I think it would be cool if this were expaned -more to do on landI will update this review every so often as the game is updated and I play it more. But as the game is, I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who enjoys survival games and are looking for a game to get hooked onto.			"

								i see people, asking for co-op, the onlt problem is, in the lore...  it is assumed you are the only survivor of the ship because your escape pod was the only one that jettisoned, in that instance, the player should either be able to (a) build a robot to allow for another player to control or (b) while inside the the ship trying to repair the nuklear reactor, find an intact stasis pod wich can be picked up and moved or towed back to your base and be placed, then, whenever you want to open up your world so others can play with you, just interface with with the stasis pod and bam! another player can join you(tthey come out of the stasis pod).  pretty neat ideas, right? vote em up!  if youd like(i know this is the review page but i dont know where else to post this, the game is just awesome and if you havent grabbed it while its only $20 then, i truly pitty you, have a nice day.).

								Having owned and played this game for over 9 months now, I've been very impressed with the development so far.  The game has been actively developed with periodic updates and lots of new content.  This is one of the better examples of how to do Early Access right.The underwater world of Subnautica is incredible.  Never have I played a game that can at once incredibly calming, awe-inspiring and yet also have moments of sheer terror.  That Subnautica covers so many bases is a testament to its fantastic design.Graphically, the game is gorgeous and with the upcoming H2O update is set to be even more impressive.  Sound design is superb with sounds ranging from the mystical to the weird to the utterly horrifying. Content-wise, there is a lot to explore and the game easily offers 20+ hours of solid gameplay right off the bat.  And this is without taking into consideration all the upcoming content including new creatures, biomes, items and game mechanics.This is easily one of the best Early Access titles and highly recommended.

								This is THE model for early access development. Game allows painless ingame feedback, devs keep Trello up to date, experimental build is updated daily, big updates are monthly. This is what early access is all about. The content changes and feedback process is enough to make you want to replay the game every update. By buying in early access you are getting you money's worth time and again.As to the game, it is beautiful, graphically exceptional. The execution is brilliant and the world feels alive. There is a lot of content already and more to come. The game is not violent, and while I love my hack and slash, its nice to have a game focused on something other than killing. There is danger enough to get your heart racing.My only negative feedback so far, its really easy. I'm waiting for the dev's to add creature attacks on the base and such. Also take the negative with a grain of salt, most things get easy on the tenth replay...			"

								As an experienced player of a lot of survival and sandbox games, I would rate this game 7 out of 10, but as devoted the DEVs are, I think it can be rated much higher some months later.+Very beautiful underwater scenes, creatively.+Interesting background+Smooth looking and beautiful graphics, feels a little bit like Portal 2, clean and high-tech.+Weird looking but cute small edible fishes, charming.+Underwater sound effect makes you feel really underwater.+Makes the best diving out of all the survivals sandbox games, makes the best survival sandbox game out of all diving games.+The feeling of diving is just simply charming. You explore with both curious and fear, in the very dark deep corners of the ocean, then come back to the inviting, bright beautiful surface with valuable loots.-Time-wasting crafting system-Nonrenewable everything----  not anything in this game is renewable. Fishes won't respawn or repopulate if you consume all fish in one area. Same mining method becomes annoying in late game, the world will eventually run out of survival materials.[Edit: forgot to say, this is definitely just a DEV-state. I'm pretty sure it will change very soon.]-High-chance of a serious glitch: submarine floats in the air and you can't get it down anyway.-Limited/unfinished exploration.Subnautica is a game of very high potential, and has high devotion of the DEV team. But if you are intolerant of unfinished food, habitant, material features, don't make the purchase yet.			"

								Subnautica is one of the best survival games out at the moment, and extremely good for an early access game.Pros:+ Massive open world with many biomes to explore, each including many unique alien plants and animals, all of which you can interact with, observe, and many times, swim rapidly away from.+ Simple crafting system that unlocks new recipes when you find new materials and scan fragments of technology that are spread across the ocean.+ Great base-building system, which includes a variety of special rooms with unique purposes, alien containments, power systems, and more.+ A subtle but good story that is hidden in different abandoned bases left by other survivors who previously inhabited the alien ocean world and various shipwrecks that broke off of your spaceship when it crashed on the planet.+ Dozens of hours of content++ Subnautica has very few bugs for an early access game.+ The developers constantly are adding new content such as biomes, different technologies, items, base accessories, and bug-fixes.Cons:-No autosave system, so be careful to save constantly or you may lose a lot of progress-Occasional bugs and crashes, but nowhere near as many as other early access games.-The short render distance occasionally gets annoying when exploring large areas.Overall: Subnautica is a great game that I highly suggest, and I have defintely gotten more than $20 worth of content out of this, and there is still much more for me to do after 50 hours. Also, the developers are constantly adding new content, so this game will just continue to get better! "

What this game is aboutThis game is a survival game at an aquatic environment, rather than survival on land. Like all survival games, the primary need is to fulfill the need of your body, which is food and water. As most of the game will be done underwater, there is a third resource : oxygen. Starting with a small life-pod, eventually you could build up small submarines, submarines with docking bay, and eventually big underwater bases with docking bays, observatories, and much more. The game is about exploring undersea wonders on some alien planet. You could eat small fishes, like we do, but there are dangers at the sea, from the stalkers that could chase you down to the mighty Sea Emperor that could destroy or heavily damage your submarine. This game brings lots of beautiful visuals, from the sun-drenched Safe Shallows, to the dark Mushroom Forest, to the Kelp Forest with tall kelp trees, all biomes are well-made, and well differentiated with each other.The fauna of the game is also astounding, there are Reefbacks that are akin to whales on Earth, to Stalkers that are akin to sharks, and many more. Every life form is interacting with each other, so expect the stalkers (sharks) eat fishes now and then. The fauna is astounding, especially the feeling when you met a Reefback for the first time.What is great about this gameFlora and FaunaAs mentioned above, the flora and fauna of this game is great. Every biome has their own life form, every life form has their own habitat. This creates a feel of biodiversity, and creates a living sea that you could explore and exploit, if you will. Building SeabasesI am a huge fan about building a ""player base"" game. The UI to build the game is really good, it's easy to snap build your seabase. You would also be informed on how strong your bases are. What is great is that building bases at huge depth will be harder, as you will need more reinforcement materials, where bases on shallow seas will allow you more windows and glass corridors for you to gaze outwards. FloodingI am a huge fan also of this feature. Upon taking damage, your submarine, or your base, could be flooded with seawater. The flooding system is quite realistic, as the compartments at the bottom will be flooded first, then the upper comparments. You could install bulkhead doors to stem the flooding, but to truly stop the flooding you must weld the hull breaches. At some depths the pressure is too severe that your ship could not be fixed at all. What could be improved in the game?Resources should be more balancedAs I know, rare resources like quartz are not respawnable, this could create frustations. Fishes should also be numerous, and if able should be tied to how the player exploit the type of fishes. If the player over-fishes, they should be penalized with the lack of fish, but if the player conserves the fish, they should be rewarded.More contentOf course, we need more content. The seabases now, while good looking, still lacks components. We have one decorative elements : the aquarium, and one furniture element : the bench. These should be expanded, for example to include beds, laboratory equipments, desk, chair, and many more. BugsThere are still bugs around, most notably is that if you put your seabase on the waterline, it would look that your base is flooded (although it is not). And also some random falling down from seabase if you install glass windows.Verdict?A great game that should be bought.			"

Early Access Review
 Subnautica  is an open world underwater adventure, in which players must craft equipment and submarines in order to explore the oceanic depths of an alien world, fending off horrible fish-monsters with intimidating teeth and fighting mechanisms in the process. The game has a vast environment containing biomes such as underwater forests, lava, enormous mushrooms, and even islands. Moreover,  Subnautica  consists of submersibles, such as the well-known Cyclops, and several other craftable materials, tools, and machines that enhance the player's gameplay. Not to mention, the fact that the game is enriched with diverse creatures, makes the player feel as if they were at the bottom of Mariana's trench, or just a marine biologist's wet dream if you will. As a matter of fact, the deeper you go the more creepy it gets. In the depths of this incongruous ocean, only hearing your own breath, makes the player experience the sheer terror of being deep in an exotic ocean first-hand. Thus, in all honesty, I pronounce this game one of the most immersive games I have ever played on Steam. That said, I would give thanks to Unknown Worlds anytime for developing this game. Pros --Spectacular graphics--Wonderful, diverse environments--Extraordinary diversity and creativity in regards to the creatures--Great audio--Simple crafting system--Smooth controls--The developers, in my opinion, are promising Cons --Items in your inventory do not stack--Thirst and hunger decrease rather quickly--No multiplayer ;(--Not enough customization for bases--There are still many bugs that may get on one's nerves**The game gets very lonely; however, for someone like me, I would not really mind.All in all,  Subnautica  has true potential. Unlike games such as The Forest,  Stranded Deep, or  Minecraft, you survive  underwater. Furthermore, from what I have gathered from my gameplay,  Subnautica  is astonishing in Early Access, and I can not wait to see how it will develop henceforth into being a much greater experience for it's players.

								This is an Early Access Review.  After the game is finished and released, I'll rewrite this review.I've always been a huge fan of survival sandbox games.  Just because I might like this game, doesn't mean you will.  If you like survival sandbox games, I believe you might enjoy this one.Pros The game is beautiful It runs pretty good on my system. On ""Recommended"" I get about 160fps and on ""Max"" I get about 40-50fps.  The game is beautiful on both settings. (My Specs) It's a pretty solid game.  I've run into very few bugs and I use ""Experimental"" on my update settings They seem to be pretty good about keeping it updated and adding new things all the time If you do experimental on your update settings you can get most of the updates pretty early, before others There's a decent amount to do in the game and it keeps getting better A huge ocean to explore. With the right gear and sub you can go pretty deep. Undersea BASES! How can you go wrong? Offers a ton of items to craft as well as mini and large subs It's a unique idea for a survival game. You're not running around killing zombies. You can now explore the ship you crashed in the ocean. All kinds of fish and I think they keep adding more, I keep finding more that I haven't seen before.Cons The game would be amazing with some sort of mulitplayer.  Doesn't have to be a ton of players, even co-op would make the game so much better.   Doesn't seem to be many threats, at least not at first.  You have a large fish that attacks you, but he really doesn't do much damage.  At night things get a little better, but even then it's not that exciting. I've had a few graphical errors. Nothing major, just a little annoying at times. Wouldn't mind having the graphic settings in game.  To change your settings, you need to exit the game, change them and reload the game.  Though in time they may offer that. I've seen other early access games start off the same way just to offer in game settings later. Wouldn't hurt to have a bit more of a story to it. Would love to see some sort of objectives. A reason why you might have been in the area where you crashed.  Are you looking for something?  Looking to find a home? I don't mind scavenging and building, but that gets old after time. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game.  If you love survival sandbox games, this is one to try out.  If you're just looking for a nice, solid game for a decent price that offers a ton of replayability, here you go. "

Early Access Review
								Subnautica, an early access, underwater, survival-exploration game is a game that can be described in many ways. Simply put, however, the game has INFINITE potential. Many would describe this game as underwater Minecraft, but there is much more to it than that from a design standpoint. Upon entering the game, the first noticeable thing within the game is the incredible design. When entering the ocean, your senses are bombarded with bright colors and haunting sound design. The ocean itself is a vast environment with multiple biomes to be explored. The depth, (pun intended) of the game is great, allowing you to learn about the formation of certain materials, through the gathering mechanics. From sand to gold, and emery to the not yet implemented Unobtanium, picking up the materials needed to craft the next structure is a treat in itself. One thing that is truly beautiful about the game is the suspenseful sound design. Though the soundtrack itself could be described as bland, subjectively, the atmosphere that the oceanic noises provide is incredible, to say the least. Working in tandem with the said sound design is the overall LOOK of the game. Set in an alien ocean, vibrant colors can be seen left and right. A perfect example of the beautiful atmosphere the look of the game sets is the incredible sunset that occurs at the end of every day cycle. Though the game itself is already a treat to play as it is, there is a lot of room for improvement. The game is quite obviously still in Early Access, as many of the core mechanics of the game have not yet been implemented. Visual glitches are aplenty as well as much to be wanted in terms of content. With all this in mind, Subnautica is definitely a game to look out for in the coming months of its development.			"

Early Access Review
About the game...Subnautica is a beautiful survival game set underwater on a mysterious planet.  The game is based around exploration and creation (you will need to feed yourself and craft things to aid your survival).  Being at heart a game of survival, it's survival of the fittest as always - and guess what?  You aren't the fittest...During a mission to colonise systems in space, your ship crashes.  In-game space ships just aren't what they used to be, so it should be no surprise to find yourself bobbing about in a tiny escape pod with absolutely nothing other than a wetsuit and a gadget embedded into the pod called a 'fabricator'.  As you have nothing to fabricate (other than lies to excuse your expensive spaceship crash), it's time to leave the escape pod and explore the great underwater world below you...I should just mention that this underwater world is NOT Earth.  There is nothing down here that has ever been televised by National Geographic, and so it is down to you to discover what's safe and what's not.  You'll be clueless about what to do, but that's part of the fun of the game: figure it all out - just as you'd have to if this were real (no 'Tour Guide' in the escape pod to help you out either).  There are curious, dopey looking, one-eyed fish just chirruping away (yes, really - begging to be caught just for doing that), there are happy purple mushrooms you can pick, and then bobbing happily towards you is a larger stripey creature, both funny and cute-looking with a snout like a cheerful sea-horse.  It's underwater Skyrim, you think to yourself as you smile, ready to pet this delightful creature with open arms, but you realise as you start to be sliced into little bits of tuna that this is no friendly pet after all.   It might be cute but it has more teeth than you, sharper teeth than you, and a razorblade tail too (I trust you don't have one of those either).   No, it's not all nice in Subnautica - not when you go deeper into the game (pun totally intended.This must be the strangest 'survival' ever because (before you become dinner or drown) it feels almost zen-like!  Trying to survive is never supposed to be zen-like but the game cleverly lulls you into a fuzzy warm blanket of security before it bites you - and remains zen-like until you get bitten again.  It's unique with this quality.  If you DO have the misfortune and inconvenience of dying (and you will), you will become conscious again, gasping for breath in the escape pod as you read the sorry one-line tale that you died and so lost some of the stuff you'd foraged for - yes, including that precious bit of copper you know you will never find again...  But it's not frustrating and there is no starting over.  You will simply have lost some of what you were carrying at the time. As far as difficulty goes, the developers have added both an extreme perma-death option (you won't revive if killed) and the opposite pure sandbox experience which offers the freedom to build without worrying about hunger, thirst, limited resources etc.  Personally, I prefer the moderate 'survival' option where food and thirst matter, but if I die I just reappear in my rescue pod or base and can continue from where I left off.  Every gamer has been catered for.About the world of SubnauticaThe underwater world of Subnautica isn't procedurally generated and I'm actually glad of this because it is obvious that the developers have taken great care in hand-crafting every last detail of this world with a purpose in mind for each cave and crevace.  It also means that the developers could in theory add new worlds as DLC (and I hope they do).  Different areas of Subnautica offer different life-forms, and the area is pretty large to explore so it certainly hasn't become too familiar yet (I've played for over 200 hours now and there are endless places I haven't even been able to reach).  For each new game you will spawn in some random spot on the map so the location of resources will vary and the game will always feel different.  You'll need to fabricate tools both to survive and to explore further by finding metals and other resources on the sea bed, and craft equipment that will allow you to explore further and build.  This underwater world consists of several biomes of different flora and fauna.  Deeper, darker waters hold more menace, and the more vicious predators are unleashed in darkness, stepping up the survival element and the risk of exploring an unknown area.Build-a-BaseSubnautica has an exceptional base-building feature.  You can build anywhere - a useful touch to set up oxygen and nourishment quarters in deep dark waters far from your original base.  The building tools are so easy to use, with pieces snapping into place naturally.  Having a base or two not only gives you much-needed recovery platforms, but also enables you to build as much storage as you like, keep aquariums full of fish for when hunger needs to be attended to, and build equipment to manufacture more building and equipment pieces.  You can also develop two submarine types depending on the resources and blueprints you uncover - and these enable you to explore much further than you can by swimming.  With the simple combination of a Sea Moth submersible and a pile of resources, I'm currently building a base deep below the crashed Aurora so that I can explore the site at leisure and have somewhere to return to when oxygen, food or hydration levels are low.  It's a superb addition to the beta, the building pieces are gorgeous (check out the store-page screenshots for an idea of how good they look) and they have added much longevity to the game because it is now possible to reach deeper, more far-flung areas of the ocean.Farming FrenzyOne of the latest updates offers players a way to be self-sustaining without depleting the sea of all plant and animal life!  You are now able to breed fish, hatch unknown eggs that you might find, and grow food-generating plants indoors and out.  It's all very easy and intuitive.About the Early Access state...This is no half-baked development.  The screenshots are enough to show just how beautiful the game is already, and they really don't even do the game justice.  It's easily the best diving game on Steam right now (sorry other-diving-games - you might be good too, but not Subnautica-good).  The standard version is very stable but you also have the choice to opt into the 'experimental' version which is the daily updated beta that the developers upload pretty much every day.  The experimental version will always be less stable than the fixed beta releases, but they show just how much the developers are adding to the game.  It's fun to be a part of Subnautica's evolvement, and there are now hours and hours and hours of gameplay compared to when I wrote this review originally over a year ago.  Thedevelopers treat problems as absolute priorities and work with the community - they truly represent what Early Access is all about.  They will even let you vote for new features using Trello to prioritise which things get done first.   In short, you won't be wasting your money on this particular EA project.  In summary...If you like the idea of exploring a strange, alien underwater world, enjoying the freedom to build a base and figuring how to survive without starving or being lunch for some strange one-eyed creature or something, then the game is already something to look at (you can even opt out of the survival element and just explore freely instead).  There is something absolutely compelling about the game: raw survival, yet therapeutic exploration coupled with the achievement of finding and crafting something new.  I highly recommend this already-epic game into which I've now sunk (yeah, see what I did there?) in excess of 200 hours!_______________tl;dr: just buy it - now.			"

								Subnautica is a survival ''horror'' (almost there),which has a really good environment and an amazing background story! Exploring is the only way to understand all what is happening.Once you start your game,you almost don't want to stop.    Pros:   + Music represents the feeling of loneliness   + Diversity of Environments  + Diversity of Living Creatures  + Background Story  + Construction system and diversity of little things to put in your base  + Blueprints system  + Creative inventory interface  + Devlopers pay attention at they community   Cons:  - Optmization and Framerate (10-60)  - Lot of bugs                      Ps: This is an early access game,some things can change, and possibly will!

								Probably one of the best Early Access games available on steam, if not the best example of what an Early Access game should be. Development is completely transparent and it's easy to see what is currently being worked on, what is planned and what has already been achieved. The roadmap set up in this game is the kind of roadmap most larger game companies dream of achieving.The game itself has a unique setting, great features and some strong ideas behind good implementations. It draws you in, makes you want to explore. And exploring is very rewarding, but very dangerous as well. You quickly realize that the game isn't as light and happy as one thinks when you start off in the Reefs.I absolutely recommend this for anyone.			"

Early Access Review
								Subnautica is one of those Early Access games that has me on the fence.On the one hand, it does a lot of things well. For example, the game's visuals are nice, and the different areas of the sea are all aesthetically appealing. There's a good deal of conveyance towards which areas are relatively harmless and which areas have giant sea-monsters that will rip you in half. In addition, I can't imagine how things would appear for the VR users, and personally I don't want to find out - the Reaper Leviathan nipped that urge in the bud. Still, the option to play the game in VR, in tandem with the already pleasant atmosphere, leaves the game with a strong recommendation from me for the visuals alone. In terms of gameplay, the game performs similarly to games like Rust or ARK, and although the crafting/upgrades system is nothing groundbreaking, it is still enjoyable and rewarding. There are certain unique aspects to the game, many of which I feel are too minuscule to even bother bringing up; however, the game does things differently enough that I feel comfortable saying that it has a personality of its own.On the other hand, the game is in Early Access, which means that not only is it not complete, but it is still relatively unpolished. Although the game has undergone extensive changes and would appear to be updated frequently, I can't say that I've never been burned by the game due to some glitch or another. For the patient (you saints), the game's glitches and bugs are relatively harmless, and they border more on the taxing side of frustration rather than fully-fledged rage. Still, the point remains that the game could be another Early Access flop, but I'm fairly confident that it won't be. Hopefully, these issues can be ironed out, and I do believe the devs will continue to work on this project.As it stands, Subnautica gets a mostly confident vote of approval from me, and I would recommend buying the game if it interests you (especially if it's on sale).

DRINK. EAT. FIND SHELTER. DON’T LET THAT MONSTER EAT YOUR FACE.Warnings, everywhere, reminding you that you are only ever moments away from some terrible end. It’s all bloody exhausting. Subnautica seems to buck this trend.These systems, hunger, thirst, they exist in Subnautica, but they take a backseat to exploration of the stunning underwater world. And they’re optional, too. There’s a freedom mode as well as a hardcore survival one, which focuses entirely on all the lovely stuff, like building fancy submarines and meeting new fishy friends.			"

Early Access Review
								As a person who has a severe case of thalassophobia (fear of the sea)...I LOVE THIS. It's both horrifying and and awesome at the same time. At first I was too scared to even leave my lifepod, but as I continued playing, I've finally gotten to the point I can actually face predators face to face (even though I might poop my pants a little!). For an Early Access game, I consider this totally worth (my) time.However, as an Early Access game, it's expected to have some bugs and glitches. I myself have never encountered any game breaking ones, but for some they have been a reality for some time now. I can't say anything about VR support since I play with with a regular desktop setup. Luckily, the devs are still very actively working on this game and have not abandoned it, like it sometimes happens with EA games.I've played Subnautica in Experimental mode, as an important side note. It's more dynamic than Stable mode, and gets updated and changed more often. However bugs are encountered more often, naturally. Something has probably changed the time I post this review.Overall, I've enjoyed this a lot. The ocean and its vast wildlife are simply beautiful, even though some of the predators are absolutely terrifying and too aggressive for my taste, especially when there are no weapons available aside the Stasis rifle. But, you can adjust the difficulty of the game (by cheating also if you're into a more peaceful experience). Whether the devs will remove the cheating option in the future, I don't know. The story itself is fascinating and it's been interesting to see it come to life even more with each update.And last but not least: don't fear the Reaper!...... I'm kidding, swim for your life.			"

Early Access Review
								NOTE: Subnautica is an EA game, what does that mean? alot of things will change since this review is posted.Subnautica is a beautiful game. The settings places you in skin of a survivor from the Aurora vessel, which under mysterious circumstances has crashlanded on the ocean world.What do i do in this game?In Subnautica, your first steps are basically surviving by gathering food and water (if you have selected survival that is) before moving on to discover what exactly happened. For those who dislike the need to keep your food and water meters full like in other survival games, there is a mode which disables those, allowing you to concentrate on gathering gear to eventually move and explore the world around you!  Features:Base Building: As you progress through the game, building a base is pretty much necessary. you have a selection of rooms to create your own little safe haven. Bases require energy and can be decorated with plants and aquariums in which you can store and breed native fauna.Detailed World to explore: Subnautica offers quite alot to explore, from relatively safe Kelp forests to deep caverns full of giant glowing mushrooms and equally giant snake-like creatures living with it. Vehicles: as of now, Subnautica offers you 3 Vehicles to use in your adventures:Seamoth: a small, agile sub which can be outfitted with various upgrades, from sonar to vortex torpedoesCyclops: A large, bulky and slow submarine which can house Seamoth inside it. while it doesnt have much in terms of upgrades, this beast can serve as your mobile home.P.R.A.W.N Suit: Otherwise called Exosuit is literally what it is. An Exosuit for you to use! it features upgrades allowing you to harvest large mining nodes, grapple along the caves, throw fish around with propulsion hand and is in general quite fun. A note though, exosuit has 2 hands only, meaning you have to select carefully which configuration you want to use, noone is stopping you from carrying different arms with you though!An Encyclopedia: Curious about that particular fish? craft a scanner and soon youll be able to read about it in your PDA! almost every fish so far has a description for it, same goes for plantlife and even some objects like Limestones.Flora and Fauna: Subnautica features quite a biodiversity, curious and sometimes dangerous fauna, various plantlife to harvest. Best part about all this? you can actually keep almost all of them in your base as pets! Big creatures such as Boneshark or even Crabsnake have eggs you can take and hatch in your base, they are harmless until you release them in the wilds. Note: giant creatures do not have eggs (yet..)Lack of ""Lethal"" weaponry: this might be a turndown for many people, but subnautica doesnt have lethal weapons. you have a  knife, but its terrible at killing creatures. Instead, you have tools such as:Stasis rifle: freeze that pesky stalker trying to steal your metal (or your face) Propulstion and Repulsion canons: Helloo gravity gun! Propulsion canon is almost exactly like Gravity gun from half-life while propulsion canon is used for blasting things away from you.Technology: As you progress, youll be able to craft more things to use, ranging from simple things like flippers up to stuff like Transfuser, letting you extract and use creature DNA as you please (currently in development~)Open Developers: Afraid subnautica will suddenly stop being made once you buy it? wish to follow their progress? dont worry! Developers share their progress through Trello, posting their developer things for everyone to see, they also have forums and changelog, links provided belowhttps://trello.com/b/yxoJrFgP/subnauticahttps://trello.com/b/KbugnSRJ/subnautica-roadmaphttp://forums.unknownworlds.com/categories/subnauticahttp://subnautica.unknownworlds.com/#/subnautica/checkinsand for those who wish to see the game models, herehttps://sketchfab.com/fox3d/models "

								Being a software developer myself, as a rule I avoid ""Early Access"" games like the plague. But between growing up on shows like “seaQuest DSV” and being a PADI certified open-water diver, I couldn't help but try this game while it was on the Steam Summer Sale.I was incredibly surprised and amazed at how good this game is already! Yes, it is still in a ""beta"" status, but the art is amazing, and the gameplay is intuitive and mostly bug free.I have about 11 hours into this game. I eventually used the NOCOST and OXYGEN cheats so I could build a base using the building system and it is fairly easy to learn.Between the great art, ease of play, and feedback system that makes it easy to file bug reports, I would recommend this game to anyone, regardless of its development status. With a little more work this will be an award winning game in the coming years. Mark my words!			"

								First off, I have a huge fear of the ocean. I wanted to get this game to potentially lessen my fear. In some aspects it did, however, in some aspecs, it made it worse. This game helped me be more calm around fish and stuff. However, it made my fear of vast, empry oceans worse. The terrifying unknown depths in Subnautica are the most scary part of the game for me. Not knowing what is below you is truly nightmarish.Onto the game itself; it is fun. It is an exploring survival game. It is a game that you can craft numerous things to help survive. I don't want to make this review very long, because not much is actually in the game right now other than exploration and basic survival. It is gorgeous, it is addicting, it is terrifying. Buy it.

Early Access Review
								I did my best to stay away from wiki's and tutorial videos before playing this for the first time just under a week ago.  I eventually capitulated around 10 hours in when I was really struggling to figure out how to get a Moonpool.  Turns out, I needed to find an appropriate tech fragment and, after that, problem solved.  Since then I've looked up about a half dozen things but tried to largely keep my experiences of the game to be drawn directly from the game.  Here's my take:The game is excellent, at least for the first few hours, at leaving you wondering what everything is and what it does while still allowing you freedom to poke and prod at your immediate environment without dying.  Sure, the first dangerous critters are pretty obviously dangerous from afar and make a distinct roar before charging you, and aren't death-or-glory killbots so you can run away or scare them off.  This makes for an environment you can experiment with, even in Survival mode where you need to manage food and water as well as health and oxygen.The ocean looks and feels great.  Motion washes in a way that feels pretty good, like you're in water (which, of course, you are).  Basic resources aren't too hard to come by.  Indeed, the biggest early restriction is oxygen, but you don't dive too deep for too long at the start and can always just come straight back to the surface.There's a marker to show the direction to your escape pod on your HUD when you're roughly facing the right direction (and haven't gone a very long way from it).  Makes it possible to get home even when you're still trying to figure out what to eat and what might kill you.Radiation, from the crashed ship I believe, keeps you boxed in on one side and away from some really nasty predators that would literally eat you in one.  You'll deal with that later.  For the start, the radiation hurts and provides a soft ""wall"" to encourage you back to places more suitable for your (lack of) experience.As you find more things, your fabricator -- the device on the escape pod you use to convert resources into useful equipment, cooked food, etc -- gives you more options.  This is good in that you don't start swamped with options, a bunch of which aren't useful to you yet, but it's also unhelpful in a game otherwise lacking a tutorial (at this stage).  Means that you might know something exists (for example, the Moonpool) but not see the option to build it anywhere.  That's fine in that one of this game's strengths is exploration and discovery, but also confusing.  Perhaps an option to show unavailable construction options might help?  In any case, while the game is Early Access, the wiki and an occasional youtube video should get you through the rough spots where you're missing the prerequisite item that reveals the appropriate construction option.I deliberately waited a long while to make sure that this game was both receiving regular updates and was in a stable, playable state.  I'm pleased to report that the game seems very stable after 20+ hours of play.  There's a few performance drops now and then, though rarely for more than a couple of seconds, even on a very high power computer (i7, 2x 970's, 16GB RAM, SSD), and I notice some report more regular performance issues but I've not really seen them.  Optimisation is usually a late stage process in development so I'm not worried.  Thus far, no crashes or serious glitches whatsoever for me.The ocean is surprisingly large and your ability to explore is somewhat capped by what equipment you've built so far.  I find you have to push to the edges of your exploration capability to find the new resources you need to make getting there easier in future.  Often you're looking for a new tech fragment, or a resource that only appears in a particular area, or below a particular depth.  But by shifting areas or depths you come across more dangerous environments, not least of which is that you need somewhere to retreat to in order to refill your oxygen (and empty your inventory of resources you've collected).  By inference, I believe I've seen less than half of what there is to see, perhaps only a third, though admittedly I'm cautious so I tend to take fewer risks than I could.  My deepest dive has been around 550 metres, with my deepest base at around 450 metres.  I believe one can get a lot deeper than that...So, to sum up, or tl;dr ...An excellent underwater exploration game that manages to be somewhat gentle in the beginning, while offering more for more risk (or just more guts, I guess).  Stable, looks good, still a few bugs here and there (easily reported from within the game), but very playable and worth your time to investigate.  Developer is active and open.  I eagerly look forward to future updates.  Think I'll be back to playing next, actually... :)			"

Early Access Review
								Once, I would've been quick to recommend this game.  Unfortunately, things have changed.Over the span of the last few updates, it's become increasingly clear that the devs are catering to a vocal minority of hardcore veterans.  What used to be an amazing exploration/survival game has turned into a giant FPS where everything attacks you on sight for no reason whatsoever and you don't even have the means to really fight back.It was stated early-on that the game wasn't going to have lethal weapons, and that suited me just fine.  They have a stasis rifle that can freeze a thing and buy you a little time -- things like that.  That was great -- until they started increasing both the aggression of all the predatory creatures and the quantities of said predators.Then they decided to make things like battery drain horrendous so you can barely get anywhere before you have to change batteries/power cells (you did bring extra, right?), place all the schematics in locations that are effectively gated by the need to have those particular schematics (upgrade the SeaMoth to dive below 300m?  Guaranteed it's somewhere below the 300m mark -- that sort of thing).It's just become an exercise in frustration and tedium.  And that's really sad, because it's got a lot of great elements and initially was looking like it would be one of my favorites.Now, I feel that it's being catered to a group of veteran players who already know what's out there, how to overcome each kind of obstacle, and who still want things to be harder.  This means a new player coming into the game and wanting to actually explore, learn and find things on his/her own is left in a world of hurt.  The only way to play this game now is to read everything first on the Wiki and go directly for those items you need -- forget exploration and discovery.			"

								I HATE THE OCEAN!!! IT CAN GO F*** ITSELF ALONG WITH ALL THE FUGLY NASTY THINGS LIVING IN IT!!*ehem*So it speaks volumes that the game is already so good that instead of turning me away from it my dislike of the ocean just adds a layer of survival horror to it for me.The crafting system is really good (please never change the Fabricator's printing sound effect) and surprisingly flexible. Exploration is fun, meaningful and often scary, but so far the game has a way of pushing me to explore further and deeper to get all those precious materials needed to craft and even just to survive.Also, I may hate the ocean, but I can't deny how good it can look at times. And while the game still has optimization issues (like popping and the such) in it's current build just swiming around can look flat out beautiful.And let's not forget how good the vehicles feel already. From your initial Seaglide to the Cyclops all 3 vehicles currently available feel really good to use (the first time you enter your newly built Cyclops is so good) and will only motivate you to explore even further.Do I recommend it even though it's early access? Of course, even in it's current state it's well worth the price tag. And if the devs keep going the right way this game will be huge eventually. Also, if you are interested in VR the game is a prime candidate for that sort of upgrade down the road.			"

								This game is pretty amazing, and pretty. Definitely worth the $19.99 even if it is an early-access.  However, I am not going to lie, the game changed for me around the 4 hour mark. It was around that time I got the Cyclops and adventured off into the blue unknown. I suddenly did not want to leave my submarine! All of the sudden the big blue empty began to make me feel uneasy for my poor guy. I began to dread leaving the safety of my Cyclops or my Seamoth. This really added a new dimension to the game. Originally I was afraid that this game would be like Minecraft, build things until you get tired of it, but Subnautica really focuses on the exploring aspect which sets it apart from all of the other games where you simply build stuff. 10/10 Recommended.

A very satisfying sense of progression via exploration. Extremely cool base building, plus a huge submarine that can function as a mobile base. Some really amazing secret areas. Made by a small indie developer, yet better than most AAA games I've played. Very little grind: The bottleneck is usually blueprints, not resources.Cons: Sometimes it's not clear where to look for the next blueprint. It's not finished yet, so there's no way to win the game.

								So, this game, for me, is somewhat unique.This was one of the first survival/exploration type games that I have owned (unless you include Minecraft, but that doesn't really count.) and, despite the low amount of hours, I have found it quite an enjoyable game. It is incredibly polished for a game in early access, the graphics are great, and the atmosphere is a solid 10/10. You get a real sense of scale, some monsters that may be implemented would be 10, 20 times your size. And the audio in this game. Just wow.If you want to experience this game fully, you definitely would have to have a good pair of headphones, as there is alot to hear, from the roaring of the Reaper Leviathan, (It's scary as it sounds!) to the quiet ping of the Cyclops as you explore the depths of this alien planet.This game can get pretty spooky, as it gets very dark at night, and basically everything is out to kill you. There is even a fish that will swim towards you and explode. Sometimes, it can get prety tense having to swim up from the floor some 60 metres down to the surface with a limited supply of oxygen, though you can craft al osrts of things to assist you in your diving. The map, though, is not randomly generated, but is made by the devs as they produce the game, and the map is large enough so that you feel you are in quite a large ocean planet. To sum upp, Subnautica is a great game, though at the current point in time, is somewhat lacking in content, and I dont feel a reason to come back to it when I leave to go do something else. One thing that would make the game far better as well would be a multiplayer, co-op gamemode so that friends can join you and you can stuff around and do all sorts of things together.Grahpics 8/10Audio 10/10Gameplay 7/10Thank you for reading my review.

Man vs OceanThe best underwater survival open world game! Pros:Explore many different environments (some above the water), each with their own plants und fishesBuild your own base underwater, connect it with power (Solar panels or generators) and create a underwater garden :))2 different Submarines you can build. The bigger one can be used as a base!Plentiful ressources, so most of the time you search for the next tech blueprint instead of grinding materials :DVR support! Can't say much about this, as i dont own vr googles but the regular version of subnautica is astounding allready Cons:If you are not familiar with the map and where the biomes are located, you will spend some time wandering and swiming around and might even get a bit lost  As far as i know no way to end / win the game yet			"

I mean what's a game without difficulty?GraphicsFor ALL you sophisticated people out there who think graphics is everything, this game is amazing even on low, still don't like it? try recommended, have the computer for it and don't like recommended? they have experimental for that! I'm not one to judge graphics but truly this game is beautiful on all of the settings and doesn't kill my computer, i get a steady 73.2 fps everytime i play and i have a windows 10 computer with a gtx 745 ti graphics card, that says a lot now, doesn't it?

								This game takes you to another world and this world becomes your world.  You are amazed at its beauty and at the same time it is dangerous.  Danger is in places you would not expect and then you also will find creatures and places that are tranquil.  The scale of the game and feeling small in a big world impresses me.  When I start to think I've ran out of things to do, I find there is yet another layer to the game.  If you are interested in science fiction, this is a must play.  It is a survival/adventure game and the nice part is the survival aspect of the game can be dialed up or down depending on how you'd like to play the game.  It's one of the best games I've played and it's not even finished yet.			"

								I am simply blown away, this thing is hands down the best ""early access"" game I've yet to play, in fact, it's more polished and more visually gorgeous than a bunch of ""fully released"" games. If the developers keep going down the road they are on, expanding the crafting, items to find/use, modules/base items/etc, this thing is going to be one of those time-warp games where you start playing at 1:00pm and look up 5 minutes later and realize it's tomorrow.The crafting is very straightforward, I've yet to encounter any bugs aside from some text missing from a few obscure items (gas_pod I'm looking at you). Sure the item list isnt 200 pages long, but the ones that ARE in, including some vehicles are very neat and if what is here is any indication of what's to come this thing will be spectacular.Even at this early stage, there are several ""modes"" to suit your mood (full on survival with hunger/thirst/etc, no hunger/thirst, etc). I own and have played a bunch of this kind of open exploration/craft/survival game and this is hands down already my favorite, even after playing hundreds of hours in many other games. After this, they all look so stiff, and are all basically a zombie clone. Also, this is one of the few games, and the ONLY early access game I've ever gifted to someone else and thats after playing it for just 2 hours. If you are listening Devs;  You guys are on the right track, keep this up and you will have a truly stellar hit with this thing.  "

Early Access Review
								Get this game.I've never seen the ""find stuff and craft it into other stuff to keep the world from eating you"" formula done so well. It almost seems unfair to put it in that category, because even if that is what it boils down to, it's so much more fun than all of those games.If you remember when Minecraft first came out and people were just blown away by all that you could do, that's this game all over. As I write this review the only thing even close to an objective besides ""survive"" is to seal up the holes on the crashed spaceship to stop it from leaking radiation.So you're thrown into an unfamiliar environment with lots of hostile wildlife, sounds familiar, doesn't it? Except every creature is imaginative and beautiful to watch (when it's not bearing down on you) and share only vague similarities with actual wildlife. The environment feels like an alien world, as beautiful as it is harsh, and everything that isn't sand can be melted down into something useful to you. Collecting things is generally easy, except when it comes to rarer metals, but with proper planning you can stock up on everything you need or want.The most satisfying aspect is what you can do with all those materials. Build a gravity gun, a knife that cooks fish when you cut them with it, a time stasis gun and an electric razor that builds YOUR UNDERWATER BASE. In said base you can dock your minisub to recharge it, store all your crafting mats, build an aquarium or five (which you are free to use as fresh food without getting into trouble). Careful you don't overextend your base, since the pressure can crack the hull and flood sections. Of course you can always lock those sections off with bulkheads until you can fix them. Or you can take your minisub and dock it inside your MEGASUB, in which you can build all the same storage and crafting systems to make a mobile base of operations as you search for new areas to find new materials in.By far the best positive of this game though is how much the devs are working on it. In the few months I've owned it it's updated several times. Most early access games update every now and then, and those updates slowly add in new content and bugfixes.Not Subnautica. Subnautica updates fairly regularly and each time it's a game changer. A new device, a new biome or a new building available. When I started playing this, you couldn't board the crashed space ship, you couldn't dock your sub with your base, there were no bulkheads, no gravity guns, no upgrades for your equipment and only the very basic elements of a base. Everytime this game updates its reason to celebrate and heralds a new set of stuff to try and build. I almost dread the idea of there ever being a full release, since that would mean slower updates and less to look forward to. At the moment this is the game that keeps on giving and those of you who haven't played yet have got several hours of discovery ahead of you already.The devs have expressed a desire to not focus on weaponry in this game, instead going for a peaceful coexistence with the planet as opposed to aggression against it's inhabitants. Yet they expect you to catch smaller fish to survive and most things that you can't eat are hostile to you. This is honestly the only thing I find disagreeable about the game's direction so far. Preserving wildlife is one thing, but if said wildlife is bearing down on you with extremely large teeth and intent to make a meal of you, I think using deadly force is justified. The knife and gravity gun are your only real offensive options (though I've heard of people ramming fish with their sub and simply patching up the hull afterwards). Propelling an angry fish a few hundred feet away is funny, but it doesn't really help when that fish swims back into the area you're searching for valuable materials and takes a chunk out of your backside while youre not looking.Hopefully they include a bit more weapons soon. I'm not asking for Ratchet & Clank levels of armament here, but a harpoon gun wouldn't go amiss.Heck I'd be fine with crafting the harpoons to be honest.EDIT: What are you doing? WHY HAVEN'T YOU BOUGHT THIS YET?! It keeps getting better! Nevermind the harpoons. Now you have underwater mech-suits! Don't like those Sandsharks? Hop in your exo-suit and PUNCH THEM TO DEATH. Or upgrade with the drill arm and rev it up like a horror movie killer under the sea!Remember finding blueprints in the open sea? FORGET THAT! You better get yourself a laser cutter because it's time to go wreck diving. Make sure you remember your way out and you have batteries for your lights and scanner, or you just drowned for nothing. Think you're safe in that exo-suit? THINK AGAIN. The sea just got meaner with biomechanical squid-wraiths that can teleport you into the open sea! Turns out it's because of a deadly plague which, guess what, you are already infected with! Running low on water and food? Just down a few watermelon-ish type lantern-fruits. What's that? Blood loss detected? EVEN THE FRUIT HERE WANTS YOU DEAD!In all seriousness though, what I first said about this game still holds true today, it just keeps getting better. Every update adds new tech, new threats and new things to find. They took out terraforming for some reason... but no one used that much to begin with. Why dig tunnels when you can make your own aquarium as big as you like and fish now breed in there? Why go to the trouble of studying nuclear reactors when you can breed electric eels and THROW THEM INTO A BLENDER FOR POWER! (Haven't actually tried that part, because getting eel eggs is a real hassle, but wow did they do an about face on that whole ""peaceful coexistence"" thing).Oh wait this was supposed to be the serious section... sorry. Look... if you're scared of the ocean, I understand, because this game will only make that worse for you. If you're looking for hours of fun, beauty and tension, THIS IS YOUR GAME.			"

Subnautica - detailed reviewSubnautica is a gorgeous game focused mostly on underwater exploration. After the terrible crash of the Aurora, the spaceship designed for intergalactic travels, we find ourselves in the middle of ocean withouth any sight of dry surface. As we try to find out what caused the crash and struggle to communicate with the rest of the fleet, we stumble across signs of other intelligent race living on the planet.Gameplay conceptApart from exploring, Subnautica features survival elements in diverse, beautiful environment and has a decent story to tell. The emphasis is put on exploration experience, I guarantee that you will want to go deeper and deeper in order to research the planet mysteries, even though every expedition will require you to face deadly creatures living in extremely dangerous areas.ProsExplorationDespite the fact that the map isn't randomly generated and the enviroment contains the same elements every time we start a new game, Subnautica definitely provides one of the best exploration experiences I have ever had. Whole planet consists of several biomes, each of which is diverse and unique. The ecosystem changes depending on depth, caves' system is complex, alien structures encourage player to do further research and futurstic items give vast opportunities to do so. Furthermore, it's also worth mentioning that the game might be helpful in overcoming the fear of the sea. After all, nothing is more scary than fighting a badass leviathan in the sheer depth, trust me. Great, great job developers, congratulations!Survival & sandboxSubnautica gives various survival possibilites. Finding new resources is easy, item schemes are spread all over the map and every object we find can be scaned to store data about it. There are plenty of methods to arrange player's structures, for example to produce energy the player can either use sun (when closer to surface), biosource (when biom has lots of plants) or heat (especially in lava zone). In addition, huge bases with storage for resources, fish hatcheries and ""docks"" for underwater ships can be built anywhere, and always can be further expanded to fit player's expectations. Overall, in the beginning it's quite hard to figure everything out, but really easy and fun to learn.Development processI've been following the development of this game for a really long time and I feel it's good to notice how well organised it is. To begin with, here[trello.com] everybody can track the progress of creation, usually with detailed comments and screenshots. In addition, instead of uploading huge 3GB updates, developers send neccessery assets and scripts to Steam in small packages - every day! Not only does it show that someone works on improving the game, but also, when there's a need of publicing an update, everything is already downloaded. Awesome!ConsVisual PerformanceSubnautica has magnificent graphics, well designed creatures, visionary equipment and beautiful ecosystem. What is the problem then? Well, the game is simply unplayable in its curent state, because of the visual performance. When we first launch it everything works fine, no lags, chunks load properly, smooth animations - cool! The problem appears after we put lots of work into the game - have a complex base system and most of locations explored. Performance drops down to 5 frames per second, game constantly crashes and pretty much nothing can be done. If we somehow get the game to work, we find out that there are even more problems, because in some locations the amount of items laying down on ground or objects we can interact with, is multiplied (even up to 20 duplicates of the same prop). It becomes annoying especially when you want to open a door by cutting it wih laser only to find out there are 19 more layers of the same door. Oh, and there are some other minor bugs as well, but the game is still in alpha and such issues are to be expected.OverallTo conclude, perfect exploration experience, survival features and breathtaking environment are why Subnautica deserves the highest notes from every customer. It definitely is one of my favourite games and I'm looking forward to playing it again, but without any bugs or performance problems. For now recommended only for users with powerful PCs.Score: 7.5/10 - I will be more than happy to give it 10/10 as soon as performance issues and other bugs are gone.			"

								First thing is first, lets start with the cons:-If you aren't an explorative type, and you need some sort of goal to keep you going into later bits of the game, there is none. Basically, after you get upgrades for your cyclops and seamoth, and build a substantial base, you have no other goal rather than to explore.  -Also, there is a bit of a grind for some of the items you need to get the upgrades. Basically, you explore, find a new fragment, see what you need, then go get it. The main part of this process is the exploration, like I said earlier.  -Survival seemed like it was rushed, without any emphasis on dehydration or hunger. Basically, you need to eat every so often, and drink slightly more oftenNow for the pros.+Gorgeous environments+A very refined and easy to understand tech path. You start in the safe areas, learning the oxygen system and how to acquire food and resources. Then, it gently nudges you to explore more for more resources, like silver. This leads into the slightly dangerous area, which easy to notice enemies that make loud noises when they attack for easy identification. This is also where you get your first sort of defense. Once you acquire the resources from this area you have the items to create the first sub, which allows you to explore more, and so on+Amazing updates. Seamoth update brought to the table something I thought was amazing.  Instead of the basic upgrades things normally have, these were completely innovative and cool ideas. The sonar is possibly the coolest upgrade in any game I've ever seen. Also the nonlethal torpedoes are interesting and useful in their own right+THE DEVS TAKE PEOPLES VIEWS ON THE GAME SERIOUSLY. We said that it would be cool to explore the main ship, and they gave us the update.+Really easy to build and cool bases.+AMAZINGLY COOL ANIMATIONS. The seamoth docking animation for the moonpool and cyclops are beautiful. Also the bulkhead opening animation is great.+EXPLORATION IS EXTREMELY FUN. When they released the idea for the lost river, I didn't think ""what loot would there be"", I thought ""how amazing would this be to look at from a seamoth."" Exploration is the main point of this game, so it is expected to be good. How this game does it is phenomenal. It drives you to explore without the promise of items or loot, but with the idea of how cool things would be. You wonder what would be passed that kelp forest, so you go through and you see the great multitudes of flora and fauna that just make you want to see what else you can find.+JELLYSHROOM CAVES!!!!!!! All the cave exploration is ridiculously cool. You get to see what lurks in the dark trenches of the ocean of an alien planet. You get to see all the cool formations, and beautiful flora. Also, jelly shrooms.+Reefbacks are adorbs. ALL THE ANIMALS ARE UNIQUE AND INTERESTING. Sandsharks hide in the sand, stalkers look for scrap and can be friendly, bonesharks are freaking scary, and Reaper Leviathans are ridiculously scaryThe pros outweigh the cons, definitely, for someone who enjoys exploring			"

Early Access Review
								There are few games worthy of a recommendation while they're still in Early Access, and aside from The Forest and Space Engineers, I think Subnautica may just be the only one I'd truly and strongly recommend.The game is brought to us by the fantastic freaks over at Unknown Worlds, mostly known for the incredibly dull but also incredibly awesome Natural Selection 2. See, I actually know what I'm talking about, you doubting lot! But anyway, I digress...Subnautica has some serious issues and bugs, but frankly, with the almost CLOCKWORK release of updates, bug splats and general patches, this isn't so much a problem as a nuisance at worst, and an interesting (if troublesome) trip at best. One of the most glaring bugs I've found recently was a strange inability to open Bulkhead Doors... however, this was made even MORE strange by the fact that it only affected some doors, even within the same base!Aside from that, the game is (in lack of a more profound and impactful word) absolutely mind-implodingly mega-gorgeous. I shït you not when I say that it's one of the most incredibly beautiful games I have ever played. Rarely do graphics justify a game's existence, however (unless it was developed by the dullards at Crytek that is), but Subnautica does several other things so bloody right, it not only earns its right to be, but does a jolly li'l victory dance to celebrate its existence, too.Exploration, for example, is harrowing and dangerous, but also incredibly immersive (no pun intended) and HIGHLY rewarding, as you can only gain access to new technology by finding tech fragments in new and unexplored biomes. Beyond that, you'll also need to explore to gain access to advanced resources and interesting new databank entries, which as a huge fan of Metroid Prime, I can REALLY get behind with a lubed-up dïldo in one hand and my turgid cöck in the other!Furthermore, the sound is lovely, with effects being realistically muffled by water, and the creaking of a buckling hull giving an eerie sense of ""Oh shït, oh shït, oh shït!"" as you run down a corridor within your deep-sea base, frantically searching for the leaks in your base's hull so that you can weld 'em shut.What the game does lack, however, is a sense of direction or ""meaning"", in lack of a better word. Unlike the aforementioned The Forest, you don't have a tangible goal (yet) in Subnautica, beyond the very basic ""survive"" one, and also unlike the aforementioned Space Engineers, you don't have as much in terms of tools or freedom either. So setting up a functioning and (possibly even moreso difficult) aesthetically appealing base may be an alluring if albeit daunting task at first, but once that's done, you kind of lack the creative freedom that many other survival-based sandbox games may offer.But aside from my various minor complaints, I should mention that I bought this game for the full price and I haven't regretted that purchase for even a single second, so with that in mind, I can't give this game anything but a hearty recommendation. 8.4/10			"

								** This is a new ' revamped ' review. **Since Subnautica first came out, it was always playable. I enjoyed it at first, but like many Early Access it just didnt have enough to hold me for very long. So on this one I just went away for awhile. I was not really into testing it, but I just ' knew ' it would progress. It has. I am now finding it to be really enjoyable, and it will hold your attention with plenty to do. It is not complete, but it sure is worth having in my mind.It is a ' sorta of survival ' game. I say that because of the real flexibility in how you want to play it. Just choose the one you like.1. Sandbox. Build, explore, no limits.2. Easy. You need to explore and have resources, but no worry over O2, food or water. No perma death.3. Survival ( Normal ) You need everything, food, resources, water and O2.. however if you die.. you lose no progress. No reset to last save. You are penalized by losing random items and amounts from your inventory. Reset at your closest base. ( thats your current carried inventory, stored / base items are safe )4. Hardcore. One life, one death.Normally in survival games I am all Hardcore. This one is different. Most survival games you tend to die early.. and they dont really involve the detail here does. As in research, building etc.  Subnautica is different. You dont really face any dangers early but yourself. If you think its a good idea to dive to the depths with no gear for it.. and  you get eaten or die from depth issues.. thats you.. To really be able to get to the good stuff you need to really be able to build, survive and not be tied to one / two bases.. you need to progress to higher techs / tools. It takes time. So even I cringe at investing hours and hours of caution, exploration and research to build up a good base camp.. only to die and lose it.. ( yeah.. IKR ?? Mr it aint survival if you cant die!! lol. ) But being penalized by loss of items, or equipment seems fair to me. If I die I dont lose my hours to build base.. but I might be naked of some cool stuff. Ok.. I can cope. Thus I dont even really consider it survival.  It's sort of survival. I DO consider it a good game.. and from where its at now.. it will only get better.If your curious.. get it. You wont be dissapointed.It is EA still tho'.. so it ' aint perfect ' But its waaay better than a lot of finished games. But isnt that more and more a case? "

								As someone who has an intense fear of the ocean, this game terrified me.  The early minutes of the game we heartpounding diving into the blue the first time.  I was immediately hooked by the wonder under the sea (under the sea!). Now, I just want to see more and more and more.  The game is amazing, and it's still getting better all the time.  Everything's better down where it's wetter, take it from me.			"

								Pros and Cons of Subnautica:Pros:- huge open world that you can explore with a variety of alien fauna and flora.- one of the few early access games that the devs actually care about and are constantly if not regularly updating.- there is alot to do between building bases, crafting items, exploring, etc. etc.- a hidden story that you need to explore to find.- always has me coming back to it.- very pretty enviroment- In-Game bug reporter (easy peasy bug/glitch reporting)Cons:- Slow to progress forward tech-wise- bases are expensive to say the least- occasional jumpscares. (looking at you crabsquid!!)- so much stuff wants to eat you ;-;- glitches/bugs (but that is expected from a early access game but still its a great game)i would suggest picking this game up if you can get past the whole ""All Early Access Games are bad and should be avoided at all costs mindset"" you should definitly pick this game up. besides if you dont like it you can always return it if you dont like it.

								Here's the deal.  This game is absolutely phenomenal.  If I weren't absolutely horrified of deep oceans, I would be playing it non-stop, but instead, I have to take it in doses, followed by an ungodly amount of green tea to calm myself down.  The updates are almost too frequent, and they're all incredible.  The atmosphere is brilliant, and the sound design is some of the best I've heard since...  Well, never, actually.  It's the best I've ever heard.  Bear in mind that this game IS Early Access, then shut up and give them money.  Twenty dollars is an absolute steal in the current industry, so get it while it's cheap.TLDR: 10/10, never going near an ocean ever again.			"

								Easily one of the most engrossing games I've ever played. Despite how simple it is and the lack of 'things to do', the evironment itself will constantly be throwing new hurdles at you without the need for any quest arrow nonsense. There are intense moments of panic as the wildlife takes you by surprise, or you may even become your own worst enemy when you have a panic-attack freak out in an underwater cave and let claustrophobia get the better of you.In fact, without ever intending on it, I think this is the best horror game I've seen in recent years.Very easily a 10/10, with content still inbound and coming in at a steady enough pace. I almost wouldn't even believe it were early access. Very minor nitpicking bugbears with some audio effect issues and glitches, but nothing that is too detracting from the awesomeness.			"

								-After a few hours playing I got my seamoth and a radiation suit.-Decided it was time to check out my crashed spaceship.-Gathered some food and water and departed to a long journey.-I went in the middle of the night because I wanted to arrive by morning so I would have time to gather all the riches I imagined would be there.-Arrived 2 minutes after departure... obviously still night time.-Even so, with my lantern, all I could see was sharks, coral and some quartz.-Check the back of the spaceship, pitch black, the lantern light had nothing to reflect on.-Suddenly a reaper, never seen one before, it was eating my submarine.-The window was starting to crack, tried to get free with no result.-Left the sub in the last moment, and swam away in a strait line as fast as I could.-Still tried to look back and there was no submarine left, only a reaver looking for me.-Made it safely back to my pod and started preparing next expedition.10/10 would do it all again :)Great game, hope the content is enough for some time.

								In a massive clump of assembly line early access survival sims this one stands out because unlike most, this one took a concept a lot of developers shy away from and run with it. Quite well might I add.The fact that there is literally a ""SEND FEEDBACK"" button in the pause menu should show how much the dev team actually cares. The fact that it's in the pause menu makes bug reporting SO MUCH EASIER because you can report a bug the second it happens without going onto some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ forum that no one reads.Additionally, this game is really pretty but in an art style type of way. The unique creature designs and genius inclusion of bioluminescence makes everything pop. Well done, devs.Edit: I highly recommend opting into the experimental build of the game in order to even more closely follow the devs' development process and participate actively even better. To do this, Right click the game in your library and go to properties, click on the betas tab and opt into the experimental build. HAVE FUN!			"

								After the $60 price tag + mediocre response scared me away from No Man's Sky, I was in the market for an open world exploration game.  I found my way to Subnautica, and it has totally delivered.I don't want to say too much, because part of the joy for me came from coming into the game with almost no information.  I don't think I've been this in love with a game since I was a kid.  Its tons of fun, the world is vibrant and rich, and curiosity is consistently rewarded.Two thumbs way, way up.			"

								Do you like Stranded Deep?  If yes, get this game, if no, still get this game.   In all honesty the only similarity is water.  In subnautica, you've crash landed on an alien water world, with completely bizzare and alien flora and fauna, and you need to survive....in the ocean.  The days are awesome and the nights are beautiful due to the high amount of bioluminescence that sea critters have.11/10, would play.			"

Early Access Review
								Subnautica is everything No Man's Sky is not.The devs decided to go with a smaller yet insanely creative and colourful hand-crafted underwater world filled with life instead of a billion planets filled with nothing interesting.This 20$ game has more content in early access than a 60$ piece of overhyped poop.The story is presented through exploration and keeps you interested due to subtle presentation.  Whereas in No Man's Sky there is only non-stop grinding and almost no story elements. Tens of hours of content, and if you love exploration it can become a hundred (while still early-access), whereas in NMS there's like 3 hours of content and then grinding + repetition.Inventory management is a big part of the game, however it is simple and effective (does not hinder you like in NMS).If for any reason you thought that buying NMS was a good idea, just save yourself 40$ and buy this game, you will not regret ir. While it is an underwater, and not space exploration game, you will find everything you would want from NMS. Subnautica is a beautiful, immersive, and well-crafted world just waiting to be explored. This is by far the best exploration game you can find on steam. "

Early Access Review
								Subnautica blows all other Early Access titles I've played out of the water; the transperency of the developers and the frequency of updates is admirable to say the least. This title is an experiment in exploration and survival, with each and every change being visible on the developer's Trello page so you know what is coming next. The game pits you, the lone survivor of a spacecraft crash on an entirely oceanic planet to try and survive against all odds. I will say now - for maximum enjoyment, do NOT look up or research the game's intricacies. Yes, I know most people - including myself - will often watch videos or vigorously devour a wiki's contents for information before purchase, but I can say with confidence that I avoided doing so with this title, and was pleasantly pleased (and continue to be). Learning what is what is a great part of Subnautica, and it feels...right, in a way.I can also recommend that if you have a fear of the ocean depths, and wish to overcome it somewhat, that this can help - it's rather therapeutic. As well as surviving the depths, this game features food and water (toggleable in game modes), base building, vehicle piloting and creation and voxel terraforming. Subnautica is yet another great title from Unknown Worlds, and I hope you give it a try.			"

								I am equally fascinated and terrified by oceans and what lives in them.  This game is truly a work of art in terms of visuals/audio and experience.  It had some graphical issues when I palyed it.  The game struggled to build the world faster than you can travel so there was a lot of popping.  I'll return to it soon and see how the updating has been.  Hoping VR support has improved a bit as well.			"

Early Access Review
								I cannot stress enough when I say that this game is ""Early Access"". That means that bugs, crashes and other errors, breakage and various problems are to be viewed as ""business as usual"". This review is based on my personal experiences of the content that the devs have provided thus far. It shall touch upon my personal prefferences, my likes/dislikes of certain mechanics, items, creatures etc, and is NOT a full review. I will update this review after the games release or any major content patch (which incidentally is tomorrow lol).   OverviewI absolutely LOVE what the devs have done so far and are still doing. They have provided, in my opinion, some of the BEST survival gameplay I have seen here on Steam or anywhere in the gaming industry. This is a truly unique twist of a tried and true gaming concept. The devs are very active on the forums. When players report new gameplay issues the devs respond when discussions get a lot of feedback, both positive and negative. They are also very adamant about keeping the community peaceful and stress free. It remains one of the top 5 mostr most peaceful communities I have ever experienced on Steam or any other gaming forum I have subscribed to.But above all else, the devs do their very best to keep the community informed about their progress on the development of the game. Their Trello bulliten board is always up to date, keeping their community in the know on their projects, both past and  present, and even more importantly the things they have yet to start working on. There are few if any developers who keep their community up to speed as well as these people do, and while STILL providing top quality content on a consistant basis.   Likes/Dislikes Likes  I love the complete attention to detail From the seascapes, to the ambiance, the sea creatures (even the ones that totally scare the absolute crap out of me).   I love the simplistic yet arduous nature of the crafting system. It combines high tech ingenuity with a simple UI that is completely user friendly.   The steady updates to the precursor storyline is really taking shape! It involves so much mystery and scifi fantasy. The precursor base updates have been completely amazing so far. The simple yet elegant design of the structures is truly unique.  IMPORTANT NOTE This Dislike list will be very short. There is not much to dislike about this game!! Some of the bugs/glitches can be very annoying. Bugs and glitches do happen. It cant be avoided. But I do hope that this gets improved upon as soon as humanly possible.Dislikes  The duplicate sealed door glitches are a major issue. It puts players in a position to drown very easily. I hope this gets fixed with the update tomorrow!!  Various clipping issues or creature and tech bugs. 1.) The Magical Reaper that dives into the ground like a sand shark and completely surprises you as he springs from the terrain underneath you!! Or...the Reaper Leviathan who holds a grudge cause he didn't get to kill your beloved Seamoth and so he follows you into the Safe Shallows or other adjacent biome your base/lifepod happens to be in. 2.) I get particularly annoyed when the Prawn suit decides it wants to be just as magical and glitches through the sea floor and into the void. It scares the ever loving CRAP out of me for fear of not having enough thrust left to escape the cold embrace of the void below.  ConclusionEarly Access isn't for everyone. Many people get angry or sad because of the lag, framerate issues, a few broken mechanics that need fixing or even the smallest of things they would prefer to be different. But in this case, the good outways the bad by a landslide. The devs have done an absolutely fabulous job despite so many hurdles they had to jump. If I had to give it a grade, it would be an A minus!!! But that is only because of a very balanced mixture of  frustration, terror/fear, heartache, and a blind hatred for the monsters who destroy my beloved Seamoth!! But along with all that comes a sense of accomplishment that makes those bad times seem like nothing!! But hey, an A is still an A after all!!! "

Early Access Review
								While I was staying at a friends house, I saw that he was playing a game called Subnautica. He told me that this is an early access game and let me create a new game. We were supposed to spend weekend with together, I spend my weekend with his computer, gradually ruining our friendship. Then I returned home and immediately bought this game. I've consumed all there is to it for now and I'm genuinely scared about what will happen when it's released (and for the devs: I'm hoping for a few Cthulhu easter eggs when it's released).Serious review now:The game has it's flaws but for an early access they are very understandable. They've nailed the atmosphere (not sure about the music selection though), nailed the main dynamics of the game and completely nailed the ""Transparent Development"" thing. I don't know whether developers will turn this into what they've promised but I'm already happy with the ratio of the amount I've payed and the time I've enjoyed playing it.The gameplay is quite simple: you're stranded on an alien oceanplanet, a water world if you will, and all you have is your crashed lifepod with limited amount of energy. You collect stuff from the ocean - fish for eating, metals and minerals for crafting - to build a sustainable life under the sea and try to find out what made your ship crash. I'm not fond of ""collect, craft and survive"" type of games but this one COMPLETELY NAILED the underwater life. I mean you genuinely want to discover your surroundings with a great example of typical human curiousity. The creatures, biomes, habitates everything reminds you of where you are; a never-seen planet that contains countless mysteries (for now they are pretty much countable though).Lastly, the dev team. They are REALLY into this game and their community. They listen to what players say and show how they're doing through several tools - Trello for checking what they're doing, what they've completed and what they're planning to do, commit log (or changelog for non developers) that shows all the code or asset commits and an active discussion board. But there is one thing that is WAY more useful than those tools: build-in bug report system. It is awesome, it is simple, it is non distrupting whatsoever. You just press F8 while playing the game, type your comment or bug report and then you submit it. Simple as that.I don't usually trust early access games and I don't usually support them. But this one is amazing as the way it is already and I honestly want them to be successful as fudge.			"

								Despite my lack of hours, I'd highly suggest this game to anyone who loves open world / exploration. For an ""Early Access"" game, this one is well done, beautiful atmosphere, but at the same time horrifying due to the unknown.Pros:+ Beautiful graphics - Amazing Atmosphere+ Gameplay is versatile+ Time wasting+ Surprisingly this can give you jumpscares if the Reaper HAPPENS TO SPAWN RIGHT IN FRONT OF YA + Open sandbox and exploration (multiplayer will soon be added as far as I know.)+ Music and Sound quality just make the scenery more.. unknown, scary yet awesome to explore.Cons: - As for cons, I'm sure most of these will be stomped out later on in the game development.- Only one type of map at the moment, I'm sure there'll be more randomized maps / world generation as development continues. - Huge lag spikes - Map graphics having to disappear and reappear (more lag.)- Horrible spawn placement (A reaper just.. poof, spawned infront of me, and yes, I had a heart attack)- Time wasting crafting system (1 item at a time - takes forever with the crafting animation)- Items can't be stacked at all- Quite a few bugs but hey, c: They'll be easily dealt with in future updates~- ...Why no crouch? C'MOOON.Other than that, this game is quite stunning, 100% worth the 20$, and considering this is just early access, I can't wait for whats in store later on when this thing is finished. Keep it up, Game Dev's. Y'all are doing quite well, and I give props to all of you for creating a new world we haven't seen before.			"

								I have to say I would recommend this game. But not in its current state, I rarely truly say to anyone they should get a game when its in early access because most people complain about bugs or the game being unfinished.However if you would like to join an amazing game company for an amazing journey whilst they create this game then I say WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?I played each of their prototypes for this game and have been following it since they first posted about it a while back now. It looks amazing for an early access game and they are continously developing new things with regular (almost twice daily it seems) updates to their experimental version (although not particularly large amounts of content added), eventually I believe there is meant to be a variety of submarines with interesting hull breach ideas hinted at and equally some customization involved with them, I believe as for the gameplay the species will be continously added upon until you are immersed in a living and breathing underwater otherworldly ecosystem, but for now you are given a handful or interesting and nice species instead, as for what to do with these species I believe they are adding scientific tools for DNA sampling etc after all you were on your way to make the planet habitable.There is also a simple and friendly feedback reporting system in game so you can highlight bugs and glitches quickly which helps them sort them quickerEqually to remain on top of their development they are extremely open and post everyting on their Trello: https://trello.com/b/yxoJrFgP/subnauticaAnd also on this site for more specifics as to what was added/changed last : http://subnautica.unknownworlds.com/#/subnautica/checkins "

Early Access Review
								This is it... the best solo survival game on steam. I initially picked up Subnautica out of my respect for the development team's work on Natural Selection 1 and 2, a pair of brilliant multiplayer shooter/RTS hybrids. The team was clearly talented, dedicated, and respectful of their customers. When they said this was their new project, it was an easy choice to support them.That choice has paid off. Subnautica has seen monthly updates, graphical and UI improvements, gameplay tweaks, the works. I could go on and on about the imaginative creature designs, the fantastic water and lighting graphic effects, the varied biomes, the different vehicles you can create and drive, the fun I've had building bases on sea-cliffs, and the secrets of the world available to discover. Rest assured, it's all there.But all you need to know is that if you have any interest in exploring and surviving in an underwater world, you need to buy this game. My only complaint is that -- a common foible of these survival games -- your nutrition and hydration meters drop like stones, making keeping yourself fed and hydrated a constant chore, rather than an interesting challenge. Fortunately, the developers have implemented a mode (""freedom"") that removes these needs from the game. Believe me, managing your oxygen and health is tricky enough! I would be interested in an option to drastically slow down these needs, as well. Despite this minor flaw, Subnautica is a truly great game and well worth your time.Note that as of the current roadmap (another great thing about Unknown Worlds is their transparent development, see their tracker here[trello.com]), Subnautica 1.0 will be released sometime around May.

								The gaming world just doesn't see enough underwater enviroments.  Much like our own reality, the oceans  are overlooked. To me its one of most fascinating places to explore.  To feel like a Dr. Silvia Earle on another planet is pretty cool.  There are many species to see and many elements of gameplay to engage in.   It maybe Minecraft underwater (of sorts) but thats kinda cool, right?  I look forward to all the future additions to an already interesting game.			"

								This game is a fine example of why the Early Access platform has merit!Innovative and fun, with an immersive world you'll sink (sic) hours into.The dev posts regular updates and each one has refined the game further and it's been great to watch this title become more and more polished in the comparitively short time I've owned it.Put simply, this game gives the majority of 'AAA' titles a run for their money and is absolutely worthy of your attention.If you have doubts, then be patient because the title tends to appear on sale from time to time, but personally, I'd dip my toes in..... sry.... I'd dive into it....... dammit thats worse........ oh just buy the f***ing thing already! :)			"

								I've supported many early access titles, and I can say with confidence that Subnautica is a prime example of early access done right. The game has a built-in feedback system, and the developers are responsive to emails and forum posts. There's also an open Trello board where the developers actively post about issues, progress on new features, and discuss gameplay elements. So far, I'm very happy with my purchase. Unknown Worlds is diving into a survival game with a unique twist, and even in early access, I'm having fun exploring the beautiful underwater world, collecting materials, catching creatures, and crafting tools. More than anything, I'm just happy to see a first-person survival game that doesn't revolve around zombies!			"

								A fantastic underwater survival game, I just love almost everything about it. Would strongly recommend!Pros:* Atomspheric zones. Each zone / biome have a strong atmosphere that always amazes me. It never feels boring to explore a new zone.* Story. The story is interesting and just really adds to the exploring, encourage you to explore further and hinting you where to go but no need to actually follow up on it. There are also plenty of story of what happened in the past. * Creatures and plants. They all have information about them and their behavoir which gives the game some depth. The player can also make use of the information in how to best approach. It feels meaningful and also interesting.* Survival. Food and water is pretty easily kept in check, but there is always a sense of fear when approaching new creatures. Even when you understand the creatures more, there is no easy way of dealing with them. Opens up for creative thinking on how to deal with them, especially since there isn't really a way of killing them. It makes you cautious when exploring, giving you a thrill and also a highly rewarding feeling.* Different modes. I'm currently only playing in survival mode, but I'm glad to see that there are more to choose from to adapt it to your prefered playstyle. Cons:* Bugs and glitches. Which is expected for an early access game. I wouldn't say they make the game unplayable, I haven't encounter those that does at least.* Optimization. The system req. is quite high, adding more options to make it playable for less system req. would be good. Hopefully they are working on improving it as well.			"

								Alright, so here we go:This game is what the industry has been missing all these years. The last time I enjoyed a submarine experience that I loved was back when I played Aquanox 1 and 2. To put in perspective from the feelings I get from this:Imagine the fictional documentary from 2005 called ""Alien Planet"". The documentary was somewhat dramatic in discussing future exploration of planets with life on them. Now take this, and merge that concept with a open world survival game. But hold on, we are not finished: NOW, merge Finding Nemo with it and you have yourself a beautifully crafted experience. To sum it up, it is all about diving and surviving off the ocean when you are forced to jump in a life pod while your space ship goes asunder in orbit; where you find yourself on an oceanic world. Even though it may seem like just some typical survival game, it is not. Did I mention open ocean exploration? You have to gather raw materials and craft things; to which you can use to expand your survivability. On the other point of this game, it is just beautiful. The Algorithms employed randomly generate a very beautiful ocean, with several biomes and many places to explore. The sea life such as schools of fish will glint in the distance and giant but harmless hardback creatures will slowly wander. There are all kinds of unknown life forms that you must take extra caution in avoiding until you know they are safe. The geography of the ocean floor biomes is also well done thus far. Coral reef biome will have lots of mushrooms, tubes, flora and other formations. Then you go into the deeper sea and you find small fissures, volcanoes, towering sea creep; as well as much more depending on the biome. All in all this artistic delight is as fun to play as it is to look at and hear; the developers clearly have be putting attention to the detail of immersion in this one, while making the experience wholesome. This review is being done in early alpha phase; and considering its very early status right now, I assume that this game will evolve into a jewel that the gaming industry has been waiting for. 10/10 - I have never felt so immersed before.

								Subnautica is an awesome game. 9/10It’s just something about the deep blue ocean that relaxes me and terrifies me at the same time. Something about not being able to see what’s beneath you when you are in the deep dark areas. Or seeing a faint, glowing light  in the deep dark abyss. Or being alone on an underwater planet where any creature of any size could grab you at any second. OR The deep distinct hum of the massive Reefbacks you can hear while in the deeper parts of the ocean. It’s the feel of isolation, exploration, and survival that brings this game together. Subnautica is an underwater exploration/survival game. It's a game where you can build advanced technologies to survive on an uncharted planet that is completely covered in ocean with a variety of flora and fauna that is native to the planet. The game starts as your huge ship called the “Aurora” explodes and is sent crashing down to the surface of a planet. You manage to survive in an escape pod only to find  yourself on planet 4546B. A waterworld, where the entire planet is covered with an ocean. From there you can explore the ocean,build a variety of submersibles, build sea bases, and discover and record the flora and fauna of the planet. The devs seem to put a lot of love and effort into their game by constantly giving us great updates to improve the game. One thing I love about the game is you can take pictures in game and put it as a picture frame on a wall in your sea base, I don’t know I just really thought that was neat. If you love the ocean and its strange creatures, or if you love exploring  and building sea bases then this game is for you. I always wanted an underwater game where you can explore and see its wildlife face to face. I felt like someone had to make a game that you can do this and Subnautica fills that need for me :D "

								I have never scuba dived, but I've always been fascinated by it. Subnautica is not helping!The atmosphere is amazing, the crafting system is deceptively deep (it feels shallow and simple, but there is much to plumb within it), and the base gameplay is fun and has yet to get stale.As fare as it's state of completeness, I'm writing this as of 5/4/2015 and I can say it runs better and is more complete than several recent AAA titles, but that is setting the bar a little low. The developer is very involved and actually working pretty dillegently on this project.I normally have a ""No early access"" rule when it comes to games, but I'm glad I made an exception for this title.

(hey, it's early acces btw)3. + Brilliant underwater world atmosphere, totally recommend this game to any person who likes diving.4. + Nice graphics.5. + Sound. Yea, it's perfect, from fish sounds, to musiс, everything is just awesome.6. - No multiplayer. Well, developers promised to make it, but in a very distant future.7. - Many bugs, yea, the game IS in development, and it means bugs.8. - Optimisation is bad.To sum the things up, it's a really interesting survival underwater simulator, despite it's in the early acces, and i will really recommend it to anyone who loves survival games.

								First of all, most game developers today are just fishing for money. But you can really feel that the people behind Unknown Worlds Entertainment really put their mind and time into this game. At first I was skeptic because I love survival like Fallout 4 and and I tried some other survival games and got really disappointed. So I bought it and game it a try, and I absolutely love it. It runs smooth, looks beautiful and on top of all, the game play is fun. And all this for just 20 Bucks.

								Okay, so I absolutely adore this game and I am super excited to see it continue to grow and expand as the months progress! I will do up a list of Pros and Cons of the game, although I highly recommend you buy it if you are into this style of the game.Pros:- Open exploration in a vast, authentic, alien world- A nice sense of realism in a fictional world --> The plants and the creatures suit their biomes- The flora and fauna all have amazing designs - Reaper Leviathans are the bane of my existence- Beautiful world- Very immersive- Lots of content despite the lack of storyline- Lots of potential- Is great and amazing- Keeps you hooked with its current snippets of possible future storyline such as found in the PDA's- Frequent updates- The creaters really seem to care about this game which is great to see. Tehy have a very high level of both detail and qualityCons:- Reaper Leviathans are the bane of my existence- Make sure your computer is able to handle the specs- Without a storyline you eventually run out of things to do - I built the Cyclops, the PRAWN suit and even scanned a Reaper Leviathan and the only things I can do now include exploration, more base building or just wait for further updates.- A few bugs which is fair enough for an early access game. Major bugs I have encountered: released a hatched ray near my base and it managed to glitch inside (It's cute cause it's a pet but sometimes it runs into me when I am crafting things) and my lifepod floated all the way over to the dune biome where Reapers are - was forced to swim there because it I still hadn't crafted a base and I needed to use the fabricator. Went back later when I had the cyclops and dropped down directly under it to find there actually was a Repear directly under it...- If you are not into open sandbox-style games you will not appreciate it at the moment as there are only self-set objectives currentlyI hope this helps anyone who is still wondering whether or not they want to risk it! My 30+ hours spent playing Subnautica say yes!			"

								Generally I adore survival games, and this was no exception. A game where you can't carry over 44,000 tons of mass, a game where you have to decide what to pick up rather than scoop up everything that looks shiny. Sleek graphics and usually sleek animations with it. Fun submersibles, excellent detail of various separated underwater biomes.But Jesus Christ I've never played a horror game more terrifying than looking out over a vast expanse of seemingly empty water and seeing a submarine-sized death snake lunging its roaring jaws at me and latching onto my pitiful little sea moth. You know what? I've never played a horror game more terrifying than looking out over a vast expanse of seemingly empty water and simply WONDERING if I'll see anything at all. Or swimming through a field of red grass and having my whole house suddenly rumble from the bellowing groans of some unseen beast. I'd spend half an hour just trying to build up courage to explore the next biome, for fear I'd encounter some sort of massive Lovecraftian horror. You can never tell if a beautifully detailed environment will hold a bunch of harmless tiny fish or if there's a gigantic behemoth waiting to swallow you whole. Or a bunch of tiny fish ready to snap at you, and a gigantic behemoth that ends up being passive and friendly.If you don't know what the biomes are and where they are... and if you don't know just what sorts of behemoths await you in this game... you might end up like me and spend several hours just looking at the edge of the initial reef, towards some big seaweed,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself over the idea of swimming just a couple feet into it. And sometimes you'll be right to do so. Do yourself a favor and don't look up anything about this game, the discovery is the greatest treat in my opinion.10/10 would flood my house in♥♥♥♥♥♥again.

								Great game. Both visually and in terms of gameplay.I was cautious when buying Subnautica as survival games as a whole have become extremely boring throughout time, however Subnautica brings a fresh survival experience for anyone who has become bored of the monotomy of the usual survival games.On an ocean filled planet, exploring the depths should be an exciting exprience and the developers have made that so. The map is filled with very unique areas with more to come. Most of these areas require exploring due to rare resources being present or blueprint parts for building new equipment/tools.The game is in Early Access so there are a few bugs and framerate issues in the game, but it's worthwhile noting that new content is being pumped out by the developers at an acceptable rate and bugs are being fixed, which makes it worthwhile buying into the early access. I expect I'll manage to get a minimum amount of 25 hours of gameplay, which for £15 is a good deal !			"

So you crash on a planet with the surface mostly made out of water and you have to dive into the ocean and find materials to craft things that can help you survive. Build submarines to go even farther down into the deps of the ocean. Explore dangerous caves, meet hostile sea creatures, build sea bases, etc.This game has so much potential to it. The developers are doing great job by making this game more fun and interesting to play :DI only played this game for few hours but I already fell in love with it XDYou should try this game out!			"

Early Access Review
								Subnautica has been a real pleasure to invest in, especially considering this is still considered an early access game. I have not invested as many hours as others into getting fully developed technologies, the best vehicles or the most ideal buildings, but the game always has the best formula; the game is continuously teetering on the verge of getting boring; but suddenly, Subnautica throws you another curve ball to keep you on your toes. The game, at its core, is a survival game based around mechanics you typically would find in these kind of games. Food, health management, how much you continue to stay hydrated, and of course, your oxygen levels, in case you didn't realise this is a game where you will spend 90 percent of the time submerged underwater.However, what this game for me personally plays on, is the search for what lies further below on the oceanic planet. The game starts you off escaping from some kind of giant mothership in an escape pod, where you have ejected on to an oceanic planet, covered almost entirely in water. With this, comes your need to survive until help arrives, or you find a way to communicate off planet. That is the basic premise of the game, and saying anymore is a spoiler in my eyes. The gameplay comes down to collecting your resources, building some kind of place to live, using those resources to develop tools and equipment, further progression ensues, etc, etc. You get the gist of these kind of games. But Subnautica has one particular element which makes this game amazing. Immersion.You see, in Subnautica, when you begin to develop better oxygen tanks, better scuba gear, and then eventually after some time, a submersible vehicle, you will begin to plummet further down into the depths of this oceanic planet. The game is amazingly detailed and beautiful on the surface levels of the water, hosting massive bodies of alien-like fish, plants, and other such things. As you further investigate, the more ferocious and disturbing these plants and alien-like creatures become. As you begin to enter depths of the ocean where the light does not reach, the game suddenly traverses genres, from a simple collecting-resources-survival sim, to a survival horror game. Pressure becomes paramount to keeping an eye on, watching your oxygen levels deplete the further you plummet and dependant on your resources, and the EXTREMELY LIMITED offensive weaponry you have to defend yourself from the deep creatures turn this game into something that comes out of childhood nightmares.The game is brilliant at giving the player scaling to the environment around them, and makes you truly feel small and insignificant in a vast ocean of shrouded mysteries. As of 12th of April, the updates continue to be made for this game, and provide many more features and large overhauls to both game elements and content, allowing you to traverse land, volcanic deep levels of the ocean, and Alien life that goes beyond both the fish and ourselves. I don't like overpraising games in general, but what I do love is early access DONE RIGHT. The only feature I beg of Subnautica to implement is co-operative; something that could potentially make this game from great to INCREDIBLE. After experiencing my fair share of early access games that provide a lot of promise and potential at first but slowly decline into little to no changes and experience, Subnautica gives me optimism for the survival game genre. A whole-hearted recommendation.			"

								I absolutely love this game. Even with my graphics settings practically locked at low everything so that it can run on my potato, the game still looks absolutely stunning if a bit laggy. With how garbage my computer is though, that's to be expected. There's a couple of reason why I think this game is excellent, and I'll list them now:*The idea of a planet that is pretty much 99.999999% ocean is absolutely fantastic, and I've not ever seen it applied as well in a game as this.*The designs of all of the flora and fauna are A+. The serpentine designs of many predatory creatures in the game, like the stalkers and the reaper leviathans, fit extremely well with the ocean setting, and their streamlined movements look absolutely wonderful in the water. The glowy, alien aesthetic definitely shows in many of the plants seen in-game, and creatures such as the sea-cow like gasopods. It matches the phosphorescent nature of many planned and partially-implemented predators like the sea dragon leviathan, as well as the deep-sea variants of the shallow-water tropical fish. The gentle giants like the reefbacks and the (I think) partially-implemented sea treaders add a sort of feeling of helplessness despite their passive nature, and a very definite knowledge that there is something far grander that occupies this vast ocean in which you must now survive.*I definitely have more than a bit of bias towards this game, as I love the ocean, but the whole aesthetic has been pulled off flawlessly. There is immense satisfaction being recieved when playing this game, and I oft find myself looking out of an observatory I've built onto my base into the vast ocean.*The game's just damn fun. It's extremely relaxing when you're not voyaging out for supplies, and when you're out scavenging there's definitely a tense feeling like, ""I could be eaten at any time"", and for many that might have a fear of the open ocean the tension could definitely compound. It's a good game. I like it.			"

								I’ve spent a long time trying to find a decent underwater survival style game and I’ve finely found it. Even though this game is in early access it sure doesn’t feel like it. It's also nice to see an early access game still being updated and not left to rot like most early access games on Steam. Though I’ve only played a couple of hours I feel right at home with this game already, it’s amazing,The graphics are amazing, the creatures are amazing, the story is amazing, I can’t recommended this game enough. Even in it’s early stages this game has plenty for you to do, plenty for you to see. I’m really looking forward to playing though the rest of the game. I will update this review if I feel there is anything else to addAlso hoping they will add steam trading cards as it would be nice to have a badge for this game on my profile along with some awesome looking backgrounds.

 Analysis This game is first and foremost, absolutely beautiful.  If I was pressed to come up with another term, I would have to go with pants-sh*ttingly terrifying.  See that extremely useful pile of scrap metal at the mouth of that cave?  Don't you dare try to pick it up  unless you would like to permanently modify the scent of your computer chair.And you better believe I'm going to keep playing it.The game is fun, nice to look at, and much more unique than the other survival games that are currently bloating the shop.  With the ability to construct your own bases and ships, survival is just the surface of the gameplay.  Rarely do we get to experience a game that builds such a desire to explore.  Just when you thought you've seen all the creatures this alien sea has to offer, you stumble across a cave full of entrancing pink jellyfish, or a monstrous horse-shoe-crab-whale. With the recent addition of underwater bases, a little bit of my faith in early access games has been restored.  As steam citizens, we are far too used to dissapointment while watching games develop (or... not develop?... starbound?), and this team shows promise.  If you need a new game to put your faith in, try Subnautica. Rating Visual: 8.5/10Although the textures could use some polishing, I absolutely love the overall appearance of the game and can not wait to see more areas and creatures added.Audio:7/10The music does a great job of providing a sense of loneliness and inensity when necessary, but the transitions should be smoothed an dperhaps modified so the ""intense"" moments become less frequent, increasing the effectiveness.Story:-/10There is a brief cutscene at the beginning regarding your ship crashing to the planet and you being the only survivor.  Hopefully, the developers can come up with something a little bit more elaborate and original.  That story seems like a placeholder, and as such, I will wait to post a score. "

								Screenshots and videos of the game look really good right ? Well it's even better when you're actually playing it.Swimming in the depths with headphones is a unique experience. I'm really glad I finally bought this game !Yes some parts of the game are still under construction, but the main mechanics are working pretty well and there are a lot of things to build, places to explore, fishes to eat.Development is progressing smoothly and it looks like I'll be able to continue with my saved game as they add more and more stuff in it !To me it's clearly one of the most fulfilling and well made earlyAccess open-world sandbox out there ! AND it's in a completely unique setting !			"

								This game shows you the beautiful coral reefs, the schools of fishes, the underwater plants, your seabases, the creatures, the wreckage, and generally anything that will makes you say ""Oh my god this is beautiful"", as i did when i played this game. The amount of details the environtment have, along with the vibrant colors of inhabitants will ensure you at least say ""So beautiful"" at least once.On the less brighter sideThis game also shows you the harrowing reality of the depth, the terrifying creatures that will haunt your sleeps, the despair inducing darkness of the caves, and would actually triggers your thalassophobia to the point that you would actually just saved and exited on the spot. This game genuinely scared the hell out of me with all it's carnivore of varying sizes.As such, i would really recommend this game for anyone looking for survival based game in the sea.			"

								This game is gorgeous. Like straight up. It's really evident game design theory went into all the alien creatures in the game, and that alone is a hint at the quality. This game is not just gorgeous, but really enjoyable. The gameplay is quite intutive even though it's still under heavy development. The fact I only had to google to figure something out like 2 or 3 times says a lot. These Devs know what they're doing.If you have thalassophobia, but are the kind of person who is both simultaniously scared and fascinated by the ocean like I am, this game is amazing. I still get spikes of fear when encountering new things and it's thrilling. You start in a friendly shallow coral reef, with a floating lifepod, so I would always scramble back onto it when I got too spooked or night rolled around. The gameplay of intutive learning curves does  make it easier to play and brave the deep.			"

								First thing I'd like to mention is that I have Thalassophobia, the fear of the sea, so this game is literally a nightmare. Still I love this game to death.Subnautica is one of the greates gaming expiriences I have ever had. The sheer wonder and excitement of exploring it's rich environments and strange alien species is magical. Although this game is in Early Access and the content is limited, the dev team is very dedicated and update the game constantly. Adding new fauna and flora, entire environments, new equipment and transportation. Simply put, Subnautica is magical. If you like exploration games, games about the ocean, games about a strage alien planet or games about survival, pick this one up. I promise you, from how little I've played this game, it will stick with me forever and I'm sure it will stick with you too. Also, the best part about Subnautica right now, it gets better every single day.			"

								Since this is early access, my recommendation is for those who enjoy taking part in a game as it's being built.  If you are looking for a complete, near-bugless game - stay away for now.If you are still interested in taking part on a true voyage of seeing a game in its infancy as it blossoms into a full fledged polished game, this is a great place to start!  Subnautica is made by the developers of Natural Selection - a company who has a history of taking good care of their games and listening to their fan base.  Even in its current state, Subnautica is looking like UW is pooring love into it!What should you expect right now?  Underwater exploration in a very pretty environment.  There's a crafting system similar to minecraft where the gathering of resources can allow you to build advanced tools and toys (like drills and vehicles).  There's not a whole lot to do at the moment but explore.  However, the graphics are very beautiful and you'll probably catch yourself swimming around for minutes on end just admiring the scenery and saying high to the alien manitees.Overally, I think this game has the chance to be something really special when it's done, and if you have some spare money to blow on an early-access - give this one a shot!

Early Access Review
								Subnautica promises hours of gameplay as you scour a nearly boundless ocean, filled to the brim with creatures to make you jump, and the prospect of treasures to fill you with the determination to hunt those creatures down. And you know what? This early access game delivers - in spades.When I first began playing, I felt afraid - the ocean was vast, and here I was, but a lone survivor amid my spaceship, crash-landed with nothing more than an escape pod. The initial hour or so was nerve-wracking; necessitated by my need to survive, I plunged into the ocean and searched for food. I learned what areas to avoid, what food was best to you, and so forth. In time my arsenal of technological goods expanded, and so too did my confidence; you could say that after a while, this small outpost of sorts became home. What once would strike fear into me became a daily ritual of survival. The game rewards you systematically, encouraging you to explore each region to find blueprint fragments that unlock fulfilling technologies. I'm talking about new ships, weapons, and improvements for your habitat. The game is filled to the very brim with unlockables; you'll want to collect them all, as they change how you experience the game for the better. Even more so, this game's strongest point is the environment, and the sense of isolation and helplessness as you further your quest. You truly feel alone out here, and after a while the aquarium you keep in your underwater base will fill you with comfort. This sense of isolation makes finding the sparsely outcropped islands - with remnants of some past people - so much more rewarding. It nudges you on even further, the sense of exploration and curiosity driving your every footfall. Everything about this game is beautifully done: from the creaking of your underwater base under pressure, to the sun shafts that greet you amid your ascent from the darkness of the ocean's abyss - you will feel emotionally rewarded by this game in every way. For now, I will wait patiently for this game's v1.0 release, and then I will come back knowing that the developers have created something worth experiencing. "

Early Access Review
								Subnautica is a survival/adventure game where you're stranded on a planet called Planet 4546B it is completely covered in water but has a few islands (I think there are two of them). It's a really adventurous game with lots of caves and biomes to explore. Build your own base and ships to travel around the planet... The game has a story that I regret not paying full attention to since a lot of people have told me it's really interesting and that they're liking it a lot. It's a very thrilling game and really something out of the ordinary compared to other survival games out there.Here are my pros and cons:ProsVery atmospheric and beautiful, not once did I explore a biome without thinking ""Wow, this looks amazing...""The adventure is hard to end, there are so many caves to explore that lead to unknown depths. Hell! Even going out looking for resources will lead to a whole other adventure! It's amazing!What I found most interesting is that all plants/creatures have their own way of acting, each and every one is unique in it's own way and you can scan them using a craftable tool to get all information there is about it.My final pro would have to be just the overall feel of exploring. The more you play the more creatures you'll find, both passive and aggressive... The more you learn about them the more cautious you'll get, which gives you a thrill when exploring.. The feeling is unique and I haven't felt this in any other game ever.ConsBugs and glitches - It is after all something to expect from an Early Access, just something to point out to players who can't deal with such things.Optimization isn't the best, but not really the worst either... Frame drops usually only occur when rendering big and open areas when visiting/re-visiting them for the first time/first time in a long time.I'm not sure if this is still a thing after the ""Infected Update"" but it's still worth pointing out... When I last played Subnautica I ran into really bothering glitches like random fish disappearing, lootables disappearing and no creatures anywhere... It would happen every 30 minutes or so and the only way to fix it would be to close the game and clear the cache. Quite annoying but will probably be fixed soon (If not fixed already).Strongly recommend this game, if you're into survival this game WILL NOT disappoint. It's absolutely amazing, and it's a crazy experience!			"

								I started playing Subnautica again after a long break of not playing (got the game towards mid April) and came back to see that Subnautica has continued to get constant updates and bug fixes during my time away from it. New items, creatures, and zones have been added along with the touch up of some pre-existing ones. It appears that the developers do care about the game and still put effort into releasing new content to ensure its release as a full game. Even as an early access game it has a vast amount of content, providing more to do than many completed games. I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a single-player open world exploration/survival type game. The world itself is very unique and captivating and will have you wanting to explore it all, and it appears to only be gettingbetter with time. "

								I swam trough a creepvine jungle looking for materials, but then a Stalker appeared behind me and gnawed on me. I saw a swarm of small fish I haven't seen before, so I wanted to catch some to eat them later. They ate me instead.I tried to explore a cave, until a fish blew me to bits. It makes a lot of fun... You're on an ocean planet full of unknown lifeforms, open for you to explore and build. Your job is to discover and survive. As early access the game offers you already the basic content (biomes, vehicles and buildings). More content will come. The beginning of the story is also available but basically it is still unfinished.  Visualisation and immersion are very good imho. I haven't found a major bugs on my way trough the sea. Grab it if you can't wait, wait if you don't want to spoil it. It's most fun if you don't know what you're doing and so get the ""full"" experience when it's released.If you're interested in what will come or when will it be probably released: https://trello.com/b/KbugnSRJ/subnautica-roadmap "

								I remember as a kid going to Epcot center at Disneyworld and seeing the ""underwater"" exhibit Seabase Alpha, where they create the illusion that you are in an underwater habitat.  I remember the feeling of awe and wonder I had, even knowing then that it wasn't real.  When I played this game, I felt like I was a kid again walking around Seabase Alpha, and not just that, but building it.The game is still rough around the edges, but it's amazing that in it's unfinished state, with areas not yet populated with stuff, some items not yet interactable, and some research not available, I still can't tear myself away from it.  The core gameplay just works.  It's not that it's really deep (the crafting system is very basic), but the satisfaction you get from carving out a small corner of survivable space in an area so hostile to human life is just awesome.I only have about 30 hours in this game, but there's a foundation here for truly awesome amount of gameplay.

Early Access Review
								I absolutely adore this game; not since the days of Minecraft 1.5 have I been so utterly addicted to a game. The parallels to minecraft and most all other survive/explore/build style games are evident, but the twist of this entire exploration taking place underwater, with undersea bases, and submarines that send my mind back to the ol' days of Descent (the Seamoth anyway!) Packed with beautiful, enigmatic, at times terrifying flora and fauna, vastly different biomes to explore, and a real sense of purpose and progression in trying to explore them all for the more exotic resources needed for awesome items, I really cannot say enough good things about this game.In another parallel with Minecraft however, I must say that at first one is completely lost on what to do, and how to go about things; I could make an awful joke about being thrown in the deep end, but what I would say is to anyone unsure about buying the game, or maybe have already bought it and are testing the proverbial waters, is that it does take a bit of time to figure out what does what and where you need to go to get this and that, and how exactly to survive, but once you get used to it, that's when the real adventure begins. Another thing that I find very commendable is the development team's eaegerness and regularity of updates; while this game is incomplete currently, from the previous two updates I've had the pleasure of experiencing I can tell that even if the game takes ten years to fully complete, each regular update will keep me more than entertained during that process.Thank you Subnautica Development Team, my productivity will be heavily damaged for months to come as a result of your creation!

								Subnautica is about isolation, the loneliness in that vast ocean of unknowns. Taking your submersible down into the black depth is terrifying. You reach a crevasse and you balance on the edge of safe, shallow waters and the empty nothingness below. The atmosphere is pounding you as hard as the pressure on your sub as you're going further down. 50 meters, 150, 300, 500. You can only see what little of the ocean floor is illuminated by your vehicles lights and you are alone, scared and vulnerable. Hurrying to gather the resources you need you notice something. You take out your handheld flashlight and sweep a beam of light out into the darkness, you're not alone. The lights strikes something in the distance, something large, very large. The echo of a creature roars and rumbles through you and you hurry back to the submersible. Turning the powerful lights around you hear it again, and then you see it. You see the the reason why there are no fish around, why the creatures so plentiful in the shallows do not swim this deep. Now you've seen it, and it has seen you.This is Subnautica, welcome.After about 100 hours put into the game it has already far exceeded my expectations. It's the first exploration game that feel like the devs got it right. The building features are fun and rewarding. Exploration is awesome and it just feels on point.If you want an exploration game that works, is interesting, funny, scary and that makes exploration actually FEEL like exploration then please, buy it. Help the developers make this game what it can be and we will all be rewarded with a fantastic game. It's already worth every penny.			"

								Subnautica is a joyful, outstanding and long-time motivating game. Concerning the fauna and flora this title is detailled and plausibly modeled. In combination with the great matching sound effects and music Subnautica develops a unique atmosphere that you will find only in a few other games e.g. Metroid Prime (GCN)/Super Metroid (SNES) or Treasures of the Deep (PS1).On daytime (in the game) it is a pleasure to discover the underwater world, collect and store materials and use them later to produce items in your safety capsule. Later on you will be enabled to build your own submarines and underwater base. In the early stage the capsule seems to be the one and only place were you can feel safe. Especially when night time approaches your mood changes radically. It is harmful out there. During night time I always develop goose bumbs because of the shock effect when suddenly a creature appears and bites you. You can hardly await for the next daytime to feel safe and carry on your discovery journey or make screenshots ;).When playing Subnautica you will forget the time. When you  loved Treasures of the Deep you will love this game too.Even though it is an ""early access"" title it plays very smooth. Yes, it has got some bugs like crashes. When loading a saved game to continue gaming it crashes often on my machine (Lenovo W540 mobile workstation, playing in full graphics quality and highest resulution). Regarding drawbacks I have noticed some minor collision problems with objects when interacting with the environment (polygon intersection). Another deficit of this game is that within the actual build no missions are included like they are in Treasures of the Deep. But the dev-time is still in the design phase and maybe they will implement quests etc.What is very interesting (when I noticed right) is the fact that each time you start a new game from the beginning (no save game) the topology of the ocean, position where items are placed and your start equipement is diffrent from the last one. Which is cool and an additional motivating factor of this game.Hovewer in this early stage Subnautica makes a strong impression, especially in technical atmospheric context, and makes great value of your money spend for this game.08/10For the final build I would be very happy to have the opportunity ... :- to load my own models/maps into the game or- have an editor to design them by my own,- quests are warmly welcome,- grow my own see food on the ground of the ocean,- more usage of the digging/terra morphing ability.

								Saw this game on Steam just after Christmas, didn't think much of it. Then I saw FRANKIEonPCin1080p give it a go. So I decided to buy it to try it for myself, and I was pleasently surprised. This game is amazing, a couple of flaws but the postives outweigh the negatives. The deal is simple, your ship, The Aurora, a terra forming vessel, is hist by a ""Mysterious energy pulse"" Sending you crashing down in an alien sea where you must survive.I'll start with negatives, and get them out the way. First off, there isn't much to do at the moment. You can build a base, which is quite easy as I was given the tool to do that in my life pod (I'm not sure if everyone gets the builder tool in their pod, but I did) So Building a base was the first thing I did. After that I built the tier 1 submarine, and whizzed around for a while collecting food and resources, and that's all I've done, and all you really can do (From my experience so far). The next negative is not really a problem, but it can get annoying at times. Frames can drop, to the point of being a 6th grade powerpoint presentation. Apart from the, that's where the negatives die off.Now for the positives. The graphics are interesting, in the sense of the art style. The various fish look so good, giving you the real sense of being stranded on an alien planet. The water is some of the best I've seen. And the look of the various plants is stunning, and the terrain is well done, featuring caverns, caves and forests of seaweed. Which can be home to some nasty predators if you don't watch yourself. Next up is the crafting. I LOVE IT. It looks complicated when you first go into the system, but it's so simple. And when you have all the requirements for a recipe, it 3D prints the item right infront of your eyes, which is something I've never seen. The controls are responsive, it feels good to play, the submarine controls are similar to Star Citizen's gameplay, wherever your mouse points is where your submarine will want to go, but it can feel a little bit slugish sometimes, espeacially in caves. Overall, this is one of the early access games where you actually get what the devs say in the descritpion. However there are some periods when you don't hear a thing about the game. However when we do hear something it's usually really detailed and good. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who likes survival sandbox games and are looking for a somewhat new approach to the genre. And $20 dollars USD is well worth it, certainly giving you what you payed for.			"

Early Access Review
								Subnautica is one of the few well done early access survival games out there on steam today. With an abundance of poorly made ""cash-grab"" games, Subnautica proudly stands above them as what an early access game should be. Developed enough to be worth playing yet with constant updates adding multiple new features per update.This game offers a fresh concept of survival not based on scavanging destroyed buldings and killing zombies but by exploring the ocean's depths and living off the sea life that inhabits it. Exploration is the key point of this game while survival is a secondary goal that must be met in order to continue playing the game. PROS---------+ For an early access game already plenty of features+ Few to none game breaking bugs+ Constant updates+ Beautiful scenery (looks better then some AAA games)+ Few games like it+ SoundtrackCONS---------- No real ""endgame""- Not much really stopping you from surviving- Can be awkward for beginners to pickup- Some major updates require a restartFINAL REVIEW-------------------I normally don't reccomend early access games personally I think they are a loophole in selling a half-finished game, Subnautica is not like that. This game is a breath of fresh air in the early access survival game genre offerring hours of gameplay and  high quality content. For those of you over at /r/thalassophobia this game is a perfect way to explore your fear or facination of the deep unknown.			"

Early Access Review
								I am totally in love with Subnautica. It's great to see that after 30 years of PC gaming I can still get totally engrossed in a new game and excitedly await every new update. Even though still in a very polished early access stage, Subnautica has great future potential and the Dev team's engagement with the community will surely turn this into a masterpiece upon release.+ Fantastic looking voxel based, alterable world, inhabited by an interesting and massive variety of fauna & flora.+ Great sci-fi Art style+ Good pacing (already) between exploring and growing your ability to become self sufficient+ Exploration and resource gathering never becomes tedious (because of the constant risk vs. reward going on due to being underwater and limited in oxygen supply/swimming time) + Base building is fun and rewards player creativity+ Sc-fi crafting and progression is fun to explore and expand as you widen your horizons in the game world.+ Some really scary moments thrown in to keep the heart rate up and the player on alert+ Brilliant setting and story/lore opportunities (not yet fully realised, but you can already see where this is going)- Minor graphic glitches now and then (early access), but constantly being worked on. I have no worries about the future here as the devs are really close to the players and actually share their backlog/current work items publically!- Lack of fully implemented story mode or goal driven narrrative, though the framework is there and being worked on.I have never had more fun with an early access title than I am having with Subnautica. Unknown Worlds Entertaniment is well deserving of my support and I hope even more open world survival sandbox fans will join me in supporting this gem in the making. "

Early Access Review
Graphics, Sound & Aesthetic:While some may find them a bit too cartoony for their taste, the graphics and sound are a highpoint of this game. The best description I can think of is: Don't Starve meets Finding Nemo with the humans from Wall-E tossed in.  The graphics are gorgeous, the sound design top quality, and both remain consistent to present a cohesive experience.Gameplay:Primarily this game is engineered as a ""Survival Sim"" and contains the usual mechanics that entails (hunger, thirst, monsters to hurt you, resource gathering and management, crafting and base building) - note:  It does have a non-survival mode which does not include hunger & thirst.  What sets it apart from (most) other survival sims is the strong setting.  Base building and vehicles are a particularly strong aspect (especially when they are under siege.. having power suddenly go out while desperately trying to weld holes in a wall shut while it fills up with water is an intense experience).  The ocean setting provides many opportunities for the game to deliver a very solid ""building"" experience while at the same time keeping you on your toes (there ARE things lurking in the deep dark!)That said, this game is obviously currently in early access.  The story is significantly incomplete and chunks of the world are still missing.  There are also a number of mechanics and items that are obvious placeholders for future buildout.Bugs:  I can only speak for my particular setup (an aging Intel i7 930, AMD Radeon HD 6900 video card, 16 gigs of RAM).  While I encountered no crashes I did encounter mild stuttering in heavily fish-populated areas.  Gameplay wise I did encounter several bugs and annoyances.  However most of them were of a ""new mechanic recently implemented"" nature rather than a ""broken"" nature (such as the submarine getting beached upon spawn in).Early Access Dev Interaction:The developers are active and accessible via a number of outlets including the Steam Forums.  Additionally they are very active on Trello which is consistently updated and accurate.  Updates seem fairly frequent - about once a month, sometimes slightly more.Bottom Line:  In my opinion this game is early access done right.  If you've any interest in survival/crafting games and have the patience to watch a game grow, you absolutely owe it to yourself to take a long hard look at this game.			"

								I'd been watching a few Youtubers play this one for the past few months before picking it up on sale.  Obviously, keep in mind it's still early access...Initial impressions are spectacular.  The graphics and sound are amazing.  The gameplay is pretty solid...  There are a few actions you'll find yourself struggling with due to wonkiness, like having to grab creepvine seeds from below where they actually appear, or needing to aim at just the right spot to get fragments to scan.  Resource scarcity will become your biggeat problem early on - nothing respawns, so as you scavenge for metals/minerals and food, they get used up for good.  This along with the general fragility of your character makes for a somewhat steep learning curve, which could conceivably frustrate some players away....but not this one.  The base building system especially excites me, with modules and systems for pretty much any function you could think of.  There's still alot of stuff in the works here too!			"

								I play lots of games, good games, bad ones, god awful ones that make me want to tear my hair out... But none of them, not even the horror games i own, scare me as much as Subnautica does. This should honestly be classified as a horror game. I love this game, don't get me wrong. I am in no way complaining at all, this game is fun and interesting, cute and belittling due to the sheer number of flora and fauna that can ♥♥♥♥ your day up!  But none of it compares to the paralyzing fear of staring into that deep abyss from on high. Wether floating there in my suit or in my little SeaMoth, the terror of staring into that inky blackness makes my throat dry my heart start to hammer in my chest. When i do finally manage to get the courage to go in there, its just one god damn jump scare after another. Swimming in my suit is by far the worst part though, your practically naked and alone, there are no weapons except for a ♥♥♥♥ing knife that goes *swish swish SHICK swish* as you swing it back and forth in a vain-glorious attempt to kill whatever it is that is trying to rip out your ♥♥♥♥ing guts and lay eggs inside you. The graphics are cute tho XDAside from the aching and paralyzing fear of the depths thats this game holds on me, i am captivated by its rather unique building system. While i can almost never take myself lower that the Kelp Forests, i do so enjoy the building system. Making sprawling mega bases with hookups for my SeaMoth(The Moon Pool landing bay) and large areas for power generation and what-not.. Its all fun to build with! With the recent edition of the bones update, the game has gotten even scarier, what with those ♥♥♥♥ing teleporting demons that'll♥♥♥♥♥♥my♥♥♥♥♥if they so much as see me ;-;(at least im pretty sure they were added in the Bones update)Anyways what i am trying to get at is the fact that i absolutely love this game, even though it scares me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I am even more terrified of the dark depths of this game than i am of heights!! And i ♥♥♥♥ing hate heights... anything over 7 feet in the air is too high for me, i dont even care that im a ♥♥♥♥♥ at heights that fear is nothing to this one of the water in this game! XDSo as a little summary im scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of almost everything in here and if you like being terrified out of your gourd at the slightest little shake of your screen then come play Subnautica!! :D			"

								I'm really enjoying this game so far! It looks amazing and the gameplay is incredibly smooth for an EA game.My only criticism is that there isn't really a clear tutorial (other than little text promts telling you what to collect). This made it really frustrating for me when starting out.Just in case anybody else is having the same problem, I made a quick little guide for starting out :)

Early Access Review
								(This review as also posted to the Bammsters website: http://bammsters.thang.dk/wordpress/review-subnautica-early-access-march-2016-build/ )Let’s start with the first thing you notice: The graphics! Subnautica is a very pretty, stylized game, from the white sci-fi plastic surfaces to swimming in the dark above a seafloor of bioluminescent plants, you invariably end up spending the first minutes looking at everything until that “10 seconds of air” warning …  The game, as the name implies, take part mostly under water, diving amongst corals, fungi, fish, and vines, and the game uses this to present a unique set of challenges; you have to deal with managing air, not swimming too deep, and having to unlock technology to dive deeper and into caves and wrecks.  You play as a survivor of the terraforming space-ship, “Aurora”, which has crashed into the ocean of an alien planet. Not far from where your life-raft landed is the main ship, and all over the place there is wreckage; it is this wreckage you need to utilize to build a survivable platform and eventually get off the planet.  The immediate challenge comes fairly quickly, as you need to asses your situation, repair your life-raft and sort out food and fresh water; there are emergency rations in the raft, and you can find a few packs on the ocean floor, but eventually you’ll need get creative. The raft comes with a “fabricator”, that lets you build basic things from the materials you can find, which will help you create a source of clean water, while there are fish and plants around for food. Pro-tip: Build some pipes, 5-6 of them, and place them tightly around your life-raft – while the raft will float around freely on the currents, small pipes don’t, and they’ll help keep the thing in one place for a while.  An interesting step from the developers is that while you can hunt for food, the only lethal weapon available is a small knife. The game’s designer, Charlie Cleveland aka Flayra, has purposely sent the game down a path where you have to deal with your environ in a non-lethal way, such as bringing food to pacify some of the more predatory marine life. This puts Subnautica in a stark contrast to many other survival games, where you often become one of the predators.  Progressing in the game requires locating “fragments” of different technology, spread across the place. Get enough fragments of something, and you’ll have a blueprint, ready to be used. The game, at this stage, doesn’t really tell you about this, but from the start you have access to the blueprint of a handheld scanner, and eventually curiosity leads you to try scanning these fragments, and builds up your available tech. Constructing items from the blueprints then require raw materials, that you gather from the ocean floor and salvage from your crashed space-ship.  Base-building in Subnautica is, of cause, also “subnautical”, where you’re placing structures on the sea-floor and making little hatches to get into them. As you’re building these under a lot of pressure from the water above it, the lower you build them, the more likely they are to break. This seems logical, but again an area where the game neglects to really tell you anything; when your first base floods from lack of structural strength, you’re simply informed that it broke, and you should fix it and/or change it. Some hints are given, such as brief messages about reduction in strength as you replace titanium walls with glass. These help, but only if you notice them.Subnautica_2016-04-17_00003Another odd thing with bases is there is only a single total HP, and no localized damage. Add a lot of glass corridors behind a closed bulk-head, and suddenly a room somewhere else pops and lets water in. Adding glass in 1 section weakens everything apparently.  Now, the one thing we’ve skipped so far in the review is sound. There is sound, and it is awesome, and helps set the mood (and warn of dangers), but there is not really a lot of it, nor should there be – there is just about enough, though some of the machinery could use some diversification in this area. One place that is sorely missing out is the sound-pack for the player. There are some grunts and what I assume is meant to be screams of pain, but they are only available in something sort-of male. People have requested a female option, but developers say this would take an excessive amount of time, so don’t hold your breath.  An area, where there could be room for improvements, is the map – it’s static. Play a 2nd round, and you’ll find that things are largely in the exact same locations. There is some randomization, e.g. tech fragments spawn in fixed locations, but the type of fragment, as well as whether any spawn in a given slot, is semi-random. Biomes, wrecks, caves etc are, however, static, and maps are easily available online for anyone who wants a leg up.  Finally, the game is, currently, single-player. This works, as survival games are about surviving, and especially in Subnautica, where you’re the only land-animal in a vast ocean. Even so, the game would lend itself nicely to Co-Op, even just 2 player Co-Op, where you have to cover the needs of an extra player, and work together to distract hostile marine life, while harvesting plants and minerals. This is again an area that would require significant effort, according to the developers, and currently not being worked on. Multiplayer beyond 2-player could be a bit of a stretch due to the static map, and actual PvP would run counter to the design of not having lethal weaponry.  It does feel somewhat polished, but at the same time lacking in several areas. There is a public roadmap available via Trello, and in-game option for submitting bug-reports, though I’d be inclined to only submit major bugs as you’ll currently encounter far too many smaller glitches to be able to get much playing done.  Bammsters’ Rating:  Design 8, Challenge 8, Fun 7, Replay 6, Price 8, for an overall rating of 7.4 out of 10.  Subnautica is currently available on Steam in Early Access for 19.99€ on Windows PC, Mac and SteamVR, and continues to undergo significant development. An XBox One version is currently also being developed, releasing any day now, and if successful, a PS4 version may also get made.This review is based on the Development Build 30230 March 2016, and meant to reflect that Subnautica’s development is still ongoing.

								As someone who is not really a fan of survival-crafting type games Subnautica seems like a quality title even in this unfinished state. Yes there are some mesh seeming and draw distance issues but overall the world is gorgeous. The gameplay is fairly laid back which I appreciate and the creature designs are fantastic. Not too far into the game but the survival aspects aren't nagging which is also good and you can play the game with them off if you so choose.Looking forward to seeing how this progresses further but I'm already happy with it. Best underwater game since Treasures of the Deep.			"

								I've been following this game and its developers for almost a year now, I think. Maybe even longer. I've spent almost 200 hours in total playing the game. 20 of which I was probably staring at the beautiful scenery, water an light effects. And even though I've been into this game since early 2015, the developers still manage to amaze me every time they put up a new update. Every single update gives me a new reason to start another survival game. I think that the best parts of this game are its looks and sounds. Whenever you're in a safe zone, you really get the feeling of safety and happiness. Once you start going into the deep, you really get that voice in your head, telling you to hurry back to the safe zone. This is the first game I have ever reviewd. In my opinion this game deserves a 10/10. It is still an early access game and still has quite a few bugs if you start looking for them and get as involved with the game as I am. Though still, the team behind this game is doing a very, VERY good job and have managed to step forward with one of the best games I think I have played in the past couple of years. I would seriously recommend this  game to really anyone.			"

Early Access Review
								OK.  I RARELY write reviews for games on Steam.  Infact I believe this is my first one.  However... I cannot keep playing this amazing game without spreading the word on how AMAZING it is!  BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!Does it have issues?  Well yeah, it IS Early Access!  However the dedicated developers work tirelessly to ensure that any bugs/suggestions are met with diligence, and their hard work has produced a game that is... quite frankly... my favorite survival game of all time!First the Cons:1. Bugs are still out there!  Little problems WILL pop up in your game, no question.  I still run into them on a regular basis.  I will say however, they are almost NEVER game-breaking.2. THIS IS NOT A SEARCH AND DESTROY GAME!  This is a survival/exploration game, so if your looking for awsome scifi-weaponry, go buy Halo.  This is a game that forces you to adapt to your environment for your survival, hunting small fish and growing crops while avoiding the predators.3. Patience is required!  You must be willing to spend many hours looking for materials for your creations.  if you want a fast paced arcade style game, this isn't for you.4.  JUMPSCARES!  AND LOTS OF THEM!  There are some awsome looking creatures in this game, and most of them want to kill you.  Life outside your submarine/base ain't easy living!5. If you have a fear of the ocean (many people do, I get it) don't buy this game.  it recreates the feel of the ocean so well, it could cause problems for a phobia.Now for the pros!  Buckle up, because this is a LONG list!1. These creators have some incredible imaginations!  The creatures in this game are beautiful, and all of them behave in unique and natural ways.  From the cute little Peepers to the enormus Reefbacks, and from sleek and deadly Stalkers to the HOLYCRAPTHATMONSTERISEATINGMYSUB Reaper Leviathan... the whole world is ready to be explored!2. The boimes... holy crap the BIOMES!!!  You can't take it all in in one session.  You will spend HOURS exploring your world and not even scratch the surface of its beauty.  Forests of kelp towering like buildings, expanses of bright red grass lining canyon-like formations stretching for what seems like miles, bright glowing forests of mushrooms teeming with bio-luminecent creatures... and thats just a couple examples!  There are nearly a DOZEN of these places, all ready to be discovered!3. This game is most definately an exploration game... but it ain't dull!  Literally EVERY biome has something that can kill you!  You are always checking your suroundings for enemies while you gather precious resources to feed your growing undersea empire!  Some you can fight..... some you cannot......4. While you don't posses any deadly weaponry, the technology you DO possess is all you could ever need.  This game taught me you don't have to slaughter everything in sight to survive in a game like this.  Instead, you can create defensive systems that drive away dangerous predators, and can actually learn to live WITH them!  I have a base inside a Kelp forest teaming with Stalkers, and I've learned how to co-exist with them without bloodshed.  It takes strength to fight... it takes even greater strength to NOT fight...5. Let your creativity run wild!  The impressive base-building system lets you create any kind of home you could possibly imagine!  A fortress of solitude carved into the sand... or an observatory covered in glass, letting you view the world around you from the comfort of home!  You want it... you can build it!6. The wreckage of your ship, the Aurora, is an adventure in itself.  The reactor cores inside must be repaired, or radiation will flood your home miles away.  Now, you could just build a radiation suit and ignore the issue... but then you miss out on some cool addons to your suit that don't protect you from radiation poisoning.  The choice is yours.But be warned... there are dangerous creatures lurking near the ship.....7. The price.  This game is easily worth as much as $39.99 in its current state, and its comming to you for half that!  To quote Garak from DS9: ""I don't know about you... but I would call THAT a bargain!""All in all, this game is currently a 9/10, and its still Early Access!  I cannot even BEGIN to describe what it could look like when its actually released!  Have fun everyone, and see you below the surface!I say again BUY THIS GAME!			"

UPDATE FEB/15Some time has passed since my review, and tons have been added since. The experimental version gets daily (or even more) updates and it gets better and better. Initially i didn't want to play it until it's done but it grabbed me and i always come back to see what's new and if i can get deeper this time.Already a great game and fully worth the money i've spent!-------original review follows:""World-of-Diving"" without ingame-shop meets the average survival-/building-game. Plus a big pile of atmosphere!The bad things i will list here are more likely just early-access-alpha-""features"", so nothing to worry about in the long run IMHO.Right now it's more a ""World-Of-Diving"" than a survival-game though, but you'll definately see where this is intended to go!This is what ""FarSky"" should have been or wanted to be.Is it worth the money NOW? Depends on you. If you enjoy an hour of diving and exploring for a mid-range pricetag, you're in for a fun-ride!If you fear the uncertain future of a not-finished-at-all-early-access-game you'd better keep off. But follow it and keep it on your wishlist! :-)My prediction is that this developer will deliver. I knew why i instantly put that one on my wishlist #1 a long time before and now it shows.And i'm not one of those trying to judge his bad purchase. I've bought ""Spacebase DF9"" too ,-)The good: On ""experimental"" quality (whatever it means) it runs smooth, solid and with >100fps average on my machine @ FullHD. Atmosphere! This game really captures the mood of being stranded in a mysterious underwaterworld. Brilliant! Superb soundscape! So many developers underestimate the need of a fitting and well done sound! It's not all about graphics! Fitting soundtrack (not much music yet though). Captures the mood but does not annoy. Considering this is the Day1-early-access-release it runs like butter. No crashed, no hickups (yet)! Own body is rendered too, like every true 1st-person game should do.The bad: Not much options to setup the game to your liking (yet) Not much too do yet, gather some resources, make some things, don't starve... Made things like an extra-O²-tank are, upon activation, held right in front of you. Floating in the air. Looks stupid :-) Sure, early access and survival...but the O²-Tanks are a joke. Just dived 50m, reached the ground, need to go up again.  Some hostile fish-things which i cannot fight yet. "

								One of the most interesting, fun, exciting yet relaxing games I have ever played.  Its kept me enthralled since the moment I first logged into it a couple of days ago.  The scenery is gorgeous.  I mean seriously.  Whoever is doing the artwork has obviously done his homework and then some.  Subnautica is a game that focusses on crafting, building and exploring.  It does these things well=even in early access.  When you finally build your first Sea Moth you will be psyched!  Multiply that feeling X10 when you eventually build your cyclops and can actually dock your Sea Moth INSIDE it.  Then you can build a fabrication machine and storage lockers inside your cyclops to use the cyclops as a mobile base.  Of course by that time you will have a stationary undersea base as well, and the size and configuration of that is limited only by your imagination.  After 20hrs of game play, there are only a couple of things that I havent created yet(like a thermoelectric plant) but I just found a HUGE undersea cave filled with luminescent plants and creatures to explore.  That and the crashed space ship is supposed to be explorable once you have an ""anti-radiation"" outfit.  Maybe its just because I wanted to be a scuba diver when I was a kid but I am mesmerized by this game.  I will be looking foward to updates and added content in a way that I have never done for a game before.  My only complaint about this game is that I just lost the last 5hrs of game play when the game crashed.  It was the only time the game has crashed on me so far.  Guess I shoulda saved more often huh?  Oh well...			"

								Subnautica is a pretty game with a steady flow of new content. I only really got a couple hours of moderately entertaining gameplay at its current state. Don't buy this game expecting it to keep you entertained for a week yet. I would definately recommend at least following or wishlisting it though. The potential is certainly there, and the devs have been devoted to its progress with healthy concern for keeping the playerbase informed while getting community feedback.Edit: As the updates come, the playability increases. The addition of modular bases and giant submarines certainly adds a lot to work for. However, I still find myself twiddling my thumbs after I've done everything I could think of. Singleplayer does get a bit lonely.Edit 2: The content grows ever larger. I can definitely recommend this game now even though it's still considered unfinished. Getting your $20 worth isn't a challenge anymore.			"

								Aww Man, where do I begin with this AMAZING game!This game has been carefully made by the producers, I mean its so atmospheric and just great! This is perfect for those who are into the survival genre of gaming and its just absolutely mind blowing with its mechanics and everything!  Even if you aren't into the survival type game or are trying to like it, this is a perfect place to start! This game is amazing and its honestly worth all the money. BUY THIS GAMEBUT DON'T GO IN HARDCORE MODE! I liked to go into hardcore mode just for more of a challange. But because of a bug when i entered my escape pod thing holding the Sea Glider i just DIED! LIKE THAT AND LOST ALL MY STUFF FOR I WAS IN HARDCORE MODE! This really annoyed me, and im just here to warn people. This will probably be fixed but still, the chance is there!Thank you Game Devolopers! THANK YOU!			"

								The visuals in this game are amazing, and despite the fact I've normally quickly become bored of survival games, this one keeps me coming back. The different biomes are all beautiful in their own ways, building your base is fun and relatively simple, but the game does give you some challenges with finding fragments for blueprints. It's not impossible to gather blueprints, but some of them are harder to find and get to. My favorite play mode is Hardcore, since you REALLY have to focus on survival if you want to keep your character. Given the pending updates and work I've seen being done on this game, once it's completely finished, it will be glorious.			"

								There i was looking for Lithium in the mushroom forrests to expand my technology reach when i heard an ominous noise, i was very deep in the ocean and i found my self looking to my left and there it was. a horrifying humongous creature circling me. luckily i was sheltered by the large mushroom shaped trees towering above me. i knew a creature of that size could not reach me in there. but i notice a large ammount of lithium just 30 metres from the forest. i knew i needed it for my research and new technolgies but fear kept me from it. the monster still making that horrible noise waited for me to leave the forest knowing i had to at some point. quickly i made a dash for the lithium swimming as fast as i could. as i left the protection of the forest i felt more bare and vulnerable than ever. out of the corner of my eye i spot the horrific being heading straight towards me. im almost at the lithium patch. i grab as much as i can carry and make a bolt for the forrest. not knowing how close that creature was i looked behind me... not 10 metres behing about 40x my size it was gaining on me. i dive for the forrest and the monster fails to get my. knowing it cant get be it gives up. i get in my Seamoth and drive home, succussful run, but i know i will have to go back for more and i know IT will be waiting for me.Pros-YOU CAN BUILD A ♥♥♥♥ING SUB-Great staff that keep updating and adding new and enjoyable features-Still in early access with still so many features-Very good looking-YOU CAN BUILD A BADASS BASE ANYWHERE-Nice music-Oceanic & creature sound effects are on point-Many biomes-Lots of creatures to discover-IT HAS VR SUPPORT (Oculos)-Can be eerie and immersiveCons-Can be laggy at times even with i beefy computer (Depending on graphic settings)-Bugs and glitched can happen-Updates can destroy your save files-After a while it can get boring and seem like theres nothing to doIn all subnautica is a great game and ive stopped playing until the game is fully released so i can really play the full game.

								I sat down tonight to give this game ""a quick run-through,"" and ended up enthralled for hours: This game is completely charming in every way. It's beautiful, the mechanics are fairly simple, and the crafting system isn't tedious or boring. Resources seem to regenerate regularly, which means I don't have to explore far and wide just to survive; exploration seems to be for advancement, which I really like. The sound effects and music pair up with the visual perfectly. There are some objects which seem to lack textures, but that's not unusual for an early access game. In the beginner area (which I haven't yet left,) the hostile creatures aren't overwhelming, and food is plentiful, making learning the game non-stressful and rather pleasant. I can't wait to get to a point where I have more than just the basic starter gear and resources, so I can construct a base, vehicles, and so forth. A+, do recommend!			"

								There are some games that make you feel like a god. Either in battle or creation, many games have the player manifest the role of power. This is not the case in Subnautica. You are not a god. You are not a powerful machine of destruction and immortality. You are just a man. A man alone on one of the most inhospitable environments mankind could possibly live on, the open ocean. You are almost literally thrust onto this alien world which is apparently composed 100% by water. The planet is thriving with flora and fauna that you won't have imagined in your greatest daydreams and your worst nightmares. The things found in the ocean of Subnautica are both dazzling, beautiful, and dangerous in the highest degree. You have no real weapon to defend yourself, limited food, water, and oxygen, and you must fend solely for yourself. But despite the dangers of this game, the beauty comes back to smack you uspide the face and say ""Hey, you. This is nice, appreciate it."" Very few games have such a gorgeous atmosphere. The graphics are decent, but in my opinion, the real winner in this game is the sound. If you're an audiophile like me, you'll appreciate every chirp, whistle, roar, howl, creak, groan, crunch, beep, hum, and splash that the game provides. While the game does sport some very real problems, such as poor optimization, poor distance rendering, and a learning curve that is extremely difficult to overcome without the wiki at your fingertips, the constant updates from the developers make the game and the game's community seem very much alive. If you enjoy gazing into the deep enigmatic abyss and wish to see what it may hold, then this is the game for you.			"

								This is my first review I've ever written for a game. This amazing gem simply compelled me to leave my remarks. For my first play I played for many hours straight, in survival and was just working towards creating my first vessel when I crashed, having foolishly not saved I lost all progress, but after a moment of horror and frustration at myself Im ready and willing to ""dive"" back in. Just this time ill make frequent use of the in game save feature.One the best Early Access Games Ive ever played. The graphics are what really drew me in, very beautiful game to just swim around and explore. Inventory management, and crafting is very simple to use and friendly. There are few issues but it is Early Access and for having only been realease in December its off to a strong start.Cant leave in game feedback because the feedback menu opens but everything is shoved up into the top right. Some feedback I'd like to give to the developers-A time based autosave, perhaps save every 10 minutes and or saves on exit.-In addition to the inventory would be nice to have a character equipment panel. Fins and tanks that are clearly equiped to my character, and are even visible on yourself should not take up inventory space.-The pipes are a nice addition but I believe at some point they should have some sort of way in which they have to attach to something, the way they simple ""float"" mind air disrupts the realism. -Its a minor detail and some would disagree but one the first things I noticed that I think could use some touch up is a climb animation for the escape pod when you leave. It just seemed unsettling how you simply ""warp"" to the top of your pod.-Im sure as others hope and perhaps its in the works but multiplayer option seems like a must. Surely a ship that size crashing would have at least a few more survivors. ;)-Speaking of the crashed ship, love its beautiful desing, and use as a landmark back to the pod, it would be a nice a addition if maybe say as an ""end"" game concept you could find away to withstand the radiation and explore the large ships interior.Again I dont leave reviews and apologize if this is not consider the proper feedback. But I do hope the developers glance upon my review if not for the suggestion but even just to let them know, Thank you for this wonderful piece I look forward to more.To fellow consumers would I reccomnend this game even in these early stages?

								VERY beutiful game with loads of potential, at it's current stage it's not much aside from a few hours of survival goodness. But as this is an early access title that is more than acceptable. With the right development this will be a great game in the survival open world genre.I really think the idea behind this game is what makes it shine, so many generic survival games out there this one brings you a totall unique experience of being trapped in the ocean of an alien planet. The visuals expesially at night are amazing. The crafting system is extremely user-friendly and well done, overall with my first baby steps in this game I am really amazed. I have looked at over 200 early access titles and this one is easily in my top 10, buy it now if you want to support the devs.Here is the video version of what I just said if you prefer it.

								Game has depth for sure. Not going to lie it had me hooked for some 30 hours. Although it did get boring and repetitive. I felt like i explored everything within the first 25 hours of playing. The lag-spikes are annoying af too. Game needs serious optimisation.PROS:- Game looks beautiful.  (If it could support ultra settings)- Amazing depth for the first 20 or so hours. It will have you hooked!- It's early access so theres still time to sort all the bugs.- Good base building properties.- Exploration/Adventure heavy with an aspect of horror. It will keep you on the edge of your seat!- The storyline has been lined up to be something great for sure, you can just feel it its going to be entertaining yet a challenege.- Theres an okayish aspect of realism to it, Depth, Oxygen, Thirst, Food, Temprature etc etc.CONS:- Terrible lag spikes. Even on lowest settings.- The game is littered with bugs.- Awful viewing distance(probably meant this way but its annoying).- Constant NPC/Item spawn/popping into the scene within 100m of you. Its like your moving to fast for the game.- Its 1PP only. There is no aspect of 3PP. Not even when your piloting your Cyclops Sub.- The game will crash when you havent saved it recently. Enjoy that grind to get back to where you were before (Y).- NPCs are on constant noclip cheat, i swear.- Games in dire need of optimisation.OVERALL:8/10. The game is good. and worth the £7.49. Once everything has been resolved (i.e bugs/crashes/glitches) i would recommend this game for sure. It's worth copping in a sale.  "

								Subanutica (PRAWN Update) Subnautica is one of my favorite games and if you buy it I think you will enjoy it. Recorces are extremely hard to find with the last update so it takes a while to progress. Finding and scanning fragments forces you to explore your surroundings and have a few close calls with your worst nightmare. From exploding fish to a snake that lives in a giant shroom Subnautica has some very diverse plant and animal life. Swim for your life through a burning space ship! Give the monster that terminated half the Aurora survivors a hug. Dive into hell and then a underwater graveyard. This game has so many diffrent biomes to visit with their won diffrent types of Fauna and Flora. As it gets really deep monsters of bigger and bigger size want to eat you. There is a LOT to explore. The game lore is really intiresting and they are updating the game a lot and even more than one a day if you do expirimental. The updates usualy bring new items and other things into the game normaly being pretty important. This game has one big rule: No guns. SO we are stranded on an ailen planet with no lethal weapons while Allterra sits back and plays C0D. Overall great game 11/10 would buy again!			"

								At first glance Subnautica might look like another underwater survival game. But after doing a little bit of exploration, I guarantee you that you will be blown away. What sets this game apart from other survival games is its beautiful environment. You can see just how much thought the devs put in making the game. Every biome you explore is vibrant and different. There are many hidden caves and places to explore. Each place has a different atmosphere. One minute you feel safe, the next, you feel like you're being hunted. The ocean is just teeming with life, from small harmless fish to scary leviathans. Oh, and you can also build you're very own submarine and underwater base. This game is definitely a must buy if you're a fan of survival games. It's amazing how good this game already is even though it's still in early access. I daresay that it has the potential to be one of the best survival games out there.			"

								Do not let the thumbs down fool you, this game is absolutely fantastic, and it has extreme potiential for the future, but I want to bring to the forefront something very important to enjoying this game that has been ignored by the Dev's.And that is the extreme lag when rendering new areas.  You will be enjoying the zone you are in and move 20 feet in any direction and your FPS willd drop to the single digits as the game has an epileptic seizsure struggling to render the game world, this will happen to you regardless of hardware, I have an i5-4570 and a (UPDATED GTX 1070 w/ 8gb's of vram, problems still persist) with 8gb's of RAM, there is no excuse for this to be happening on LOW settings.I have been eager to jump back in (no pun) and keep exploring with each update the new content but EACH time I go back, I come face to face with single digit FPS when moving to new areas and I think ""Wow I really don't want to deal with this"" so I turn the game off.ATTN devs, fixing this and increasing LOD distance to show the islands in the distance should be prioritized, I should not be able to swim and stumble upon an island that popped in.Don't be a dayZ subnautica, fix the important, engine related issues before adding new equipment and areas to the game.EDIT: After seeing some downvotes I have to wonder if these people have legitimate greivances with my critique or rather if they're blind fanboys, I've owned this game for over a year and have watched it progress, both of the issues I have stated (low LOD and massive stuttering upon rendering) have been in the game since the game released, this really shouldn't be something put on the backburner because it does not stop you from playing the game, my fear is it will never be fixed and the final game will be full of content and yet a simple yet immersion shattering issue will still plague the game.If you have an SSD I highly recommend installing the game to it, it eliminates much of the problems I have listed here, for those of you without an SSD, you will have to wait until the dev's optimize the game.

								This is quite an interesting game. You show up on an alien world filled with cool aquatic creatures, plants, and environments, using awesome technology to both control them and make the world yours. Exploring and building in this strange place is exciting, and gadgets like the gravity, propulsion, and laser guns make every moment awesome. The creatures are creative and well-thought-up as well, and the music is excellent. If you are interested in diving/alien games, get this!			"

								GREAT GAME. Perfect made. Seems very well already. Very enjoyable. The game has a lot of stuff to be found out and to see.  Many different place are waiting to be visited. Great crafting system and very cool base build. Very nice music, perfect for this game. Perfect survival game without killing anyone and without zombies.  It isn’t easy to survive in this game. Attention: the game has some bugs, but the developer working hard on it. Excellent survival game, can be also played in VR. You don’t need to have a powerful PC. Recommend everyone to play it, the game is much better than many other AAA games.			"

								Wow, as a great passionate of Farsky i really wanted to play this but didn't have some spare cash to buy it, finally after few months of work i managed to obtain a copy of it and i must say, it is really well done as a game, it is challenging and smart and the graphics seems really pleasant; in the future i will write a better review of it but i must say that i'm happy with it, indeed i was looking for a good singleplayer game because i lost my internet connection for about 3 painful and boring days and with such a game i wouldn't even  notice the difference in my life, an immersive experience, nice one.

								Great early access game, with the time I already put into it I built a base, explored a lot, made mini bases scattered across the land, deconstructed my first base and a made a massive underwater sealab.Thats before theres even a real late game implemented into the game at all. Its great, well worth what I spent on it and its sure to just get better, the updates are speedy with these guys, no early access scam on this one. 10/10 would drown again.			"

								Subnautica is a love, hate relationship.The Love:-Outstanding graphics-Gameplay is novel, and interesting-Crafting is rewarding-You will feel a genuine sense of terror when wondering into new territories every single timeThe Hate:Game is near-unplayable at times due to the sheer level of bugs that exist. Seriously the devs are not concerned about optimisization. The game will crash, objects will be distorted, frame-rate drops will get real with you.Overall: Subnautica is a wonderful, unfinished, buggy game. I would give it a 10/10 if not for the bugs that often crash the game. Unfortunately, I can barely recommend the game in this state after having it crash on me now over 10 times, falling through the world 8 times, and objects being distorted to the point of having to restart a couple times from scratch after 20 hours in the 96 hours I've played. 7/10 "

								I absolutely love this game. The atmosphere is unparalleled by any other game I have ever played. Crafting isn't tedious, base building is simple and fun, and the world itself is filled with wildly different biomes that are an absolute blast to explore. Most important of all is that there is a true sense of progression as you acquire vehicles and upgrade them to explore deeper and deeper.So why did I downthumb it?The optimization for this game is absolutely horrendous. No matter WHAT system you're playing it on, the game becomes so bogged down with data after around 15-20 hours of gameplay that you start to experience severe frame drops, and it gets worse as you explore more and more biomes. There are temporary fixes, such as deleting certain folders from your save file, however it does not have a lasting effect. After 80 hours of gameplay on one save on a decent rig, I've reached sub-10 fps more often than I've gotten >40 fps.I realize that it is still in early access, and this is why I trust that the devs will soon address this problem. For now though, if its not on sale, I reccomend you not buy it in its current state.			"

Early Access Review
								Subnautica is a scy-fy-esque, underwater survival game that places you into a primarily underwater world filled to the brim with vibrant plantlife and fish. What does this game need to be great? Content. They could very literally just implement bountiful amounts of content and that alone would hold this game at a very elevated stature to not only mine, but I feel quite a few others viewpoints.The good news is that the Devs *seem* to be very active, but that is completely expected with brand new titles.The bad news is that at any given moment they could cease update production and we'd be♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck. Subnautica is a great game, conceptually, but to obtain that solid, justified ""great game"" status in my book it needs to have MUCH more content, and a bit more overall polishing. Now that is crazy considering the fact that it is a brand new title, but hey, the devs did great work in my book.---------------------pros and cons---------------------WHAT IS GOOD: (pros)- The graphics were designed very, very well. I was, and still am wholeheartedly impressed with how immersive the graphics alone are. The devs have blended the perfect mix of vibrance-to-shadowy-darkness ratio, allowing you to feel sunbeaten and safe on the surface yet utterly terrified of the unknown once you get deep enough. - The sound is very good, I'd like to say that I utterly despise the soundtrack they have implemented (it's a mix of random nightcore-ish club music-esque tracks with some easy going starts to them. I think that if they just took the music out entirely and created in depth, immersive sound for most actions and/or places in the game that it would add even more layers of immersion while also making Subnautica have that deep complexity factor.) Overall, though? I love the sound. That, matched with the graphics make this one of the most immersive games I've played in a while. - The immersion. Once you start playing this you're almost 90% of the time going to be very literally afraid of what could be below you. A friend and I joked about going too deep and realizing the entire ocean floor was a creature, and as unrealistic as that sounds, that's the kind of thing this game makes you think about. At least until you get a feel for the creatures in it, then... well... Just read my ""cons"" tableWHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED/CHANGED: (cons)- Fish AI. What can I really say? It is very basic, and you have to essentially have a staring contest with a creature for them to be any danger. This game is completely relying on that fear of the unknown, but once you get over that, this game becomes kind of boring actually. There's no real danger, beyond what psychological tricks this title plays on you with that ever prevelent ""unknown"" feel. - Crafting. Crafting in this game is the biggest let down. Everything is given to you. There's no trial and error, no experience, no interaction. It's utterly linear, hand-holdy, and very very bland after you use it more than about 20 times. What they really need to do is take a lesson from Minecraft, for example, and let us find our own way in Subnautica. You're telling me that I just automatically understand how to create a fully functional submarine? That I just have some inate knowledge to create a Stasis Rifle? No. Fix this. It's unrealistic, creatively limited, and a bit frustrating considering all the other amazing elements of Subnautica.- DANGER. Implement a creature that comes to the surface and ♥♥♥♥s your♥♥♥♥♥♥up if you don't fight back. Make a creature that can actually see you from a distance away and comes-a-huntin'. Make a creature that blends in with the rock and grabs you as you swim past. Right now, even on HC mode, playing is a bit lackluster due to the fact that you can literally get away from anything. There's no real danger about any aspect of this game. I literally fear forgetting to eat something more than I do the creatures in this game. That's not good. - Map. It's essentially always the same. I know this is a very unfair critique so early on, but I feel I need to say it for future purposes. Subnautica would IMMENSELY benefit from having some type of minecraft-esque procedural generation map functionality. With JUST how limitless the underwater landscape can be in terms of map creation, I'm VERY sure that with time (and perhaps some of the resources that the devs have obtained from the early access) the devs could implement this, and should implement this. After just a few playthroughs the map itself becomes a bit hollow, but overall they've done a great job in making me come back for more map-wise. - Survival. Your food bar goes down far too quickly, as stated in most other reviews I see. As I said above, I quite literally worry about forgetting to look at my food meter more than I ever have about dying from a mob. - Realism. Everything is so perfect in this game, there's no survival aspect once you really boil this title down. It's all: ""Go collect this"" and ""Go collect that"" then ""let this 3d printer thingy do your work for you, because why not?"" Everything you create comes out perfect. Hell, even the knife you make out of VERY basic resources comes out with perfect branding on it as if you had just purchased it from a market. There needs to be that procedural grind, that feeling of ""wow, did I really make it all the way here from when I spawned in?"" Overall? I just think they should either completely remove the hand-holdy crafting system or revamp/overhaul it to the point where it doesn't do 80% of the work for you. ---------------------------------------I know I was a bit harsh here, but generally this is a good game. I wouldn't have critiqued it so harshly, or even wasted my time typing this if I didn't absolutely know that the Devs could easily turn this into one of the best games of the genre. I'll be revising this as I play, and as the game is updated. I'll also provide in depth changelogs of my edits, so that you guys know what you are buying. On more of a straight to the point level? Yeah, I recommend this game. As of right now (3/8/2015) this game has the replayability factor yet fails to have enough content to go all the way. I keep wanting to go back to it, yet I know there's nothing to do. This will improve as the game updates, obviously, but it won't make the fact that in another 20 minutes I'll have every bit of new content they update in my inventory go away. This game needs to make me feel like I've created something, not pushed a button and had it created for me.EDIT: 3/10/2015 (1:40 PM)I have added a ""pro's"" list encompassing some of the things I love about Subnautica, as only having a ""con's"" list was a bit unfair.EDIT: 3/10/2015 (2:08 PM)I have added a ""realism"" button point in the cons section, as well as did an overall polish of the review in its entirety.

								Hello and Welcome to my Subnautica review laddie’s,Before I’ll start talking about the content of Subnautica, the Devs and the community i would like to talk about how i got in touch with Subnautica.Since like 2 years  Im always looking for new games to play because the game i mained for a long time,Team Fortress 2, started dying due to a toxic community that was the result of the free to play update. There are also many other reasons  why i did quit Tf2 and i dont think i need to talk about all the flaws of Valve and TF2 here. After i did quit playing Team Fortress 2 a friend got me into Payday and Payday 2 and also i play Awesomenauts alot. But since i lost Team fortress 2 i somehow feel lost and im always lurking around on steam to find new great games to play. Like 10 or 11 Months ago i saw Subnautica the first time on Steam in the ""coming soon section"", there werent many informations about the game and just a few concept arts but i instantly fell in Love with the idea and the game itself.I lurked the Internet to gather any information i could find about Subnautica, i started making up my own ideas and concept arts, it was the first time i was actually really hyped for a game (except fallout 4 right now). The idea behind subnautica has always been extraordinary in my eyes. Underwater/Diving games vanished 2000-2005 completly, i remember when i was a kid i used to play alot of diving simulators on the PC, of course underwater levels still exist and so does diving but there havent been many high quality games focusing on Underwater adventures, in fact the only game i remember is FarSky, i actually liked the game but it was more like a underwater minecraft with arguable quality.So i visited the Subnautica site on a daily base and soaked up everything it did spit out.Sadly i was not capable of backing the Game because i really despise Paypal. As an excuse, i got like 5 friends with paypal accounts doing it vicariously for me.2 months ago the day finally came, early access, i instantly forced my good friend Don Karnage to buy me the game for christmas because i had been broke. Like a real comrade he did it with not to much resistance.Well now im here, after 90 hours in experimental mode and im writing this review here (Captain Obvious)So where should i start?i think i start with the Devs.The People working on Subnautica are from the Studio ""UnknownWorlds Entertainment"", they made Natural Selection (another great alien game) and are currently working on Subnautica and Natural Selection 2. Subnautica is not the first ""Early Access"" game i bought and not the first process of gamedevelopment i accompanied as a customer. But without a doubt the development of Subnautica is so far the most enjoyable and accessible i have encountered. The Devs do a great job in communicating with the Community and really try to integrate us, the players, in the Development process. There are multiple ways to communicate with the Devs. like the Subnautica forums, the steam discussion  forums, Trello, Sketchfab,Facebook and other social media. You also have a great insight in the game process so far, On trello you can see  what is being worked on and you can vote what has higher priority for example a new creature or a new tool. The Devs usually read posts in the forums with gameideas and if they are good they will be added to the game, they have a plan they follow but they are open-minded and allow us to bring our ideas in the game to. Only negative thing i see right now is that subnautica gets alot of attention, actually nothing bad, but there are people who are really hyped about the game and who have alot of more or less unrealistic wishes and ideas and they spam the forums with no  malicious intentions, still i think it is hard for the devs to keep track of the people who really have eleborate ideas and concepts. Due to this high level of communication and also ways to report bugs the game runs smoothly and bugs or glitches get killed off quickly. In experimental mode you get 2-4 updates daily that add new tools and creatures to test and optimize,add new areas and terrain or fixes bugs. On normal mode there is a weekly update.About the game itself.It is one of this games you just cant stop playing because after every update there is something new to discover, also its one of this games you just cant stop looking at. It is absolutely beautiful.The Alien-Creatures reaching from Huge Peaceful Whalelike Mantarays to Dangerous yet beautiful Fish that  mesmerizes you with their shiny colours and then take your head off, There are funny looking fat manatees that will Gas you if you get to close and other fascinating creatures. The entire Biomes are well made and just gorgeous. At this moment the amount of Flora and Fauna (Creatures and Plants) is not that big, also not all biomes are implemented yet and the ones that exist are not finished yet, new creatures,new plants, new islands and new areas and biomes get added from time to time and i hope the finished game will have all the planned Biomes and tons of creatures ranging from small and peaceful to huge and terrible. But i have no doubt that this will happen, it might take some time but the Devs give their best to add everything they had planned, for example nearly all creatures from the concept arts are already ingame or being worked on.The Game itself is beautiful and has nice graphics but doesnt require a really good Computer which is really nice , my Computer is from 2011 and i can play most of the latest high end graphic games on low-medium without stutters, Subnautica runs fine on the highest settings.In my 90 hours i havent experienced a single crash although i messed around with the game a lot.The Controls of the game are smooth and easy to learn. The concept of the game is to explore and craft and you can play it on different ""difficulties"" for example in ""freedom"" you dont have to worry about Water or Food you can just explore and only have to look after dangerous creatures and Oxygen, in ""hardcore"" you have to eat and drink and also when you die you dont respawn you have to start a completly new game and lose all your items.This review is not done yet, i will keep working on it and change things as the game changes, i know im still missing some things but i hope this review helps you a bit to decide if you should buy Subnautica, My suggestion is clearly a ""Ja Kamerad""Miles			"

								First, I want to say that I adore this game. It's amazing. It's more addicting than Minecraft, the world is designed well, and you're constantly striving to do more or progress to the next thing. The health, food and water system work perfectly. The base building is engaging, and while somewhat frustrating, allows you to create some amazing facilities. Why am I not reccomending it then, if I'm singing it's praises? Performance.You could be running a $10k rig and you'd get lag spikes and pop-ins, due to the way it loads the biomes. When you hit 8-10 hours on a save file, it crashes. Regardless of anything, entire areas of the map become inacessable due to crashes if you so much as stray to close to the biome loading zone. It's taken me 20+ minutes to do what was once a 2 minute trip due to constant crashes and relaunches. There are workarounds, but they're shoddy at best. This is an issue with the game itself and the way it handles the world, and it desperately needs fixing, because 10 hours is the point that you're usually going to be staring to explore the better, more interesting areas of the game's world. When this changes, I'mm happily change this to a reccomendation in an instant, but I'd say wait for the massive performance issues to be fixed. Though if there was ever a game to make me forgive these kindof of peoblems, this is the top contender.*Editing this bit in* - I know there are fixes for this, I've used them. What I'm saying is that I shouldnt have to go into a game's files and delete things to get the game to continue functioning.			"

								From the first moment i dropped into this game, I was truly amazed by the quality of the atmosphere.  You truly feel like your under water, and there are so many small details that bring home that fact in a big way.From gathering resources, to hunting fish, and building this game truly has it all.  Honestly, its the most polished early acess title i have played and I feel like even in it's current state it could pass as a full release.   There's a suddle uneasyness to some of the areas in the game, and I have by no means explored them all.   The game can be calm and enthralling at times, but eerie at others.  I guess it goes back to the fact that your one man, in a large open ocean world, where anything can be swimming with you.    I highly recommend giving this game  a shot.

								As a fan of sci-fi, I absolutly love this game. The idea is so unique, it's the only survival game on another planet (That i'm aware of.) You spawn in a life pod, after your ship ""The aurora"" crashed on the planet after an unknown weapon hit it. The game is based almost entirely underwater, which I like, you catch fish as a food source, or you can grab plants from the Island, located behind the ship. You can build underwater bases, submarines, weapons, etc. The only thing I could possibly dislike is the fact that there is no multiplayer, but I'm sure they will add it. I personally love the idea of survival on an alien world. This game is an early access game, so it has many bugs, but nonetheless it's great. It's quite worth the $20 I paid for this masterpeice.I rate 9/10, Probably a 10 with multi-player.			"

								Subnautica is a great game overall. It can be for people who just like to explore the open oceans and looking at the breath taking views. But its also for those hardcore survival gamers who want to make the game as challenging and realistic as possible. I am looking forward to new updates and playing more of this in the future. 9/10			"

								Ok, this is not your hardcore ultra-survival. This is a relaxing, VERY atmospheric game. You swim around, and discover the ocean and it's strange alien orginisms. This is why, the game is better without tutorials and wikis. Really not that much challenge, unless you play hardcore. The game does force you to explore to progress. The game is also very vague when they want you to get a certain material to craft something, such as vehicles. I do recommend this game very much. Now is it worth $19.99? Depending what kind of person you are. For me, yes. But it does feel like a very indie game, low production. So if your not into these kind of games, but you still want this, just wait till it goes on sale!			"

								The game is in early access and yet it is overwhelmingly beautiful. Everything about this game is particularly peculiar, everything is well designed and different from any diving games (which aren't much). This is the best diving game on the market at the moment (on my opinion) and it's the only where you can dive at an alien world. The game is a little buggy, sometimes, but it works pretty damn right for an early access, and I consider it the best early access on steam. The design of the life-forms, tools, vehicles are amazing and innovative.The flooding system about to come up with the submarine named Cyclops is astonishing.  Watch it here.  "

								This game has a special place in my heart.I originally bought it the moment it went on sale, having been convinced by the teaser trailer alone. At the time, it was rather barebones, more of a concept than anything else, but a concept that I loved. Over time, it's slowly grown into something far more than it originally was.It didn't help that I'm also a big fan of Unknown Worlds, having bought Natural Selection 2's Limited Edition the moment it went on sale as well, seeing how much I loved the first game.It too was very barebones at the start, but has evolved into much more (albeit some may find it disappointing nowadays). Back to Subnautica, though:I've been playing the game about once a month for a few days at a time, as it seems like a good amount of time to return to it, since the devs add content left and right almost every week.I've been fascinated by it's lore since it started popping up, especially since it takes place in the same universe as the Natural Selection series.The devs have multiple locations to follow their work, all of which are constantly updated with new plans and previews of content or systems. The game itself is one of my favourite survival sandbox games, by far. Even if the world is handbuilt, I always feel like I'm discovering something new when exploring it every time I play, even when there's hasn't been any updates to it.There's enough content at the moment (I expect much more to be added very soon) to keep me occupied for dozens of hours per playthrough (even if I generally spend 50+ on each), and keep me interested. I always have ideas for new parts of my base to build, or new bases entirely.I can't really think of anything else to say, other than I very highly suggest this game to anyone interested in the Survival/Sandbox genre. It definitely is a game of exquisite quality (at least, in my opinion ^-^), and it has a great team behind it, making it one of the best Early Access games to jump in to at any point.			"

								Do you love the ocean, the cool blue water, the exotic creatures underneath the surface, and all that constitues Oceanography? Then you will appreciate Subnautica! Subnautica while still in Early Access, represents the inginuity of Unknown Worlds, the developing indie studio. After their RTS-FPS title Natural Selection 2, they decided to change gears and make a radically different game. No major AAA studio released an underwater exploration/survival title. Only ""FarSky Interactive"" an indie studio published an underwater survival game called ""FarSky."" That title while impressive falls utterly short of what Unknown Worlds has already accomplished in Early Access.In Subnautica you are able to explore beautiful undersea environments. They are filled with exotic creatures crafted by U.W. (Unknown Worlds): some resemble creatures from Earth's oceans while others are radically different to represent the alien-ness of the planet you've crashed on. The peaceful exploration mixed in with intense confrontations with dangerous fish constitutes Subnautica's greatest strength: an underwater exploration simulator. The weakness of the game is simply in it's premise: minimal violence. Unlike Natural Selection 2, this game isn't about violence. Subnautica revolves around exploration and imagination.Provided you appreciate the mystery of the ocean depths, you will love Subnautica. If you want undersea combat, look into the undersea hunting title ""Depth Hunter 2"" or the undersea asymmetrical FPS ""Depth."" "

								Greate, Beautiful game. First You fight to survive, then You explore and then You retire in Your own subnautical paradise ...Some tips for those who are in the very beginning:- There is a container inside Your pod with some starter resources to save You some time. You can store some excess stuff there also.- Fixing sparks in pod is just cosmetic. Does not change anything at the moment.- Craft two or three oxigen tanks and keep them in Your inventory. This will give You more time to navigate and search important materials for survival without need to surface because of oxigen running out. Less stress and more productive diving fun.- Fish and waterplants can help You to deal with important survival issues in more than one way. Some species of fish in this game are much more than just ""another random source of the food"".			"

								Still early access, so its missing a lot of content that they have planned, but you can tell they are overall heading in the right direction.  Is in great shape as is right now however, and is in the best shape that I've seen an early access title get released for quite some time!  Can't wait to see things like base building, ship building, and with any luck multiplayer!In its current early access state, most of your enjoyment will be exploring their terrain, which is a true beauty!  Played some of the early prototypes of this, and it has come a long ways since then, so I am expecting this to go pretty far!  Really hope Unknown Worlds keeps up with it, as I see it as being the first UnderWater survival game that has the ability to provide 100s of hours of gameplay, instead of mere hours like most of the other ones!So far my frames are solid, haven't experianced a crash, and haven't really seen any glitches!Update 12/31/2014 --Been playing around in it once again, now has save games, more animals, and more content.  Starting to actually feel more like a complete game :D.  With this sadly came some bugs, but of course I'm on the experimental branch, of which has been getting 2-3 updates daily.  Loving each and every thing I've seen that is new (Except the bugs, none of which are ground breaking though).  Keep it up Unknown Worlds!			"

Like I needed more storage room, so i built a 3x3 metal storage container...It can't contain anything...now its just a huge metal box taking up my precious storage room. If it is a piece to go somehwere else i wish it was indicated somewhere..so I didnt have to spend my time and energy collecing the resources/4. (Not as urgent but a mere idea) I wish we can develop our submarine lab, as place additional attachment making it grow into a more permenant base. Perhaps some weapon system as well...the big animals kept knocking it around-------------------------------------------------------With all this said, I am changing it from a No to a Yes.			"

Early Access Review
								Subnautica is a deeply engrossing game of exploration, discovery and survival. It's also absolutely terrifying at times.My game play as shown here is quite inaccurate because I've been playing offline for a lot of it, my actual time is more like 15+ hours and this is still just early access. Exploring this planets oceans is really, really fun!At the moment you can build a small submarine, a big submarine and as many highly customisable sea bases as you like with more big features trickling in every few weeks. The ocean of this game does a great job of actually seeming alien and as such it can be very scary exploring as you have no idea what you may discover. The survival aspects are very manageable at the moment but do have a tendency to get a bit tedious as the game continues, however you can play in sandbox mode where the survival elements are stripped out allowing easy exploration. The games map is huge but can feel a bit samey after about ten hours. However i think this is because the map is hand crafted so much of the outlying areas haven't been properly furnished yet so this will probably improve in time.And finally, this game (so far at least) is an excellent example of a developer using early access as it was intended for aka they really listen to the community!They constantly update their Trello board letting you know and up vote what things they are working on and you can easily talk to them through a bunch of methods including twitter. Overall 9/10, really impressed!			"

								This game is awesome already and I'll tell you why- Graphics are stunning- Its super stable. I have played about 30h now and never had a crash or game breaking glitch (besides very rare animation glitches)- Frequent updates with new content -> it grows fast- Great simplicity. No overloaded menus. Very streamlined experience from the beginning.- Highly immersive. It doesn't try to be very realistic in all areas, but that doesn't stop you kind of ""feeling"" the environment.PeacefulnessI like this game especially because of the peaceful gameplay with a high focus on exploration.There are no lethal weapons (besides a small knife) and the developers stated there wont be any in the future. This and many more gameplay mechanics encourages a peaceful lifestyle with the environment and not against it.Sure there are animals who want to eat you - after all it's a survival game - but there are ways to defend yourself without killing them. Which brings me to the next point:SurvivalIt's not a hard game, and it doesn't try to be. As I mentioned, the gameplay focuses on exploration and that's what I bought this game for.The survival aspect is merely a tool to encourage exploration. Dying isn't punished very much (at least at the moment) so you can enjoy the gameworld without much frustration.This doesn't mean however that encounters with scary big fish while exploring a dark cave aren't tense however!TechyMost survival games set you free on a deserted patch of land with literally nothing, so you have to build crude weapons and shelter with literally sticks and stones.That's not exactly the case here. You are stranded because your huge mining-spaceship got wrecked on this planet, so there is quite a bit of technology at your hands. You have to find some blueprints and materials first, but you are able to build some cool tech like submarines and nice-looking seebases with the help of sciency fabricators (with lasers and♥♥♥♥♥♥)Bottom LineThis game is different from a ""standard"" survival game in quite a few aspects gameplay-wise. Combined with its eye-pleasing graphics and beautiful open world its a very nice fresh touch to the survival genre.And to everyone waiting for ""No Man's Sky"" -> This is your game to fill the time.

Early Access Review
								This game is truly a unique and entertaining experience. At all times, I was feeling -something- about my surroundings. I found myself admiring the beautiful view in the safe shallows and kelp jungles, found myself jumping at every bump and chirp in the bloodgrass plains, and most of all, I was genuinely paranoid and terrified of the Leviathans near the Aurora. Subnautica, though it could be called many things, and indeed does these many things well (adventure, sandbox, survival), it truly comes into its own as a horror game. The atmostpheres designed and the creatures to go with them truly instill a sense of fear into the player, as you go deeper, you'll be asking yourself if that was a tail you just saw out of the corner of your eye, or maybe it was just a Spadefish. Unlike most horror, it comes naturally rather than simply hitting you with a jumpscare and demanding that you scream. The setting ushers in an organic feeling of genuine fear for your surroundings, waiting for something that may never come.While this game has many strengths, unfortunately, it has its flaws too. Though it's early-access, and issues are understandable, and indeed expected, some of these things could be well avoided. My biggest problem came from the system of combat. On my first night, I found myself with only a pair of flippers and a survival knife, in desperate need of food. However, upon exiting, I was set upon by Stalkers, and, in my rush to defeat them, I found myself scoring only a hit or two before dying and being forced to go back to my escape pod. Upon further investigation, I learned that, even when not panicking and flailing, it is still exceptionally hard to hit an enemy, and indeed anything that moves, during combat or otherwise.While there are many, many features one might go over, in essence, this game is stellar, providing a refreshing twist on the increasingly stale survival game genre. Despite its high demands of your computer, I find myself able to run the game with only minor issues on a low-end GPU. I would strongly reccomend this game for any who are looking for a true horror experience.			"

								To start off, this game as an awsome looking. It has a great graphic quality, and for me in unique. The developers are putting all they're work on to this game, and it's getting bigger and better. It's a game to really enjoy the underwater life. Also the gadgets they have implemented or concepted have a really awsome looking, like the cyclops. The seabases are also looking great, but in my opinion they need to have a bit more work, but for now they are so cool. The gameplay is really smoth. All the controls swimming, in the cyclops or even in the seamoth are great, and easy to play with. The developers are also showing a lot of hard work on this game, since it has a lot of updates.			"

Early Access Review
								EDIT: Still an amazing game, bug list SQUASHED...just throwing that out there, one of the very few early access that runs like a finished game, I like it. Could use more in game mission type content... everything else looks good, just needs some objectives like, kill this, deliver that, build this here, make an outpost there, lick this whale, kick this fish in the eye, idk...AMAZING GAMEMore fun than AAA games, More fun than Minecraft, Great game to explore and build.Bought this along with Metal Gear Solid 5 this week, played MGS 5 first for 4 hrs then I played Subnautica for 21 hrs, yes it's that good.Edit: There is still more to do in minecraft because of command blocks and all the creative things you can do there, but Subnautica is really great too, it's just different, and the whole time I am like OMG EYE CANDY, seriously, it's polished quite well, not perfect, but I like it.

Early Access Review
								It's many, many years in the future. You're part of the crew aboard a terraforming ship on a year and a half journey out from the nearest major starport, one-way. Or rather, you were before a catastrophe happens that leaves you alone on the surface of some water planet in the middle of nowhere.Don't let the bright, tropicaly colored graphics fool you; this game gets categorized as 'Survival Horror' instead of 'Tropical Vacation' in my book because you and Lifepod 5 are sitting in an ocean full of alien life forms who would go out of their way to give human a try. Hostile creatures ranging from small parasitic Bleeders the size of your forearm to the loud and scary Leviathan-class predators inhabit the waters.Starting off with your futuristic fabricator within the lifepod, you start building tools with the resources in your vicinity and work your way up, eventually beginning to recover technology from wreckage of your assigned starship, building a small seabase to establish a base of operations, creating and operating a large submarine to dive deeper, and eventually making an exosuit to operate in some of the deepest depths of the shelf you inhabit. Just be careful down there, it's hard to imagine what sort of creatures have evolved to survive one of the harshest environments imagineable.----Fluffy review aside now, I really don't know why more people haven't purchased this game. It's amazing and innovative; where other survival games treat water as a boundary this game embraces it, innovates on underwater graphics, yada yada. It's pretty and it makes you feel like you're in an endless ocean.They're about ready to meet the final goals they'd originally set hopefully by the end of the year. Currently the early access is quite filled out in comparison to a year ago, though I admit the biggest issue I have is batteries not being rechargeable yet (coming in the next update probably!)I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of survival games. Just know that the priority in early access isn't quality of life stuff like the afformentioned battery chargers. That said, they're nearing completion and have finally gotten around to implimenting QoL content!			"

								From the same developers that created Natural Selection and Natural Selection 2 comes another quality over quantity game. The devs are extremely vocal with the community and are constantly asking them for input. This game is updated almost bi-monthly and not just bug fixes but actual content.This game is beautiful, fun and the soundtrack is not bad either.			"

Early Access Review
								Stop looking at the negative reviews.Buy this god damn game.NOTE: I update this thread periodically to evaluate the games performance as it evolves. Check back every few months for a little tidbit extra.August 8th, 2015:Where was I? Oh yes. I wont tell you about the amazing visuals, sound, and loads of new content being rolled out by the responsive devs, Ill leave all the good points to the other 94% of writings on this game. Instead ill tell you why the 6% of negative reviews arent representative.Ive read through about half of the complaints and the primary complaints are lack of content, and some lag. People: The devs themselves currently claim there is only about 2 hours of content. This is well known. This is no secret. If you come and buy a game whos makers are TELLING you this, and then complain of (Current) lack of content, you shouldnt downvote the game, you should downvote youir own lack of research. And besides, theyre working really hard to fix that already and are doing a great job of it with regular community updates. And yes, as you also may of noticed the game looks AMAZING. While there are video settings, some computers simply cant handle the beta-optimization of this game. The devs already fixed many lag issues, instant memory crashes, ect. but its not perfect. You will need a modern/decent computer to run this, but not state of the art. Note: many older performance-related reviews are now irrelevant. Take them with a grain of salt. However, once again people, there is a minimum system requirement DIRECTLY underneath the ""About Game"" section of this page for god sakes. Read it. Once again, many who bought the game and did not like it, did'nt glance at the current needs of the game, and therfore should blame themselves for poor foresight, and not the devs for poor game design.And they're working on further improving performance. And to top it all off, there are almost no game breaking bugs, just small nuanced visual glitches like hollow objects, fish stuck in odd rocks, ect. Very minor and easily ignored. No inventory wipes, no spawn glitches, no stat swings, or sudden drops in thirst or hunger, and the game will even try and warn you when a crash is about to happen, giving you precious time to save and restart to continue where you left off. So please, for gods sake, remember that every issue with this game is simply out of the devs control at the moment. Early access games are sometimes laggy, buggy, and with lower content than the finished versions. The fact that games spend time in this early stage is no ones fault. Just be sure you know what your buying when you buy it.BUY THIS GAME.[End of Game Review] EDIT:For those posting to the tune of ""Dont give this game a negative review if you want it to fly""  ect. When I wrote this review, I thought the way I could make the biggest impact is by writing directly to the wary buyers who might be looking at old, outdated, or non-game related complaints as justification not to support this game. And where better to write to them than here in the negative reviews? For those singing to the the other tune of ""Dont skew the stats"" ect. Doing simple math:As of 8/15/2015, there are 4,509 total reviews for Subnautica. This means that 1% of that is 45.09.(The equation is 4,509 x .01 = 45.09)  This means that AT LEAST 45 reviews would be needed to change the visible stats at all. So seeing as this review is 1/45th (0.02222) of what we would need to change anything for the devs, lay off. The added bonus of being seen far more often by the people who actually need to see it (Catious buyers) far outstrips the harm being done to this amazing game.  And to make this abundantly clear: THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY A NEGATIVE REVIEW.Further Edit:The date is now 11/18/15, and many many changes have come to subnautica since I origninally drafted this snarky attack on ignorant steam shoppers. While many of my comments ideas still stand, Subnautica no longer has only 2 hours of playable content. While I estimate first time runthrough at about 15 hours if you take your time, I dont know the official opinion on game depth. Ill leave it to you to read up on exactly what theyve pumped out this month, but I can garentee you will get your money back in playable value. (Seamoth update is hype)Further optimization, and the game crashes even less now... ECT ECT.The game is still going strong in every regard. 10/10, would leave negative review again.EDIT:3/23/2016In the name of fair play, I will have to now throw a warning to the wind. For some, my assesment of graphical stability is now overly optimistic. Ocassional drops in FPS do occur.  The recent geeneral visual upgrades means the game performance was somewhat impacted. While its nowhere near gamebreaking, some people may have more trouble on minimum graphics than others. It should be noted that this happened as a result of a MASSIVE shader and water texture overhaul, so its to be expected. This is by no means a case of Dev neglect. Careful review of minimum system requirements and common sense should avoid any major issues. Game is totally playable. Devs are working on a fix ASAP! All my other comments stand 100% to this day.EDIT 5/19/2016:I am happy to say all performance realted issues are solved despite all the graphics improving in texture, vibrancy, and depth. New balancing changes and model updates, MORE CONTENT!EDIT: 06/08/2016Now with Nopesquids! Ft. Battery-Rechargers and beds. This sounds lame, but its actually a way bigger deal than you would ever suspect. New models for solar power!Sea dragon / huge creature update on the horizon!10/10 Would never leave shallow reef again.EDIT: 09/19/2016Development has taken off. Lava lizard, Sea Dragon, and Lava Larvae are now functionally in the game. Additoinal assets of the precursors have been added, along with the completed PRAWN suit update. And lastly, dont forget about expanded Aurora compartments and data pads to check out, adding volumes to the implimented story. Incoming are sea emporer and the finishing touches to the Lost River biome. But really what is most important right now is that we can now quit to the main menu, thank god.			"

Early Access Review
								As of build from 14th Dec. 2014:Subnautica is a survival game. And even though the genre itself is quite oversaturated by now, Unknown Worlds take on it is unique enough to capture your attention.We already know how to survive zombie outbreak and even apocalyps. But what about surviving crash in the middle of the ocean?Gather materials to allow you to dive deeper, to fight with sea monsters, to get better gear and build your underwater safe-heaven (that part is not in the game yet, but already has been talked about).Sounds easy and maybe a bit boring, but it's pretty damn awesome, especially considering colorful underwater environments.Aside from the setting, the game is pretty much your traditional survival game, which is not a bad thing because you know exactly what to expect from it.You can as well play it with Oculus Rift (although it's not officially supported yet).Oh, did I already mentioned that this game has the most open development approach I'd seen in Early Access? Yeah, it does - up to commit messages. Kudos to Unknown Worlds, it's pretty fantastic way to develop Early Access title!On the not-so-good side of the game are:1. Little content at the moment. Gathering and building everything you can takes about 1 hour, after that you are left to just swim around the ocean.2. No saves. Which means every time you restart, you will start from a scratch. But since 1), it's not really a big deal at the moment.3. Bugs. A lot of bugs. Although, mostly they seem to be related to physics and wonky behaviour of objects.So, to sum all that up:Very promising.Still very raw.Little of content at the moment.If you want more gameplay, I'd recommend waiting a few months.If you want to join the dev process and help the devs make a better game - jump in. It's very good.More detailed look in the video:

Early Access Review
								After playing so many ""bad"" (under-developed or abandoned) early-access titles I wanted to share my experience with Subnautica.I've played some and watched many LPs of games like WarZ, The Forest , Stranded Deep... the list goes on. They aren't technically bad, but most of them lack... I don't know, it's hard to describe... ""soul"". None of them are bad, not at all. But some may have a good base going for them, but they don't really expand on it and it gets stale after a very short time.This is of course to be expected, as it is early-access. But we all have those games. They looked pretty at first, but then the devs dropped the ball for one reason or another. And you're stuck with an forever ""meh""-game that may have become something really cool. And we all know that sometimes that was the play from the beginning of some black sheep devs.But this time, in terms of games like Subnautica, you can actually see how invested the devs are. They opened up their working list (I think its called Trello) and even have a neat bug report feature in the game. They are quite talky over Twitter and stuff as well, but it doesn't feel... marketing-ish - if you know what I mean.The game looks (to me) gorgeous, has good sound design and kept (and keeps) me playing a long time, as this feeling of the ""mysterious unknown"" doesn't fade so fast as in many other games (for me this happened in The Forest really quickly). I don't even want to go too deeply into the details of the game (you can watch videos to get an idea).What I really want to highlight is that this game practically restored my faith in early-access at a whole!Before that game I had pretty much had given up on early-access (EA? nah, that sounds bad :] ) as I bought so much garbage that got tossed by the devs in early stages. This game, this dev team is different and deserves more attention.TL;DR; --> We should keep looking for that yet unpolished diamonds in the piles of **** that stacks up under the early-access banner. Because they are out there... and we just have to find them, and support that companies and devs that care! I found my diamond for the next weeks and hope so much that I'll find more in the future.Over and out.If you want to see some moving pictures, check this playlist or start with this video:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN1yhsZCLKqPqhEM1BVmlDi49rcunzHUI

								I have played a few hours on this game and for a game still in development it is oustanding! The game is absolutely beautiful and you, quite literally, have a whole ocean to explore and build in. The recent implimentation of the Cyclops submarine is quite amazing... you can even dock your small, one-man Seamoth sub inside it and you can customise the Cyclops with a few gadgets. Cool little feature: if you damage it too much the interior slowly starts to flood and you have a race against time to fix it before you run out of air. (Game within a game!)Invest in this game! It's far and few when it comes to finding a game that's doing this well so early. It's a procedurally generated, open-world, survival (optional), sandbox game. I can only imagine the amount of mods that will come out of this and I hope to see the opertunity for co-op gameplay sometime in the future. 9.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								Simply said, this is what Early Access should look like. An excellent foundation! Compelling and well defined gameplay already fully functional. The ambiance and environment is already lush and immersive. Exploration yields  some excellent vistas and ominous moments while in survival mode as you find ways to reach further into the depths. Of course there are bugs/glitches, it is early access after all. Unknown Worlds provides a means to report what you run into WHILE IN THE GAME! The amount of development information that they allow players to see is astounding also. It seems almost unfettered access to what's going on almost daily at the studio. The dev team is very accesible and approachable. Easy to find in the forums where constructive discussions are taking place. With the upcoming release of the Cyclops submarine and some of the other things on the horizon, I highly recommend giving this title a look. If early access is here to stay, players need to support the titles and teams that are doing it right on all levels and that certainly seems to be the case here. I'm having a ton of fun already with a minimal amount of  inconvenience from any kind of game breaking bugs thus far. If you're looking for survival gameplay in a well crafted and novel environment (without those pesky zombies) and what appears to be a ton of features in various stages of development already in the pipline, you should really consider taking this game for a swim.

Early Access Review
								Ahhh... SubanuticaSuch an amazing game. Subnautica is the kind of game that you might play late at night just because. Subnautica creates at atmosphere that no other game has ever made. It's such an amazing, immersive experience. I don't want to spoil anything, so I will put it this way. The game starts small and with a bang. Eventually you (literally) go deeper and get even more immersed. In this game, you never feel truly powerful against the massive hostile fauna that want to eat you, rather you feel less vunerable as you get better tools and submarines. Exploring the vast and diverse biomes the game has to offer starts with whimsical child-like wonder that quickly turns into a feeling that you are being watched or stalked at the deeper biomes OR the feeling of awe looking at the beautifully ecologically diverse Grand Reef or Fungal Forest. There are many minor glitches in this game, but that is to be expected from something in alpha. On that point, the game feels incredibly complete for something that technically isn't. This game is constantly being updated with new biomes, monsters, tools and vehicles. The development roadmap also lists co-op as being in progress, as well as an ending to the game. If you love the lore aspects of games, this is also for you. Subnautica has a huge and interesting story behind it that only inquisitive players can uncover.If you have a steam card in hand or are lookng for a great atmospheric survival game then this is CERTAINLY worth your money!

								Let's get the obvious out of the way, this game unbelievably beautiful and super atmospheric.Even if the game looks pretty it's at the same time really scary.You can go really deep underwater where everything is super dark, and a lot of things want to murder you there.There is crafting in the game, you can find resources all over the ocean to create like little submarines, knives, lights and allot more.You do also have hunger and thirst, so you'll have to find fishes you can eat to survive.Now the game is still in alpha and there isn't to much to do at the moment, but I'm definitely going to keep an eye out for this game, looks like it has a lot of potential.

								I feel this game would best be reviewed in a Q&A/FAQ format:Q: What is Subnautica?A: Subnautica is a deep-sea simulation game where you've crash-landed on an alien planet, and you can explore the ocean and build vehicles and items to help you survive.Q: Is that it?A: Yup, the story isn't in place yet.  There will be a story, however.  The gist is you're sent to this planet to terraform it, but your ship blows up for some reason.  From there it's currently a mystery.Q: So what is there to do?A: Swim around, build new ships, observe alien life forms, explore underwater cave systemsQ: Is this game polished enough, with enough content, to justify spending $20?A: No, but the developers have an ""experimental build"" system, so you can actually watch the game evolve HOURLY.  If that's what you like about Early Access, then I wholeheartedly recommend you purchase the gameQ: Can the developers be trusted to finish the game?A: Yes.  Unknown Worlds' first retail game (Natural Selection 2, which I was an alpha tester of) was updated much the same way as Subnautica.  Except UKW earned enough from the sale of NS2 that their team is larger, and thus updates are much more frequent, as well as packed with more content.Q: How much do the developers communicate with their community?A: Their CM, Hugh Jeremy, is one of the best that I've ever seen.  He responds quickly and politely every time I've needed to speak to the team.  In addition, other members of their team browse their official forums and regularly post there to answer questions.  By far, one of the most well-communicated communities I've ever seen.I would recommend this game to people who like exploration games and to watch early access games evolve and change.			"

								Fun and beautiful, but for me it did get a bit boring after a while. Still would recommend this if you like the ocean, alien creatures or gathering resources and building your own base.Lots of different biomes and fauna.			"

								I enjoy exploring the ocean and have finally built myself a seamoth so I don't have to swim everywhere. Scary getting out to the deep dark water instead of around the pretty reefy area I habitate.  Have started constructing my underwater base and discovered bigger is not best.  I look forward to new developments, I'm just doing the update for the new features.			"

								I love this game. It´s clearly not finished yet but the developers are interacting with the community a lot to improve their game. Even if the game seems to be a rather peacful, maybe even meditating experience it will suprise you to find the true value of this game in it´s synergy of beautiful views under the surface of the ocean and the horrors of the dept of the sea. It may not seem like a horror game but after playing some hours my heartbeat still goes up when I see a deep cliff or explore something new.All in all the game is wonderful with a great atmosphere sound and graphic wise. If you can handle some bugs and are interested in building bases and exploring a colorful and horrifying world this game is just for you.			"

								For all Fans of FarSky:This is the game you should aim for!- It is more beautiful than FarSky.- It will most definitely get a lot of content which is similar to FarSky, and even expand on what FarSky had to offer.- It gets updated daily (if you activate the experimental branch).- You can vote on what you want to have in the game: https://trello.com/b/WEDPjhjg/subnautica-feature-vote- It is not just one person developing it :PEven though right now the game is in a very early alpha state, I regularly get the urge to dive into the game, because every game is different and it just looks so real and beautiful!Buy it and support the development of it :)			"

Early Access Review
								DISCLAIMER: There's a specific issue (or multiple issues) with this game that might not apply to everyone, both technically or in experience, so hear me out...First of all, I LOVE this game. I had been following it since like 2014 through YouTubers to see where it would go, and at the start of 2017 I finally decided that it was developed enough to put money down for it and jump aboard (the Aurora).Within about two months I played through two save-games, I believe about a full day of time each, and apart from some technical issues (such as performance and a bunch of crashes, which did become less even within the month or two of playing), I had a good time. - This game became the new main game to me to just roam around in, like a game such as Minecraft allowed to do.I'm not going to comment much further on what the game in general is like, because I agree with the general consensus; It's unique, it has an interesting world, it's a mix of some fun and some challenge, it's also atmospheric and creepy, it has impressive sound, and so on and so forth. Though, I'll add more about problems with the gameplay-side of things at the end.On to the problem(s); Both for me and a lot of other people it seems to break really inconsistently. By that I mean that I see so many complaints about technical problems that are extremely specific and abundant. Lots of different situations for lots of different people, which unfortunately is worse than if most of these people were having the same (type of) problem.Take my game for instance; It suddenly stopped wanting to launch at all. I hit ""play"", the drive rattles for 10 seconds, the executable only shows up for 1-2 seconds, then it goes quiet and the game just refuses to launch completely. I didn't change anything between that and the previous time it DID launch, verifying the files didn't help either, so out of nowhere it just became a dead game sitting on my drive. Thát while it launched without fail for many times during two months.This game has such random technical issues that it's really difficult to approve of and also recommend to anyone.I would LOVE to be able to just recommend it to anyone, but the risk that I would recommend something that won't even work properly for them is too high, and that would just be disappointing and embarrassing.Now, the even bigger problem is that they claim to officially launch the game in like May. But to be honest, this game looks about a year away from being finished, both on a technical level and on a gameplay-level.Because that's another thing; While there's quite a lot to explore in its world, once you've gone through the motions of finding everything there doesn't seem to be a pay-off. And sure, there is  a plan for an end-game of which we already know roughly what it's going to be, but that sounds almost as anti-climactic as what ""One Man's Lie"" threw into people's faces.Then again, to be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if the developers had a more secretive surprise up their sleeves, because they do seem to be passionate about this game, don't get me wrong.But really, if this (and perhaps two updates from now) is supposed to be ""all"" (without meaning to sound spoiled or entitled), it would leave a lot to be desired, because then it would really be at this generation's level of videogame-standards in terms of gameplay, which is horrible.I mean, what is the game supposed to be then? You crash on a planet, you gather, you explore (you already know the way after the first playthrough), you get to know some vague story, you avoid being killed by sea-creatures and other death-poisoning, you escape the planet, and do that over and over? - There needs to be more to it, because even though there is surprising variety, it's also just a lot of going through the motions of going from point A to point B and once you find whatever thing you're supposed to find it's like ""OK... I have that thing. Now what?""... Well, on to the next thing. - And they're not really significant objectives or all that challenging to get either.For the most part your fighting suffocation and starvation, and just not getting in the way of creatures. Which is not a bad constant to have, but bigger challenges or threats are too rare and it's just not dynamic enough to form good gameplay. It just stays a bit tame and dull for the most part.So they need to spruce up the gameplay before they could call it a proper game, besides also ironing out both big and small technical issues.As for the game being released as a ""final"" within a matter of months; I do expect them to add a lot more FEATURES as well, because that also seems quite unfinished in the state it is now. - Who knows they might take a Summer-break from developing it, which they deserve. But if they don't go back to it and just make a bunch more gameplay/feature-updates and tweak the details of the experience, then it will likely never be a properly finished game.I'm optimistic, but at this time, even though this is one of those few games that's a lot more promising and developed than so many other successful ""Early Access"" titles that never went anywhere, it seems like they want to call it finished before it is. - That would be disappointing.EDIT: Apparently the final version's release-date has been pushed back by months and they will also do technical updates after that. - It seems they've realized they ran out of time, but it's good to know they're going to focus on the technical aspect more.Half of the people seeing my ""review"" can dislike or disagree all they want, but you can't get away from the truth.I will give this product a positive recommendation as soon as it magically starts working again like it magically stopped working.

								Let me just say that Subnautica is an absolutely gorgeous game, and one of the few games I've ever played that has instilled a true sense of awe in me as I've explored its world. It is a truly breathtaking experience at times, unlike anything I've ever played, and the crafting is satisfying and mostly logically laid out in its progression. The game is also frequently updated, and it's clear the developers truly love what they've created.HOWEVER, I cannot recommend the game in its current state. It runs fine for the first several hours, but after 10-12 hours it starts severely dropping framerates, regardless of your computer's power, and it frequently crashes. After 22 hours (over time, not in a row obviously) I'm left with wanting to play this game more, but I *can't* because the game crashes less than a minute into loading a save. This is after I've tried all the little tricks out there to fix the problems.I want to love this game, and once they improve the performance and fix the crashes I have no doubt it'll be one of my favorite games of all time, but right now I simply cannot tell you to spend your money on it. Wait on it for a while, read recent reviews, and pick it up when the issues have been fixed. I will amend my review when, and if, those problems are taken care of.Edit: I'm running this on a brand new GTX 1060, so there's no lack of power here. Stop making excuses for terrible performance issues.			"

								This game is still in it's infancy, yet it's magical. Diving in the game is simply a marvelous experience, and the immersion is complete. Despite being in Alpha, it is extremely smooth and feels like a game that has been through beta already. I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested or new to the voxel genre, and for anyone who might just want a relaxing game to play. In all consideration, judging it from what it is - a game in alpha, I have to give this 10/10 for it's immersion factor and ease of play.			"

								Ahh, Subnautica. This game is very refreshing and feels new. This is what I've been looking for. The game explained: Subnautica is a game of where you are a crashed pilot on an alien-type planet. The only thing that you have is the ocean. You are challenged to survive and build, which is a must-have for this game. The Pros Amazing graphics - If you have the right GPU.Refreshing - No other games currently like this, and it is performing it's idea greatly.The Devs - Development on this game has been fantastic and it contiunes to go smooth.And a whole lot more. The Cons No game is perfect, and since this is an Early Access game it is expected to see cons.Long loading - Look, I understand it takes alot to set everything in place and make sure your system is ready, but I feel as if it takes too long. I've even lost interest in playing because I get sidetracked. Some bugs - I'm not going to start whining about this but of course there always are bugs. For instance, when you hit a certain fish with the knife it teleports away.Little to no options - Look, we need more options for customization in the main menu and in game.Can be demanding for low-end users - If you do not have the best hardware, you may be in trouble. It's a very demanding game so it will use alot of GPU and CPU. The Conclusion  Do I reccomend this game? Yes. Even for it's flaws every update adds something new and fixes issues. This is what Early Access should be like in other games.			"

								I don't have a lot of time to write this review so it's going to be pretty basic. I did feel compelled to write it though because this game has surpassed any of my expectations I had for it including graphical, gameplay, longevity etc.Graphics are convincing and I'm hard to please, the reeds sway beautifully in the currents, the sun breaks through the surface of the water and casts light rays over the alien reef and makes me feel almost scared of the sheer scale of things. I desperately want to explore but I'm worried to go too far from my pod at the moment. I do know that the longer ranges of exploration will come with time invested in the game and it encourages me to go a little further with each dive, just to see what I can find.  Without rambling on too much I'll just finish off with this fact. I had said to myself that I wouldn't invest in any more early access games after feeling let down by previous devs. This game has rekindled my faith in the system, or at least made me feel that not all devs are out for a quick buck. This game has trully impressed me so far and I'd highly recommend it to anyone no matter what your usual genre is. I can't wait to see what comes next.			"

								While Subnautica is a really interesting game with a lot of cool adventure, danger, and creativity in mind, and I really wish I could play it more, it lacks too much in performance. After playing for about 10 hours in a single world, lag spikes become rampant regardless of PC specs due to the way the world-loading is programmed. After doing some forum searching I've noticed that these performance issues have been around for over a year now, without any visible efforts to fix them in recent updates. I would not recommend this game until these issues are fixed, as it becomes virtually unplayable.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a review of the current state of the game (1/1/17, happy new year!). Early game is pretty well balanced, and it's super satisfying to explore and see all the alien wildlife for the first time. Build a base, find new things to research and build and upgrade, so that you can better explore. Mid to late game though, it can start to get frustrating for a few reasons. First, you have to do quite a bit of grinding to get the materials you need to build upgrades. While the gameplay is fun, grinding can get tedious.Second, the exploration can really feel like flying blind since there's no objective markers (aside from some initial escape pod signals early on) and no map. You either need to look around randomly for wrecks and other worthwhile landmarks, or cheat and look at a map online.Then, late game, even looking online won't help you if you get lost in really deep caves. If you're not thorough in marking your way, you may be trapped down in those caves, drown and lose your expensive equipment. Quite frustrating. All that said, overall I greatly enjoyed the majority of my playthrough so far, and I've experienced about all the current content. There's something super cool about starting out with nothing on an alien planet, and working your way up to building a seabase and giant submarine. I will likely revisit the game when it's content complete. I hope they work on some of the frustrating aspects between now and then.			"

								10/10 best underwater hamster cage simulator. Seriously it's some of the funnest part of the game adding on all this advanced technology and corridors, you can live in your own personal hamster cage filled with more and more stuff. The waters are filled mostly with creatures that want to eat you or swim right past you. Though there is one nitpick with the creatures, the brambles that shoot spikes are extremely annoying and you can't kill them. When you're building outside and they shoot at you, they also damage your base which is infuriating. Solution? Use the terraformer and put rock around them (not ON them, you form rocks on them and they'll shoot spikes through it, needs a patch IMO) and that should stop them from shooting at you. The only other nitpick is that the draw distance is horrible but hey can you blame them? It's underwater physics, plus it's early access. Cool little thing is you get an achievement for reporting glitches or bugs that break the game. If there are some really annoying things about the game it's this: Moving items is an absolute bore and pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ if you deconstruct ANYTHING that holds items (lockers, storage units, things like that), those items won't be there when you reconstruct them, so don't save after deconstructing something unless it's empty. Also one last thing, there's no efficient way to power the cyclops except putting 4 crappy looking solor panels on it, If you want to completely recharge the cyclops, you need 6 power cells, That's too many and takes up way too many materials. Every other power source (bioreactor, transfer rod or whatever that diamond rod is) weighs it down. There needs to be a way to dock the Cyclops or power it. Other than that, really fun game			"

								I must say this game is certainly getting better with each update! Certainly a great title! and fun with ever growing things to explore and do!.. But i really want them to add Co-op so i can play with another person or a friend or 2.. Just read this recently thought i might add this as it may answer the question to a lot of people who wants multiplayer...Adding multiplayer support to Subnautica is something we would love to do. In fact, the game was originally conceived of as a co-op experience. However, as we started to develop the game, we skipped multiplayer to be able to release the game faster.Now we find ourselves in a difficult situation: we all really want co-op player, but adding it would take us many months of work. We almost have to start over from the beginning, as it affects everything. If our small team decided to add multiplayer right now, we probably wouldn’t be able to improve any other aspect of the game for a very long time.So we’re not sure what we’re going to do, but we’re not working on multiplayer right now. The most important thing is to make sure the exploration, crafting and creature experience is working well. Maybe before v1.0 we’ll figure out a way to hire another team to help us with networking, or maybe we’ll release a new version of the game later that supports co-op (like Klei did with “Don’t Starve Together”).”That’s Subnautica multiplayer as it stands today. If the team consensus moves, we will keep you updated. We have to be honest about this: “we’re not working on multiplayer right now” means there is zero, nada, zilch, absolutely no possibility of multiplayer any time in the short or medium term.			"

If our small team decided to add multiplayer right now, we probably wouldn’t be able to improve any other aspect of the game for a very long time.So we’re not sure what we’re going to do, but we’re not working on multiplayer right now. The most important thing is to make sure the exploration, crafting and creature experience is working well. Maybe before v1.0 we’ll figure out a way to hire another team to help us with networking, or maybe we’ll release a new version of the game later that supports co-op (like Klei did with “Don’t Starve Together”).”That’s Subnautica multiplayer as it stands today. If the team consensus moves, we will keep you updated. We have to be honest about this: “we’re not working on multiplayer right now” means there is zero, nada, zilch, absolutely no possibility of multiplayer any time in the short or medium term.			"

								I wasn't sure about Subnautica at first, but im really happy with it. I had bought it for myself, and my husband totally took over, I have watched him play quite a bit, I had no idea you could do so much with it, from crafting an underwater living area, making subs and different ways to get around, and fixing and repairing and adventuring, and there's even a storyline you can follow :D It is all so peaceful at times, the sound of the ocean and sea creatures is very relaxing. There so much more to the game, I have left out a lot, but we are happy with it. Yes I would recommend this game! "

								This game is in early access and developers made a fine job so far, there is just so much potential in this game to be seen.- although there are bugs, they will probably get fixed,- there's a big open world which will probably expand even more,- good graphics, might get better,- story isn't really in the game yet (other than ship crashing on a strange planet and a man stranded on it) but storyline will definitely be introduced in future,- lots of wildlife, more in development- only 3 vehicles at the moment but can't wait to see more of them- cool base building system, maybe expanded in futureFrom my personal experience the game gets a bit boring after you played it for a while because there isn't much things to do, YET! The game is in early access as I said so its not really ment to be played yet, because is not even nearly finished, it might take years for release, who knows.Also 1 more thing: Multiplayer/Co-op is definetly coming, although I am not going to talk about that, because I have no idea how would that work considering current gameplay.

								Most early-access games are developed at a snail's pace, but Subnautica is moving along so quickly that I've had to rewrite this review 3 times now because it became irrelevant.This game's basic concept is scuba diving on an alien world, and if that doesn't sound cool to you I don't know what will. When I first got the game there wasn't much to do but swim around and look at all the pretty colors, but since then they've added sea bases, a gigantic submarine, half a dozen new biomes, a completely revamped crafting system, a terraformer that lets you change the terrain as you please, the list goes on. There is no danger of this game being stuck in developement hell like so many other early-access titles. If anything I just mentioned sounds remotely interesting to you, you owe it to yourself to get this game. It's not finished yet but it's already worth the price of admission, and is only going to get better as time passes.			"

								Okay I play a lot of early access games and I got to say this one takes the cake! I mean visually this game is one hell of a gem! the designs on the landscape and various creatures are rather impressive and the game mechanics are pretty simple to figure out. I admit it could use some more explaining in the begining of the game, at first I was confused as to where you find certain resources and what to actually do. but after a bit you'll find it pretty easy to figure out. So I suggest you buy this game and try it out! you won't regret it ^w^			"

								I already have a healthy fear of the ocean, don't like being in the water with no land in sight. Had to quit the game after about 30 mins because I could almost feel myself hyperventilating because of the endless ocean and being in it. Not even sure why I purchased this game, maybe it was the review scores, being on special or the fact that I've got plenty of open world survival/exploration games. This is different though, its not space, it's not post apocalyptic, it's water, plenty of it! It's appealing because it's not what I would normally play in the endless pile of games that I have based on space, war, dragons, zombies and zombiedragons. So I got something different and something terrifying to me and I'm SUPER impressed!I plan on playing a lot more of this game and look forward to the ongoing development!			"

Its massive world, unique and amazing aquatic life, base building, and outstanding  ambient noises (such as reefbacks) make this game a definite buy! I'm always excited to see what Unknown Worlds add to the game next! An easy 9/10 rating for me personally! Only issue I am having is occasional frame drops from 135 to about 10 in certain areas.			"

								Subnautica pros and cons Pros: Amazing graphics, an amazing amount of npcs for early access, this game also provides  a good amount of crafting items that range from useful to useless. and easy for beginners to crafting/survival games. Cons: Due to the graphics you will require a powerful computer for the best game play, most npcs are useless and there is only 1 tool that can truly kill a npc that can damage you, and the worst flaw is the frame rate is random and glitched so bad it can cause you to die in a bad frame rate mostly from drowning.So all in all its a great early access game but it still needs a lot of work to become a master piece.

								Don't get me wrong, i love this game to absolute death, it is one of the better survival games i have played in a while (and you should buy it aswell if you already haven't).However, this game has two fatal ♥♥♥♥ing flaws.1. Framerate drop: Whenever i try to go through areas, sometimes the textures haven't been loaded in yet, and when they do, the game goes from 130 frames down to ♥♥♥♥ing 10-50. And in some cases the game stops completely.2. Constant Crashes: Subnautica has crashed over 20 times during my 18+ hours of gameplay, this is related to the first problem, the framerate slows down to a grinding halt, and then the game tells me that it has crashed.Conclusion: it is an incredibly good game, but these two flaws will have to be fixed for me to fully enjoy the gaming experience.And no, i have a pretty good rig, so that is not the problem.

								How have I not reviewed this yet?I don't do long reviews. I like just posting what I like, unless its a terrible game.This game is amazing so far. The development team has not abandoned this game, and probably won't. I can almost guarentee this game is going to get out of Early Access. Its fun, theres quite a lot to do, tons to explore.If you are looking for a game where you kill everything, this is NOT your game. This is a (mostly) pacifist game, where you are trying to coexist with the environment. There are some weapons you can use for self defence. But purposely going out to kill things is not worth the trouble, and not very fun.This is a building/exploring/surviving game. The story isnt fully there, but they have a really awesome story writer for it. I do recommend this game to anyone that likes survival games, or anyone that enjoys swimming.			"

								I tend to dislike any game with a strong resource gathering / crafting element. They bore the pants off me. Hard to explain then why, with limited time to game these days, I've just sunk 40 hours into this and haven't regretted one of them.  Really, Really enjoyed it.Perhaps it's the novelty of the underwater setting. Perhaps it's the real OMFG tension of exploring and hearing or seeing a new creature, with no idea if that means I'm about to have dinner, or be dinner, or see my Seamoth mini sub torn to pieces. Again. And the views! I find myself stopping and gazing in newly discovered areas just to take it all in. In fact I do the same in areas I've been to or passed through many times before.Just a tip - not a spoiler -   for when you're a few hours into the game.  You're seamoth mini sub can be upgraded, and doing so allows you to go further and deeper to properly explore the map. Before I realised that I thought the bulk of the map was just bottomless water.And whilst discovering things yourself is fun, don't be afraid to hit the wiki or Google if you're confused about something. It's not always obvious what the possibilities are in this game.			"

								Subnautica is not only unique among survival games by virtue of its underwater setting, it's also unique in that it's the only one of these EA indie survival games that I actually enjoy. The setting is beautiful, the mechanics are solid, crafting is just complicated enough but not overwhelming, hunger is balanced...in short, this is a really good game. When you dive down, there is legitimate tension; I often realized that I was unconsciously holding my breath during my dives. And yet, it's not a horror game. It's not particularly difficult. It's just one of those games that pull you in, yet triggers some deep fear, far at the back of our animal brain.Unfortunately, performance needs to be worked on. It runs ok on my system (60fps), but there is plenty of room for improvement to remove small hangs and jitters. Some animations are janky and buggy. Loading a saved game triggers a million messages as all of the game systems initialize. But this is still early access and the game is absolutely worth playing in its current state.edit: typo			"

								I gave ""Farsky"" a lot of praise in my review, and why not? There's just not a whole lot of games out there that feature underwater exploration in an open-world sandbox environment. Like ""Farsky"", the game puts you in the shoes of someone who has wrecked at sea (this time it's a spaceship, not a submarine) and is tasked with surviving. While both games have multiple ways of killing you, ""Subnautica"" features quite a bit more in terms of crafting recipes, including the need to drink filtered or disinfected water. The crafting system is fantastic in that it gives you all the recipes and tells you what you'll need in order to make them..in other words, very user-friendly.  There are also a few different vehicles too! I honestly can't wait to see what else will be added to the game as it continues to develop.  Be warned however...at the moment, the save feature doesn't appear to be working.

Early Access Review
								This is a (Very) Early Access Review.There's not a lot of gameplay variance here yet, but I'm surprised by how much I like what's in Subnautica already.The game's premise is that your starship's escape pod has crash-landed on an alien water-world, and you have to survive (and hopefully thrive) from moment one of play.It appeals to my love of builder/management games, and the first-person perspective really heightens the feeling of ""you are here"". Immersion (no water puns intended) feels surprisingly strong when I play.I also like that the ""survival"" aspect of the game doesn't mean ""OMG! The entire game is trying to screw you over from second one. Good luck, chump!"" as in so many so-called ""survival"" games; it means what you expect -- you're marooned in an alien environment, and you have to survive.You can play Subnautica with the survival aspects (the need for edible food and potable water) turned off, and just tour around, but at this early stage, the game loses its primary focus, and inherent drama, without the struggle, and you may get bored without these things. Also, the developers did just added a savegame feature,  so you don't have to start from scratch if your survival doesn't go well.In addition, there's  a Subnautica Wiki out on the `net already, if something stumps you (for example, I had to look up how to acquire a ""Membrane"" in order to create filtered drinking water).And I'd be remiss not to mention that the undersea world looks beautiful. The graphics and the environment design are impressive, even at this early stage. Again, I feel like I'm actually there, under the waters of an alien sea.As of this writing, Subnautica's gameplay is limited to basic survival tasks, but I already dabble with the game more than I ever expected I would. It's like a quick vacation to an alien world.If all this sounds like something you would like, and you can handle the fact that this is a work-in-progress Alpha test game with cool, but limited, gameplay at this point, then I recommend Subnautica wholeheartedly.

								Changed from a Exploration-Survival Game into a Action-Survival Game.When the game launched you had this amazing underwater world where you could explore the world, find aggresive and passive animals and could build your own base.Now almost everything attacks you on sight without any reason and you have no way to fight back. The fun in exploring the world was patched out.			"

								One of the best survival games I have played. The game itself is just.. amazing. But the performance is just pure horror. Screen freezes, swapping from 60 to 1 fps every 5 seconds. Once progressing in the game it crashes and shuts down every few minutes. Myself I'm completely unable to play the game anymore due to the game crashing within 5 seconds after starting it. According to forums the game isn't optimized yet. Although it's not expensive, I wouldn't recommend purchasing until this is fixed. Will update review once fixed.			"

Day one: I survived from crash and had to take out the fire. Luckily lifepod had extinguisher. If it hadn't, then the fire would've spread me alive. Oh well...the communication relay has been busted. Looks like I'm going to repair it, but I don't have tools with me after I took lifepode 5 to escapse from Aurora. I don't know where am I and have to find this out where am I. Ocean....no island and nothing. Just Aurora. Sadly....this is what it looks like. Survived by crash, but it is badly. I guess I have to go in there and get some....oh well whatever they got it in there. Looks like I can't go in there due with radiation. Let's hope it's not mini nuke. If not, then it may be bigger. Let's see what lifepod 5 have....a scanner, three rations, three drinking provisions, one emergency medkit, a flashlight, an emergency fire. This might've come in handy. Let's think of food and water. There's no pointing to waste it, but to save it until last day. Looks like I have to gather for resources whatever I have to survive without having worry. Day 2: If anyone would read this, then I may never survive this...... Or perhaps I have to survive longer than anyone does. Ok let's check...... titanium.....check. Quartz....check. Acid mushrooms....check and copper ore...check. Looks like I have my list to make tools or equipments. Never judge with my cover. I used to be Aurora engineer this before. Lucky me, I can make everything as I could. I have to hold my hunger because I ate one ration. Now I have two rations left and three waters left even if I'm tired. Let's see....I have to start to work on this.Ok...I crafted welder and I may be able to repair communication relay. Let's get started for no- SH!T WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!?! I heard there was some huge explosion. Good god...it sure is louder than this before. My ears are still ringing. I guess I have to check this out. Oh well...looks like she blew up pretty bad. Let's hope the foods will be ok after it blows up. Looks like I have to get back to work on communication relay. YES! IT WORKS! IT'S ALIVE! IT'S ALIIIIIIIIIIIVE! Hahaha I used to watched old movie because I used to love the quotes from doctor. Let's hear this out if anyone is out in there. Just like me. Welp! I have good news and bad news. I would prefer good one; someone did survived from lifepod 17, but the problem is...I don't have co-ordinate from 17. Looking for 17 would waste my time. And bad? The distress signal has been sent out. Guess what? They'll arrive 9999 hours. This meant I have 416.625 days. No wait....27.39452 years to go. ! I should've never join Auraro! I should've never! I'm crying....I know I won't survive about 27 years to go. But knowing there should be someone out in there. Perhaps there should be more lifepods in there. I missed Half-life 5. I expect they will release in few more years to go.Day 5: Lookie here! I'm alive and well. I build my small base, not too far from my lifepod 5 and Aurora. Don't worry, I'm not hungry as well and I cooked some fishes before checking. I managed to build well. I do plan to build my base bigger soon. I have to build radiation suit right now.Oh boy...I haven't test it yet. Looks like I have to go to Aurora and collect some things. Oh right, I have to fix the radiation leak so that it won't effect me.Sh!t! Sh!t! Sh!t! I'm back at my base and heard some huge growl. *shudder* Looks like, I won't go in there to become food. Now I'm sitting here, crying on the floor.YES! I created a.....BALL! This leaves me to draw on the face. I name him.....Wilson! I know it's weird for having my ball in here. I think of him as partner. He would never leave my side.I I've got alot of things to work on. Day ???? : You remember that one that I did tell you about a boogeyman in Aurora? Now it's sitting on front of my base. Guess what? I'm screwed. As long as Wilson is here on my side. I'm not being afriad in here....Wilson is on my side. He never leave on my side......			"

								I have only played for a very few minutes, however, this game has me excited like no other has in a long time. The game itself still obviously needs work, but what is here in Early Access is very well refined and polished. All systems in game seem to work and work quite well so far. It is already very well optimized and looks very nice. If you are interested in crafting/survival games, this is one I can fully recommend!			"

								I Love Subnautica, But call me a baby, I almost can't progress because of my terrible fear of those reaper levithan bullies. Its more that im afraid they'll break my stuff and set me back but there overall look is disturbing.I start up a game I get annoyed with the fact that im slow and go out venturing for food and technology! after much exploration I find and craft myself a seaglide and... hey whats that ship in the distance I ask myself. Of course I had no idea of the threat that lurked there. I went over with my tiny seaglide feeling a bit too confident, once I get there I go along the bay of the aroura searching for things. I find some scanables and some rations but eventually I wonder, ""How do I get in?"" So me as the oblivous idiot I am swam around the side I find an opening and swim out looking at the deep sea below me. And then one of the most tramatizing moments of my time in this game was seeing that HUGE tail in the distance, the dead eyes, the red mandibles. I noped right on out. but once I found the real submarine (Cyclops) I just stared at them in awe as they couldn't hurt me. I love this game but it is terrifying and I haven't even seen the sea dragon leviathen			"

And it is an interesting biological fact that all of us have in our veins the exact same percentage of salt in our blood that exists in the ocean, and, therefore, we have salt in our blood, in our sweat, in our tears. We are tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea - whether it is to sail or to watch it - we are going back from whence we came.""- John F. Kennedy			"

								Basically it’s a survival game, where you have to collect materials and food to survive and create equipment and such, same as any survival game, but this one is done underwater, the graphics and sound are really nice and well done, responsive controls, and nice easy to use crafting menu, the problem with this game and with most survival games, is that the requirement for food and water are very taxing, at least with the short time I played this game, you need to spend most of your time preparing food and water to drink or food instead of spending your time exploring, mind you the game has a mode where you can explore without the need to eat or drink, but that’s not the point, in real world you can survive without food and water for a long time, why not in survival games. So I request from the developers to consider this, it would be much more fun, other than this, although it’s an early access, it’s worth a try.			"

								I highly suggest you play this game with headphones, the ambiance in it is amazing. this game has many cool features, and one of my favourites is the base building. It's a happy cheerful place with many cool creatures to discover like the leviathan, but if you are daring enough to go deep sea diving then you will see a whole new side to this planet. I have a fear of the open sea with nothing to see under your feet (yes you can see your feet), and this game does that alot with depths reaching over 300m. I've only played a couple hours but I can't seem to find any game breaking bugs, unless of course you're in the experimental build. So if you're looking for a well made often updated exploration indie game, then you've found it.			"

								The best horror game on Steam!The sound effects will scare you silly, I suggest going to the toilet before playing to avoid any fear induced leakage. You will be happily potting along in your teeny one man submersible admiring all the cute little fishies, exploring the alien ocean oooohing and aaaaaahhhing at the spectacular visuals when before you know it, you've gone deep, or maybe not, but your somewhere and it's so dark you cant see anything apart from what your headlights reveal, but you can hear....something. It sounds big, and angry and very, very loud and you have no idea where it is!You spin your Seamoth submarine around to take a peek, nothing but darkness. Relieved, you turn back around and there it is! Right up in your face like some kind of jumpscare horror movie bs.The good news, if you needed to go to the toilet, you just saved yourself a trip. *Quick advice* Don't youtube the big monsters right away, its a fun and scary as heck discovery. Don't ruin that part of the game for yourself, it is one of the more memorable moments.In a more serious, but quick review, the game is great. It's still early access so bugs n' whatnot, but I get pumped for every update adding new goodies.Visually, the game looks great. The effects and lighting is really well done, from gigantic glowing mushrooms to luminescent cave dwelling spider things. The sound, heh, the sound is amazing. I really want to know what the dev team used for the Bone Sharks and the big R's. Also all the little sounds are well done, from Peepers leaping out of the water to your character splashing around, the audio person has really outdone him/herself and I believe the sound is what makes this game so immersive.The habitat building is fun, you can build some really cool looking undersea water bases (or above water if you want). There isn't a huge variety of things to build at the moment but more and more stuff is being added. Farming, pet keeping, gazing lovingly out the windows at the gorgeous coral reefs and running through your complex like a lunatic dealing with catastrophic breaches 600ft below sea level, trying to band aid the base and figure out what went wrong before it all fills with water and you drown. The first time you build a Cyclops - I was awed, I really wasn't expecting it to be so big. Overall I highly rate the game as being worth the buy. It's only getting better and better. And things are getting bigger, including the friendly....and not so friendly fishies. That are already enormous.			"

Overall Rating: 9/10Please note that time played is only about 1/3 of all time played on 3 copies my family owns. 1 on this toaster, owned by this account, 1 on XBox One, and 1 on my husband's account and housed on his much higher end rig. I play on all 3 copies, and we do not have multiple accounts on either rig, to keep Steam accounts seperate (to not overcrowd storage components and keep saves completely seperate... )Too many people buy an Early Access game, thinking it will never change, and are salty when it does. Read the Early Access disclaimer before you buy. I knew when I bought it that required specs may change, and my lower end rig may not be able to  play it someday. Currently,this is the case, so I play on my husband's rig on his account, and on the console. And I am still thouroughly enjoying this stunning game.Recent changes have taken some getting used to. Currently in Experimental branch, there are some truly significant changes. Anyone who claimed the game was ""too easy"" in the past (and who was playing without using the dev console cheat codes, may be needing to swallow their egos and eat their words. The challenges just got ramped up. And I am glad.  My only complaint is that the dev console is still being used by so many, giving false feedback to the developers. Hard to balance a game, when your ""testers"" (including many ""Official"" testers), are using the dev console to give themselves infinite health, water, food, oxygen and make themselves invincible.That said, I play without cheats, in Freedom and Survival modes. Hardcore mode does not appeal to me in this game, mainly because I am too easily distracted by the beautiful world UWE has created, and all they have given me to see and do. I am hopeful that the dev team's efforts to improve performance, and make the game playable on lower end rigs like this one will be successful, and I will be able to play on this toaster (and account) again soon. But, even if it never happens, and I can't play on this toaster, I will be upgrading my rig soon, and I will continue to play this gem of a game on it, my husband's account and rig, and on the XBone. And have already gotten more than my money's worth out of the purchases of all 3 copies.Time now to go play on the other account, and enjoy the new updates in Experimental. I may update this review at some point. I may not. But I will not change my recommendation to buy this game. And I will never regret buying it in the first place.			"

								Breathtaking game, no less.Subnautica is, in my eyes, one of the best early access titles you can grab atm. The game puts a twist on the regular survival game, forcing you to swim your way around a beautiful landscape going from shallow coral reefs to spooky dark depths, which may hold an unpleasant surprise. In the base ''Story Mode'' of the game, you play as a stranded crewman from the spaceship ''Aurora'', somewhere in a not-too-distant future. You start off in an escape pod with limited supplies & some diving gear; you choose what happens next.The gamplay is honestly amazing; you feel like you're in control of your character, and the immersion (in the game, not the water *silence* ok) is very pleasing. The game does suffer from some bugs such as weird noise in loading screens, sometimes loading your game but not letting you use item bar, general AI feels weird when it comes in contact with the cyclops, and the render distance could be pushed a bit. Alot of stuff has been fixed by the dev team, which is pretty active and somewhat transparent about where the developpement is at; props to devs like these. Other noteworthy thing would be the ability to choose between regular survival and ''freedom'', identical to the other survival mode except with no food/water bar for those who dislike that mechanic.Edit: This game is a prime example of how Early Access can be an amazing thing, they add content updates regularly and  publish posts explaining everything they added. Everytime there's an update, you have a reason to be excited because there's almost surely new content to play with, and without having to pay any more money.Nonetheless, this is an amazing title that will catter to fans of diving, but also to those (like me) who would be terrified to go diving in anything more than shallow waters.  I recommend it to any survival fan, as long as you don't mind spending most of your time swimming or simply being under water.			"

								Honestly, I really do love this game. I've played constantly in the past week or so after buying it earlier this year. So I started up a new survival game. Finally unlocked the Cyclops and, poof, my game now after maybe hardly 30 seconds of being loaded into the game crashes. I don't recall it doing this earlier this year...I don't know what the issue is because I have all the settings on its lowest possible option and I'm running on three year old hardware that was top of the line at that time. So I don't really think it has anything to do with my hardware's performance.tl;dr: Game crashes constantly after getting really far in the game and continues to crash.Please fix this, I really do enjoy this game. :(EDIT; 1/28/17Played the game again for a couple of hours and things went fine, thought the updates in these past couple of months fixed it. Low and behold roughly 6 hours in, it crashes after 5 seconds of me going back in-game. So sick of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.			"

Early Access Review
								Good solid game, needs full controller support for this type of game...I will give this game a thumbs up for now, as with all early access they are liable to ""take the money and run"".  My biggest problem so far is no controller and like most survival games someone thinks its fun to eat 70k in callories per day just to survive.  They have a no food option but thats not what I want either...I just dont want to focus all my day around eating, that gets boooooring and tedious.			"

Early Access Review
								This game was very good to start with, I got to about 25-30 hours in in a few days because it was so addictive discovering new things. Even now, at 40 hours I still have stuff to do! It was amazing when you get your first vehicle, then your second, then your third... getting you to new areas in the game every time. The gameplay changes with the level you're at. I rarely use my first vehicle anymore (even though it was very exciting when I first got it) and don't do much in the shallow waters. I don't bother with the stasis rifle or propulsion cannon. Most of my time now is spent upgrading my base and PRAWN or exploring deepsea.However, the bugs in this game are really getting annoying. I usually have to restart the game 3-5 times a session due to bugs. This is made worse by the stupidly long loading time when you start the game up. When I cruise around the ocean in a seamoth the game lags/buffers when loading the scenery. This is with a PC I can play Crysis 3 on maximum settings on. I've now turned settings to minimum to hope it can cope because it kills the enjoyment when almost everything you do causes the game to freeze... These past 2 days it has become unplayable, with me having to actually change what I do in game to try and avoid it crashing (hmm scanner room crashes the game, will go look for some Quartz on my own then, hmmm game crashes when I try to change the upgrades on my PRAWN suit). I actually CANNOT play this game right now due to the errors.I got about 30 hours of enjoyment before these problems became truly frustrating. Maybe this is because what I'm doing in the game now is more buggy than when I started, or maybe the game has more bugs in now than when I started.I would not recommend this game until the bugs are fixed.

Early Access Review
								Early Access games can be a big risk but Subnautica, for only its first day on Steam, delightfully did not disappoint.  GamerQuest purchased Subnautica as soon as it was released on Steam and then proceeded to stream the game on Twitch for 4 hours of non stop gamplay.  To our amazement the game proceeded to run the full 4 hours without any hiccups at all.  Since Subnautica is only in its very early stages of Alpha we were fully expecting to run into a fair share of bugs.  We also did not encounter a single bug during the entire 4 hour stream.  Honestly, that is pretty impressive for an Early Access title but most likely we just got lucky and chances are that we will encounter some bugs the next time we play. Frankly, everything from the graphic quality, stability and game mechanics, as well as the game optimization itself, were really quite impressive.  Credit here must go out to the entire Subnautica team who really have exceeded all expectations of what an Early Access game should be and hopefully it sets a new standard for other Early Access game developers to follow.  Undoubtedly, from everything that we experienced while playing the game, Subnautica looks to have some HUGE potential.  Development on the game seems to be in very good hands as the team working on Subnautica has already shown us a glimpse of just what they are capable of achieving.  The future seems to be very bright for Subnautica and the good news is that the journey has only just begun.Great job on the Early Access launch to the entire Subnautica team!			"

								In the games current state it runs above 60fps on my PC with the new RX 470 at minimum graphical settings. However, the game still had frame rate drops and stutter when moving between biomes.Don't get me wrong here, this is a great open world, sandbox and survival game. But in it's current state it's really unoptimised and hard to run on even a decent PC like mine. I can't reccomend it in it's current state untill the devs optimise this game a lot more. It crashed twice within a 10 minute timeframe once.If You are still really keen to explore an alien ocean like I was then go for it. However, be prepared to be amazed at the first 10+ hours of gameplay, and then watch in horror as the game crashes just because you entered a new biome. It seemed to crash less on reccomended settings for me personally.			"

								10/10.  I have always been fascinated by ocean environments.  Their beauty, and the many mysteries behind it all.  I first saw gameplay of this game on PBGgameplay on YouTube and since I wanted to play it.  Weeks later I finally acquired the game and played all night long.  The atmosphere, the crafting system, the environment all feel wonderful.  I love to explore the deep blue, seeing wonderful sights and the many biomes that this game has.  On another note, a game has never had me feeling scared like this one.  Whenever I explore I always have that feeling that I am being hunted down and I have no idea what to expect.  All in all, I highly recommend this game, it is beautiful, fun, eerie, and highly emerses you into it.			"

Early Access Review
								This is an open world surivival game. It is comparable to games like minecraft, but is very different. Your space ship crashes onto a water planet, and it seems, thus far that you are the only survivor. Luckily you managed to get onto an escape pod, and must now survive until, presumably, help arrives. This is an early access game, keep in mind, and is not finished yet. THE GAMEThe first thing you will see when you start a game in Subnautica, is your (very large) spaceship sinking in the distance. You start the game on your escape pod, which conviently has basic supplies for survival, but will not support you for very long. So you have to dive in the water, and basically, survive! There are three basic things that you need to take care of in order to live. Oxygen, food, and water. Keeping these things up is relatively easy once you get the hang of it. You will notice as you start to craft things to aid you in your survival, that there are many advanced doodads that won't really help you 'survive' more, but will actually make the game very fun. Crafting is an important part of the game, and I like it a lot more than minecraft. Altough at this time minecraft is a better game, because of things like multiplayer, as an early access game, it is very good. I'm a huge ocean geek, and the immersion in this game is top notch. You can see your mask on the edge of your screen, when you look down you can see your legs with your fins on and your arms helping you swim. The graphics are beautiful, and when you find a mushroom forest for the first time, you will be in awe. But there is also that feeling of uncertainty that you get when you are in your tiny submarine, going through open water, and when you look around, there is only that deep blue.. And it makes you wonder.. What is down there? Am I about to run into something? Speaking of subarines, you can construct a little one that when you eventually build the bigger one that can actually be a mobile base if you wish, you can actually dock the smaller one onto it, and is done very well. And both need power cells in order to function which deplete eventually! So if you want to leave your base behind and go on an expedition, you will need to plan ahead! That is what I love about the game, I actually wanted to explore what was around the corner, or that really deep cave that is rich with rare minerals, or go to that island that is very far in the distance.. There is no real end game. You can't beat it, but what keeps me going back is the immersion that you experience when you dive in the water, and I wish that I could play it with an Oculus! THE BADAs this game is early access there are a few things that can withdraw you from the experience. You will definitely run into a couple of bugs, but even if your hard work somehow becomes inacessible, you can actually spawn any object in the game so, it is very rare to lose anything. As far as gameplay goes, I do wish that there were a little bit more enemy types, but they are working on it. They release new things very often, and I can't wait to see the finnished product. "

But that can get change in future patches.Edit: I'm not sure if smoething was changed, but i find a lot more quartz.In the end it still good little game with a lot potential in a unique setting.			"

								I'm usually not a fan of Early Access games, but I'd highly reccomend getting Subnautica.As a Scuba Diver, this game really gets me at the core of why I dive: the beauty of nature, and exploration.This gorgeous and sometimes dangerous world is full of life and peculiar beauty, sounds and sights that send a shiver down your spine. The world is large and full of things to explore and try out, and with the consistent updates there's always something to come back to. Whether you want a place to relax as you explore the colorful shallows, listening to the sounds of nature.Or if you want the tense, dark, and dangerous deep-sea biomes.This game has it for you.And this game isn't just an idle exploration of a world, there's plenty to do. Gathering and scavenging resources in this game manages to walk to fine line between grinding and a cakewalk. You get to slowly evolve from the scared, slow diver surrounded by carnivorous fish, to the powerful, confident engineer walking the ocean floor in their exosuit.In my non-professional opinion...I absolutely reccomend this game.9.5/10			"

								There aren't too many games in this world that have no point but are still endlessly fascinating. Subnautica takes the cake on this one.This game is all about making cool vehicles and bases, to further allow yourself to dive into caves of absolute beauty. You collect, analyze, make, explore, and even fight big scary things that eat your face. I have never been so into one of these mindless farming games. This one doesnt get old, until you have literally everything. But that's not even a bad thing.The other thing that makes this one the best games in a long time, is the early access. The developers have a log, a to-do list, that's public. Oh yes. You can see what they are doing. http://subnautica.unknownworlds.com/#/subnautica/production-trackerWho does this? Literally no one. This is the first time I have ever seen something like this. I feel involved in the process. So pick this game up now, dive into the depths of a very pretty, well thought out, almost real sim game that you will lock yourself in your room for weeks playing.			"

								Don't let the colorful previews fool you. This game has some serious exploration and eerie/creepy/scary environments.

You will be busy for quite a while and will have a pretty good mental/exploration challenge to keep moving forward with uncovering the story.			"

You can explore various underwater biomes and scan the fish and creatures you will encounter, scan for new tools and builds to make, and eventually build your own base that can house you and the fish you will encounter in aquariums and containments. You will enjoy the stunning beauty of this game.(Watch out for eclipses, they usually come without warning!)			"

								Subnautica is a gripping, and enjoyable game. The developers have really pushed the boundaries of possibility to give there fans the most enjoyable gaming experience possible. The developers are very hard-working and listen to the fans, moulding the game based on their feedback which, I believe, is how every game should be made. Though it is still in early access, the game is already showing signs of prosperity, which I find very admirable of the developers.

								I initially did a bit of a gushing review, so I decided to write a more balanced one!!PROS:Very immersive and beautiful world to explore.Randomly generated, no world will be the same.Tonnes of content thus far, with more being developed all the time.No zombies. Seriously, not one.Leviathans.Extremely customisable bases and submarines; which you can even walk around in!CONS: (Bear in mind that this game is still very much in development, so ""cons"" probably isn't the correct term to use! XD)No ""story"" as such. Not a massive deal but can leave you wondering what to do.Framerate failures. Counter this by having small bases and not too much crafted stuff.Bugs for days. As expected, these will be sorted come v1.0.Leviathans. You'll see what I mean! ;)Can't put it simpler, this game rocks. Very, very hopeful for it for the future with shed loads more content and features planned by the devs.9/10.			"

								I picked up a signal from Lifepod 8, asking me to come and help the survivors out. I headed into the direction of the signal, leading me towards the destroyed remains of what once was the gigantic spaceship that went by the name of ""Aurora"". It's gigantic and my SeaGlide was taking quite a while to reach the signal. I watched as the amount of meters left before I reach the lifepod slowly decreased and I watched my surroundings change. Everything was perfectly fine. There was no noise, except a few Stalkers and occasionally a Sandshark every now and then. 100 meters left. Suddenly, I heard a very close noise. And it was loud. Very, very loud and horrifying. I looked around me, terrified. I knew exactly that I had screwed up badly. As I turned to the left, I noticed their bodies. Two Reaper Leviathans, right next to me. I panicked and my heart began to race, adrenalin levels rising to the top. I thought they didn't notice me, so I continued my escape. Oh, how wrong I was. The Reapers began to chase me down and as I looked back, I looked death right in the eyes, about two meters behind me. My heartbeat must have been around 110 BPM at that point. I began to swim for my life, no longer looking back as I escaped the most threatening, most terrifying thing that I had ever encountered. It took me several minutes to get my heart frequency back to normal, even though I knew I was perfectly safe in my lifepod.This has to be the most terrifying, but also the most beautiful game that I have ever played in my entire life. Even though it gets me incredibly scared and stressed at times, I just keep coming back for more. Thank you, Unknown Worlds. Thank you for making the best survival/ exploration game ever. Please keep up the fantastic work. ♥			"

Early Access Review
								This game is amazing.I had my eyes on Subnautica for a while before I finally purchased it. While my expectations were high, I was awestruck by how amazing it is thus far.Subnautica takes you on a journey through the waters of an alien, oceanic world. You start out in your lifepod in a safe, shallow area. You do a few free dives in order to satisfy your immediate needs: food and water, before slowly pushing further out and exploring deeper in order to acquire more materials and items needed to build vehicles and bases. While you have to eat and drink (in survival mode), survival is not really the point of the game. Instead, the survival aspect is there as a guiding force that gives you incentive to keep exploring through the breathtaking (literally -- watch your O2!) world you're stranded on.From a technical aspect, most of the content that is already there is well executed and actually quite polished. Several of the difficult things are already implemented. The fauna behavior is varied and life-like. Most of the game mechanics work really well, and the few bugs that I've encountered are minor nuisances rather than anything even remotely game-breaking. The devs have included a very easy way to provide feedback, and seem to really care about the product they're making. Although it's early access, this is a high-quality (pre-)release and I'm confident the devs have what it takes to make it into a brilliant finished game.On the downside: This is early access, and obviously there are a few rough edges. While still massive, the content could still be expanded more. A few of the textures are WIP, primarily 3D representation of some items and materials. However, the amount of content, the stability, the balancing and polishing is still better than in several released games.11/10 would be stranded on a remote, alien water-world again. And again.			"

Here are 10 good points I have to say about the game:1) No zombies.2) (very) active developers, with a development timeline on Trello, you can track their ideas and development progress.3) Actual challenging gameplay (at the start), which gets a little easier as you start building a base.4) Massive scary fauna, some of which will actually get your heart racing when you hear them coming for you.5) Interesting Biomes, some with fauna that looks really cute to look at, some with fauna that will mess you up if you so much as sneeze in their general direction.6) Unique base building, incuding different modules, defences, storage modules etc.7) Some semblence of story line (which is being expanded per update), take the crash sequence update for example.8) A pretty diverse range of fauna, from small cutesy fish to massive reaper-leviathans that will totally put a crimp on your day.9) Fish tanks (who doesn't want their own virtual fish).10) You can totally stab an alien shark to death, it's basically like being in the back alleys of Manchester.A few bad (or critical points off of the top of my head):1) No multiplayer / Coop, while this isn't a bad point, it may frustrate some players, not being able to shank alien sharks down with their chums.2) No way to kill a Reaper Leviathan, so once one has you in its sights, you better pray to sweet lord gaben that he misses you and you can get to that giant sea-shell you're so desperately clammering for.3) It feels very slow paced, again this is quite cathartic for some, it may not be for everyone.4) No real objective, the game feels lacking without a major end-game goal, apart from building a base.5) Saves are not compatable between updates.6) No mud crabs, I want the ability to have a mudcrab pet and call him ""citizen snips"", please add this asap.All in all, I give it a 9/10, disregarding all of my semi-negative points (I'm english, I have to moan about something) I find  it to be a good game to come back to every time that they update it. You have my seal of approval.			"

								Without a doubt I recommend this game. One of the best, if not the best, game I've ever played! The music is amazing. The layers to the gameplay are diverse. The colors and graphics are unreal. From the moment you're placed inside your small ship out in the vastness of the ocean you immediately feel a sense of urgency to get something together to protect yourself and survive. This game is why I've become a youtuber. If any of you are curious and want to take a look at how the game looks and plays I'm doing a series on my channel. http://www.youtube.com/TheSStandsFor "

								I am extremely impressed how comptent this game is, especially compared to all other survival sandbox games.Usually I am overwhelmingly skeptical and cynical towards videogames, and with the flood of survival sandbox shovelware I had no hope for anything in this genre.Subnautica is well programmed, optimized, designed, good looking and has the highly comptent developers of Natural Selection 2 working on it that already showed they'll support their games long term.I can't wait to see this game when it reaches gold status.

								It's been a long time since I've enjoyed an early access game this much. The graphics are really impressive so far. The only issue is the draw distance seems to be very inconsistent, but that can be easily overlooked. I don't know about other people but I got drawn in pretty hard. Lights turned off and headphones on, I found myself turning my head to the dark room around me whenever something made a noise. You find yourself so lonely at times you end up talking to the marine life. Or maybe that's just me again. I will admit this fact, I initially got this game from a place less than above board. After playing it for a while I quickly decided that it was worth the investment.			"

								I figure after the bit of play time I've put in that I could write a user review of this game.I honestly feel that this game is phenomenal, especially at a price of just over 20 bucks.  The beautiful underwater world really feels alive and encourages you to explore to find more blueprint fragments and resources.  When I first played I wasnt really sure what to do so I eventually made my way towards the shipwreck, and on my way back after filling my inventory with junk for salvage... I came across a reaper leviathan.... I heard it first.  I did manage to sneak away before it seen me but wow, I didnt know what it was at first so I had to google it.  The sense of danger was definitely there when I was exploring and now that I know some of the things that are out there, wow consider that feeling reinforced!The game has a slew of really cool other stuff to do as well such as crafting underwater bases, special suits, etc.  I'm really looking forward to this game's future to see what other great stuff they add.  I cannot recommend this game enough!This game was a definite pick-me-up after the disappointment that was No Man's Sky and for a fraction of the price. "

								This game is great ioceianic survival game Ive spent 10.6hrs playing it and still feel like i just started. The graphics are amazing and the ocean looks beutifull. The survival aspect is great, and if u pick this game up from the steam store i recomend you play freedom mode, to me its better then survival because you dont have to be eating a drinking water evey 15 min. But i do have to say one thing, for some odd reson the game was working perfectly fine for the 10hrs i played and now its starting to aact up. i dont know if this is because of the new update (Power Nap) but its sertenly getting me on edge. Every time i log in and my game loads it freezs. please fix it devs. Other than that i have nothing on this game. remember its an early acces game so their will be some bugs. Thank you for your time reading this review! have a wonderfull time exploring the ocean of subnautica.			"

								A great concept for a game, clever and well executed. You really feel the exhilaration and anxiety of exploring an alien ocean this wonderful game is hamstrung by a terrible development team who have been attempting to solve their coding problems for the past year.The worst example of this is the fact that in a game where the more you explore, the larger your savefile grows.  If you explore 50% of the map you will have a 1 gigabyte save file that takes over 5 minutes to load, as well as extended framerate drops after spawning as the entire game world is frontloaded. Building a base is a joke, attempting to create multiple bases or a large complex will cause your framerate to drop below 10; No idea why, perhaps the bases are being rendered despite being offscreen? My framerate at the start of the game is above 100, I get frustrated and give up after it drops below 25If the coding problems are ever fixed I may return to playing the gameFor reference my computer specs are far above recommended. i7 4770K 16 Gb ram Gtx 760 Game Installed on a SSD to boost loading speed "

								You are alone in the ocean. The hardest thing to find is... Water?Salt is no fun.I've waited for this game for so long and it hasn't disappointed me in this early incarnation. Even the lack of save functionality gives it a roguelike appeal. Of course, there isn't much content yet, but another thing there isn't much of either is gamebreaking bugs.It's likely as cheap as it'll be for months or maybe years, so why not pick it up now? You can trust Unknown Worlds to deliver.			"

								So i am going to go over First of all The Type of things this game has and weither or not i think its for you.First of all: early developmentThe Game is Barely complete, but the devs Are working their asses off to get new content out.Some people if you go into the negative reviews say about random crashingIf you have a Decent computer and you dont Build A Collosal Base, You will be able to Play this gameSecond of all: Content and playability.alot of People Don't think that there is much to do in this game, but look at their playtime.Mostly 0.1-1 hourseMost people ATLEAST Play a video Game For 20 hoursTheir is endless buidling to do, tons of recources and monsters to find, and biomesNext: Visuals.From Smooth running water, relaxing sounds, Fish swimming noises, Sun rays, Deep abbysses, Bright and giant Mushrooms, And a giant island, The games Visuals Are AMAZING, Especially if you are a person into nature and THe wonders of the sea ( Yes, I Know its a alien planet, but cut me some slack here).And now: Sounds and atmosphere.The sounds of your base Along with the mix of nature, Terrifying creature, Advanced Machinery, And The Roars Of the Reaper Leviathan Give this game a sense of Dread, Fear, But with a blend of Intreage, And curiosity For what the sea may holdAnd Finally: Expieremental modeHow often do you in a game get a mode for free that allows you to play with all the goodies they have made during development Before the Update has came out? Yeah, NoneHere's a brief Tutorial Of how To Change to expeirimentalfirst: Right click on subnauticaThen: click on propertiesNext: Go to Betas And click on the arrow on The Top Bar.Finally: Click on expeirimental.Boom!All in all Great Game And A wonderful Survival titleIf you have 20.00$ to spare.Buy thisYou Won't Regret it			"

								UPDATE: Well it's been a few of months and the developers have been releasing large content patches regularly and smaller hotfix patches in the interims between them to fix bugs that arise from the content updates.  All in all, the experience with this Dev and this game has been 100% positive.  I still recommend buying it, this is definitely one of those ""labors of love"" for this developer.  We have left the ""just a tech demo"" stage of this one and are now seeing a game take form.  ***Original Review***Ok, gonna keep this short and sweet.  As of the writing of this review, there isn't much game.  It is more a tech demo than anything at this point.  With that said, it is one damn impressive starting point for an early access game.  I feel a bit better after dropping the $19.99 required to jump into this.  The developers clearly love their game and this seems to be one of the EA titles to keep a close eye on.  With all that being said, if you are looking for a game to play and get into, look elsewhere.  This title is not ready for prime-time, but if you are interested and want to see it succeed, by all means PLEASE purchase this title immediately.  The more funds these engaged developers get, the more content we will see.  TL;DRIs the game worth playing?  Not at the moment.  Is it worth buying?  Yes, if you want it to succeed and want it to live up to all of its potential.			"

								We live in a dark time. Talentless indie developers go for the low-hanging fruit of open world-procuderally generated survival games. Adults who live on the autism spectrum gobble them up in some vein attempt to find some sort of fulfillment in their lives. All thanks to an obese Swedish man.But the skilled developers at Unknown Worlds Entertainment wanted to do something different. They actually put effort into the art direction, into the world, into the atmosphere. This game isnt design for uncharismatic fruitcakes who scream into a webcam for online ad revenue. It's designed for chill gamers who want to explore a detailed, immersive, interesting, spooky world for 10-15 hours and go ""That was pretty sick... Good job UWE""Dive in gamers.			"

								The Game is great. It has alot of cool features and creatures to see and alot of things to do in a game where you are under water. The graphics are great and the base building is becoming more extencive with each update. The Meka's are one of the many awesome vehicles in the game. I think the customization of the differant vehicles are great and make getting a cyclopes worth it. Things they could add would be a Multiplayer ability, Land Vehicles and ways to take them from under water to on land like a new sub port for them, and maybe the ability to go to other planets(not truely needed but it would be cool). All in all i think this game is great, yes a few bugs but what great game doesnt have them. I think anyone should at least try the game and give a revew to help the devs fix thing. So, personally i think its a great game and i recommend it to anyone.			"

Gr8 game! 8/8 m8 (﻿ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)This game is way better than I expected.  It's a mix of survival games and Terraria...Rust with more creativity (lol)The game is fun.GudScavenging resources is fun and always different.  You have to avoid the monsters and try to get the resources next to them at the same time.The crafting is fun and it gets more difficult as you progress because resources get scarse as you use them.  Crafting stuff also makes you feel the progress/improvement!Exploring is AMAZING! I love going around in my little Seamoth (submarine) and enjoy the beautiful (radioactive  (﻿ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) nature!I also like there is a single player mode.  I would love a multiplayer mode.Git GudThere a few things that could improve (mostly interface features for us spoiled lazy gamers ;p ).I've had very few bugs.  I would like if the game would delete old objects over time so it doesn't use your computer resources for no reason and lower down fps the more you play the game.I'd also like more stuff - new tools, new bioms, new enemies, new furniture, etc. This game has an amazing potential and I want to see the devs using it.  Another thing I want to see - the game releasing sometime this year.  I dislike the forever-early access releases.This game is awesome.  Totally recommend it! "

								man I don't even know where to begin well let's start here it's an early access game so be expecting much more okay now to the bigger stuff.AI: the AI is very good, the small fish will swim away from you, well the Predators will swim after you, this is probably really obvious look I don't know what to say here besides the AI is very good go buy subnautica.the graphics: the graphics are amazing so far it looks realistic for an alien planet, when you go into the jelly shroom or the blood kelp they glow it's awesome so overall the graphics are great.the ambience/immersive: well the game is really creepy when you go into the further out parts and you cannot see the bottom of the ocean, the game also helps us with creeping by throwing in ambient noises👍 like growls moans and roars, so yeah the game is creepy and immersive 👍.the terrain: the game is one Big Map it is not randomly generated but that doesn't take away from the experience it is still a great game and actually some of the terrain has not been finished cuz remember it's still an early access game the terrain is great.the design: the design is great awesome alien creatures underwater alien creatures like a reefback or the sea emperor the design is great.well I don't have anything more to say my final answer to subnautica is 10/10 I recommend this game 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍			"

								Basing the game on its current state, I cannot recommend it. Even with a GTX 1070 there are major FPS crashes, skipping and outright crashes. The game will run smooth as silk for the first few hours, but as you explore more performance will slowly start deteriorating until it literally just starts crashing. There is a fix by deleting the save file cache, but this is basically ""cheating"" as it resets all loot. I shouldn't have to resort to something like this to make the game playable (and even this is just temporary until you rediscover/change the environment). There's an amazing game in here that won't let us play it. If they can fix the optimization, I will edit this review. As of now, the game is borderline unplayable. Do not buy.			"

I had more than one moment where a predator snuck up from behind or I was scavenging the seafloor and had a shadow startle me. At the moment it seem like large parts of the ocean are barren of any life, but the areas that are populated are teeming with fishes and other undefineable creatures.Diving through a cave can make you feel claustrophobic.The Crafting is easily done and I can not wait what comes next. I can only imagine how much more it immerses you when you use a VR Device.Summa Summarum; A very good and promising game 10/10 would play again and again and again			"

								A wonderful game, beautiful graphics and really great building system.The only thing lacking in my opinion is some sort of direction, end-game if you like.Or missions/quests for longetivity.I've got no idea what they have in store in the future, but right now when you've build a base and tried out all gadgets, there's not much else to do.That's the problem in general with all these open end ""survival"" sandbox games, at some point you've mastered the survival and then loose interest. Perhaps with some procedural twists and turns, surprises if you will, they can ensure you keep interest to live another day. In any case a very good game as it is, on which i've not encountered any noticable bug whatsoever.Very recommended. "

								Unique.  There aren't a lot of games that focus on underwater gameplay -- and even fewer take it to space.  On top of this, despite its early access status, the game runs relatively well and provides fun and interesting gameplay right off the bat.  This game has powerful potential, and is fairly deep and very entertaining in the meantime.  More animal variety and density -- especially of harmless or helpful animals like reefbacks and floaters -- would be a good direction to move in.			"

								Favorite game for the year, by far.Pretty, very very pretty!I have enjoyed my exploration of Subnautica and look forward to its development. It is still in the find stuff, craft stuff mode. Some elements only craft one thing. I have a AMF 6300, Nvidia GT740 and had no lag issues, very snappy display rate with a high fps. Rare crashes did occur; rate about one every 10 hours of game play, so remember to save.Building a base is cohesive. (use the glass walls) The fish and critters are great. Use of bioluminencence is stunning.			"

								Unique.  There aren't a lot of games that focus on underwater gameplay -- and even fewer take it to space.  On top of this, despite its early access status, the game runs relatively well and provides fun and interesting gameplay right off the bat.  This game has powerful potential, and is fairly deep and very entertaining in the meantime.  More animal variety and density -- especially of harmless or helpful animals like reefbacks and floaters -- would be a good direction to move in.			"

								Admittedly, the game is still in development phases. But it has so much to offer. It has beautiful graphics, different levels of gameplay for those who just want to build and those who want a hardcore survival experience, and a few in between. The different biomes are so fun to explore and I love learning where to find which elements. Also, the building mechanic with the bases... definitely a plus. I think my biggest and only downside to this game, which might change as the game develops, is the lack of any kind of in game tutorial or help. I find myself alt-tabbing or leaving the game multiple times simply to figure out how to do something. Don't get me wrong, it's relatively easy once you've watched a let's play or two. But a little more in game info would make this game completely solid. This might sound like a negative review, but this is a small price to pay for something so fun. I've basically been linking the game to every one of my friends begging them to get it.			"

Early Access Review
								Subnautica is one of those rare early access games. A hidden gem, in a sea of terrible survival games that would probably do okay at a game jam, but terribly in the real world. One where the developers actually give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about player feedback, and have fully committed to giving us a polished final release.Even though it's not finished, Subnautica is probably my favorite PC game out there right now. I have never felt so much legitimate excitement from discovering new things in a video game. Hell, I've even gotten more enjoyment out of it than many finished games in the survival genre. I think that what helps set it apart from those other games is that Unknown Worlds managed to get the whole ""immersion"" thing right, which you'd think is important to the survival genre. Why would I care if my character survives X amount of days if I'm not immersed in the game itself? However, that seems to have been forgotten in the newbie developer scene's rush to make disposable survival games to make a quick buck or 50. Thank you Unknown Worlds for not forgetting such an essential part of the genre.Much like the real-world ocean, it's an entirely different world out there in Subnautica's waters. There's a huge diversity of wildlife, divided into three categories: passive, defensive and aggressive. Passive species just simply ignore you. Defensive species ignore you unless you get too close. Aggressive species will actively hunt you down with the goal of killing you, or maybe they'll attack and eat other species in the surrounding area. Speaking of which, there are almost no offensive weapons in the game, aside from the knife you get early on. This focus on survival and crafting rather than combat is a refreshing thing in a genre that seems to be more focused on combat than it is... well, survival. It requires you to actually think how to get out of a dangerous situation than just simply running in guns ablazin'. I like that. There's also a wide variety of biomes, each with their own range of native fauna and flora.Also, the game can be pretty damn creepy. Take for example, the reaper leviathan. It's big, it's deadly and it will kill you if you aren't crafty enough with your defenses. But don't worry! It doesn't spawn everywhere, and you can hear its loud, echoing roar miles away, letting you know you're getting close to its territory. Then there's the crabsquid, one of the recent additions. It's what it says on the tin, a crab-squid hybrid, and it makes these loud clicking noises for echolocation. It's also deadly, albeit less so than the reaper leviathan. Just imagine being in a dark, seemingly-empty cave and then suddenly hearing clicking sounds. Yeah.The game also gets very dark at night. If it weren't for the - by the way, beautiful - bioluminescence of the sealife, I wouldn't be able to make out a lot of the seascape. It helps make the game even prettier, too. Speaking of which, the game isn't ugly, compared to most other games in the survival genre. You know things are bad for said genre when this is a surprising thing to you, a game that is actually very pretty. There's plenty of diversity in the game's sights, too. The safe shallows are bright and colorful, with the dunes also being colorful (albeit much less bright), while the sparse reef is very green-ish and the mountains are very gray. And that's just scratching the surface.Overall, would I recommend Subnautica? Yes, I definitely would. It's one of those rare, hidden gems of early access, and I can see myself continuing to play it even beyond it leaving early access. Good work, Unknown Worlds, and keep it up.			"

Early Access Review
								I've been somewhat keeping an eye on this  game for a bit. I try to stay away from early access games after being a bit underwhelmed by a few of them. And then the Summer Sale hit and I thought ""Eh, I'll give it a go."" I have been super impressed by this game so far. It's way more polished than is typical for early access. If they did nothing else to the game, I feel like I've gotten my money's worth. Don't worry, from all I've heard, the devs are awesome and add big content updates fairly regularly.As you no doubt know, Subnautica is an underwater survival game, with resource gathering and crafting. It has base building and vehicles (awesome, btw). It is a beautiful looking game, although at higher setting, I had some performance issues on my mid-level system. While it is a survival game, I think it's less about survival and more about exploring. If you are paying attention and don't make any dumb mistakes, survival is not an issue. If you love exporation in a game, then do yourself a favor and get this game now. This game does a great job of dangling that carrot out there on the stick and rewards you for your wanderlust. Also, there are mechanics in place for a story-driven experience. Although there is not really anything to it at this point, I could easily see them adding story without sacrificing the open-world gameplay.Pros:-Very pretty game-More polished than is has a right to be-Scratches that wanderlust itch-base building is generally interesting and doesn't get in the way of the fun of the game-did I mention it's really pretty?-Active devs-SUBS!!Cons:-Can chug a bit at high setting without a beefy rig-may be a little light on current content long-term for those that tend to get sucked into a game like this-no multi-playerHonestly, except for maybe no multiplayer (which the devs have not rules out in the future), the few cons I can come with are minor issues for this great game. Unless this just isn't your kind of game, you should not hesitate on this game			"

								Although Subnautica is in alpha stage it already offers a great atmosphere and motivating goals like the Cyclopse - a massive sub that can be customized with lockers, builders and other components. Being a natural selection veteran, i was sceptical about this rapid change in game style. But i was totally wrong. Subnautica is great and highly immersive. I loved it from the first moments under water. I absolutly trust Unknownworlds to make another great game.

								I have never bothered to leave a review for a game before, but for this I feel it's worth it. I can't even begin to describe the level of beauty and ""realism"" this game has. Now, I say realism because this game does take place on an alien planet, so the flora and fauna aren't technically real animals and plants, but this game will have you believing that they are. The animators are INCREDIBLE! The entire development team really is. They are still in the process of developing the game, and they make a point of communicating with us (the players), in so many ways. They have a chat room on Discord where you can IM with devs on a virtually daily basis, they have multiple boards on Trello where you can leave cards for them to see, and there's an in-game bug report system as well. They're very responsive to community comments and suggestions. You really feel like you're part of the creation of this incredible game. They update it in small ways on a daily basis (I download at least two small patches a day). At the moment, the game is sort of an open world where you go around and scavenge for resources, use them to craft futuristic technology, and advance up the tech tree to more and more capable vehicles and gear. These upgrades allow you to explore deeper and further from your home base. There are so many different environments in Subnautica, and upgrading your tech allows you to explore them all. There's a multitude of gorgeous bioluminescent plants, titanic creatures, as well as cute little ones that it's fun to swim with. The game will eventually incorporate a story component as well, so it's exciting to see that unfold piece by piece. You start off operating out of a little life pod, but as you gather resources you're able to construct elaborate (beautiful) bases underwater (and you can build as many of them as you want). The views are spectacular out the windows, and there's so many ways to power your base, farm your own food, and basically become self-sufficient. You can even collect your favorite plants and animals from throughout the world and bring them home with you. Fish can live in aquariums within your base, and planters can be placed in which you can grow your favorite plants. This allows for a lot of customization of the aesthetics of your base.It's impossible not to get immersed in this game. On multiple occasions I've found myself diving deep in the ocean and literally screaming at the top of my lungs (and probably♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off my in-laws in the middle of the night) when I unexpectedly run into one of the terrifying leviathins that lurk in the deep. My heart races and my hands shake. It's fantastic.There's even more exciting tech and creatures on the way, and I personally am thrilled to be along for the ride. I'm still shocked this game was only $20. I've seen way worse games selling for $40+. So, in conclusion I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this game. Probably the best $20 I've ever spent. This game offers HOURS of play (I've currently got over 300 logged...I clearly don't have a problem...), and I've found it to have high replay value as well. This team is awesome, and they deserve all the support they can get, so please give this game a try. I promise you won’t be disappointed!Edit: As of late my computer is having a hard time running the game. Not sure if this is due to updates or because my computer is getting old...			"

								The ocean is a scary place. You are the last survivor of a spaceship crash and have escaped with the bare essentials. You plunge into the seemingly endless ocean in hopes of finding food and drinkable water to stay alive. The ocean is beautiful and full of resources. It's also full of things that want to kill you. By far, the best part of Subnautica is not knowing what's around the corner, seeing the resources you need and finding out how to get those resources. You'll go from surviving to thriving but never think you're invincible because, like our own ocean, this alien world has some messed up creatures who will mess you up. Subnautica is fun. When trying to explain the appeal to people I say 'It's like Minecraft but underwater' which does the game a disservice. Subnautica has some truly great things that are unique to it. The environment, particularly at night, is beautiful on any settings or rig. The game is about $30 AUD and well worth it.			"

								Loving this game so far.  It's beautiful (especially in ""Experimental Mode"").   The world is enormous.  And every little thing you accomplish opens up more of the world to you.  If you're brave enough to venture out.  I've seen most of the world now I think (at least above the sea floor), but there's still a couple areas I'm too chicken to go into.  You can just HEAR something's out there and isn't happy about you poking around... The game is clearly unfinished (see that ""Early Access"" label?), but there's already a pretty full game here.  And even with the gaps, it's already great at triggering my sense of curiosity, and a need to scavenge just a couple more things so I can build that next upgrade, or base component or ship, or explore that new cave I just found.  It's also neat to be able to watch how development is progressing and what the devs are currently working on.  They have a publicly viewable Trello account with several boards detailing their dev, design, and release history.  Updates seem to come monthly from what I can tell.  And even more frequently if you opt in to that ""Experimental Mode"" I mentioned earlier (basically gives you access to their internal testing builds).  On the other hand, since the game IS still unfinished, so there ARE rough edges.  For example the the way assets load into the world can cause very frequent framerate stuttering.  Personally, I'm not having trouble seeing past that stuff, but I'm sure it will bother other people.  Hopefully all that will be ironed out eventually.  The devs very clearly have a lot of work they still plan to do.			"

But after watching her play it for a while I could tell that my sister was hooked on the game; and she was practically begging me to play it also.  When I started playing it, I was a little confused by it's unique style, but I soon got the hang of it and not before long I was engrossed in the game as well.  I now play this game all the time. Loved ones have to come to me and remind me to eat and drink.

								Fascinating game.There is much to explore and the scenery is really stunning.Gameplay:You explore the area and dive for resources.Research is performed by locating and collecting fragments.These fragments are scattered all over the area.Though you need to travel around to get all the research unlocked.The game features the well known game modes, which you already know from similar games.These are typically a creative mode, a survival mode and a ""dead-is-dead"" mode, which means dying=game over.The other modes have different difficulties to offer, Survival mode requires you to look out for food and water either.Creative mode does not require food/water, but you can still be harmed and die (though  you are revived/respawned with some less equipment in your inventory).The map is colorful and has lots of potential.You can craft/build your own base and for travel two kind of submarine crafts.A small one and a bigger one, where you are even able to dock with your small one (really awesome feat!).Next step is finding a nice spot for a little base. ;-)The crafting itself is done quite easy.You have a crafting station and the recipes are already ""known"", though you just need to collect the necessary resources to craft the items you want.The only downside is the inability to kill (or at least defend yourself, except fleeing!) certain aggressive creatures/fish.I read in a statement, that the developers do not intent to add any ""weapons"" (you have a knife available, but you can only kill some minor fish/creatures for survival or protection).I think it is necessary to have some kind of weapon to protect yourself.There are bigger and meaner enemies as you explore the area and they are aggressive.Graphics/Sound:Stunning and colorful underwater world.Very detailed and subtle.Ambience sounds and sporadic music (really nice tunes) are adding up to the underwater feeling.Controls:Your average controls, like in any other FPS.Nothing fancy here.Multiplayer:Currently not available and the developers are more tending to keep the Singleplayer.While most of the customers think otherwise!!! Including me, I would really like to see a multiplayer version.Summary:In a whole, a really well done game with lots of potential.I hope the crafting will be expanded, also with one or two useful weapons (to either kill or taze/shoo-away certain enemies).I mean really, a stasis rifle does not kill, nor does even the diamond knife harm any bigger enemies at all.A harpoon or the like would do the job.

								One of the greatest games I have ever played. This game, even in early development, has made me use more than a day's worth of time and keeps me wanting more. The map and gameplay overall makes for a wonderful and worth while experience.			"

Early Access Review
								I really enjoyed this game, especially considering it's an early access survival. For what it is, Subnautica has an amazing atmosphere. I love the underwater alien feel to it. The sound design is amazing, and the graphics/artstyle look really good when it's not glitching out. That is one of the main cons though. The atmosphere is really really amazing, but quite often it can be ruined by the terrible optimization. Apparently this is something that's going to be fixed very soon, but I'm reviewing the game as it is now. Every time you're moving and going into a new area, the game stutters and you drop down to about 1-5 fps for like a second or two. It's really annoying and really bad. It doesn't matter if you have the best computer ever made by mankind, it still does this. going along with that, the game is fairly glitchy. There are a few number of gamebreaking bugs right now. As it is, I had to find out the hardway that the scanner room just flat out makes creature sounds not work if you use the cameras in it, which is really really lame. Like I said before, the atmosphere in this game is amazing when it's actually working. I just wish there was some easier way to find out or the tooltip just said ""hey this thing ruins your sound and doesn't do much else"" or something so I don't have to figure out exactly what the problem is. One last con, and this one probably not going to be fixed anytime soon. A lot of survival games do this, and I just don't get it. Inventory management is an absolute chore and not fun. I don't know who likes to do that. It's one thing to grind all your materials for a bit (subnautica is pretty generous with materials I find) but I hate having to sort them all and make 5-6 lockers full of junk and then needing to take it out to craft some kind of garbage I need. ALL THAT ASIDE though, this game is great for people that love exploring. I am a scardy baby, and I have to say I was generally scared of the deep dark waters of this game. It's really amazing to be exploring the oceans and come across the big and weird and scary alien creatures. Base building feels a lot more rewarding than most survival games. I don't think it's quite as open for you to make castles and stuff, but bases actually have purpose and it feels good to get a good place up and running efficiently. The vehicles are really good too. The seaglide (I don't know if it counts as a vehicle) could use some work I think though. Eats up batteries waaaaaaay too fast, even though it's early on and gets mostly replaced. The Seamoth is great though and you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. The Cyclops is reaaally cool. They're really good rewards for exploring and the upgrade from just swimming around to driving around feels substantial. Right now there's a lot of placeholders and some flatout unfinished stuff, but I'd say this game was worth the price and I'm really glad to have played it. If for some reason this never got updated again, I'd still say go for it if you really like exploration and can get past the horrible loading stutters and know what the cons of it are. It's probably a good idea to wait for more content, but I got 20 hours of enjoyment out of this (I played some offline.) and I liked it all. So yeah, it's cool and whatever, maybe wait for release, but if you're really interested and can't wait then go for it. Just remember the stutter bug and keep the other cons in mind before buying. Thanks bye			"

Early Access Review
								I figured I have sunk (pun intended) enough time in this game that it is time I post a review and recommendation of it.This game has been a great experience. There is tons of stuff to do and tons of places to see. At the time of this writing, I have played over eighteen hours and there are huge portions of the map that I have not explored yet. The game itself is beautiful, especially with the most recent update. I'm using a decent (but not amazing) laptop to play and the game still looks great. Someone put a lot of love and imagination into the design of the sea creatures and landscapes.That being said, it is in early access and there are a few spots which are a bit unfinished as of this writing. For example, there are some hints at a story that you can pick up through your PDA but right now it doesn't go anywhere. I have encountered a few bugs: clipping issues, brief FPS drops, and textures being slow to pop in. None of it was enough to ruin the game for me and the most recent update did a lot to address these. While we're on the subject, I should point out that the developers have done a very good job of releasing regular updates. You can expect one about once a month (give or take). I actually get a little excited with each new update because there is always something new to see. I hope the developers keep up the good work!I could go into greater detail but it would take a while and this review has gone on long enough. In short, this is an early access game that I am happy to support. I eagerly await the finished game.[Update: The story has been greatly elaborated on in the more recent updates and it is really becoming interesting. Also, a lot of the fps drops and clipping issues were fixed once they got rid of the shifting terrain. Massive kudos to the developers for listening to feedback and making fixes as needed]			"

Early Access Review
								I absolutely love this game. I like a lot of games, but this is the first one I've felt the desire to write a review for. Hardly even know where to start! The videos and images are pretty self explanatory. It is an underwater survival, building, exploring game, all set on an alien planet. I'll get my one negative point out the way first. At this stage of development, there is no real story, or objective (besides not dying.) The problem is that once you finish building everything you want, there isn't much to do. Sure, you can explore around and see cool stuff, but the feeling of accomplishment diminishes. That being said however, the building and scavanging before that point is amazing! I usually delete my saves and start over with every new update released. That part doesn't get old. Even though I've done it all before, it is a blast! Again, I absoulutely love this game and would recommend it to anyone.			"

								Even as an early access title this game does -not- disappoint. If you want a true underwater, sci-fi, survival game that puts emphassis on exploration then look no further then this. From the diverse biomes, in depth crafting and base building systems, vehicles and not only enviromental but creature challenges. This game keeps you thinking, moving, and learning from experience as you progress into new territory. I'm -terrified- of the deep open ocean, and I can't put this game down for a minute. Even if I am screaming into a bucket with fear.			"

Early Access Review
								7.8/10 Too much water. (Joking.)Ah, Subnautica. Where do I begin?First and foremost, this game is beautiful. The art style of this game are enough to leave your mouth gaping multiple times, from the darkest ocean depths, where luminescent creatures and mushrooms lay in the darkness, to the kelp beds infested with creatures that thirst for your blood. This game is simply a joy when it comes to admiring the views you'll be treated to. I find myself using that screenshot button quite often, because of this game.As for the AI, it can be a little clunky. Sometimes predators are easily avoided simply because their AI is a little clumsy. I've seen fish unrelentingly attempting to swim through solid rocks, and right into the path of predators. Crafting, so far, there are plenty of items to craft. Even going so far as to implement sea bases. Sea bases at the moment feel a little bare, but I hear they plan to expand on them in a future update.I also sometimes come across objects in the game, that no longer have a use. I feel that extra seamoth fragments, should be able to turn into something useful, perhaps some extra titanium and such.I've seen a lot of people compare this game to Minecraft, which I feel is a unfair assessment. This game is not about building blocks, and protecting yourself from monsters at night. This game has a physics engine, so floating trees and landscape will only come in graphical glitches, rather than being intentional.  It seems this game is based more on exploration, than actually building things.Now, you are buying a game that isn't complete. Expect a few bugs, play the game slowly while admiring the views, and try not to rush it and you're in for a good time.I look forward to future updates.Pros:+ Graphics + Exploration + Diverse Landscapes+ Excellent crafting system+ Unique take on survival game elements. Cons: - Bad AI.- Glitches.This game is worth your time. If you love survival games, give it a try. You wont regret it.			"

								For VR gamers out there, I do not currently recommend this game.   When I first loaded it up, I thought  my mouse was broken because I couldn't click any of the menu buttons.  No, it just turns out that developers have disabled both the mouse and keyboard in VR mode.I was forced into using my gamepad,  which isn't the worst thing in the world, but I definitely want to play the game with my mouse and keyboard!The game is beautiful and nice to explore, but I ecountered another very frustrating issue.  Items put in floating storage lockers simply disappear!  Supposedly this issue will be fixed in the next update, but beware until then!I will come back to this review after the issues here have been addressed.			"

								A really cool concept that initially sold me on it. A survival-building game entirely underwater, on an alien planet, no less. Unfortunately I just cannot bring myself to recommend this game. The developers are painfully sticking to this gameplay idea of passive non-inteference. What I mean by this is that this is not a survival game like ARK which is combat heavy. In Subnautica, the only lethal weapon you have access to is a tiny, crappy knife. That's it. Every other weapon, even the torpedoes for the Seamoth are non-lethal. Until you manage to unlock the stasis rifle, you just have to run from everything. Exciting at first, but the theme eventually gets tiresome.If you need your game to have goals and lots of things to do, then this isn't for you. But if you just like to build stuff and explore and faff about, then it is.			"

Early Access Review
								I just want to start off saying that I am a huge fan of this game. I would feel challenged but not in a tense, need a break, kind of way. Its always had a calming feel to it. However, with the new update, its changed that. The PRAWN update came with some cool things like the PRAWN suit, but to be honest, the game developers changed a lot of things that didn't need to be changed. Which is frustrating and irritating. Simple things like the multi purpose room is in fragments???? Something that simple and basic should not be in fragments!The last issue I have is the odd placement of other fragments. When you have made the seamoth, you can only go to 200m which is fine. But the blue prints for things to make said seamoth to go deeper are in the very deep parts you can't get to in the first place! I cannot tell you how many times I've died or blown a seamoth up trying to get these fragments. Putting needed fragments in those odd places is a terrible design choice.  I understand that maybe they want to make it more challenging, which is fine. But may I suggest just make fragments sparce, or put randomly in different places. Not 4 uneeded fragment pieces in one wreck.So as it stands now, I would not recommend this game. However, if the developers just change those things, Subnautica would be the best survival/crafting game ever.			"

Early Access Review
								It's been a while since a game's atmosphere and environment alone has made me feel genuine fear, it doesn't help of course that I have thalassophobia. Despite that fear though, I have a morbid facination with the deep dark abyss and am addicted to exploration. I started out on hardcore just to drive the point home that I truly was afraid of any conceivable threat. I slowly expanded my reach throughout this underwater world, watching and studying creatures before then testing cautiously to see whether or not they were hostile or how they'd behave in my presence, in order to understand what tactics I'd need to employ in the future when encountering these creatures, when coupled with other stressful factors like low oxygen, hunger, thirst, or already being pursued by another predator. Surviving in the game can be rough at first but I quickly figured out what food sources were the most valuable and did my best to preserve them. Once you can build a base, things become relatively easier. I recommend building a base deeper down, on the border of one of the more dangerous biomes, so that you have a source of oxygen/safehaven closer to where you will be taking dangerous expeditions. The devs have done a fantastic job at making a both beautiful and terrifying world, especially on the experimental version which is what I have played on for the most part, the nights are rediculously dark and the days can 'happily' surprise you with an eclipse as a incredibly close planet blocks the sun for around 15 seconds. This can be a shock if you're already pretty deep down but relying on the light of day.Reaper Leviathans though... hoo boy, I mean looking at a picture of one doesn't make it seem all that terrifying, hell watching someone else be attacked by one isn't either. But when you're immersed in the atmosphere of the game and one of those things springs out of the gloom, man did I♥♥♥♥♥♥myself. Don't think I've turned a seamoth around that fast at any other stage. The sheer weight of them is what's scary, along with their roar, it's more of an aura that's intimidating as opposed to what they actually look like. Doesn't help that they can basically 1 hit you either :P. Even Reefbacks are pretty intimidating and they aren't even hostile, just the sheer size of that creature... you know that thing could probably kill you if it sneezed your way.But yeah, this game is good you should get it, has bugs but you should expect that from early access... devs are pretty on the ball with updates however. I recommend playing on the 'current' (obviously current as in when this post was made, may be different now) experimental mode, game looks and plays a lot better... . (Just look up how to change to experimental mode, I'm not talking about the graphic settings in the initial menu)			"

								The only reason for not reccomending this game at the moment is just the MOST HORRIBLE optimisation I've ever seen in EA games. Once you start a game, it runs relatively smooth, but the more you explore and build your base, it becomes simply unplayable. It crashes, stutters and freezes all the time, fps drop to some ridiculous values. I won't play it until the performance is fixed. Speaking of the gameplay - it's just the way a perfect openworld, survival, exploring and base building should be. I will change my review once they pay attention to optimisation.			"

								Verdict: SubNautica is fun and has a lot of potential, but is hampered by a lack of content (it is in early development, after all). There's a lot going for this game - graphics are decent, the underwater setting is intriguing, initial survival is fraught with danger, and crafting/designing bases is fun.However! my character had ""maxed out"" equipment and seen all there is to do within 8 hours or so. I am flush with resources, crafted everything I can, explored the entire area, and no fish in the ocean can harm me. There needs to be MORE - more story, more craftibles, more to explore, more danger for endgame characters, more goals. It's a promising start, but it has a long way to go before it's complete.			"

								Bought this game in December because it looked beautiful.  It was fun then, but the content just keeps getting better.  Just read a write up on this game in Gaminformer magazine.  This game is going to be big, so buy it now before it comes out on consoles for $59.99.  The dev team keeps adding mroe and more content and the environements are amazing.  Gameplay is smooth except for the occasional crash which is typical of early access.  Build yourself a sub and head for the deep parts of the ocean, it just keeps getting better and better!  You wont be disappointed, this game is great.			"

								This game is quickly taking over my life and I don't regret a thing. Where do I even start on reviewing this game? It has to be (in my opinion at least) one of the best early access games out there. Even without further content additions there are hours upon hours of game time with beautiful graphics and is well worth the price tag as it stands right now.The survival element is real in this game since many items don't respawn/don't respawn often forcing you to venture more in a quest to further progress on crafting or building as well as the fun task of searching for blueprints. Plus certain sea life that want to take a bite out of you.There are different game styles depending on whether you want a relaxing near sandbox game on creative, no worry of drinking or eating on freedom, standard survival on..well, survival and the really challenging hardcore mode where death means death and starting all over again.There are admittedly a few bugs still lurking in this game but it's easy to tell how the developers take them seriously with the many updates in fixing those found which brings me to another point, the developers are very active and put out content updates and fixes often, another reason I see this as one of the best early access games around right now.Highly recommend this game.

								FIRST IMPRESSIONI put my headphones on and started the game upI'm in a life pod, now, I'm standing on top of it and hear a loud bass-y honk from deep underwaterI'm spooked by the noise and accidently fall off the life raft into the water scrambling to get back up and i just hear that noise getting louder and louderDidn't even need to see what was making the noise to be terrified. I think that that is something amazing that is shown here, that set and setting alone can have a great deal on setting a mood, in this case, an alien ocean seeming as dangerous as it is idylic. That is something you don't really see in games anymore.Overall after my first impressions I think the devs are doing something truly original here and I'm going to have a good time playing this game (if you know what I mean) "

								This is an awesome game, I really love exploration and the ocean all together and while looking at games that take place underwater, I came across this one. Typically, I'm quite picky about buying games and was sceptic about buying this but it really wasn't a mistake. This game has everything it promises and even in early access, it has a lot of content to offer.PROS:-Beautiful graphics-Amazing-looking animations-Plenty of unique alien creatures-A lot of content-Fun to play-Exploration is always fun-Realistic in ways-Good storyline so far-Scary going down into the depthsCONS:-No multiplayer (will probably be added in a later update)-Updates don't come out very often at times (it's early access after all, right?)-Sometimes when I build, there are pieces of terrain stuck in my buildings, as well as when I dig up sand, some little pieces stay floatingOverall, this game is fantastic and I look forward to seeing where it goes and what the storyline has to hold.

								Verdict: SubNautica is fun and has a lot of potential, but is hampered by a lack of content (it is in early development, after all). There's a lot going for this game - graphics are decent, the underwater setting is intriguing, initial survival is fraught with danger, and crafting/designing bases is fun.However! my character had ""maxed out"" equipment and seen all there is to do within 8 hours or so. I am flush with resources, crafted everything I can, explored the entire area, and no fish in the ocean can harm me. There needs to be MORE - more story, more craftibles, more to explore, more danger for endgame characters, more goals. It's a promising start, but it has a long way to go before it's complete.			"

								I haven't seen a game so well realized and executed like this in several years... well, since Portal 2.This is a fresh take on the survival genre where the trade up of realism for a 3D printer and Sci-Fi ecology feels like an entirely unique experience.  The presentation is so tight, I'm left with the impression that the only thing missing is human.  The landscapes sprawl out and meld together seamlessly; their only barriers are the dazzling light effects that dance down from the surface and surrounding fauna.At night, the world takes on such a different appearance that it requires another layer of exploration. The wildlife lays dormant and ripe for hunting.  At daybreak, you gather resources in the midst of schooling life and continue to devise a game plan.  Subnautica is different; it doesn't feel like a job.  Instead, it feels like an expedition where the only stress is how small your starting locker is.			"

Early Access Review
								It's been a while since a game's atmosphere and environment alone has made me feel genuine fear, it doesn't help of course that I have thalassophobia. Despite that fear though, I have a morbid facination with the deep dark abyss and am addicted to exploration. I started out on hardcore just to drive the point home that I truly was afraid of any conceivable threat. I slowly expanded my reach throughout this underwater world, watching and studying creatures before then testing cautiously to see whether or not they were hostile or how they'd behave in my presence, in order to understand what tactics I'd need to employ in the future when encountering these creatures, when coupled with other stressful factors like low oxygen, hunger, thirst, or already being pursued by another predator. Surviving in the game can be rough at first but I quickly figured out what food sources were the most valuable and did my best to preserve them. Once you can build a base, things become relatively easier. I recommend building a base deeper down, on the border of one of the more dangerous biomes, so that you have a source of oxygen/safehaven closer to where you will be taking dangerous expeditions. The devs have done a fantastic job at making a both beautiful and terrifying world, especially on the experimental version which is what I have played on for the most part, the nights are rediculously dark and the days can 'happily' surprise you with an eclipse as a incredibly close planet blocks the sun for around 15 seconds. This can be a shock if you're already pretty deep down but relying on the light of day.Reaper Leviathans though... hoo boy, I mean looking at a picture of one doesn't make it seem all that terrifying, hell watching someone else be attacked by one isn't either. But when you're immersed in the atmosphere of the game and one of those things springs out of the gloom, man did I♥♥♥♥♥♥myself. Don't think I've turned a seamoth around that fast at any other stage. The sheer weight of them is what's scary, along with their roar, it's more of an aura that's intimidating as opposed to what they actually look like. Doesn't help that they can basically 1 hit you either :P. Even Reefbacks are pretty intimidating and they aren't even hostile, just the sheer size of that creature... you know that thing could probably kill you if it sneezed your way.But yeah, this game is good you should get it, has bugs but you should expect that from early access... devs are pretty on the ball with updates however. I recommend playing on the 'current' (obviously current as in when this post was made, may be different now) experimental mode, game looks and plays a lot better... . (Just look up how to change to experimental mode, I'm not talking about the graphic settings in the initial menu)			"

								This game is fantastic and beautiful, the devs clearly listen to feedback, and I love how they have made providing feedback so simple and intuitive in the game as you play. It shows they care a lot about the product and their players!Features get more expansive and better each time they update which is often, and opting into the beta access you see updates happen sometimes even several times a day which again shows these guys mean business when tweaking the game. I get so excited about what they will hold next for us.The game is great fun and can be quite unforgiving in survival mode when searching for resources and exploring.Take a look at my gameplay on youtube to get an idea of some of the great stuff the game has to offer:

Early Access Review
								I have literally fallen in love with this game. Subnautica has tons of stuff to offer and you will have a blast discoveing all the weird things under the ocean. The graphics are top notch. The biggest part of this game is the atmosphere. The deeper you go down into the ocean, the creepier everything gets. The unsettling noises of various creatures, the darkness, the fear of not knowing what you might encounter are some of the best moments that you will have to go through as you progress. The game is still in early-access but it already has tons of content which will take a lot of time for you to go through all of them.The game has a story mode in-progress. This isn't a multiplayer game, so far. So if you are into games that lets you play with your friends then this might disappoint you a little bit. However, in my opinion, Subnautica shines as a single player game because if it were a multiplayer game then this would become a really boring and easy game where you wouldn't even have to worry about the secrets and spooks of the deep dark ocean that you may encounter. This game is meant to play as solo where you have to do your own work, you have to deal with everything on your own. This isn't just a game. It's an experience (aside from bugs and glitches, duh). I recommend playing the survival mode first if you want to actually feel the immersion that this game offers. Do not play creative mode and don't even try any of the console modes at the beginning. Trust me, it feels really good when you put a lot of effort on surviving and scavenging and finally get to build your first base or Seamoth or Cyclops (which is the submarine) after going through a lot of struggle.Again, I request devs to keep working on fixing the lag. Yes, things are a lot better now, but we still have to delete cache files after a long playtime, and it brings up some more bugs and glitches like the multiple doors bug.My personal rating - 8 out of 10.

Plus certain sea life that want to take a bite out of you.There are different game styles depending on whether you want a relaxing near sandbox game on creative, no worry of drinking or eating on freedom, standard survival on..well, survival and the really challenging hardcore mode where death means death and starting all over again.There are admittedly a few bugs still lurking in this game but it's easy to tell how the developers take them seriously with the many updates in fixing those found which brings me to another point, the developers are very active and put out content updates and fixes often, another reason I see this as one of the best early access games around right now.Highly recommend this game.

								Subnuatica is a great game so far with it's story and casual gameplay style of looking for resouce and blueprints, building bases, and piloting subs I have found the SeaMoth the most fun to pilot and the one of the most usefull things in the game. I like how the Cyclops will tilt when you rise or sink into an object or is hit with enough force, aswell as the customizeblity of both subs with colors, names, upgrades, and in the cyclops furnature the lighting and graphics are great for what hardware is needed. Over all I find Subnuatica a fun and at times challenging experince that I wish more games had.			"

								The game is great, low end PC's can play it if they go for performance instead of quality, not even done yet and the story is being fabrcated in front of us like out magic fish cooker, and our building seeking generators that somehow don't electrecute us to death. Love this game, would be great with controller support.			"

This is survival exploration done right, Subnautica makes you want to explore, as there is wonder around every corner.Very atmospheric and very immersive, the only thing this game is missing (other than just more equiptment and fish, which it already has lots of!) is Co-Op. Something about this game would just be so fun if you had a friend doing it with you.Just imagine you and your best gamer buddy hundreds of metres deep in an abyssal trench, trying to operate a submarine as you are getting attacked by an enormous leviathan.Devs Pls <3			"

Early Access Review
								VERY Recommended!Awesome graphics, amazing design and feel, lighting and water is incredible, and physics are nice too. There's plenty more to say about how nice this game looks.Concerning how the game ""feels"", although it is an exploration/survival type game, you do not feel alone or simply ""surviving"" with no actual purpose. Most survival/exploration games out there are boring after a while (even when they're interesting and good-looking) and I'm a person who gets bored REALLY quickly. Somehow, this game manages to keep you wanting to discover more. You feel ""alive"" and with purpose. For example, you'll WANT to find out more about what happened to your ship, where are the survivors (since you receive messages from other life-pods), what's out there on this planet (because you receive messages and discover things related to new areas/islands/caves/formations...), who's out there (because you get messages about people coming to get you)... and I still barely explored anything in this game.Crafting is also very well done and balanced. The items you craft are interesting and useful, and you dicover more as you proceed in your exploration. Items range from cooking fish, creating water, to crafting tools, suits, subs, building underwater bases, and weapons... Furthermore, you've got limited oxygen so you'll feel the urge to find ways to increase the time you can stay underwater to explore intriguing new depths.Resource gathering is also pleasant and sometimes challenging.Underwater life and visuals are very nice and breathtaking.A very imporant thing for me which this game captures well: it not only captures the beauty of deep oceans, it also captures its majesty and scary aspects. Just wait until you're in a not-so-shallow area and the night approaches.One surprising experience that really mesmerized me: I was once diving in shallow water during the day when suddenly everything went dark very quickly, which was apparent that it's surely not the regular night-fall. I quickly surfaced to see what happened because it's kinda frightening when everything suddenly goes dark down there. What I saw was AWESOME! The planet that's orbiting the one you're on (which is large and visible very well at night) actually ECLIPSED the local sun! And the eclipse looked incredibly awesome! Every time I play this game, it positively surprises me with plenty of events and discoveries.The devs are also working very actively on this game since each update has a very significant amount of additions, features, and fixes. It still has bugs, of course, but nothing game-breaking.This game has a very high potential and very recommended.Update: After playing and advancing more and more in this game, it'll get more and more exciting, but the more 'advanced' my equipment got and the more I explored, the more I found the world to be quite small. I REALLY started wishing the ocean was much larger as it feels a bit small now. It still is an AMAZING game, but I simply want a much larger ocean and vast areas to explore.			"

								The most striking this about this game to me is that I didn't expect it to make me instinctively scared - but it did. Something about being underwater and vulnerable from all sides with foggy shapes off in the dimly lit depths that really gets under my skin - and probably yours as well.  As they keep adding in new kinds of threats to the player in the undersea world I hope that paranoia mounts *just enough* so that I never feel completely safe when I go to the edge of the shallows.As for the whole game: Overall it has a huge amount of potential long-term. It's already got a lot of attractive stuff about it right now.  Building structures is good. Underwater combat works pretty well.  The creature AI while unfinished shows potential for emergent behavior that makes the game more interesting.Also this game is very pretty, and getting prettier with each update - particularly after they gave a huge overhaul to water surface.The game is single-player presently, with the *hope* according to the devs of eventually making it multiplayer.Personally I am looking forward to whenever they put multiplayer in the game.  Wanna make sealab cities and coop against raid boss tier massive sea monsters.I would say 'consider buying this now if it interests you enough from videos you see of people playing it.'  Otherwise you can definitely 'wait but keep an eye on this for when it is finished or close to finished.'			"

As for updates, the devs are constantly working to add new content, so just when you think you've seen it all, there's something new on the horizon.

								Subnautica is very smooth and entertaining. It is updated monthly and the new content is always flawless. The only downside is the lack of multiplayer. It is like Rust underwater, but smoother and better oppurtunities for exploration. If you like underwater exploration or base building, this is the game for you. However, if you want underwater combat then what is in the game right now is simply ways to avoid other wildlife and coexist. This is a game about science, discovery, and exploration. Food and Water are important resources that can be gathred in a vareity of ways as well.			"

I am very interested in seeing how they add a content that will keep people playing long after they have built the largest sub in the game. Everyone that has played this game want's there to be co-op and I agree with them. But as it stands the game is extremely fun and impressive. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK :D			"

								Loved Subnautica, racked up over 100 hours of playtime and decided to buy it on Steam because XB1 is a glorified media center. Pros:- Provides hours of relaxed fun with heart-wrenching moments of near-zero oxygen and horribly large creatures attacking you.- The game is beautifully desgined and set.- The level of exploration is surprising and continually replayable.- The crafting system is intuitive and resource finding is well-balanced.- Immediately sets itself appart from the typical open world survival game.- The devs are transaparent about the game, its direction and what's happening.- It is updated frequently on normal and moreso on BETA.- Bug crashes have almost stopped ruining game play and you can easily do 10/15 hour playthroughs without issue.Cons:- Controller support seems dependent on Widows updates being patched.- Frame rate will drop every so often as you cross over map sections but it's minimal and recovers quickly on PC. Barely even an issue but still a slight con.- Texture pop-in can be an irritation.- You will often find wrecks floating above the water and lifepods missing. (minor inconvenience)			"

								Open world survival exploration is getting quite common nowadays, first you start off with nothing than hunt for food, water and resource for making weapons and structures. But this is different, you’ll get to do it underwater where surviving in the deep pitch black darkness.No one will hear your cries in the depths of hell.But for first time players, you’ll probably be tearing most of the time in the life pod as it will be your most visit haven when you venture too deep and die.Some may be curious or easily agitated when you found a life form called Crash when you get close to it, it is like a homing missile waiting to explode in your face. For players that just started the game will never expect it untill when you notice it is swimming to you. #TearsSurvivingOXYGENWhats unique in this survival game is there is an additional element to consider in underwater survival is oxygen, as you dive deeper into the depths of hell it gets darker and pressure starts kicking in, as you happily explore the seabed getting your awesome loot you notice your SeaGlide ran out of power and forgot to prepare your spare oxygen tanks, or construct your Seamoth or Cyclops before your grand adventure into the depths, you’ll know you are doomed. But do not panic, try to look for a Fauna called Purple Brain Coral, it produce oxygen bubbles and it can replenish 10 oxygen for each bubble.Another Tool that is quite useful is the Air Bladder activating it will act like a buoyancy and send you floating back to the surface, it can save you as it is faster than swimming up.FOOD & WATERFood is everywhere, the fishes in the sea can be eaten raw at a cost of decreasing your water. So it's best to have it cooked at the Fabricator or by swinging your Heat Blade at the poor fish. But try not to cook too much than what you are required to, as cook food will start to rot over time.Water can be found on fishs when you cook them as well, but to make Filtered water by using the Airsack at the Fabricator which only +20 on your water, i will recommend Disinfected Water as it +40 the only difference is using Bleach (Salt Deposit+Coral Chunk) rather than Airsack.Pros•	 Animations are quite well made (e.g Bulkhead, Docking)•	 Nice graphics.•	 Gets to build bases.•	 That underwater feels.•	 Aurora EXPLOSION.•	 You get to cry alone in your lifepod or in your seabase in the dark 500m deep.•	 Use Terraformer to build yourself a small cave. Make you feel like an EELCons•	 There is no random generated map.•	 No multiplayer (For now).•	 Some FPS drops in some locations.•	 Updates are kinda slow but worth the wait.•	 Still not enough content but I am sure it will be a promising game.•	 Minor Bugs (e.g Constructor can't build, Fabricator not working. Just restart the game. Really.)9/10 "

								There are very few games out there that make you really feel.From the moment you climb out of your escape pod to see your crashed ship and.... and nothing really, the horror and loneliness hits you like a wall. You are completely alone on this planet. Then there is the hunger and thirst that drive you to dive in and explore this incredible world, always going deeper into the darkness to find all this game has to offer. This game thrives on a hand crafted landscape and creatures to drive an incredible experience. At time of writing there are some bugs / issues but the developers are incredible and you can track what they are working on Trello to see the upcoming features. I was inspired to write a review which I never do, I believe it is one of the best single player experiences out there and well worth the low price.			"

								I shy way from alpha releases, but this game caught my eye, and I'm glad it did.  I got about 10 hours of gameplay out of it in it's current state, and am looking forward to new updates.Pros:* Nice graphics & beautiful world* Smooth gameplay* Instant transitions between crafts, bases, & world* Easy to use crafting* Intuitive pretty much everythingCons:* Bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking.  I haven't had a single crash or anything like that. "

								The most striking this about this game to me is that I didn't expect it to make me instinctively scared - but it did. Something about being underwater and vulnerable from all sides with foggy shapes off in the dimly lit depths that really gets under my skin - and probably yours as well.  As they keep adding in new kinds of threats to the player in the undersea world I hope that paranoia mounts *just enough* so that I never feel completely safe when I go to the edge of the shallows.As for the whole game: Overall it has a huge amount of potential long-term. It's already got a lot of attractive stuff about it right now.  Building structures is good. Underwater combat works pretty well.  The creature AI while unfinished shows potential for emergent behavior that makes the game more interesting.Also this game is very pretty, and getting prettier with each update - particularly after they gave a huge overhaul to water surface.The game is single-player presently, with the *hope* according to the devs of eventually making it multiplayer.Personally I am looking forward to whenever they put multiplayer in the game.  Wanna make sealab cities and coop against raid boss tier massive sea monsters.I would say 'consider buying this now if it interests you enough from videos you see of people playing it.'  Otherwise you can definitely 'wait but keep an eye on this for when it is finished or close to finished.'			"

								As far as I have played the game looks gorgeous in VR. I have an Oculus Rift and so far no flaws. Underwater environment looks perfect yet perhaps there are some minor issues while inside the floating vessel with objects messing up. Anyway, it is in alpha state so that is something that can be easily fixed. One thing I want to criticize the game is the lack of indications. You're thrown in the ocean with a world to dive and nothing clearly outlined on what to do, craft, inspect or whatever. Anyway, good game, great price (got it on sale) and nice VR experience.7/10 in my opinion			"

								Subnautica is very smooth and entertaining. It is updated monthly and the new content is always flawless. The only downside is the lack of multiplayer. It is like Rust underwater, but smoother and better oppurtunities for exploration. If you like underwater exploration or base building, this is the game for you. However, if you want underwater combat then what is in the game right now is simply ways to avoid other wildlife and coexist. This is a game about science, discovery, and exploration. Food and Water are important resources that can be gathred in a vareity of ways as well.			"

								There is nothing quite like lying on the roof of your escape pod, watching the sun set/rise over the burning wreck of your starship.Well, part from exploring the incredible underwater scenery while trying to avoid being eaten by one of the many terrors of the deep.I find Subnautica to be an excellent game, providing both 'Wow, pretty', and 'brown trouser' moments in equal measure. Yet, there always seems to be something new to see. Granted, this review is while the game is in early access, so that may be because the devs are constantly adding new features, zones, tech, fish, and so on, to the game, but even now, while they are still developing new stuff for the game, there is already so much to see and do.

								This overview is based off of the Power Nap build that was released on June 1stI have been following Subnautica for a while now and it has turned into a survival game that I love to enjoy when I am in the mood for some relaxing exploration with survival elements. While not difficult, the crafting, building and exploration is top notch.The player character is a member of a ship's crew that has crash landed on an oceanic world, filled with beautiful flora and wildlife, with a sprinkling of danger mixed in. The world under the waves is split between multiple biomes that provide the player with unique resources to be used in the game's simple but fun crafting system.Strengths:* Beautifully crafted environments give the player something interesting to explore, while also rewarding the player with new technology.* Crafting bases and Vehicles feels epic and worthwhile.* Seamless tiering of difficulty as the player adventures deeper and deeper under the water.* Amazingly transparent team of developers working on the game, taking player needs and turning them into game features. Their last release provided a solution to a long standing player need and their Trello is available for all to see.Weakness:* Look elsewhere if you are looking for a brutal survival experience, food and water are abundant especially when a fully functional base is built. Most predators can be avoided, the rest can be dealt with with specific tools that allows the player to escape.* Performance can be a serious issue to some, lots of pop in and stuttering movement, even with a strong rig. The game is still in Early Access, and the new features the developers have cooking looks fantastic (and frightening!). Even at this point, the game is worth the purchase and I have been enjoying every content release since I purchased the game!

								It is the late twenty-second century and a faceless protagonist has crashed landed on an ocean planet in the middle of a terraforming mission. He is the only survivor and the spacecraft, the Aurora, soon goes nuclear and turns a disproportionately small amount of the planet radioactive.Not to worry, because his escape pod is filled with just enough space age equipment to eat fish and yes, this guy is you. The goal of the game is to survive long enough to explore the planet.As a survival sandbox game, it will probably be compared to Minecraft quite a lot. It's a completely unrelated game, let's get that out of the way. There's very little in the way of building, mostly exploring.It's a very pretty game. The cartoonish art style is reminiscent of No Man's Sky and it has the most fantastic creatures. It can be unforgivingly hard at times, though, to actually maintain a seabase as it can actually leak. You will not be killing very much in the early game, as the most you'll have at that point is a small knife. Late game, you'll have a submarine, torpedoes, a freeze-gun, but you still won't be killing very much. It's mostly about going ""ooh"" and ""aah"" and the amazing looking game, which actually looks kind of awful on lower-end machines. You need a fairly decent computer for it to look really impressive.The developers are fairly reliable and it's a game about admiring everything instead of killing everything (though I imagine it would be fun to watch people try to, as most big fish will kill you) so I definitely recommend it.

								At first, this game will dissapoint you. But once you open the dev menus and turn off some non essential things, it at least gets good FPS. Otherwise, Subnautica is a great game filled with the right amounts of terror and adventure. Killing aliens, destroying ecosystems, what more could you want in a survival game? I wouldn't say perfect yet, and that's why it's early access. Don't expect this game to run like the youtubers run it. 4/5			"

Early Access Review
								First of all, let me thank Uknown Worlds for this wonderful game, and very special thanks to the world designers - the underwater world created by them is totally stunning, and the atmosphere of the game lets you feel completely submerged and swimming around searching for valuable resources, always looking out for various not-very-friendly (and utterly hostile) creatures trying to bite you.My personal diving experience is not as extreme as depicted in this game, but is quite notable, and I must say that this game has fully raised all of my underwater memories and it seems pretty much authentic to me - all the sounds, and the movements of my character.I'm watching this game for 1.5 years already, and only recently decided to buy it - unfortunately, too much games never get out of early access, and are not worth buying. The Unknown Worlds developers were pretty much active during this period, and although the progress does not seem very fast, but the game is already worth investing to encourage further work.However, I must note several really serious points:- The current food/water system is pretty tedious. Fish around the player's base depletes ridiculously fast, forcing the player move further each day just for the sake of getting food and water. Okay, but that's already done by all the other resources - they are not really plentiful, thus we have to constantly move around searching for them, and doing the same for food seems just overkill.- The current state of the seabase building is rather rudimentary - as soon as you construct the Cyclops, the seabase gets pretty much obsolete. The seabase definitely needs a way to create food - something like a fish tank, and a seaweed farm.- The water filtration machine is brilliant, but definitely needs an external inventory - it's fine if it will be craftable and you'll have to search for the blueprint, but as it is now the machine pretty much useless, as it can accumulate only one bottle of water.- Cyclops really lacks some functionality. Taking into account the technological development of Aurora, it just must have some mapping capabilities - even if will just store the sonar scanning data from the Seamoth, making it possible to review it; also it absolutely must have some navigation (actually even Seamoth should have it), maybe it should triangulate it's position from the beacons placed by the player, but this feature is really missing. Also, why Seamoth can be upgraded with a solar panel, but Cyclops can only work off power cells?- In its current state the game really lacks a story and some long-term goals. Otherwise it takes at most 10-20 hours (even without checking with the online wiki and maps) to get most of the map explored and run into nothing else to do.So, even putting aside the ""early access"" words, after almost 2 years of development we have a stunningly beautiful underwater exploration game with a very good map, rather solid game mechanics, absolutely no story,  and nothing for the player to do after a very short time. Calling it a ""sandbox"" is way too much, as the gameplay is too much focused on exploring, throwing everything else overboard - thus, after exploring all of the map (which is pretty small actually), the players stays wishing for further updates, which will hopefully bring much, much more.

Early Access Review
								At this time i don't know what could possibly derail this game as it is very playable and contains all you need for a proper experience so don't be afraid of the Early Access tag. So it's quite a safe investmenet unless devs decide to release a bad version and run away with the money. But i am getting ahead of myself here. Yes, It is a good game. Recommended to people who wish to marvel the beauty and deadliness of the sea. Map is not random so exploration and the joy of finding things and locations takes the drivers seat accompanied by survival which can be really something as it takes quite time before you are ready to build your first base. You are also no threat to the environment but they sure are to you. Takes a little while to even get the first knife which is your main tool early on. As for tips... well there are tons of wikis and guides but i strongly recommend to keep away from them early on. Let the beauty of the sea sink in and explore around. Hunt fish and make water out of the airsack fishes. Also this is good to know: Don't hoard titanium ingots. You are wasting time making them. You don't need them for anything in quite some time. Making ingots is pretty much standard in sandbox games but this game treats them differently. That's all. Buy the game. Enjoy the marvelous scenery and try to make your mark on it. You will need a good PC for the game. I upgraded my old rig capabilities for this game.			"

								I played 38+ hours but I have a slow pace. Right now there is about 20-25 hours content and it is top notch! There are bugs like memory leaks that show up after 8 hours of continuous play, graphics glitches (rather often I must admit) and the occasional well known bug that everybody knows about but nobody fixes.Despite those critics, this game is incredibly fun, full of drama, action and horror! Sometimes it's even hilarious, like when you do the hero and master all odds only to kill yourself by exiting the seamoth (a submarine-like vehicle) while it still floats ahead and rams you in the back.Graphics are very clean and perfectly fit for this game, sound and atmosphere is thrilling. The models and textures are really enjoyable on maximum settings (GTX-970 and it runs smoothly). They are very futuristic and feel Star Trek-ish sometimes.Just to get in the mood watch movies like: The Abyss, Leviathan or anything on this list, you won't be disappointed:http://www.imdb.com/list/ls004587557/ "

								Simply amazing. It's the underwater simulator I've wanted for a very long time.One thing I appreciate most is that the development of this game is completely transparent. There's a backend that anyone can look at and it's something all early access games should have.http://subnautica.unknownworlds.com/#/subnautica/checkinsYou can easily see what the developers have been and are up to.There's a major update at least once a month. The game is almost unrecognizable compared to where it was just half a year ago. I thoroughly enjoy exploring the alien sea even though the last time I played I got spooked and my sub was destroyed by something unseen. *sweats*The few glitches I've run in to have been patched out. I'll update the review as the game nears completion but for now I recommend it. It's worth full price.			"

								It truly is an immersive game apart from the lag and chunks not loading in until you get right infront of one. I can't wait until Mid May when this game will finally be released.  Edit: The lag is persistent, not when loading, but when I move, or it loads new chunks or if I make anything, I am fine with it right now because thta means the devs will be pushing out more content, but that is kindof a downside to Subnautica, it loads in chunks. I don't know how else they would do it but until they optimize the game more in the next update I will have to wait.			"

								Subnautica is a beautifully rich underwater exploration game with the unique, luscious artistic style from Unknownworlds Entertainment. The process of exloring, crafting and growing your underwater empire in Subnautica is really well designed so far, and I am very keen to see how it contiunes to develop. Yes, the game is very much still in development, so if you're after the polished, final article, hang fire for a bit: there are some bugs and lots more content still to be added. However, what is there already is quite substantial in extent, and is really stunningly presented. I thoroughly recommend Subnautica. Go! Buy it!			"

Early Access Review
								I can recommend this game because of two reasons: First, it is a very beautifull game that is a fresh drop in the ocean of survival sims out there. It is actually good fun already and showing promise being a unique idea with excellent execution. I have to admit though, for a lack of a save function (will be implemented early 2015) I haven't even touched the survival mode yet. I only played freeroam so far and after crafting everything there is to craft I use cheats every time I start a game (no oxygen restriction, no damage, fins and a seamoth is all I need :). I just love exploring and roaming the underwaterscape! For a game this early in development there is already a crapload to discover. Secondly, there is the devs themselves. If you ever wanted the chance to see the full potential of EA being actually taken advantage of and to good effect, giving the players the tools to have insight in the goings-on  of game development and give feedback that is taken into account, don't let this opportunity pass. The devs are very active on the official as well as on the steam forums and there are multiple daily updates of their Trello-page. Content is added at a rate that I would just call mindblowing (been playing since Earliest Access a few months ago) and at stunning quality. Bugs are present, but nothing game-breaking so far.I'm convinced the game will be finished within the next few years and receive great after-launch support (the latter was the case with the devs last game). It is a great concept with a very able and enthusiastic team behind it that shows some of the best community-interaction I have ever seen.			"

								Played it for about an hour, I've found I'm dying for one thing, MULTIPLAYER PLEASE DEVELOPERS. The exploration feature in would be on par with Minecraft if multiplayer was added. If the AI was increased and some more horrific creatures were added this game would already have a 9/10 from me. I'm keeping in mind this is an Early Access game.Wishes + Things I like:- If it had an edge of fear from larger and more variant fish types.- Some nasty marine life at night. As in nocturnal life. - Multiplayer. It would increase my hours of gameplay phenominally not to mention all my friends hours who would play this with me.- The concept and room for ideas in this is great.Cons:- It seems a little empty and I wish the graphics options were a bit more diverse. I cant turn up the render distance and its a little odd to suddenly see life spawning in front of me.  - Going in and out of bases seems little too instant and takes me out of the game quite harshly. - Switching between weapons has a bit more effort than necessary, making it scroll-able would be a great time saver instead of having to pause and go to your inventory screen and change numbers around.

								The game is beautiful and has a easy to learn crafting system. The game has you go around collecting material while trying to survive by avoiding dangerous creatures and eating and drinking. Use the materials to make tools to help with exploration and eventually you will build a home underwater. You can also make a terraformer which you use to form the land in your image. I loved every moment when playing and can not wait for more updates. You can build a submarine which allows you to be able to further explore the vast ocean in the game. There are not that many creatures and ways to defend your self yet but more will come in the future and by the time the game is release it will be a masterpiece. I also can not wait for new giant sea creatures to be added. Overall the game is beautiful and amazing and I would recommend this game to others.			"

								Subnautica is a game about exploration, survival, crafting, and building. Despite what some people may say, coming from me, who is a very critical person with games, this game is really good. The developers care about their game, update it atleast once a month, and in general I really have faith in this game. After playing for about 13 hours I was only about a quarter into this game. meaning that, yes, this game will literally take about 52 hours to explore/do everything. In summary, you wake up after crash landing desperately on a mysterious alien planet. You look around and just see a never ending ocean all around you and a gigantic crashed space ship that you could only assume you used to be in before you popped out of it with your pod.Graphics: 7.6/10 (Not amazing, but still a REALLY fun game)UI: 7.9/10 (Pretty simplistic, but nice)Animations: 6/10 (Most animations are good, except for the falling)Multiplayer: 0/10 (Not implemented)Singleplayer: 10/10 (Works great as a singleplayer game)Crafting: 10/10 (Simple, yet intuitive)Content Amount: 10/10 (Lots of content)Community: 8/10 (Not a very big community, mainly because no multiplayer)AI: 8.4/10 (Very well done, but sometimes glitches out)Base Building: 9.8/10 (Very easy to understand, and doesn't take many resources)Overall Rating: 8.6/10The reason I gave it this rating is because yes, the game is very well done, but the thing is that it doesn't have multiplayer, and is still in Early Access. I will probably do a revisit of this game once it's released (Hopefully it does release!) I do hope they also add multiplayer or else this game won't ever really have that big of a community.How many hours will you get out of this game no matter who you are?

								Superb visual and sound design produce a sublime, eery, and gorgeous experience. I love that this game isn't about driven by death, but rather thrives on atmospheric exploration and construction. While the survival aspect needs some more depth and content (we need base-building and some form of scientific research to conduct), this is still very early into development, and I have nonetheless had a fantastic time. Indeed, I am still reeling from my first encounter with one of the giant creatures alive in the game's alien world.If you're looking for a brilliant underwater exploration game, and want to help with the development process (the developers have made it extremely easy to give feedback in-game), I highly recommend Subnautica.

								I have had my eye on this game for a long time now and I did not plan to buy it until full release. The addition of Vive support and the fact that it is close to coming out of early access persuaded me to click the buy button.This review is based on monitor gameplay. The VR implementation has only just been recently added and I don't think it would be fair to judge this game by it's VR implementation.This is a really good game, but constant freezing and framerate drops have made it extremely frustrating to play. I have an I7 plus a 1080 (the game seems to be pretty much cpu dependant) but the more you play/explore the more freezing and framerate drops occur. I didn't expect to see such massive performance issues on a game so close to the end of early access.If you are planning to buy this game then I would say wait until the game is optimized and then buy it.

								If you enjoy playing open world survival games, you will probably love this game. This has been easily one of my favorites in this genre. However in its current state I can not recommend it, unless you don't mind unexpected crashes and frame drops. Probably one of the worst experiences I have had with an early development game.All that said, I am looking forward to picking this game back up once it is fully realease. I'll probably change my recomendation to ""yes"" if the game is better by then			"

Not recommended for this reason, Please update devs so we can give this game the good review it deserves			"

Early Access Review
								I've played and followed the development of this game for a while, and think it's a amazing game and will recommend that people buy it but not now for the following reasons.One is that the game in recent months took a heavy turn in fleshing out a story for the game, and as a early access player I feel like i'd never get the same experience as someone who gets to experience the story new in its entirety. If you wait till this game leaves early access a blind play will be a much better experience.Second is that over the course of the months I followed this game the demands it puts on system preformance has ramped up considerably, to the point where I'd say the minimum listed requirements is practically false advertising. I went from no framerate issues when I bought the game to booting it up on the day I wrote this and getting 1-5fps. It needs a lot of work on optimsation, dont even consider buying if you are between minimum and recommended requirements: I exceed recommended and the game is already unplayable for me.I personally enjoy the survival sandbox aspect more, and enjoy exploring the amazing environment this game produces but I respect their decision for a less hardcore more story orientated game and would recommend this game once it has left early access for the sake of enjoying the story as a whole and if you have a very modern and powerful PC.

Early Access Review
								Very cool game, for the first couple days I played, now I find it's true that as you spend more time in game you begin to experience awful skipping, lagging, poor fps and downright crashes to the point I can no longer play more than a few minutes at a time without a crash. Initially I had flawless gameplay and framerate. If they fix THIS issue I will say that I would recommend it, but as it is I cannot recommend, sadly. Other than that the game runs great, looks fantastic and has massive potential! I just hope they correct this well documented and frequently complained about issue of crashing.-A word of warning to anyone looking to buy the game, this fps/crashing issue seems to affect most people as time goes by, regardless of their pc build and specs. There are supposed workarounds, but they have their own problems and shortcomings.			"

								I love this game, I really do - That being said, I can't in good conscious recommend this game to anyone as it stands right now. My reasoning behind this is that at this current stage in the game, the framerate is so unstable that I can hardly get anything done - even after removing the files that were recommend by countless people, Youtubers included. Because this game loads in chunks, it causes a lot of stuttering which eventually leads into a full on crash, not to mention objects appearing and disappearing at random.All that aside, this is a beautiful game - from the biomes down to the fauna. The story is very interesting and I can't wait to see what the devs have in store for the full release. I just hope they'll fix the framerate issues so the game is actually playable.			"

								This game is pretty good, it's not usually my sort of game but I am now a complete convert. I am in awe of the crafting system and the things you have to do in order to progress further through the game.  This early access title is far more polished than a lot of so-called finished games.The only bad things I have experienced is some terrible frame drops, this runs at around 120fps with maxxed out settings but occasionally it will drop to single digits for about 2 seconds before shooting back up to the 3 figure frames, I put this down to Early Access and optimisation.I fully recommend this title at it's price as there is so much content. And the best bit is I havent even tried the VR side of the game yet as I thought I'd play it just for a bit to get used to the controlls etc but then got sucked into it.Great game, go buy it.			"

Compared to other survival games it is different but fun. Can't wait for another update ... granted i havent done al i can yet by any means. For an early access game it shows a positive outlook. Would recommend if on sale or as a gift. the price seems to be right but it all depends on where they take it, who knows?			"

Early Access Review
								THIS IS AN EARLY BUILD OF THIS GAME!!!!Keep that in mind when reading this, as things could change and get better. The players of this game and I are all working very hard with the developer to find and report bugs so that when this game releases, it will be flawless.That being said, this game does have a good number of bugs, some of which are recurring and some of which make playing the game difficult, if not impossible. The game, however, is in a state in which, if you don't mind running into a few bugs, it is playable. Fixing game breaking bugs is as easy as leaving the game and coming back sometimes, as well, so it's not like you're going to lose anything.The game has a compelling story, and at one part, it ripped my heart out of my chest and stompped it into the dirt as I realized that I wasn't going home. Hat's off to the developer for making such an extraordinary thing. I can't wait until the game is fully released.TL;DRIf you play Elite: Dangerous, it's kind of like that, only underwater, and there's no one to interact with. You complete long, drawn out, but incredibly simple tasks, and try to survive. Overall, it's fun and I recommend it.			"

If it hasn't killed you before, it can still probably kill you. If you haven't seen it before, it can probably kill you. If it looks friendly, it will still most likely kill you. If it can kill you, it will kill you. Just about everything can kill you. Swim away. Almost EVERYTHING wants you dead.Its a good game, a little difficult to explore while you are hiding from everything, but it makes it more fun.

								What a game.If you love the ocean and love exploration, or just love good games, you'll love Subnautica. It's challenging at times, terrifying at times, but most importantly always enjoyable. Whether it's building underwater bases, crafting new items and submersibles, or just standing (or indeed swimming) in awe of the beautiful sights and sounds of a lovingly crafted environment packed with fascinating alien flora and fauna, this game is utterly riveting.Despite being in Early Access, Subnautica feels pretty damn complete to me, and is a thoroughly enjoyable experience even without the story promised in the final release. It feels good to play and enjoy a polished, fun game whilst knowing that even more is still to come - regular updates bring fresh experiences every time. It's got to be said, Subnautica is a fintastic game and well worth the money.			"

Early Access Review
								OK! So I've been trying to write a review on this game for a while now, because I love it so freaking much. So let's start with Pro vs Con:Pro:-VERY Active Development team (Content patch usually once a month)-Very immersive gameplay-Absolutely collosal playable area-As freeform as freeform can possibly get-Lots of content (I'm still discovering new stuff)I could go on. No, really. I could go on. But with the good, must come the bad, what little of it there is.Con:-No multiplayer/Co-Op (For me would make the game nearly flawless)-Lack of any truly effective self-defense weapons makes predators tiring to deal with.-Day/Night cycle is a little fast-I'm genuinely scraping the barrel to try to find this game's faults, because frankly, there aren't many.ANYWAYS.This game is an absolute thrill to play, and a joy to get completely immersed in, but therein lines a slight problem. It is VERY easy to get sucked into this game and spend countless hours of your time doing something that you think could take only a few minutes. But all in all, a great game with a very active development team, which means theres always stuff being added to the game. Money well spent, in my opinion.			"

But the game is incomplete.If your someone who would like to help the devs by pointing out all the glitches and give feedback to them while they improve the game. Go for it. They update the game every few months or so that really improve the game as a whole.If your someone who wants the full experience right then and now. Best to avoid it until this game is complete.

Keep up the good work creating more creatures, stuff, and abilities!  Love it!!			"

								I haven't had this much fun in a new game for such a long time. Such a huge area to explore, so many unexpected places. Cave systems that are incredibly large with all kinds of liveforms. The way to learn new things is amazing aswell. You have to keep exploring the world to find new tech to use. A lot of jump scares aswell which is fantastic. It obviously is in Early acess so there are bugs. Lags of all sorts. But still unimaginable fun none the less. Found this other station by other survivors down in a mushroom cave and by all the signs they had been long gone from there to another location. Or presumbly dead.I cannot recommend this game enough! I've played my save already for about 14 hours. Steam time has got it wrong i believe. I'll most likely be playing this game for months to come. I still have loads yet to discover. Plenty of things to do and they do update the game frequently I've been told. So I wont be running out of things to do any time soon I believe.			"

								This is an amazing game, i definitley recommend. If you're experiencing bugs, maybe try the experimental build, you can choose this by going to the game properies via steam and going to the beta selection and pick it there. That has updates around the clock and fixes most things right away.You can put a submarine in a submarine. Who doesn't want to do that? I was going down as far as i could with the Cyclops (biggest sub). I went too far and the hull started to breach. I was drowning, while the sub filled with water and sunk me further. That was a good day.11/10			"

								Subnautica...This game is not like many other early access titles,this one actually delivers great content.The graphics are very good,the gameplay is smooth and feels great,the soundtrack is just amazing,it scares you easily.The story is intriguing and mysterious,overall a great game.However,this is not only a survival game,no,this is an horror game disguised as a survival game,don't get fooled,the graphics and concept might be simple and not scary but when you get deep in the ocean,the game goes from a survival game to an intense horror game.I can honestly tell you if you should buy it:Do you like survivalDo you like horror?Do you like the seaAnd do you like crafting?So Subnautica is for you(See what I did there xD)			"

								Yes, this game is still in development and needs some tweaking to the lag issues, but if you're willing to overlook that then you're in for a real treat! Subnautica brings a whole new meaning to the word, ""survive"". It's one of those games that has the players teach themselves how to play rather than hand them everything on a silver platter. The game also can get pretty terrifying when encountering hostile beings or when it turns to nighttime on the planet. Overall, I'd give this game a solid 8.5/10 for limitless creativity, beautiful sound composition, unique and well-designed creatures, and a challenging yet highly addicting and enjoyable premise.

								Subnautica is simply my favorite game of all time.There's something about this game that I especially love, but can't quite put my finger on. The game is graphically beatiful, with incredibly atmospheric moments of fear and awe.  The creature designs are fasinating, majestic and terrifying.  The biomes range from sparse expanses of barren sea to claustrophobic caverns.  But there is something else about the game that makes it so special to me......the friendly community and the brilliant devs?...the imersive sound design and music?...the mysterious lore?...the creative base building aspects of the game?...the extremely open development of the game, where we get to see everything as its being worked on?No, it's the sense of exploration this game gives.  This is the pinnicle of exporation games.  It's a well designed game in many aspects, but the overwhealming sense to explore just makes this game that much more incredible.  Oceans are already alien enough, but an Alien ocean?  The concept itself just screams interesting, and Unknown Worlds has done an incredible job pulling it off.			"

								As of the 6th May 2016 update, fish now respawn.In theory, it still doesn't answer the long run ressource depletion, but lots of progress have been made, enough to make the game enjoyable again in my opinion.With farming, solar panels, fish respawn and the ability to fully recycle constructed elements, I don't see depletion as a pressing issue, as a big part of the daily consumption can be streamlined, and the ocean will look more alive again.Thanks a lot to the devs for listening to the crowd through the heated but necessary ressource respawn debate. Review happily changed to recommended!###Initial review (deprecated).Firstly, let's clarify something: Get this game and play it, you'll have fun. I want to give the lovely Subnautica a big thumbs up, and I thought I would.... then I realized something after hours in the game:Ressources don't respawn. None, ever. Fish, plants, minerals.I almost can't believe it. This is simply a huge deal breaker. I went from super happy playing the game to hardly willing to launch it anymore.Infinite consumption of finite ressources is the long term horizon of the game, which means it's a checkmate from the start, no matter how well you manage. In a nutshell, a growing radius around your base(s) will gradually become a dead zone, and you'll have to make longer and longer trips to places that haven't been plundered yet.It means you can never reach equilibrium, a goal that's a huge motivator for me, unless you plan to stay in your base eating your crops all day, and that death and emptiness will prevail no matter what.It is also inconsistent with the idea of being immersed in an ecosystem, which is the driving point of the game.Yes, there is a welcomed farming update, a step in the right direction but it does not adress the long term inevitable doom of finite ressources and growingly depressing dead oceans. Where is the pleasure of exploring a thriving one, like on our enchanting first dive?And how does it make sense that fishes in a tank can reproduce, but not in the wild?Even if the player didn't exist, the oceans would soon be void of fishes just by the sheer actions of the predators constantly eating and chasing!This dev choice is not even consistent with the will to design living, coherent ecosystems (while still maintaining the fun). This is NOT how things happen in nature! Incentive to explore should not rely on irreversible and total depletion: that's never why I went exploring in the first place. In the very long term, exploration cannot mathematically even be accomplished, because the point will be reached when doing so consumes more ressources than it yields.It's pretty sad that such a great game is dragged down by this, although some might not object.To get a more complete tour of the issue and make up your mind, please check:http://steamcommunity.com/app/264710/discussions/0/527273789693374590/#p1 "

								Give this game a try. Just do it, do it now.This is a really solid open-world, survival game, and it's still only in early access. It's hard to know where to begin, there are so many ways in which this game already nails it while still having build up and potential as the devs work on it.This isn't an action game where you go in to kick butt and destroy everything. This isn't a building/devolopment game where you get to a place of complexity that gameplay collapses in on itself and has no longevity after the initial challenges are met. This isn't a puzzle game where there's a right and wrong answer to what you're supposed to do with a defined order of gameplay. This isn't a game with training wheels on it that's forgiving of all your mistakes while merely tricking you into thinking it's ""open world.""This is a game that comes in and takes its place with as much simplicity or complexity as you want. You can call the shots and do things in the order you want, accomplish various aspects of survival organically without (currently at least) a plot driving you into a set storyline for game development. It submerses you in a world that is familiar yet altogether alien with new surprises coming frequently with updates. It allows you to build and develop your own experience without feeling cramped by a short-sided goal system that micromanages your every move. You can gather just enough resources that you're not in a constant state of emergency, and yet you are driven to keep exploring, keep gathering, keep doing more and working your way into the world of water you're stranded on.If you have any appreciation for exploration, self-paced gameplay, gorgeous imagery, survival, and suspense and intensity without people shooting at you, zombies attacking, or a ticking clock... then go and dive into Subnautica and see for yourself how awesome this game is.

Early Access Review
								Another survival game! Oh god! Or at least that’s what I thought before playing it; in one word I would say the graphics are Brilliant! I really found myself lost in the not only the sheer beauty of the game, but the submersion is like few others I have run across- I really feel as if I’m in the world and to me that’s something I always count as a major deciding factor in first person shooters/survival games. The only complaint I have is the game has a very weak story line, I often wonder if there’s a grand design or point for the game’s grand final; is it going to be quest oriented like the fallout or elder scrolls somehow? Are you going to be able to play with others online? (that would be a beautiful thing), or is it just going to be open world, defend yourself against underwater animals while trying not to starve, drown, or finally just die of boredom. I mean the graphics are truly fantastic, and the game play is out of this world, but it lacks the feel of accomplishment outside of crafting equipment, building an underwater base (which at this point in the game’s construction is still very limited in content). Granted I’ve only played the game a total of 20+ hours and it’s still very much in development, but I would really like to see something to enhance the storyline and add substance to character development. Thank you for reading!    "

								At first, I was frightened because I thought the developer, Unknown Worlds, found my secret diary and read through it. However, it was not long before I realized the situation was more dire than I could have ever imagined: They could read my thoughts, my dreams and hopes, my deepest, darkest desires... And they used that information to make a game they KNEW I wouldn't be able to resist playing.Subnautica is, in short, AMAZING. Both strikingly beautiful and challenging, even in its Early Access state, its completely playable and play you will. I admit, I have not been a fan of crafting / survival games, having avoided most opportunities (such as MineCraft and DayZ) but Subnautica delivered the concept in a package that seemed perfect for me to finally dip my toes in the water.You'll find yourself forgetting to breathe due to the wonderfully realized environments and the creative and gorgeous flora & fauna design. While alien in design, they still feel familiar without being derivative. I can not wait to see what new lifeforms and environments Unknown Worlds comes up with next!Being an underwater survival / crafting game, one may be worried about the controls in this aquatic world. Do not fret, the controls are VERY intuitive and responsive. Swimming through the water is a breeze, whether it's just you or your crafted submersibles. While there is not too much to craft yet, the system is still robust enough to keep you occupied, as you'll want to push further into the depths to discover what lies beneath. However, be careful as there are not really any weapons, per say (other than some different knives)! The world is as dangerous as it is beautiful.Subnautica is basically the game I've always wanted, but never realized that I did. Unknown Worlds has, on their hands, what I think may be one of the most fun experiences I've ever had the opportunity to play, and I can not wait to see what they come up with next for the breathtaking world of Subnautica. Thank you, Unknown Worlds, for making this game (and for not actually reading my secret diary).Pros:----------- Gorgeous, breath-taking environments- A day cycle that is calming and playful in aesthetic- A night cycle that is absolutely stunning due to the crazy amounts of bio-luminescent lifeforms- Creative and fun creature and plant design- Smooth, intuitive controls- A fun, though somewhat limited (for now), crafting system- It's all about underwater survival -- No land lubbers here- Observation decks for my base -- nearly 360 degree views of the ocean around me- That reminds me: You can build an amazingly intricate underwater base!- Regular updates from a dev. team that is passionate about their project- From what I can see, a very responsive development team that responds to the community regularlyCons:----------- Some creature / plant / environment interactions seem a bit limited at this point- A fun, though somewhat limited (for now), crafting system- I have to wait for more content (but it will be worth every minute)Favorite moment (so far): Took my Seamoth submersible out into the deep ocean, beyond the Kelp Forest, and saw a lifeform in the distance. As I moved in closer, I realized it was MASSIVE and looked like a giant alien squid. Not knowing if it was hostile or friendly, I got scared and quickly booked it back to my base at the edge of the  Safe Shallows.			"

The game looks amazing but runs pretty heavy even on a GTX 1080.In saying that man I’m glad i bought it, this game is incredible, and it's the best single player experience I’ve had since Half Life!Seriously No Mans Sky should have given their budget and resources to this team to make the game for them, because this is how NMS should have been!Speaking of, can you imagine this game if it got space flight and multiple planets?

								The atmosphere of this game is amazing. Especially at night, in which the creepiness definitely takes hold. Of course there are a few bugs, such as the habitat builder not always locking to a position you like...But it is an early access game after all, and minor bugs aside, this is a fantastic game for people who like to be afraid of the environment they survive in.

								Oh man. How can I sum up this game without writing a long review detailing how beautiful, impressive, and scary the vast ocean that encompasses Subnautica? There is no way. Subnautica has easily become one of my favorite games.The devs are constantly updating it with new content, both scary and awe inspiring alike; from the tiniest starfish to the most terrifying and long anticipated leviathans that hunt you from the deepest, darkest depths. Though this isn't specifically a horror genre, it brings to light all the fears one might have of large, intimidating creatures arising from out of the deep blue and yet still keep you intrigued and curious about discovering the secrets that the game world has to offer.TL;DR stop reading reviews and just buy this game already! And be sure to play with a good headset ;)			"

								Solid with plenty to do (the most so of any early access game I've played). Regular and content rich updates. Easily worth the price tag in its current state and will work out to be a complete steal after future updates.Looks, controls and sounds great. The underwater atmosphere can be serene or daunting depending on how deep you go and what biomes you're exploring. If you're bathophobic, prepare to scream internally.			"

Early Access Review
								Subnautica is a fantastic game and is worth more than it costs despite being an early access title. I've been playing almost nothing but this game for weeks, I've been utterly captivated by it. There are so many amazing moments in this game: awe-inspiring beauty, utter fear, truly rewarding exploration, the satisfaction of really earning your progress, building cool bases and vehicles. The game is just well-designed and has a wealth of content. The world of Subnautica is a fleshed-out, living, breathing world of which you are just a small part. You are part of the ecosystem, not the master of it. The creatures are varied and have their own motivations and behaviours based on their diet and territory. The sound design in the game is phenomenal. While navigating the environment you can tell what creatures are around you by sound alone, and tell their mental state as well. The music is awe-inspiring, tailored to the environment and situatiion, gorgeous and affecting, it fits perfectly in every location and mood. And the game is beautiful. Not well-rendered, or competent, but beautiful and real in all the good ways that most games aren't.There are minor caveats, which is to be expected due to it's early access status. There are a few, very minor glitches or bugs but for the most part the game is bug free even at this stage. What few bugs or glitches I encountered were very minor and didn't really affect gameplay.There are a few things worth mentioning though. I did experience a few system crashes while playing, but it's possible this was due to how my graphics cards was set up as I changed some settings and it hasn't reoccured since.You have ONE save file for the game. If it becomes corrupted (as happened to me several times) you will lose everything. I recommend backing up your save files if you are enjoying the game, You can easily look up how to do this. If you are considering playing this game you neeed to respect the system requirements. The game renders large areas in significant detail continually. If your computer is more that a few years old I'd think twice about playing Subnautica.I have a few qualms about how item acquisition and data about locations of interest are handled in the game. Without giving too much away, as you progress through the game you explore, then acquire and build items and vehicles. Once you have a vehicle the game really opens up for you, and if you are unlucky and aren't able to get a vehicle & the means to build it the game slows to a crawl and can become frustrating. The game also provides you with ""clues"" about interesting spots in the game, which is good, but the way this is handled involves a lot of unnecessary steps and is quite wonky.And lastly one design decision: Subnautica is a game about exploration, that puts you in the middle of a detailed, rich, alien world, puts you to the task of seeking it out but refuses to give you a map. It's a pretty conflicted decision to say the least. Apparently two previous inccarnations of the game had maps in them, but it has been removed and there are no plans to reinstate it. I have to say I understand partly why they went with this design decision, it has merits and flaws, and there are ways to ""map"" the world in the game. They went with a way that forces you to be more hands on and personal in the process of exploring, and that has some definite pros to it so I'd say this is a neutral decision at worst and not a bad one.In summation: if you like good games, if your computer is competent, if you want to support a good early access title that is already in an impressive state, if you enjoy having your jaw drop in the presence of staggering beauty, or the satisfaction of a job well done, or holding your breath out of mind-freezing fear then play Subnautica. I can honestly say it's one of the best games I've played in years, possibly ever, and it's not even done yet. I can't wait to see what comes next.			"

								Probably should have written a review earlier. I just really enjoy this game. Even in it's testing phase, it has so much to offer, and the devs really keep you wanting to come back over and over.It has a little of something for everyone. Don't want the stress of survival? Ok. It's got it. Or, want super hardcore survival? It's got that too! And of course, just normal survival. Even without being a randomly created world, when you restart a new game, it feels ""different"". There's also more content in this game, than most new AAA titles that have come out recently. Can you see everything? You can. That isn't a bad thing. By the time you have seen everything, you look at your hours played and say, ""Wow...that's more time than I've spent on most other games"". It's early access, and I was hesitant about purchasing it because of that. I've seen many a game just sit in limbo in early access. Not this one. The devs are always working on new content. You don't get weekly updates of huge new things, but it's mostly trickled out. What I enjoy about that, is you can play a new game, get far into, stop. Come back to it a month or more later, and there's a bunch more new stuff you want to see. Lastly, the devs seem to keep their promises. X feature is usually added. They also don't seem to give you false information on when X feature is being added, unless they are sure it's ready. They do have an experimential version of the game you can get quicker updates from, but are less stable. It's worth $20. If it's less, it's a steal.			"

								This game rocks.  I keep seeing consistant updates from dedicated developers.  It is relaxing and exciting.  It appeals to the adventurer in me yet the underwater diving is relaxing....well sometimes it can be tense.....Reaper...need I say more.  Anyways, this game is a have to have.  I highly recommend and if you are concerned about it being early dev, don't be.  They update on a regular basis, the developers are responsive to constructive feedback, and this game is b e a utiful.  Every major update I have to start over so I can see the new stuff.  You would think that I would be upset at losing progress, but every major change also has changed the dynamics of my focus on gather materials. Therefore it is like playing a different game.   For example, acid mushrooms were edible but are not edible anymore.  However, I can also get food easier than before with my heat knife.  BEST INVENTION.  Good for food on the run.Enough rambling already...buy the game and try it out.  Really,  Your gonna kick yourself if you don't.			"

								This is an amazing game, i definitley recommend. If you're experiencing bugs, maybe try the experimental build, you can choose this by going to the game properies via steam and going to the beta selection and pick it there. That has updates around the clock and fixes most things right away.You can put a submarine in a submarine. Who doesn't want to do that? I was going down as far as i could with the Cyclops (biggest sub). I went too far and the hull started to breach. I was drowning, while the sub filled with water and sunk me further. That was a good day.11/10			"

								Despite the game being far from its official release date, and my fear of early access disappointment, I took the PLUNGE with Subnautica. The prospect of underwater survival was just too mouthwatering to resist, and having been obsessed with submarines from a young age, could not turn down the offer. I'll also do my best to review this without spoiling the game, because it's the mystery that makes it fun.Subnautica is beautiful in every aspect. The visuals, the variety of biomes, flora and fauna, and the sound effects are spine tingling. The ingredients of the game allow for exploration, hardcore survival and a huge element of creativity. From prepping deep sea dives, to creating lavish sea bases, it's all there.What's more - it's horrifying. Once you go beyond the familiar start-of-game biome, you'll discover there are more things out there to kill you. You go from apex predator to bottom-of-the-chain prey in split seconds. But you'll only ever find out once you get too close, and by then it's too late. It's a quick learning curve. Bone chilling growl? Teeth? NOPE.In a way it's like Minecraft, meets Depth, meets Silent Hunter. You have the harvesting of resources like Minecraft, the fear of predators like Depth, and the claustrophobia of Silent Hunter. Maybe throw in a bit of Amnesia: The Dark Descent too.			"

								The developers mention that the early acess is the nucleus of the game. And I have to say that that nucleus is solid. This game is extremely immersive and relaxing. The underwater environment is gorgeous and vast. You feel like the ocean has swallowed you up, and you're there to stay. And, the colors of this underwater environment are vibrant.  There is an abundance of fascinating marine life everywhere you look. Some creatures look, and are very menacing. Others are docile.  You can lose track of time in this game. As I found myself building my underwater base, without a clue of the passing time. The vehicles that you already have acess to are real neat. And I'm sure they'll add more. With more and more additions to this game, and constant improvements this is sure to be an awesome game when finished. In early acess I find it very enjoyable, much more so than games I've spent fifty dollars on.			"

								As far as I actually played Subnautica, considering its early state of development, it is highly recommendable. The last unterwater experience I enjoyed goes back to Aquanox (the first and better part). Of course, Subnautica is far away from a Aquanox like gameplay, but I'd like to compare the environmental aspects. In terms of emersion, Subnautica is yet both genius and genuine. A subnautical world with its own flora and fauna so emersive that you want to stay in the game for hours, even when it's not finished yet. The only questionable fear I have about Subnautica is, that when it is done, you're also done with it. And with 'done' I mean that you simply have enough from the subnautical environment. There are many possibilities for crafting and hunting and so on of course. But let's face it, it is a very limited environment to play in. At least this is what I personally think. But as always I'm quite curious to see what the developers will put into the game and how they are going to enhance the experience. At this point I recommend this game very much. Not only because of Subnauticas unique gameplay and environment, but for the great love and patience the developers put into it. For those who face a phobia about underwater / divings - don't use it with VR :-P			"

								Although it does recommend to have a such beefy computer to run Subnautica, I almost have no trouble running it with only a maximum of comfortable 18 Frames Per Second without crashing or overclocking. The ambience and the enviroment is absolutley stunning. You can almost do anything inside Subnautica from chasing Peepers, to getting chased by a Reaper Levithan. This is one of the most popular underwater sandbox you will set foot- (Er, Flippers!)in. Most people do show off their seabase or vehicle creations in Subnautica's Community Artwork section, From building a base inside the Aurora full of giant monsters, to building a base on a island, surrounded by unusual trees (and probably wildlife soon!).Do I recommend you this game? Of course as long you can handle it's hunger for computer power!			"

Early Access Review
								Subnautica - the cool oceanic diving game in the glory of its post-beta, here my journey begins. (this review was based on ""Freedom"" mode as I just wanted to see what the game is really about in the beginning, so I will probably update this review once I get into survival mode. Keep scrolling down to the pros and cons for the game far below if you don't wanna read the stuff below.) 2016@0.1h   Launching game:   Successful!   Attempting to climb out of escape pod: Unsuccessful (still happens from time to time when I hold on to an item while doing so) Initiating quitting-to-desktop: Unsuccessful at first try, ""Subnautica stopped working"".20170.2-1hLaunching game:   Successful!  Starting another attempt to climb out of escape pod:   Successful!    (you can do it with the default breathing tank!) Diving 40+ meters below water:   Successful!    Dodging quantum detonation inside escape pod in time:    Successful!  Exploring caves without dying from an explosive fish charging at me:   Unsuccessful.  1-2h Finally got a knife to defend myself from stalkers. Finally have loads of Oz tanks to go further into the ocean.  Winning a hand-to-hand combat with a stalker without losing any health:   Successful!   The next stalker ate my knife, and lowered my health to 3.  Loading the last save where I still had the knife:   Successful!   Attempting to retrieve a stalker tooth from a stalker: in progress... Attempting to quit the game to desktop:   Unsuccessful.  (yet again) Impression within the first few hours: With soothenting background music, alien oceanic life forms and their exotic cries echoing throughout the ocean, Subnautica really emerses you into its beautifully crafted alien oceanic planet with almost everything to do under the surface of the ocean (jumping  on a floating giant ray's back  hardly counts, sorry).Everything feels calm, relaxed and approachable (optimal if you have faster means to approach them of course), accompanied by the deep gruntings  of the massive rays and gasy glowing fishes  at night, this oceanic survival game creates you a grand scene with occassional surprises.  Pros: - Immersive environment settings of oceanic biome- Beautifully and delicately designed sea creatures in detail: fishes, corals, rays, seaweeds, etc- 3 game modes to choose from, feels loads of flexibility: Survival, Freedom, Creating, feeds the appetite of different crowds- Well composed background music to boost up the mood in the slow-progressing world filled with unexplored excitements- the material fabricator works in such a cool way, it beams all your crap found in the ocean back to their futuristic lives.  Cons: - Still pretty buggy: as mentioned above, the game contains bugs including making your knife invisible (even if you still have it in your quick slot and inventory), breathing sound from Oz tank while above surface, and a semi-transparent alien big moon that indicates the time of the night. - Unfinished materialisation of the items in-game (i'm yet sure if it's a bug for me, or the game glitched out on it): such as the  black cubes with question marks on them  which should be in the form of writhing weed samples, etc- The medikit fabricator is so broken, that it produces medikit outside of escape pod while the animation doesn't even work most of the time when you open & close its door. But still, thankfully you can still obtain medikits from it.- The game is always saddened each time by me trying to exit the game and would not quit properly every time I do.   Overall: 7/10  So far, it's been a really fun diving/crafting/surviving game and a cool exploring game for me, with more bug fixes in the future, this game is worth giving a shot, especially if you're a surviving game lover who digs good graphics and have the persistency to collect and craft your way back into space over time.

This early access title is far more polished than a lot of so-called finished games.The only bad things I have experienced is some terrible frame drops, this runs at around 120fps with maxxed out settings but occasionally it will drop to single digits for about 2 seconds before shooting back up to the 3 figure frames, I put this down to Early Access and optimisation.I fully recommend this title at it's price as there is so much content. And the best bit is I havent even tried the VR side of the game yet as I thought I'd play it just for a bit to get used to the controlls etc but then got sucked into it.Great game, go buy it.			"

								I don't usually play (or trust) alpha games, especially now there're millions of mediocre survival/exploration whatnot early access games on steam. But this is something else. As a kid I always fantasized a game where you play as a fish and swim through the vast occean, from warm surface water w/ dolpins and♥♥♥♥♥♥to the deep dark unexplored caves w/ underwater forrest and hugeass maneating octopuses. That's this game. Except you play as a human.  +Great atmosphere+Good, friendly and responsive dev team. I've yet to experience it personally but that's what the community says. +Great UI/inventory/building management (unlike, say, ARK, building in ARK is pure pain)+Good optimizaton - your toaster won't be able run it, but your last-gen PC should. +Great terran design, a hand-made world instead of a randomly generated one. -Need more creature variation, I've seen most of the fishes after ~10 hrs playing. -The map's smaller than your expectaion, but DEEPER. -Texture loading takes a long time, meaning if you find an area, sit there idling for a few seconds then start exploring everything is fine, but if moving at high speed you'll see textures rendering in and out, models poping out from thin air (or water), stuff that PC gamers don't want. It can't really be fixed by a super gpu either. Remember the game's still in alpha, and issues are really expected to be fixed by final release.			"

The Survival game where ""No traditional weapons"" does not mean ""Ineffectual constantly starving victim""The fact the Devs are openly saying ""Nah, you should be able to make predators stop ****ing with you.  It's a bug they keep chasing you after you electrocute/gas/Physics gun them in the face"" even while in their mindset of no spearguns or tridents does a lot for my optimism in the overall design. I have been consistently pleasantly surprised to see all the little bits that are clearly favoring ""This is a video game"" over ""Realism = Tedium"". Which is more impressive for a game holding ""No undersea rambo"" as a hard design choice, as usually you'd expect that kind of mindset to bleed over into making you an ineffectual constantly starving victim as long as possible. I'm not usually one for the sandbox survival genre but I'm glad I got thisSo my only real concerns for the game are if it gets proper optimization work instead of a ""Good enough for a small team"" pass over it. The Cyclops turns tanking FPS bug has just killed my enthusiasm for setting up extra bases or exploring for the hell of it, now that I've gotten everything (except all the furniture I'm not allowed to scan) unlocked.A lot of the playerbase will talk up how ""You are not at the top of the food chain"", or even finger shake at newbies over having the nerve to kill a non edible fish while starving (I wish that was an exaggeration).  But when your answer to the Apex predator biting your mini sub is to electrocute them, fly out of their mouth, and shoot them in the face (maybe you'll hop out for some Stasis gun insult to injury)?  You are not at the bottom of the food chain, you're not even IN their food chain once you get going.Right now, if you can deal with the fact they haven't finished putting in all the content (Such as, you know, all the story mission stuff) and in some serious need of optimization work still slated for ""Later"", this is worth a buy.If you'd rather wait until they smooth out the edges for when launch happens in the coming months, that's also understandable.  But even for a guy who normally does not like ""Sandbox survival"", I'm glad I got this.Worst part of the game outside of the optimization is the playerbase who will practically kill you over screaming how nonviolent they and their game is, but then when has ""Sometimes the worst part is the playerbase"" never been true for most games?

								So i tried to hold off buying this game till full release, but buckled during the recent steam winter sale. And honestly if you have any will power left you probably would be better off waiting till the game is released or at least till the optimization patch is out. The game looks amazing but runs pretty heavy even on a GTX 1080.In saying that man I’m glad i bought it, this game is incredible, and it's the best single player experience I’ve had since Half Life!Seriously No Mans Sky should have given their budget and resources to this team to make the game for them, because this is how NMS should have been!Speaking of, can you imagine this game if it got space flight and multiple planets? Droooool.Don't look up guides and Wikis just go in and explore all this game has to offer, the love and the detail that the developers have put into this game is outstanding and come full release i would have paid $50 for it!

								If you play this for the first time. Your going to be impressed with the surroundings in the game... the graphics of the ocean and the depth. All the different biomes makes each one unique from the others, some nice and beatuiful, others more dangerous to explore. Creatures of different kind with their special sounds, some which are friendly and others that echo through as you moves through the ocean, making your body chill for a moment. The music is also well made for the game and every biome has is own theme when you cross over.The developers work and adds new features to the game, which means they care for the people who play Subnautica and they have a feedback menu which allows players to report bugs and framerate issues to them (or just giving them good feedback).The good side is that they always keep this game updated and listening to the bugs that get´s reported to them. The bad side, is that when they release a hugh update with something new in it. It can come unexpectedly with the content they have added (in my own opinion) + Any previous savings can become outdated, makes you to start on a new beginning. But it´s not a big issue.In general. This game gives you a nice exploration feeling as you decent in the ocean for scavenging, exploring and survival. All the biomes are unique in it´s own way and the graphics in the ocean makes the game feeling realistic.If your into the game. Your going to notice afterwards where did the time go when playing this?!The only downside I can say is that once you have been able to acquire everything for survival and establish a working base. Your going to be less needed to scavenge and might end up wander around without knowing what to do next. Getting the feeling like you have beaten the game.Another thing is that there is no help or tutorial at the start of the game. If your playing this for the first time. Your going to have a hard time trying to acquiring the resources, crafting and blueprints without knowing how to do it and get you going. You also need to establish a base early on, since collecting more resources forces you to store them somewhere and more resources needed to craft new improved equipments for survival.If your also playing on surival mode. Important factors like thirst, hunger, health and oxygen is important to keep an eye on since it´s going to be hard collecting food at the start and predators hunt the nighttime in the ocean.In my opinion. This game is something I can recommend to buy. Once your getting the hang of the game. The ocean will not feel so big.			"

								I purchased this game on sale for $11.99Let me begin by saying I am very skeptical of early access games. Even if their reviews are loaded with positive reviews.I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a lone survival type of sandbox experience. It's difficult to find anything bad to say about this game. It's worth the full price. The only negative things I can say (and im stretching here) are:-the initial load time takes a bit-the game slows down a tad when there's a lot on the screen to load but to be honest it's probably becaause my computer's specs are not the greatest-very minor glitches so far but nothing game breaking yet in 20 hours (nothing worse than any glitch or bug you'd find in a 60 dollar finished title)-Easy to lose yourself in this game and forget that time and real life is a thingI love the exploration aspect. I love the crafting. When you make the tool that lets you build your own underwater home, appliances and upgrades, ho man it gets fun. Exploring a deep, dark, vast ocean is terrifying and fun as hell.Some people may n ot like this game because there isn't aany co-op (yet). However the game isn't meant to be cooporative. You're alone. The sole survivor. Also out of all the crazy technology equipment that you can conger, I do not believe there are any lethal wepons. However again, it's not supposed to be thjat type of game.Now if you'll excuse me I just finished crafting a Seamoth (single man underwater exploration vehicle) and upgraded it to dive down to depth of up to 900 meters. Time to see what's down in the depths!			"

Played this game in VR (Oculus Rift) and normally.In VR (Oculus Rift) it is really nice and fun, everything is scaled relative to size and the game looks amazing. It really is beautiful and an expirence to have. The only down fall of VR is the motion sickness when flying around in a seamoth for too long, aswell as a few visual glitches (i.e. Body being sideways in Cyclops and the Seaglide obstructing your view)As for playing the game normally, it is a really fun survival game which you can spend hours just exploring caves, building a base and reading PDA's that you find. I really enjoyed this, the game doesn't seem too hard and has hours of content. The lore of the game is really nice aswell (which is just an added bonus).To sum it up, the game is really nice for an Early Access title, I was not disapointed and it is worth the $20. The developers are constantly adding new things and fixing bugs. This is a good game to try in VR and a really good game without it.			"

Early Access Review
								to start off i have had this game almost since its steam realease and i think that it is just about the best game i have ever played.  my decription of it goes along the lines of a mind bogglingly gorgeous survival horror game in disguise. (the amount of jumpscares i have had) at first it was a little dull with a major lack of content and, getting bored with the game i quit for a while.  then there were a ton of new updates realeased that made the game so much more fun.  like now there is some major story development two+ islands (one just floating on the surface with no support from anything other than giant floaters (pink creatures that store helium in its 'skin') there is a maximum explorable depth of about 1500 meters below the surface and about 15 - 30 biomes realeased and in development according to the concept art. as well as an amasing variety of creatures; most of them hostile. i am not doing a very good job at telling what the game is like but i will try to explain the point of all the actions you will need to do in order to progress.  the only real thing you have to do = explore.  in subnautica you have to explore if you want new gear, more awesome and terrifying expiriences more resources and new tech.im sorry if this review has turned you away from the game (i did make it sound like another of those cheezy ripoffs of other survival games)this is a video about subnautica that basically tells you why you should much better than i couldhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3K4FqpPyMk "

								The very essence of our deep ocean is the dark abyss and the natural hazard it poses to us as human beings. We fear the deep darkness but love the idea of exploring strange new things. Subnautica does a damn good job exploring that conflicting dichotomy.A threat in any game is made a million times worse when it cannot be affixed with a face or identity. When what tries to kill you cannot be identified, it adds to a sense of despair and hopelessness. You may adapt and work to mitigate the threat, but you can never eliminate the threat. It is the threat of drowning, the threat of starvation, and the threat of thirst. However, I'll only glance over hunger and thirst because I feel like we're all used to that mechanic by now. However, the threat of drowning is one of this game's prime threats. Drowning in this game is what freezing is to The Long Dark. However, there is a second element of threat: the abyss. You start off in shallow waters with all the bright colors and cute itty-bitty harmless fish aliens. Might I add, the color choice is actually very well thought out. We are naturally calm and relaxed around bright colors for we have learned to fear the darkness. So, the first thing that surrounds us is a bright blue sky, clear waters, pristine white sand, and a butt load of bright blue and purple mushrooms. So, you're at peace and safe while you learn the mechanics (More on that later). Yet, as you move on and on, the depth of the waters grow deeper, the fish grow darker in color (and have more teeth), and the bright blue ocean turns in a pitch black abyss for which there is no bottom. You could just stay away, but if you want to make use of the all the nifty gadgets you have, you'll want to explore further, deeper. So, it draws most people with this desire. However, this game isn't yet without flaws. I wont' address the technical issues as everyone else is doing that. However, I will address one key issue. While this game has threat, it isn't so dominant that it cannot be avoided. As far as I can tell, you are literally given 90% - if not 100% - of everything you'll ever need within 1 to 2 biomes of you. I know that sounds like a lot, but a key ingredient (silver) is found relatively easily in a grassy biome (Of which, after 5 new games in a row, I've always found near me). So, while the game poses what's really an invitation to explore the abyss. Otherwise, you could just technically stay within the 1 to 2 biome range and be perfectly content with unlocking most - if not all - of the gadgets. The question then is whether this is intentional or perhaps an oversight? Would it be wiser to eventually limit the resources? To force players into exploring? As of now, as I said, this is more of a suggestion to explore deeper waters. What I want is for this game to avoid being Salt, where exploration is so forced that it's pointless. Yet, I can't quite say that the game gives me enough desire to want to explore the deep. I'm only exploring the deep abyss because I want to - not because the game makes me want to. Of course, that could be the very point of a sandbox game, and yet, Minecraft - as my age old example, eventually cuts off your resources if you continuously dig and mine in the same general area forever. In Subnautica, as far as I can tell, scrap metal seems to spawn infinitely. I do not know yet if there's an end to the world in this game, but if this game truly is infinite, then there may be a problem. Minecraft is an infinite (or near infinite) world with finite resources. That's why it works.If you have an finite world with finite resources as a sandbox game, the game will eventually became pointless. Yet, an infinite world with infinite resources makes the world pointless. There needs to be a mix up between the two: a finite world with infinite resources or an infinite world with finite resources. I still recommend the game though.			"

You never rly know what you are about to run into until it just appears in front of you and that's just great. It might need a tweak here and there, but it's one of the most fascinating games I've played in years.I realy don't recomment watching a ton of videos about this, as it spoils the best parts. And it is pure intention of mine to not tell you about the actual features ;) Nothing beats those moments of seeing this with your own eyes.			"

								*Wake up after loading screen*see escape pod, see boom, see vast sea. jump in. only thing I have is a fire extinguisher. start scavenging.Within 90 seconds I see all manner of creatures, then i see one that looks mean. It chases me. I freak. I think...maybe i can use my fire extinguisher to disorient or at least propel myself away from this scary af alien shark monster, since I have nothing but a fire extinguisher.And you know what? It worked. 10/10 would shoot fire extinguisher in alien shark's face to survive again.			"

								I clearly reccomend this game, but if you want to buy it, you must understand that it is an Early Early Access Game.The game has potencial, it is playable and enjoyable even as it is now, but you can finish all there is to explore and to build fast and then you can only either make the same bases all over the ocean (and make up a story in your head) or just quit and wait for more content. I did both, I built bases at different depts, even put photos in all of them (yes, you can take photos and then put them in photoframes), reached the end of the map, and then quit and never played since, waiting for content to play more.The game has a nice story, nice graphics and already has diversity. And it can certainly have more. So I am waiting for the dev to not forget this game ad make it complete! :)			"

								I love survival genre games, look at my gameslist, I have a lot.  This is the most unique, refreshing, eerie, aesthetically pleasing game that I've played in a long time.  If you're a fan of the survival genre you owe it to yourself to check it out.  So far it's a game that's taken a long time to just get really established.  It's nice because the game takes care of the mundane stuff that every survival game has you do in the beginning, chop wood, dig dirt, make wood pick, build craft table, forge etc etc... In Subnautica, you start with the basics for crafting, leaving you to explore.  The UI is excellent, there is no handholding, but there doesn't need to be because everything is intuitive.  There is lore, mystery and a dark ocean at night is both creepy AF and beautiful.At this point in, at time of this writing, I'm 8 hours in and just scratching the surface what there is to explore.  I haven't really left the shallows, and have just begun to really build a base and get established.   And yet, nothing has felt boring or tedious, there's always something new I'm finding.The devs seem really organized.  They have their development tracked for all to see, so if you have any questions on what they're doing with their time, go check it out for yourself.			"

								Ok, if you are reading this view I really recommend reading through the whole thing. I will be listing pro's and con's about this game. Enjoy!Pros of SUBNAUTICA - 1. So So So fun and addicting. Not just a game you can only play for a few hours at once. A game you can play all day!2. Lots of time needs to be spent. This means that basically you need to take time to explore and gather resources to build things, still very fun though3. Lots of different ways to survive.4. Different gamemodes such as survival where you have to worry about food, creative you get anything you want for free, and another one I forget the name of but its survival without the food and water that you have to worry aboutCons of SUBNAUTICA1. Some framerate issues but not often2. Some bugs in this game but they are not fatalI hope this really helped you on your decision of buying this game but I REALLY REALLY recommend it!

								Oh man. How can I sum up this game without writing a long review detailing how beautiful, impressive, and scary the vast ocean that encompasses Subnautica? There is no way. Subnautica has easily become one of my favorite games.The devs are constantly updating it with new content, both scary and awe inspiring alike; from the tiniest starfish to the most terrifying and long anticipated leviathans that hunt you from the deepest, darkest depths. Though this isn't specifically a horror genre, it brings to light all the fears one might have of large, intimidating creatures arising from out of the deep blue and yet still keep you intrigued and curious about discovering the secrets that the game world has to offer.TL;DR stop reading reviews and just buy this game already! And be sure to play with a good headset ;)			"

								Solid with plenty to do (the most so of any early access game I've played). Regular and content rich updates. Easily worth the price tag in its current state and will work out to be a complete steal after future updates.Looks, controls and sounds great. The underwater atmosphere can be serene or daunting depending on how deep you go and what biomes you're exploring. If you're bathophobic, prepare to scream internally.			"

								Subnautica is simply my favorite game of all time.There's something about this game that I especially love, but can't quite put my finger on. The game is graphically beatiful, with incredibly atmospheric moments of fear and awe.  The creature designs are fasinating, majestic and terrifying.  The biomes range from sparse expanses of barren sea to claustrophobic caverns.  But there is something else about the game that makes it so special to me......the friendly community and the brilliant devs?...the imersive sound design and music?...the mysterious lore?...the creative base building aspects of the game?...the extremely open development of the game, where we get to see everything as its being worked on?No, it's the sense of exploration this game gives.  This is the pinnicle of exporation games.  It's a well designed game in many aspects, but the overwhealming sense to explore just makes this game that much more incredible.  Oceans are already alien enough, but an Alien ocean?  The concept itself just screams interesting, and Unknown Worlds has done an incredible job pulling it off.			"

								OK! So I've been trying to write a review on this game for a while now, because I love it so freaking much. So let's start with Pro vs Con:Pro:-VERY Active Development team (Content patch usually once a month)-Very immersive gameplay-Absolutely collosal playable area-As freeform as freeform can possibly get-Lots of content (I'm still discovering new stuff)I could go on. No, really. I could go on. But with the good, must come the bad, what little of it there is.Con:-No multiplayer/Co-Op (For me would make the game nearly flawless)-Lack of any truly effective self-defense weapons makes predators tiring to deal with.-Day/Night cycle is a little fast-I'm genuinely scraping the barrel to try to find this game's faults, because frankly, there aren't many.ANYWAYS.This game is an absolute thrill to play, and a joy to get completely immersed in, but therein lines a slight problem. It is VERY easy to get sucked into this game and spend countless hours of your time doing something that you think could take only a few minutes. But all in all, a great game with a very active development team, which means theres always stuff being added to the game. Money well spent, in my opinion.			"

								Despite the game being far from its official release date, and my fear of early access disappointment, I took the PLUNGE with Subnautica. The prospect of underwater survival was just too mouthwatering to resist, and having been obsessed with submarines from a young age, could not turn down the offer. I'll also do my best to review this without spoiling the game, because it's the mystery that makes it fun.Subnautica is beautiful in every aspect. The visuals, the variety of biomes, flora and fauna, and the sound effects are spine tingling. The ingredients of the game allow for exploration, hardcore survival and a huge element of creativity. From prepping deep sea dives, to creating lavish sea bases, it's all there.What's more - it's horrifying. Once you go beyond the familiar start-of-game biome, you'll discover there are more things out there to kill you. You go from apex predator to bottom-of-the-chain prey in split seconds. But you'll only ever find out once you get too close, and by then it's too late. It's a quick learning curve. Bone chilling growl? Teeth? NOPE.In a way it's like Minecraft, meets Depth, meets Silent Hunter. You have the harvesting of resources like Minecraft, the fear of predators like Depth, and the claustrophobia of Silent Hunter. Maybe throw in a bit of Amnesia: The Dark Descent too.			"

Early Access Review
								An absolutely GORGEOUS game; maybe not a good choice if the idea of ocean survival and swimming around the ocean scares you, but the setting is very gorgeous. It looks like a lot of work went into making the wildlife new and alien, but some measure of believeable, and equal parts beautiful and terrifying. The game play is pretty intuitive, and the crafting system is actually pretty easy to pick up; the thing is, you do have to explore and figure out what biomes contain which resources, but once you understand that, the crafting recipes themselves are relatively simple and straightforward, even for more complicated things like the mobile vehicle bay.Similarly, building and expanding bases is also straightforward and not very complicated; the catch is that you need to find and scan the blueprints for some of the more complicated structures like a dry dock for the submersible (called a moon pool), and power supplies.  But since the game isn't procedurally or randomly generated at all, you can also look up spawn locations for things, if you really feel you must.The controls are very intuitive, and the challenge comes primarily from the survival aspect of the game; as a human on a water planet, you have to be mindful of the need for oxygen (at least, in survival, the main game mode) in addition to the usual hunger and water requirements.The game is all about exploration; you have to explore and discover this strange new world that you have crashed on, and there is a lot to explore. Including the wreck of the Aurora; in fact, exploring the wreck can lead to finding signals directing you to even more interesting locations, which serves as a sort of second phase to the game, and can lead you very deep into underwater caverns and caves with even more gorgeous surroundings.I should mention that it can be a little hard on graphics cards; my Dell laptop handles it just fine, but there are occasional hiccups and lag spikes, and that can sometimes make catching fish a little more difficult.And I absolutely love the new intro that they just added, it is absolutely intense and engaging.I do think that this game would benefit from an option to return to the main menu from the pause menu; currently, the only option is to quit to the desktop and relaunch the game, and if I want to jump between save files, that is a lot to do. Still, definitely worth the price; the quality is excellent to the point where I constantly forget that it is an early access game, even with the current build indicator in the corner of the screen.

								The first tag for this game should be ""horror.""  Because fear has dominated my experience with this game and I absolutely love it.  It must be said early on that this game suffers from performance and framerate issues.  It's early access, so it's forgiveable and will be fixed someday, but you MUST understand that buying this game now will definitely get you a product that does not perform as you hope it will. Buyer be advised.Beyond the performance issues this game is outstanding and only continues to improve itself.  The ocean is as vast and vibrant as you would hope.  It teams with different types of life many of which are not unlike our own underwater horrors.  The terrain is fun and immersive.  It has geological activity.  The day/night cycle is fast, bordering on too fast, but it certainly keeps you alert as night time is... less comfortable.  Which leads me nicely into my favorite part of this game - the sense of isolation and fear.  Reaching my escape pod sometimes borders on therapeutic it feels so good. In no other survival game that I've played has the feeling of ""exploration"" been so genuine.  New areas are as fascinating and rewarding as they are foreign and unnerving. My pod drifted out over some very deep water and I experienced one of my first real moments of true fear as I swam out to it.  Looking down into the black... If you like survival and exploration games or if you as a person have the slightest apprehension of the real open ocean then I strongly recomend this game; as it will challenge your senses and illustrate the boundaries of your comfort zone.  The price is excellent given the amount of content and hyper-realistic atmosphere it creates.			"

I should preface this by saying that I own no other survival games, and that in general I avoided the early-access H1ZI-Rust event like the plague.This game is probably one of the best, if not the best, sandbox survival games on Steam. Not only is the game fascinating, but the devs are probably the best around. They are very transparent with their development plans, updating their fans on the current projects on this site[trello.com], as well as getting to know people on the subreddit.Beyond the fantastic people crafting this game, you have a beautiful game set on an alien water planet. As you swim around the shallows, gathering supplies to begin crafting your new home, you encounter an alien ecosystem, complete with the smallest, cutest fish like the Peeper to the giant, terrifying Reaper Leviathan[vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net], whose howls and screams that echo the murky depths will haunt your nightmares. You build power structures, habitats, hunt for fish, scan blueprints, while the sun and moon pivot about your head. The blue skies and deep indigo depths invite you, as you pass mammoth docile giants and fast, scaly sharks. This game will make you fear the deep, but make you also want to explore it.The tl:dr of this is that this game, set in a seemingly untapped locale (ocean), provides some great survival, building fun. The world is beutiful, the mechanics good and improving with every update, and the ocean teeming with a seemingly viable and alive ecosystem. Top that off with an amazing studio and a relatively low price, and I would say this game is a great deal.Please, do yourself a favor. Pick it up, and experience it.  I rate 8/8 m8.			"

								Subnautica is one of those games where you can play for hours on end, it is a very good game with lots of potential for the future. The Gameplay in subnautica is what you would expect in survival games. Gather food and water and build later. However with things like vehicles in this game it makes it even more addictive as you search for that one last part that youre looking for for the next vehicle. The building in subnautica is both well executed and satisfying. It is easy to get a hang of and will leave you feeling rewarded after you finally finish that bit of your main base off. However there are quite a lot of bugs, mostly graphical, but i have come accress a few and none of them dampen the gamneplay in any wasAnother thing about this game is the steep learning curve witht he lack of tutorial so if youre not willing to pick up this game and learn how it works then dont buy it because 6 hours in and im still learning.I would really reccommend this to anyone who likes any sort of survival game.

								Subnautica is a fantastic game and is worth more than it costs despite being an early access title. I've been playing almost nothing but this game for weeks, I've been utterly captivated by it. There are so many amazing moments in this game: awe-inspiring beauty, utter fear, truly rewarding exploration, the satisfaction of really earning your progress, building cool bases and vehicles. The game is just well-designed and has a wealth of content. The world of Subnautica is a fleshed-out, living, breathing world of which you are just a small part. You are part of the ecosystem, not the master of it. The creatures are varied and have their own motivations and behaviours based on their diet and territory. The sound design in the game is phenomenal. While navigating the environment you can tell what creatures are around you by sound alone, and tell their mental state as well. The music is awe-inspiring, tailored to the environment and situatiion, gorgeous and affecting, it fits perfectly in every location and mood. And the game is beautiful. Not well-rendered, or competent, but beautiful and real in all the good ways that most games aren't.There are minor caveats, which is to be expected due to it's early access status. There are a few, very minor glitches or bugs but for the most part the game is bug free even at this stage. What few bugs or glitches I encountered were very minor and didn't really affect gameplay.There are a few things worth mentioning though. I did experience a few system crashes while playing, but it's possible this was due to how my graphics cards was set up as I changed some settings and it hasn't reoccured since.You have ONE save file for the game. If it becomes corrupted (as happened to me several times) you will lose everything. I recommend backing up your save files if you are enjoying the game, You can easily look up how to do this. If you are considering playing this game you neeed to respect the system requirements. The game renders large areas in significant detail continually. If your computer is more that a few years old I'd think twice about playing Subnautica.I have a few qualms about how item acquisition and data about locations of interest are handled in the game. Without giving too much away, as you progress through the game you explore, then acquire and build items and vehicles. Once you have a vehicle the game really opens up for you, and if you are unlucky and aren't able to get a vehicle & the means to build it the game slows to a crawl and can become frustrating. The game also provides you with ""clues"" about interesting spots in the game, which is good, but the way this is handled involves a lot of unnecessary steps and is quite wonky.And lastly one design decision: Subnautica is a game about exploration, that puts you in the middle of a detailed, rich, alien world, puts you to the task of seeking it out but refuses to give you a map. It's a pretty conflicted decision to say the least. Apparently two previous inccarnations of the game had maps in them, but it has been removed and there are no plans to reinstate it. I have to say I understand partly why they went with this design decision, it has merits and flaws, and there are ways to ""map"" the world in the game. They went with a way that forces you to be more hands on and personal in the process of exploring, and that has some definite pros to it so I'd say this is a neutral decision at worst and not a bad one.In summation: if you like good games, if your computer is competent, if you want to support a good early access title that is already in an impressive state, if you enjoy having your jaw drop in the presence of staggering beauty, or the satisfaction of a job well done, or holding your breath out of mind-freezing fear then play Subnautica. I can honestly say it's one of the best games I've played in years, possibly ever, and it's not even done yet. I can't wait to see what comes next.			"

								Night times, for the first time - If freaky as hell!Have you ever swam in the ocean here on earth and felt the feeling that something is going to come and eat you alive? - Well this game literally makes me feel like that 100% of the time!Subnautica is a first person, openworld sandbox, based in the open water-world of somewhere not earth. Overall it's not a bad game at all, personally I find that it's lacking content in-game to keep me captivated for more than a few hours.However in saying that, the graphics and gameplay are as smooth as it is beautiful. Not only that but the atmosphere the game developers have given the game has definitly set some kind of standard, conveying a complete sense of openess. Which leaves me feeling somewhat scared at times!#thecrackenisreal #stayawayfromthedarkness			"

								At first when I downloaded Subnautica I was just expecting a early access title that was under developed. This first thought was from the early access sticker being slabbed on. After I downloaded and played this game for three hours I came to this conclusion. This is one of the best early access games I have played in a while. When it comes to these types of survival games you should get this. The only issue with the game is graphics (due to texture glitches) and no multiplayer. Other than that I highly recommend this game to everyone who loves survival games. I give it a 9/10 due to it needing a multiplayer update since textures are being worked on. Other than that 10/10.also i have been playing a lot lately and i just got the salami scared out of me by the giant creature that i have nicknamed the sea devil (due to the 4 or 5 horns coming out of its head) when it sideswiped me while i was exploring the Aroura			"

								The developers mention that the early acess is the nucleus of the game. And I have to say that that nucleus is solid. This game is extremely immersive and relaxing. The underwater environment is gorgeous and vast. You feel like the ocean has swallowed you up, and you're there to stay. And, the colors of this underwater environment are vibrant.  There is an abundance of fascinating marine life everywhere you look. Some creatures look, and are very menacing. Others are docile.  You can lose track of time in this game. As I found myself building my underwater base, without a clue of the passing time. The vehicles that you already have acess to are real neat. And I'm sure they'll add more. With more and more additions to this game, and constant improvements this is sure to be an awesome game when finished. In early acess I find it very enjoyable, much more so than games I've spent fifty dollars on.			"

Also, building your own underwater base and your own submarines is amazing.  The Biomes are well made and fun to visit.  I spend alot of time exploring them.  However, sometimes the total map seems a bit small but I am sure that the devs will add more areas to explore.  If you like ocean environments and survival games, then this is definitly your game.  If you expect to run around and kill stuff, then you better find another game.			"

								Ohmygod. I love this game!Okay so, I got this game in a Humble Bundle and actually got the bundle for another game. I never even heard of this game before (SHAME ON ME, I know!). Anyway I just randomly started playing this game without knowing what it even was.So at the start of this game you start in this POD and there's an alarm going off and there is this fire. You wake up and put the fire out. *remember how I had no idea what this game was?*. So I put the fire out, went up the ladder and all I saw was water and this giant sinking/exploding ship.I jumped in the water and I ended up in this AMAZING under water sea life! Seriously it's so pretty! So there are lots of pretty (and creepy) things around you and you just have to survive and build your own life in these waters. With all the stuff you find you can craft stuff to make your life easier or make stuff that you need to stay alive - water/food.I haven't played it that long yet, but with some help of some YouTube video's and articles online I think I got pretty far! I'm even building my own little place under the water now! I EVEN HAVE A FISHTANK! So if you still think this game isn't worth buying. A FISHTANK! I'm sold.**Oh. I might have to add that this game is still in early acces so it does have some bugs and all that. But even with all this, it's still a pretty amazing game.			"

								OK! So I've been trying to write a review on this game for a while now, because I love it so freaking much. So let's start with Pro vs Con:Pro:-VERY Active Development team (Content patch usually once a month)-Very immersive gameplay-Absolutely collosal playable area-As freeform as freeform can possibly get-Lots of content (I'm still discovering new stuff)I could go on. No, really. I could go on. But with the good, must come the bad, what little of it there is.Con:-No multiplayer/Co-Op (For me would make the game nearly flawless)-Lack of any truly effective self-defense weapons makes predators tiring to deal with.-Day/Night cycle is a little fast-I'm genuinely scraping the barrel to try to find this game's faults, because frankly, there aren't many.ANYWAYS.This game is an absolute thrill to play, and a joy to get completely immersed in, but therein lines a slight problem. It is VERY easy to get sucked into this game and spend countless hours of your time doing something that you think could take only a few minutes. But all in all, a great game with a very active development team, which means theres always stuff being added to the game. Money well spent, in my opinion.			"

								At first, I was frightened because I thought the developer, Unknown Worlds, found my secret diary and read through it. However, it was not long before I realized the situation was more dire than I could have ever imagined: They could read my thoughts, my dreams and hopes, my deepest, darkest desires... And they used that information to make a game they KNEW I wouldn't be able to resist playing.Subnautica is, in short, AMAZING. Both strikingly beautiful and challenging, even in its Early Access state, its completely playable and play you will. I admit, I have not been a fan of crafting / survival games, having avoided most opportunities (such as MineCraft and DayZ) but Subnautica delivered the concept in a package that seemed perfect for me to finally dip my toes in the water.You'll find yourself forgetting to breathe due to the wonderfully realized environments and the creative and gorgeous flora & fauna design. While alien in design, they still feel familiar without being derivative. I can not wait to see what new lifeforms and environments Unknown Worlds comes up with next!Being an underwater survival / crafting game, one may be worried about the controls in this aquatic world. Do not fret, the controls are VERY intuitive and responsive. Swimming through the water is a breeze, whether it's just you or your crafted submersibles. While there is not too much to craft yet, the system is still robust enough to keep you occupied, as you'll want to push further into the depths to discover what lies beneath. However, be careful as there are not really any weapons, per say (other than some different knives)! The world is as dangerous as it is beautiful.Subnautica is basically the game I've always wanted, but never realized that I did. Unknown Worlds has, on their hands, what I think may be one of the most fun experiences I've ever had the opportunity to play, and I can not wait to see what they come up with next for the breathtaking world of Subnautica. Thank you, Unknown Worlds, for making this game (and for not actually reading my secret diary).Pros:----------- Gorgeous, breath-taking environments- A day cycle that is calming and playful in aesthetic- A night cycle that is absolutely stunning due to the crazy amounts of bio-luminescent lifeforms- Creative and fun creature and plant design- Smooth, intuitive controls- A fun, though somewhat limited (for now), crafting system- It's all about underwater survival -- No land lubbers here- Observation decks for my base -- nearly 360 degree views of the ocean around me- That reminds me: You can build an amazingly intricate underwater base!- Regular updates from a dev. team that is passionate about their project- From what I can see, a very responsive development team that responds to the community regularlyCons:----------- Some creature / plant / environment interactions seem a bit limited at this point- A fun, though somewhat limited (for now), crafting system- I have to wait for more content (but it will be worth every minute)Favorite moment (so far): Took my Seamoth submersible out into the deep ocean, beyond the Kelp Forest, and saw a lifeform in the distance. As I moved in closer, I realized it was MASSIVE and looked like a giant alien squid. Not knowing if it was hostile or friendly, I got scared and quickly booked it back to my base at the edge of the  Safe Shallows.			"

								I love this game. I really do. The only reason why I'm not playing more? Because of the latest update that raised the minimum requirements for graphics. SO... yeah, got to look for stronger computer. If you've got the gear for it, jump on this when you've got the chance! It's worth it.			"

Early Access Review
								The game has grown so much in the past 2ish years and is destined for success. But it still has problems and aspects that i belive could be persued further. for the building system the large tanks amazing but take up so much of the room that you cant walk around and enjoy the view, i would not say shrink the tank but get a bigger room or just make the whole room a tank that way we just pass through the thing instead of akwardly walking around it. we could also use 45 degree corners. and a major problem was that larger rooms like the moon pool and to a lesser extent the large room will clear a large area around tthem, and i often try to build as close as i can to the coolest looking thing i can find(within reason). other then this the building system is great below the water but above the surface it can be hard to build up because of gravity forcing players to build out instead. it looks amazing, everything this is the prettiest game i have ever seen done on the unity engine, hands down. the monsters are cool and unique however some like the stalker seem too ""hungry"" constantly chasing after any fish or players that wander too clost even during their least active time period. sometimes finding somthing gets hard especially for now players a SIMPLE in game map that is slowly revealed as the player explores would be cool instead of dropping 10000 beacons at every wreak or place of interest like I did when i first played. this is the ONLY ocean themed game i have seen (exept for ABSU) that isnt entirly focusd on horror or survival, subnautica shows wonder and spacific environments that have their own atmospheres and soundtracks(bloody cool ones). I would highly recomend supporting it on early access.			"

								8/10Pros+3 - Atmospheric AF+2 -Didn't skip on the difficulty, but it feels fair+1 - Did the Ocean Justice, You are always exploring and finding new places+2 - Gameplay is unique and inventive, before this game I used to hate underwater sections in games, but now I feel like this set the standard for aquatic sections in games to comeCons-1 - Can be Glitchy at times, but never broke on me, it was just miner things like clipping issues and physics (How a storage Crate moves an Escape pod and almost makes the thing drown is beyond me)-1 - Honestly I feel like the game could do well with some co-op survival, Completely optional but Truly would be an improvement, because a lot of my friends have the game, but we just wish we could play it together.Final RulingHonestly a good game, It does atmosphere, gameplay, and exploration justice in a setting most games would dread. I highly recomend this game to anyone who wants a new experience in single player survival without subscribing to generic ""Crafting Survival Gameplay"". This game truly made me rethink aquatic sections in games and I hope to see much more of this game in the future.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm going to give an overview of some of the things I love and dislike about this game. I will try to make this as unbiased as possible. PROS: 1. If you love underwater simulator games for the aesthetic this game is FOR YOU. 2. If you love base building to its most free roam kind of version with the tools you're given this game is FOR YOU! 3. If you're fascinated with speculative evolution or just thing Alien fish are neat this game is FOR YOU! 4. This game has multiple modes like creative and survival for a multitude of play styles 5. Has a great story about how you got to the planet and one that continues throughout the game without being the main part of the game and still feeling very important. The story doesn't feel overwhelming in the game takeover-wise sense. It has some riveting moments that have nothing to do with fish and it makes the parts of the game that do have to do with collecting resources and gathering information still feel vital even though it already is. 5. Some of the creatures are absolutely terrifying and will scare you every time without it feeling like a horror game when you start up a new save. You must be aware of your surroundings at all time. The environment has a way of killing you. CONS: 1. If you don't like early access games don't buy this game it's not finished yet but it's pretty well on its way. 2. Don't play this game if you have a heart condition or anything else relating to medical conditions that prevent safely experiencing some game generated jump scares. I'mTalking about predatory creatures catching you by surprise sometimes when you forget how dangerous some map areas are. These are not traditional jump scares at all. 3. This game is completely single player so if you're looking to play with your friends then no. Although I have a suspicion that multiplayer would wreck the game because it would take away from many of the realism-feeling type elements.  That's all folks. Overall I highly recommend this game.

Early Access Review
Played this game in VR (Oculus Rift) and normally.In VR (Oculus Rift) it is really nice and fun, everything is scaled relative to size and the game looks amazing. It really is beautiful and an expirence to have. The only down fall of VR is the motion sickness when flying around in a seamoth for too long, aswell as a few visual glitches (i.e. Body being sideways in Cyclops and the Seaglide obstructing your view)As for playing the game normally, it is a really fun survival game which you can spend hours just exploring caves, building a base and reading PDA's that you find. I really enjoyed this, the game doesn't seem too hard and has hours of content. The lore of the game is really nice aswell (which is just an added bonus).To sum it up, the game is really nice for an Early Access title, I was not disapointed and it is worth the $20. The developers are constantly adding new things and fixing bugs. This is a good game to try in VR and a really good game without it.			"

Early Access Review
								The developers mention that the early acess is the nucleus of the game. And I have to say that that nucleus is solid. This game is extremely immersive and relaxing. The underwater environment is gorgeous and vast. You feel like the ocean has swallowed you up, and you're there to stay. And, the colors of this underwater environment are vibrant.  There is an abundance of fascinating marine life everywhere you look. Some creatures look, and are very menacing. Others are docile.  You can lose track of time in this game. As I found myself building my underwater base, without a clue of the passing time. The vehicles that you already have acess to are real neat. And I'm sure they'll add more. With more and more additions to this game, and constant improvements this is sure to be an awesome game when finished. In early acess I find it very enjoyable, much more so than games I've spent fifty dollars on.			"

Early Access Review
								Great game, one of the best games on early access! In addition for an early access game there is a decent amount of content available, around 8-12 hours of the stuff if you intend to create every thing in the game and explore every part of the map (which I reccomend you do because it is very detailed for the most part).For the first fully underwater game I've played it just works. Really well. Might I add that the devs hit the nail on the head with the sound design! Really makes you feel you're in an underwater environment with a huge array of alien sea creatures wading all around you.Final verdict: 8/10This score can only improve due to the fact it isn't even a fully released game yet. So with this being said: definitely pick this game up if you enjoy open world survival games! I predict by the time this comes to full release it can only improve to a 9/10!  "

Early Access Review
								Subnautica - the cool oceanic diving game in the glory of its post-beta, here my journey begins. (this review was based on ""Freedom"" mode as I just wanted to see what the game is really about in the beginning, so I will probably update this review once I get into survival mode. Keep scrolling down to the pros and cons for the game far below if you don't wanna read the stuff below.) 2016@0.1h   Launching game:   Successful!   Attempting to climb out of escape pod: Unsuccessful (still happens from time to time when I hold on to an item while doing so) Initiating quitting-to-desktop: Unsuccessful at first try, ""Subnautica stopped working"".20170.2-1hLaunching game:   Successful!  Starting another attempt to climb out of escape pod:   Successful!    (you can do it with the default breathing tank!) Diving 40+ meters below water:   Successful!    Dodging quantum detonation inside escape pod in time:    Successful!  Exploring caves without dying from an explosive fish charging at me:   Unsuccessful.  1-2h Finally got a knife to defend myself from stalkers. Finally have loads of Oz tanks to go further into the ocean.  Winning a hand-to-hand combat with a stalker without losing any health:   Successful!   The next stalker ate my knife, and lowered my health to 3.  Loading the last save where I still had the knife:   Successful!   Attempting to retrieve a stalker tooth from a stalker: in progress... Attempting to quit the game to desktop:   Unsuccessful.  (yet again) Impression within the first few hours: With soothenting background music, alien oceanic life forms and their exotic cries echoing throughout the ocean, Subnautica really emerses you into its beautifully crafted alien oceanic planet with almost everything to do under the surface of the ocean (jumping  on a floating giant ray's back  hardly counts, sorry).Everything feels calm, relaxed and approachable (optimal if you have faster means to approach them of course), accompanied by the deep gruntings  of the massive rays and gasy glowing fishes  at night, this oceanic survival game creates you a grand scene with occassional surprises.  Pros: - Immersive environment settings of oceanic biome- Beautifully and delicately designed sea creatures in detail: fishes, corals, rays, seaweeds, etc- 3 game modes to choose from, feels loads of flexibility: Survival, Freedom, Creating, feeds the appetite of different crowds- Well composed background music to boost up the mood in the slow-progressing world filled with unexplored excitements- the material fabricator works in such a cool way, it beams all your crap found in the ocean back to their futuristic lives.  Cons: - Still pretty buggy: as mentioned above, the game contains bugs including making your knife invisible (even if you still have it in your quick slot and inventory), breathing sound from Oz tank while above surface, and a semi-transparent alien big moon that indicates the time of the night. - Unfinished materialisation of the items in-game (i'm yet sure if it's a bug for me, or the game glitched out on it): such as the  black cubes with question marks on them  which should be in the form of writhing weed samples, etc- The medikit fabricator is so broken, that it produces medikit outside of escape pod while the animation doesn't even work most of the time when you open & close its door. But still, thankfully you can still obtain medikits from it.- The game is always saddened each time by me trying to exit the game and would not quit properly every time I do.   Overall: 7/10  So far, it's been a really fun diving/crafting/surviving game and a cool exploring game for me, with more bug fixes in the future, this game is worth giving a shot, especially if you're a surviving game lover who digs good graphics and have the persistency to collect and craft your way back into space over time.

								Although it does recommend to have a such beefy computer to run Subnautica, I almost have no trouble running it with only a maximum of comfortable 18 Frames Per Second without crashing or overclocking. The ambience and the enviroment is absolutley stunning. You can almost do anything inside Subnautica from chasing Peepers, to getting chased by a Reaper Levithan. This is one of the most popular underwater sandbox you will set foot- (Er, Flippers!)in. Most people do show off their seabase or vehicle creations in Subnautica's Community Artwork section, From building a base inside the Aurora full of giant monsters, to building a base on a island, surrounded by unusual trees (and probably wildlife soon!).Do I recommend you this game? Of course as long you can handle it's hunger for computer power!			"

								As far as I actually played Subnautica, considering its early state of development, it is highly recommendable. The last unterwater experience I enjoyed goes back to Aquanox (the first and better part). Of course, Subnautica is far away from a Aquanox like gameplay, but I'd like to compare the environmental aspects. In terms of emersion, Subnautica is yet both genius and genuine. A subnautical world with its own flora and fauna so emersive that you want to stay in the game for hours, even when it's not finished yet. The only questionable fear I have about Subnautica is, that when it is done, you're also done with it. And with 'done' I mean that you simply have enough from the subnautical environment. There are many possibilities for crafting and hunting and so on of course. But let's face it, it is a very limited environment to play in. At least this is what I personally think. But as always I'm quite curious to see what the developers will put into the game and how they are going to enhance the experience. At this point I recommend this game very much. Not only because of Subnauticas unique gameplay and environment, but for the great love and patience the developers put into it. For those who face a phobia about underwater / divings - don't use it with VR :-P			"

								You wake up, alone in your dilapidated escape pod, groggy and disoriented. There isn't time to react as you struggle against heat from the fire that encircles you. Quickly you reach for the fire extinguisher and snuff out the flames. A light above you breaks through the smoke. It's the hatch! You step up onto the ladder, force open the hatch, and escape your life vessel.You are a castaway. falling from the seas of the skies, you find yourself bobbing in the seas of an unknown world- your ship smoldering in the distance.Subnautica is a beautiful game through and through, and (for me) sets the bar for what you should expect from survival games. From the moment you dive into the waters, you are just amazed at how beautiful the world around you is and at all the varying degree of life surrounding you. There isn't tons upon tons of things to do (explore, gather, study, explore, build, explore, see how deep the rabbit hole goes, explore), and the map is static, but this game is so beautiful that I find myself returning to it frequently when I just want to play a game by myself and have the survival experience and even though it's tagged as early access, it does not have that early access feel that 90% of the other EA games have.Pros:- Beautiful world/ Magnificent color pallet. This game amazes me just as much now as it did when I first set foot on it.- Decent rig= good experience. I haven't experienced any real serious bugs and definitely not any lag or latency when playing. I built a pretty good rig 4 years ago and I can run this game with the highest graphic settings and play fine.- Still challenging. This game is mostly filled with peaceful creatures but there is still enough in the game that can kill you, from running out of oxygen to reaper leviathan (You have a mini heart attack every time you get near them), to the other new dangerous creatures they recently added.- Animations on point. everything from the Aurora explosion to the way the fish move, you feel encapsulated in this world. I enjoy chasing Peepers around and stop playing every time the Aurora does it's thing.- The sea. The map itself isn't very large (large enough for a 1 player experience). But being in the ocean 90% of the time is a unique twist to survival and it gets pretty unnerving when you start branching off from the shallows and enter the abyss.- Unique creatures. I cannot stress this one enough! Everything from Peepers trying to be elusive, great lumbering Reefbacks, sneaky Crab snakes hiding in mushrooms, to screeching bone sharks and intimidating reapers, they all have their own style and feel.-Crafting/Building. While you have an assortment of ready to make technology, there are scattered pieces of tech throughout the deep seas for you to discover. This allows you to build vehicles, new and useful tools, expansive bases, and even gardens!-Exploration. Most of the new technology fragments are scattered throughout the world, allowing you little rewards for exploring new places. Grab a torch and cut open doors on fragments of your ship and explore the tombs of your previous home to find aesthetic items, new power sources, tools, etc.-Updates. The game gets one or two big updates roughly every month and almost always has exciting new content and bug fixes. The developers have a Trello board so that you can track what is coming next.-Single Player. Yes, a lot of people want this game to be multiplayer but I feel the map is too small. It also feels good just exploring by yourself and not having others get in your way. If they did multiplayer, they would have to do it as a separate entity.-Have your own aquariums and hatch your own fish!Cons:- I wish they had a dynamic map where every new play through randomized the locations of each biome. This would add to an already high replayability and keep me from wanting to build in my ""optimal"" build sites.- There are unfinished parts of the map. There will come a point where you will stumble across a large, blank expanse. Nothing in it. These are sections of the map that are unfinished.- I have run into a few graphical bugs that are a bit bothersome (fish swimming through your base, schools of fish clumped into a ball).-Not much to do after awhile. It takes a bit to get to this point but after you've built your base, your cyclops, explored the Aurora and the prison, there isn't much left to do except start over. It would be nice if they added a few more dubious creatures around the map to where you had to defend your base etc.-Story is being fleshed out still. There are plenty of tidbits on the story of the previous survivors, but still has more to come it seems.Ratings:Fun: 9/10Visuals: 9/10Sounds: 10/10Playability: 8/10Development: 7/10Creature models and animation: 10/10Butt pucker when attacked by reaper leviathan: 11/10			"

								Subnautica is a good game but it's TERRIFYING. I mean like never EVER go to the jellyshroom biome at night time. Subnautica will give you nightmares even if you play it in the summer, outdoors, at noon, while surrounded by friends and family. This game is cool if you like being scared kinda like FNAF but easier. It is open world and survival with some crazy looking alien sea creatures so you could see where I am coming from when I say it is scary. And when I say alien sea creatures I mean ALIEN SEA CREATURES. Not like some weird looking sea creature like that weird Jelly blob monster caught on camera in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico (search that up by the way). No I mean alien like different planet alien...because this game is set on an uncharted planet. Once again I will say that this game is fun but scary. You just need to watch out for the things that can grab you that are currently in the game such as the Crabsnake or Reaper Leviathan. Also the is a button that you could press to bring up a menu that allows you to enable the console which you could use to give yourself items and spawn creatures and vehicles. I forget which button but I know it is somewhere close to F5 or F7.			"

DON’T LET THAT MONSTER EAT YOUR FACE. but this game is relaxing at least sometimes. i like the concept its brilliant very scenographic. the realization of the landscapes and creatures are (wow) for real. At this point you will think (I have to swim all the time?!) of course no you can use a multiple vehicles as the seaglide,cyclops ( a very big submarine) and SEAMOTH ( a small and faster submarine). definitely try it (because if I have to describe everything It would take me a week ahaha) sooooo nothing I recommend it. vote 8/10one thing sorry for my bad english :(   "

								""9...9...9...9...9...9 hour until arrival.""I decided to write this review after I encountered a new (to me) white snake thingy that was bigger than my current base, and made me say ""Nope. Neeewp. Whole big fat ocean full of nope"" as I sped away on my mini-sub.I purchased this game almost exactly one year ago. I played it then, and it was a beautiful experience. The underwater world held wonder and fear in equal measure. The crafting and survival aspects of the game were entertaining enough that I played until I had my very own sub.But that was pretty much it back then.I picked it up again, wanting to see if the devs were keeping up with the game. I was shocked! Shocked, I say. The amount of content added, the improvements made, the expanded world and a quest system. The pacing has also been improved. No longer will it take only a few hours to get the Cyclops blue print. I've been playing for a while now, and still don't have the pieces. Exploring the crashed ship, the beacons (which lead to some really amazing sights), the sometimes extensive and dangerous cave systems are all a tense delight. And I feel like I have only just scratched the surface.I recommend this game to anyone who has ever played a game with the dreaded ""water level"" that you hate. This game will help you get over that hatred of water. Or it will drive you mad. Either way... Worth it!			"

								So, Subnautica, ey? If you're reading this, you're probably wondering if you should buy this game, or at least curious. Well, if you've got the hardware, Subnautica is TOTALLY WORTH IT! Now, let me answer some questions that some people might be asking about Subnautica:Q: What sets this game apart from other ocean survival games like Stranded Deep?A: Almost everything, and I could go on and on about it, but, that would kinda be a spoiler for all of the gameplay surprises, wouldn't it? In my opinion, what sets Subnautica apart from Stranded Deep is the Realism factor. SD is based off a real life event that can ocurr, however, because of this, the game can become less fun because of the real life elements that make-believe scenarios help us escape. However, Subnautica has the perfect balance of Real and Not Real.Q: But look at the first picture with that weird snake thing! How can this game be the perfect balance of Realism and Fairytale?!A: Well, it is a survival game, so you have certain needs you need to take care of or death is imminent. You must eat and drink, but instead of just normal food, the game has exotic alien flora and fauna to gather, hunt, and consume! You can even create a fish tank to breed more fish to have at your disposal in your underwater base!Q: I don't know, is there anything funny to the game?A: There's an item litteraly called an Acid Mushroom, what more could you want?!All in all, I highly reccomend this game! In my personal oppinion, it's also really fun to watch a game develop and grow! This game (as far as I know) is updating quite frequently so there's usually new content to explore and experiment with! Totally worth the $20 asking price! :steamhappy:			"

Early Access Review
								Let's be concise upfront before I get loquacious. This game has huge potential but hasn't been tapped much as of yet. There is still a lot here already, and well worth the purchase for fans of the survival genre of games. It's not really Minecraft in water but that's what everyone is going to say and it really sells this game a bit short. This game nails exploration in a way that few games can match, and the underwater environments are both visually breathtaking and wonderful to explore. The use of an underwater environment and limited oxygen make for the best gating mechanism I've ever had to pleasure of using in a game. In short this game to me is a must buy. Now onto the longer review. Starting with both the least and most important thing, graphics. This game looks fantastic most of the time, and has been receiving visual updates from the developer. I would expect that eventually it will look even better which is a joy to think about. The water in this game is easily some of the best, and in VR would probably be enough to make anyone with Aquaphobia rip the headset off. The only real complaint against the water is the transition effect between underwater and above water needs polishing. The boundary zone for it causes some fun glitches but can rip you out of what otherwise is an incredibly immersive experience (pun intended). Now the water isn't everything, although it makes up a large portion of the world. Yet, my favorite things visually are probably the heavy use of Bioluminescence in everything. Both the fauna and flora are amazingly well lit even in the depths of the ocean thanks to this. It feels like they basically took ""The Avatar"" (not airbender) movie visual themes and stuffed it underwater. The end result honestly blew my mind a little of the first night. While you can notice it during the day, the way the ocean lights up at night is near magical. This combined with incredibly solid art assets, and the game is full of eye-candy. However, like most things the art isn't all rainbows. The ground textures could use a bit of improvements and there is a lot of placeholder art still in game at this time. I have incredibly high hopes in regards to what the finished game will look like. Next topic, the gameplay. Now this is the most important part for me, and to me this isn't just mechanics/story but also includes performance. Thankfully this game is pretty decent for an early access title. The depth of the gameplay is enough to last most people for 10-20 hours with what is currently there. Unlike Minecraft, this games tech progression has a huge amount of room to grow. The idea of scanning 'fragments' of debris from the main ship is both simple and piratical as a progression.  Crafting unlocks as you acquire the needed raw material, which is a good thing since it shortens the menus early game, and what is there encourages you to find the resources to make them. There really isn't much of a tutorial in place yet, but I found myself able to get quite far without needing to look up the wiki for anything crafting related. There is still room to grow however, and I found that I struggled to find certain resources due to less than intuitive harvesting requirements. Resources aren't fully balanced yet, but I didn't find myself hating the rarity of anything other than lithium until I found some easy areas thanks to the wiki. Now onto the swimming/exploration. Let me start off by saying it again, this is the single most genius way of gating ever used in a game. I'm not going to comment on the balance of tech to dive depth, but using the tech tree to dive deeper gives you incredible motivation. The fact that you only hold so much oxygen means that your dive depth is less then half of your oxygen meter. This starts a very fun gameplay dance where you try to push as far as you can without dying of asphyxiation. The way this adds tension to every deep dive is enough to sometimes give me a heart attack. I won't spoil your first time through but let me say that if you're like me, the first time you're underwater and watch the oxygen tank hit 0 with 20 meters of water between you and air...I dare say you won't forget it. Late game is where the balance of gameplay really gets thrown off and where the limitations of the inventory system kick in. Nothing in this game stacks, which works both for and against the game design. Early game this limits you in very interesting ways. It forces a balancing act between the things you would want to carry like food, equipment and resources. It also stops you from getting in the ""collect everything"" habit that a lot of people get stuck into. This is because you can't hold it all and storage is at a premium early game. Sadly, late game you are rolling in resources, able to move around quickly, and have lots of toys you want to carry. This makes inventory management tedious, resource gather monotonous, and building a new underwater base a huge pain. While it doesn't quite break the game, it does wear at your spirit while playing. I'm not sure what the best solution to this is, but I would argue for some form of limited stacking to be added into the players inventory, and higher stacking counts to be allowed in storage objects. A expandable inventory for the player wouldn't go unwelcome either. Last and least sound. It's pretty good. Despite being called an audiophile due to researching the sound stage of my headphones, I'm not much into critiquing sound design. Overall I think they really nailed it, with some minor annoyances. The biggest one is probably the 'swim charge fins', which unsurprisingly charge batteries while you swim. The little whirl sound isn't so bad, and let's you know when you're going fast enough to use them. But I feel a charging icon would better serve in the display then the whirling sound. It also sounds terrible when an item dies and gets recharged only to die again and again. Only one devices (the SeaGlide) suffers from this but it's enough to mute the audio until you swap batteries. Otherwise the sound design feels very fitting and generally will save you, as most things that want to kill you have some great audio ques. Final note, mods. This game needs them, though it's hard to think if many mods could keep up with the art style used by the devs here.			"

								You know that moment when you're swimming in the ocean or a big lake and you look down and you just see endless black, and every fiber of your body is like ""NO NO NO NO""?This is that, but with a giant, compelling survival game attached to it. And that's saying something because ""compelling survival game"" is basically an oxymoron.(On the con side, there are a bunch of performance issues as of early July 2016. It's early access, so whatever, but still, something to be aware of. If you're covering ground, be ready for giant sections to suddenly pop in and for your frames to go to a slideshow for about five seconds or so at a time.)			"

								Great exploration and building game, fairly frequent updates introducing more interesting and atmospheric biomes, story is somewhat lacking but there's enough of it there so far in my opinion since the main point is exploration and base building. Both of those functions are functioning very well already and are just being expanded upon with every update.			"

Early Access Review
								I am currently 16 hours into the game and it has by far surpassed my expectations for a early access title. I previously decided to not purchase until the final release came out. Although this game is far past expected final release date, I find that the developers in that time had added enough to the title and seamed to have consistant update so I warranted purchase. This game is gorgeous. The ocean physics, day/night effects, reflections, textures. Granted I am playing on 4k @60 hz with highest graphics, but if you happen to see a video of this game on youtube, it does not compare whatsoever. I do find that once night settles it makes exploration next to impossible. I will find if I am not at my location to hang for the night, that I will end up floating in the hopless dark at the surface terrified by knowing the unknown right below me in the black water. The on hand lighting equipment is far from beneficial unless near an object. So for the vast majority of the surface and immediate below, you are helpless at night. Near the bottom, you can get aproximattely 3 meters of murky distance out of the flashlight. I personally found the gameplay intoxicating and loved the constant hunt for blueprints and treks out into the abyss constantly searching for material. I personally found that it did take me all of 14 hours to get a sea vehicle, but this could have been a personal fault as I've put off exploring the ship. The game is very open ended, so you will have to find your own direction and ways to progress. There is some in game help with music cueing around different points of interest and waypoints through the communications array. I found that many times you would have to push yourself past the safe boundary in able to get what is needed to progress. I personally liked this and found it very realistic. The enemies in the game are very difficult and are consistantly aggresive. The ocean is not friendly. Along with the soundtrack and sea creature screams/roars/whatTheHellWasThatNoise you will find yourself constantly on edge and ""trying"" to be aware of the environment. I say this because it seems with the constant threat of low oxygen at deep areas and aggresive nature of the creatures you can't help being hit from the back. Athough the game is difficult, it is not unfair. The times I have died have been my fault for pushing too deep for too long. That is not to say that is not needed. You will find you are consistantly pushing and riding that fine line. The game has initial help with learning how to go about, but I found this was very short. Although the game really leaves you to your own means on learning how to craft, wield, explore the environment I found that through just playing it seemed to come naturally. The crafting is fair. I find deposits of materials are spread, but once you find where the spawns are limited to each environment and depth, it helps substantially. I did find that it seems that once you are in need of something specific, then it is suddenly not easy to find. This may have to do with some kind of ""need"" sensor many games instill. I have found that the amount of items to craft and play with are limited at this point. Don't get me wrong, theres a ton there, and I have yet to break the 200 meter down mark so I could be wrong. I just feel like there should be more. It is funny that unlike others now that I have found the point where there are no consistant questions or surprises and now finding a known comfort in knowledge I am unsettled. I wish for that disarray and frenzied thirst to learn quelled by the breakthrough of cognisance. This game really thrives on that quest to learn and I hope with the final release and coming updates that as more story is instilled, this comes back to me. As an early access release there is a lot here. I am currently playing with:Win 7 ultimate 64 bitamd 8 core 4gz processorpower color radeon 390 8 gb vram16 gbs ramon a 500 gb ssd@ 3840 x 2160 60 hz, highest graphics allowed in in game setting. UPDATE---------------Game looks very impressive displayed in 3D using a 3D TV. I have a 32"" Powerful PASSIVE 3D tv w/ LG panel that has internal 2D-3D conversion. I am unable to use my 24"" Sony Playstation ACTIVE 3D tv because that tv does not have internal conversion. I have to use a software that renders the games direct x files as 3D locally w/ gpu, w/ unoptimization is unplayableBelow is my first issue-> implemented solution. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sudden massive performance drop, standbye memory slow/now fast fill(memory leak)Just to be clear and to help allieviate unhelpful feedback I am aware how windows 7 uses ram and the purpose of standbye memory. This is how windows 7 is supposed to work. Unfortunately there are times when this does not work because a application has a memory leak causing standbye ram to fill without emptying even when the application is completely closed. This will eventually lead to system slowdown and even crash. I am 16 hours into the game and suddenly am experiencing massive lag upon load of save that does not allieviate.  Performance is choppy and setting the graphics/resolution lower does not make a difference. Before this point I was playing virtually seamless.  I was playing lag free, but found after playing for a while that the longer I played the game the less view distance I would have and eventually would experience lag. I found that this was caused by my standbye memory being slowly filled and free ram reduced. Eventually when there was ~50 mb free ram left and standbye completely filled then the game would choke horribly. I am wondering if this is because memory held by the game in standbye is not being released properly or even being held, just accumulated. This is signs of a classic memory leak. Upon exiting the game the standbye memory is not emptied, but will stop accumulating. Windows will show signs of slow down, as well as the browser loading videos. Restarting the computer or using a command line execution to clear standbye memory will fix this completely. Now at 16 hours in the game is unplayable because upon load there is massive lag that does not go away and I've found that the standbye ram fills very fast. When starting the game I will have ~12 gbs of free ram.All drivers are updated completely. This is not a video card hardware issue. My card had previously performed very well with this game. I updated drivers recently to try to fix this once it started, but did not make a difference. UPDATE 12/11/16-------------------------------Upon installing on my other build I did figure out that many of the game assets the player puts in are stored in the save file. Mine was a whopping 692 mbs. I do not seem to have a memory leak in this installation of the game on this build. The lag was reduced upon load and ran a bit better. I then looked at my assets and I had built a large base by the mushroom fields and found that deleting half of it cleared up a large majority of the lag. I also found that subnautica uses a consistant data connection while playing and if there is not enough free ram to keep that connection consitant it will also introduce additional lag. Whenever I am very close to a fish there will be a micro lag as well.Largely my issues with the game are with optimization (how the game stores active and unactive data during play and how it accesses it), consistant graphical clipping in areas of the game with enemies, no gamma settings(This is something I appreciate and dispise -the ocean in the night is accurately dark, but unplayable).

								Subnautica is one of the best atmospheric games I have ever played. Once I pick this game up, I can never stop. One thing I have to say though, I definetly reccommend playing this game knowing next to nothing about it. The real thrill of the game is not knowing what that weird sound was or if this sea creature is about to rip you limb from limb. Eventaully you will learn about everything, yet the devs keep adding more and more, so there is always more to be scared about. Also, the sequences that happen in this game are amazing, and the graphics are the same way. That is why I have nominated this game for the Steam 'WHOOAAAAAAA, DUDE!"" award.			"

								Do you ever want to explore the vast ocean? Well, now you can! Except it took place in an unknown alien planet, where you are the 'alien' to the creatures of the deep. However, you are not at the top of the food chain here. Your mission is to survive, explore the deep ocean, scavenge all the resources from what's left of your crashed spaceship, build your temporary shelter and many more. Yes it sounds like any other survival games on steam, but maybe  one of the best early access survival games  you can find. The updates are huge with a lot of content. It looks like the developers know what they are doing and that's a great thing. The only let-down is when you spend too many hours into the game it will start lagging and crashing frequently (fixable by deleting save game caches). Hopefully they will fix this problem soon.I would recommend this game for its regular price, and also during the sale. Worth it.			"

Early Access Review
TLDR: Subnautica is a fantastic example of early access done right. With great graphics, an immersive world, and fun crafting and exploration its easy to recommend in its current state. The consistent information and updates produced by the devs shows dedication to the game and a desire to make it better all the time. I can only see this game getting better over time.=============================================Full ReviewIt's hard to get excited about survival/crafting games being released on Steam these days, especially when you add early access to the mix. Early access games are often hard to recommend due to shoddy developement and lackluster content however Subnautica stands on its own regardless of its early access status.GameplayWhen the game starts you find yourself in a life pod that has ejected from a crashing spaceship. You grab the small number of supplies from inside the pod and then exit out into the vast ocean and start to gather more supplies. After a few trips back and forth from the sea floor to your pod you will have found enough resources to start crafting your very own sea base. The gameplay loop then basically becomes going out and exploring and collecting materials/blueprints then coming back to base and crafting upgrades. The progression is incredibly natural as you upgrade your equipment to allow yourself to explor further from your base and deeper from the surface. It doesn't feel like any of the barriers are artificial and as such progression feels incredibly rewarding. My only complaint with the current gameplay is that at times the back and forth between crafting and going out to find more materials can be a little slow and it isnt rare to go out and come back without being able to build anything new. Also in the current build the tutorials are hit and miss with some items being explained well and others requiring you to look things up on the wiki. There also isn't an incredible amount of content and i felt finished building all of the worthwhile upgrades after ~20 hours. What is there though is fantastic (with the exception of a glitch here or there) and more is being added in significant updates every month.GraphicsThis game has beautiful visuals and makes for an incredibly immersive experience. All of the alien creatures are well designed and each has its own intresting AI. The bases and equipment also give off a cool futuristic vibe that fits in well with the story. The only problem here is that there can be a lot of pop-in and occasionally some hitching especially when moving around quickly.The restThe game also sports an interesting story however at the time of writing it is very undeveloped. While the basis is quite interesting the rest of the story can only be picked up through lost PDAs found throughout the world and there isn't much drive given for you to persue any leads other than a couple relatively meaningless blueprints. It is worth noting that the game also has a creative mode that allows you to build whatever you want without needing to worry about food/water or gathering resources however this is much less of a focus than the survival gamemode.Overall I would easily recommend this game to anyone interested in either the survival or exploration genres. I would also say that you do not need to hesitate because of the early access status because it is incredibly well managed. Score 9/10 "

								""9...9...9...9...9...9 hour until arrival.""I decided to write this review after I encountered a new (to me) white snake thingy that was bigger than my current base, and made me say ""Nope. Neeewp. Whole big fat ocean full of nope"" as I sped away on my mini-sub.I purchased this game almost exactly one year ago. I played it then, and it was a beautiful experience. The underwater world held wonder and fear in equal measure. The crafting and survival aspects of the game were entertaining enough that I played until I had my very own sub.But that was pretty much it back then.I picked it up again, wanting to see if the devs were keeping up with the game. I was shocked! Shocked, I say. The amount of content added, the improvements made, the expanded world and a quest system. The pacing has also been improved. No longer will it take only a few hours to get the Cyclops blue print. I've been playing for a while now, and still don't have the pieces. Exploring the crashed ship, the beacons (which lead to some really amazing sights), the sometimes extensive and dangerous cave systems are all a tense delight. And I feel like I have only just scratched the surface.I recommend this game to anyone who has ever played a game with the dreaded ""water level"" that you hate. This game will help you get over that hatred of water. Or it will drive you mad. Either way... Worth it!			"

Early Access Review
								The game has grown so much in the past 2ish years and is destined for success. But it still has problems and aspects that i belive could be persued further. for the building system the large tanks amazing but take up so much of the room that you cant walk around and enjoy the view, i would not say shrink the tank but get a bigger room or just make the whole room a tank that way we just pass through the thing instead of akwardly walking around it. we could also use 45 degree corners. and a major problem was that larger rooms like the moon pool and to a lesser extent the large room will clear a large area around tthem, and i often try to build as close as i can to the coolest looking thing i can find(within reason). other then this the building system is great below the water but above the surface it can be hard to build up because of gravity forcing players to build out instead. it looks amazing, everything this is the prettiest game i have ever seen done on the unity engine, hands down. the monsters are cool and unique however some like the stalker seem too ""hungry"" constantly chasing after any fish or players that wander too clost even during their least active time period. sometimes finding somthing gets hard especially for now players a SIMPLE in game map that is slowly revealed as the player explores would be cool instead of dropping 10000 beacons at every wreak or place of interest like I did when i first played. this is the ONLY ocean themed game i have seen (exept for ABSU) that isnt entirly focusd on horror or survival, subnautica shows wonder and spacific environments that have their own atmospheres and soundtracks(bloody cool ones). I would highly recomend supporting it on early access.			"

								Excellent game and very intoxicating. The graphics, and sounds all make it a very immersive experience that I could play for hours on end, which I have. That is also a reason I don't like it though. All 100 hours I have are from 1 month of owning this game, I actually almost failed 2 of my classes because I played it so much. Nothing really bad to say, just remember that it's early access so the game is always changing and sometimes you'll have to delete your old saves if they're incompatible with the new version. So personally I'd say wait a while, but if you do choose to buy it now, just know what you're getting into.			"

								This game is the first of my 240 steam lib to drive me to leave a review for. I picked it up for the summer sale and I put these 30 hours in over the first 3 days. It is absoulutely amazing and unique. There were a few minor bugs, but nothing that interupted gameplay, and it is early access. The game has a small story built in which is nice copared to other similar genre games. It cetered to my love of base building and resource managment but also scared the hell out of me with some of the creatures, and being stuck way to deep exploring. 800m down and lost in a cave looking for your sub is NOT a good time.. It has a lot of cool customizable options for your base and vehicles which is nice and the progression feels natural, not forced leaving you to do pretty much whatever you want to focus on (base building, farming) and when ready you can try and move to a new zone. Lots to explore, and each zone unique. Soundtrack is very nice to have in the back ground and varies based on zone. Id happily pay more then $13 for this game. No multiplayer, and no set answer on if/when but I still played with a friend just sharing screens as we played so still fun with a friend or solo. You will not regret buying this game			"

								I really like the concept of how in order to progress in technology, you need better and better resources. And to find these resources, you need to explore deeper and deeper into the ocean. And the deeper you go, the bigger and stronger the creatures get.I think the developers should continue working on this concept. There should be more of an element of fear to exploring. Bigger creatures, more generated structured, abysesses, and more ways of putting fear into the players.Overall, a really fun game and unique to other voxel-based survivals.			"

								Do you ever want to explore the vast ocean? Well, now you can! Except it took place in an unknown alien planet, where you are the 'alien' to the creatures of the deep. However, you are not at the top of the food chain here. Your mission is to survive, explore the deep ocean, scavenge all the resources from what's left of your crashed spaceship, build your temporary shelter and many more. Yes it sounds like any other survival games on steam, but maybe  one of the best early access survival games  you can find. The updates are huge with a lot of content. It looks like the developers know what they are doing and that's a great thing. The only let-down is when you spend too many hours into the game it will start lagging and crashing frequently (fixable by deleting save game caches). Hopefully they will fix this problem soon.I would recommend this game for its regular price, and also during the sale. Worth it.			"

								Absolutely amazing. The visuals are beautiful, the game mechanics are mind-blowing, every thing about this game is amazing. I sit on the edge of my seat staring at the section where updates are shown, constantly refreshing my browser waiting for the next update. The developers of this game are geniuses. This game has been holding me back from playing all my other games and I enjoy every minute of it. To be honest, the concept in this game is awesome. Seriously, Science fiction mixed with survival with a little mystery sprinkled on top? Who could have thought of it? But seriously, thank you for making this game and keep up with the development!

								Well I bought this game when it was on special but would now easily of payed full price for this gem. It is a game that is simplistic in doing what needs to be done crafting wise, but also enough of a challenge to make all the gathering of ingredients worth it. It also has adjustable difficulty levels which can add in hunger/thirst, or just have hp to worry about which can come in handy for new people to the game.The ocean has some of the most beautiful sights to see which begs you to keep searching through to new depths, and rewards you with upgrades obtained by scanning or new types of minerals to use in crafting. The creatures also make all of these environments come alive, but also be pretty terrifying at times too with some areas having giant monsters out to get you! Also for a early access game I have only had 2 major glitches which I was able to fix by quitting and reloading the save.All in all I 100% reccommend this game to anyone who enjoys open world exploration games or love bioshock! PS This game takes its toll on your graphics so if your computer isn't up to scratch try lower graphics			"

								Subnautica is a refreshing take on the survival game genre by taking place not just underwater, but on an alien world in the future.  It opens the field for a lot of creative ideas from the developers, which they deliver on well.  I recommend thsi game, but he's my list of pros and cons of it, as of the time of this review in early access of course.Pros:Very Polished Feel - For the most part all the features implemented are actually fully integrated.  It's not like most Early Access games where you'll just get grey blocks with the words 'dur plant"" scribbled on.  For example Farming was jsut added a few days ago, there's multiple plants and they all have growing cycles, fully modeled out.Great Graphics - It might be that I'm using the experimental high graphics setting bedcuase I figured my computer can handle it, but the game looks beautiful.Fun Gameplay - Right now the alien world survival genre is pretty small, what ones there are just assume oxygen atmospheres, which I think just dodges an attempt at some interesting game mechanics.  Subnautica's world is an oxygen world too, but since most of the game takes place under water, you still have to manage that along with hungry and thirst.Cons:Bad LOD Distance - Might be caused by the high graphics experimental build, but things only appear like 10 meters out.  If you're moving fast, or have been playing a while it might drop to 4 meters.  And also if you've been playing a long time when it does load it might take up to a second or two.Key Missing Features - There's no compass or map.  There is a beacon for the escape pod and you can make mroe deployable beacons.  But maybe realistically so, is super easy to get lost.  In desperation to get some sense of direction for example I tried to go straight east by my guess and drop a beacon, and go straight west and drop a beacon.  Instead I ended up putting one northeast and one north.  (You might say that a feeling of being lost is what they want to do, but remember it's the future, sci-fi, the escape pod replicator actual says it's programmed to make things you need for your environment - a compass at least should be something you can make.Strong Reliance on RNGesus - Since it's hard to navigate, and certain biomes are the only ones to spawn certain blueprints you just have to hope you find the right ones.  For example I only got 2/3 of a basic workstation upgrade, but I probably found 50 blueprints for a nuclear reactor.  I realize this is a tricky one to balance, because some RNG is fun and engauging.  Something like blueprints you already have not showing up anymore, or blueprints you need glowing on screen.In a nutshell, this is one of the best survival games I've played with a very cool setting.  It needs optimization pretty bad on load distance, and really needs some options to help with navigation			"

Early Access Review
								I've been playing this game on and off for months now. I generally make a return to it whenever there's a major update, as they're slowly adding in the story and new environments leading to what could be an actual end to the game. Every time I return, it feels amazing just to be back and explore the environments once again, especially as I notice the new features as they continue diligently removing bugs and polishing the game, unlike so many other early access games that have been utterly forgotten about by devs.Between the four game modes, I personally recommend Freedom. You still have health and oxygen to worry about, which can be enough of a challenge on its own. However, in Survival or Hardcore mode, you also have food and water to worry about. Now that doesn't sound too hard, except it becomes so tedious that at a point, it only serves to prevent you from exploring farther into the beautiful environment, detracting from the game without adding much interesting challenge. I'm perfectly content with the challenge of trying to fully scan a reaper leviathan with no protection.In terms of gameplay, it is generally very smooth already. I've experienced some FPS drops when loading into a new area, but that's to be expected from an early access game, and it doesn't by any means make the game unplayable. The controls are standard and straightforward, the inventory system works fine, and the multiple methods of self-defense generally work when they're supposed to work. Items generally are functional and can be found useful throughout the game. The scanner, for example, is a very useful tool that serves to immerse you further into the environment of the game while also giving you practical feedback (think Metroid Prime). There are a few items in the game that feel impractical at best right now, such as the dive reel, and other items would be useful but can be a pain to make work, such as the Seaglide, which increases your movement speed quite a lot but chews through power so fast that it almost isn't worth it to keep replacing the batteries until you've built a battery charger.This is the Minecraft successor survival sandbox we've been waiting for. It looks beautiful, it is challenging, and it's actually terrifying at times (nighttime and deep ocean). And unlike No Man's Sky, Stranded Deep and other survival/sandbox games that have been mostly forgotten about, this game is still being constantly worked on with more story being added. If you have a computer powerful enough to handle it, it is so worth it.			"

								This review is for the December 2015 build of the game. I have to say I had my doubts, especially since I've sworn off Early Access games, but I was more than pleasantly surprised at how developed this game is thus far.  Sure, there are some bugs, a long initial load, it's definitely framey in some areas, and there isn't really a story, but if it weren't for these few aspects, it would be difficult to even tell that it's in alpha.  ALPHA.  Even if they did nothing else to it (and there's a lot planned), I still got my money's worth out of this little gem.  My play time reflects learning the game and getting all the fragment (blueprints), not even exploring every nook and cranny the alien ocean has to offer.  If I hadn't used the wiki for a lot of things, I'd wager my playtime would be upwards of 50 hours.  How many FINISHED games can you say that for these days?  You can even give feedback and report bugs from within the game.  Updates appear to be roughly monthly at this time.			"

								Subnautica is a good game but it's TERRIFYING. I mean like never EVER go to the jellyshroom biome at night time. Subnautica will give you nightmares even if you play it in the summer, outdoors, at noon, while surrounded by friends and family. This game is cool if you like being scared kinda like FNAF but easier. It is open world and survival with some crazy looking alien sea creatures so you could see where I am coming from when I say it is scary. And when I say alien sea creatures I mean ALIEN SEA CREATURES. Not like some weird looking sea creature like that weird Jelly blob monster caught on camera in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico (search that up by the way). No I mean alien like different planet alien...because this game is set on an uncharted planet. Once again I will say that this game is fun but scary. You just need to watch out for the things that can grab you that are currently in the game such as the Crabsnake or Reaper Leviathan. Also the is a button that you could press to bring up a menu that allows you to enable the console which you could use to give yourself items and spawn creatures and vehicles. I forget which button but I know it is somewhere close to F5 or F7.			"

								This game gives me the worst damn nightmares but the best damn time. The game is so colorful and bright, at the start. As you go on the game becomes creepier and creepier. You first spawn in a reef close to the surface, everything is so pretty and nice. Then you move away from spawn, wanting to explore this vibrant game world. Then you see seaweed, bright seaweed and you're like COOL new biome! Then you see a barricuda lookin♥♥♥♥♥and you're like oh♥♥♥♥♥♥Imma cut this hoe. Then you get closer to it and it whips its head showing its teeth but you're not scared it's only a game. He reaches you and takes a little of your health and after cutting him up so much and thinking about the amazing sushi you just ruined, two more appear and kill you. Then you realize that your knife is♥♥♥♥♥so you look at the weapons you can make. They can't save you, they arn't ment for fighting. They are ment for surviving. You realize you arn't on the attack, you're on the defence, you need to survive. After respawning at your escape pod, you climb the ladder out to the top of your escape pod. Then you hear a countdown and the main ship explodes into a million pieces. In the comms you hear ""radiation"". You crawl back into the ship and see what you can craft in the fabricator. Tons of option that you have no clue how the hell to make. To you get out and start collecting reasorces, a hole♥♥♥♥♥♥ton. You come back and build tools and electronics and food. Then you see that your inventory is jam packed with titanium, so you take out your handy building tool and build an underwater base with sprawling corridors and huge rooms. Then you build a mini sub. And you go back to that stalker and you ran the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of him and you get the cofidence to go out and explore the world. Then you go out, staying close to the surface, not going too deep. Then the comms, ""radiation poisoning"" you turn around and head back to base and build a radiation suit and head back out, back the the radiated area and you notice the ship is close, it's not just a background but an object, you head closer and closer to the mothership and then the music stops, and you hear the ship let out a moan, a cry for help. The sound of metal falling and fire and then a...scream? A growl? You turn around and see nothing then your screen is jerked down and you see the biggest creature you have seen yet, it throws you out of your sub and you're left out in the open water. After picking up your headphones off the ground from jumping, you get jumped again killing you, and any sence of confidence you had. That is why this game is a horror survival game that does it better than any other. 9.6/10. Worth every penny.			"

								A fun exploration game that gets better and better with every update. A bug here and there and major crashes cause a small amount of frustration, but I can safely say due to the quality of gameplay I feel happy to just redo my lost progress. Saving is recommended greatly though. It also currently requires a lot of juice memory wise. On the worst computer, I was still able to navigate this by setting the resolution to 800 x 600 and the graphics to minor. The FPS is an issue, but I still feel able to enjoy the game with little hinderance. I'd recommend soley on the latest precursor update.			"

								Amazing game a game you can spend hours on building in creative or playing in survival exploring in this game is amazing once you get so far down there is awesome stuff to see down there.the developers work hard on this game and listen to the community, this game is still bugs out a lot but what you would expect in a early access game but besides the bugs you encounter sometimes and still an amazing game cant wait tell the full release of the game and see what they do with subnautica then.

								You wake up, alone in your dilapidated escape pod, groggy and disoriented. There isn't time to react as you struggle against heat from the fire that encircles you. Quickly you reach for the fire extinguisher and snuff out the flames. A light above you breaks through the smoke. It's the hatch! You step up onto the ladder, force open the hatch, and escape your life vessel.You are a castaway. falling from the seas of the skies, you find yourself bobbing in the seas of an unknown world- your ship smoldering in the distance.Subnautica is a beautiful game through and through, and (for me) sets the bar for what you should expect from survival games. From the moment you dive into the waters, you are just amazed at how beautiful the world around you is and at all the varying degree of life surrounding you. There isn't tons upon tons of things to do (explore, gather, study, explore, build, explore, see how deep the rabbit hole goes, explore), and the map is static, but this game is so beautiful that I find myself returning to it frequently when I just want to play a game by myself and have the survival experience and even though it's tagged as early access, it does not have that early access feel that 90% of the other EA games have.Pros:- Beautiful world/ Magnificent color pallet. This game amazes me just as much now as it did when I first set foot on it.- Decent rig= good experience. I haven't experienced any real serious bugs and definitely not any lag or latency when playing. I built a pretty good rig 4 years ago and I can run this game with the highest graphic settings and play fine.- Still challenging. This game is mostly filled with peaceful creatures but there is still enough in the game that can kill you, from running out of oxygen to reaper leviathan (You have a mini heart attack every time you get near them), to the other new dangerous creatures they recently added.- Animations on point. everything from the Aurora explosion to the way the fish move, you feel encapsulated in this world. I enjoy chasing Peepers around and stop playing every time the Aurora does it's thing.- The sea. The map itself isn't very large (large enough for a 1 player experience). But being in the ocean 90% of the time is a unique twist to survival and it gets pretty unnerving when you start branching off from the shallows and enter the abyss.- Unique creatures. I cannot stress this one enough! Everything from Peepers trying to be elusive, great lumbering Reefbacks, sneaky Crab snakes hiding in mushrooms, to screeching bone sharks and intimidating reapers, they all have their own style and feel.-Crafting/Building. While you have an assortment of ready to make technology, there are scattered pieces of tech throughout the deep seas for you to discover. This allows you to build vehicles, new and useful tools, expansive bases, and even gardens!-Exploration. Most of the new technology fragments are scattered throughout the world, allowing you little rewards for exploring new places. Grab a torch and cut open doors on fragments of your ship and explore the tombs of your previous home to find aesthetic items, new power sources, tools, etc.-Updates. The game gets one or two big updates roughly every month and almost always has exciting new content and bug fixes. The developers have a Trello board so that you can track what is coming next.-Single Player. Yes, a lot of people want this game to be multiplayer but I feel the map is too small. It also feels good just exploring by yourself and not having others get in your way. If they did multiplayer, they would have to do it as a separate entity.-Have your own aquariums and hatch your own fish!Cons:- I wish they had a dynamic map where every new play through randomized the locations of each biome. This would add to an already high replayability and keep me from wanting to build in my ""optimal"" build sites.- There are unfinished parts of the map. There will come a point where you will stumble across a large, blank expanse. Nothing in it. These are sections of the map that are unfinished.- I have run into a few graphical bugs that are a bit bothersome (fish swimming through your base, schools of fish clumped into a ball).-Not much to do after awhile. It takes a bit to get to this point but after you've built your base, your cyclops, explored the Aurora and the prison, there isn't much left to do except start over. It would be nice if they added a few more dubious creatures around the map to where you had to defend your base etc.-Story is being fleshed out still. There are plenty of tidbits on the story of the previous survivors, but still has more to come it seems.Ratings:Fun: 9/10Visuals: 9/10Sounds: 10/10Playability: 8/10Development: 7/10Creature models and animation: 10/10Butt pucker when attacked by reaper leviathan: 11/10			"

								This game got me wet, and that´s not just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pun. This game is amazing.Yes, It´s early access, and some of us have a code not to buy Early Access games, but this one is already taking form to become a true masterpiece. You´re a crewmember on a spaceship called ""Aurora"" when it (for unknown reason) crashes onto a planet covered in water. You wake up in your lifepod which is floating nearby the burning wreck of the Aurora, Now it´s up to you to survive and eventually get rescued. Dive down into the dephs of this gargantuan ocean and discover alien creatures and unique marine life, while asking yourself the question: ""Was i the only survivor?""This is an openworld survival game with a story starting to take form. Build bases, Submarines and tools, to travel deeper and deeper in search for wrecks and information about this planet. It can be scary at times, Especially at night, and it includes some BIG creatures roaming the ocean floor.I recommend this game if you like Survival games, Basebuilding, Big creatures with great sound design, Sci-fi and exploring.Pros:Great basebuildingExtremely cool veichlesInteresting storyUnique creatures (And BIG)Great sound designGood graphics, along with a beautiful world.Cons: Apperently alot of people got problems with the game running badly and crashing, i wouldn´t get too affected by this since it´s a common occurance for Early Access games.9/10, Im so excited for the upcomming updates.

9/10 - Absolutely amazing project with big potential and ambitionYour spaceship - AURORA - was myseriously and heavily damaged during sling-shot maneuver near a distant planet and crashed onto it as a result.You are one - if not the only - survivor out of ~100 people that were on board.Your lifepod has landed in relatively peaceful shallows of planet's ocean, filled with alien wild life.Your lifepod is halfbroken. AURORA's carcas is burning in the distance.With no better idea in mind you do the only thing that you can do - you go out there and start collecting all the essentials for survival: resources, minerals, water, food.Thankfuly your lifepod's fabricator is still working... You don't even have to do anything - just bring the materials needed and the thing will combine - or even cook - them for you.TECHNOLOGY IS YOUR WIFE NOW. GET USED TO IT.GOOD  Amazing visuals Immersive world and amazing atmosphere Gameplay never gets old - you will always have stuff to do, even when you think you don't WARNING: HEAVY DEHYDRATION DETECTED WARNING: HEAVY STARVATION DETECTED WARNING: 30 SECONDS OF OXYGEN REMAINING WARNING~- I KNOW, KAREN. I KNOW. Story and gear progression Sometimes it feels like you're playing a horror game. Because ocean is a scary place. ESPECIALLY alien one. NOT GOOD  It gets very spooky sometimes. I hate oceans. Game is not finished yet. There's going to be a story with final goal, but for now - its just a sandbox It's an early access with all the things that come out of it: bugs, performance issues, unfinished and/or half-baked content Each major update kindly asks you to forget your old save file and start the game from the beginning. All the progress you are going to be making - remember that you will have to abandon it and start from nothing again. BETTER USE YOUR TIME WISELY. Conslusion: its like Minecraft. But better. "

								""9...9...9...9...9...9 hour until arrival.""I decided to write this review after I encountered a new (to me) white snake thingy that was bigger than my current base, and made me say ""Nope. Neeewp. Whole big fat ocean full of nope"" as I sped away on my mini-sub.I purchased this game almost exactly one year ago. I played it then, and it was a beautiful experience. The underwater world held wonder and fear in equal measure. The crafting and survival aspects of the game were entertaining enough that I played until I had my very own sub.But that was pretty much it back then.I picked it up again, wanting to see if the devs were keeping up with the game. I was shocked! Shocked, I say. The amount of content added, the improvements made, the expanded world and a quest system. The pacing has also been improved. No longer will it take only a few hours to get the Cyclops blue print. I've been playing for a while now, and still don't have the pieces. Exploring the crashed ship, the beacons (which lead to some really amazing sights), the sometimes extensive and dangerous cave systems are all a tense delight. And I feel like I have only just scratched the surface.I recommend this game to anyone who has ever played a game with the dreaded ""water level"" that you hate. This game will help you get over that hatred of water. Or it will drive you mad. Either way... Worth it!			"

								8/10Pros+3 - Atmospheric AF+2 -Didn't skip on the difficulty, but it feels fair+1 - Did the Ocean Justice, You are always exploring and finding new places+2 - Gameplay is unique and inventive, before this game I used to hate underwater sections in games, but now I feel like this set the standard for aquatic sections in games to comeCons-1 - Can be Glitchy at times, but never broke on me, it was just miner things like clipping issues and physics (How a storage Crate moves an Escape pod and almost makes the thing drown is beyond me)-1 - Honestly I feel like the game could do well with some co-op survival, Completely optional but Truly would be an improvement, because a lot of my friends have the game, but we just wish we could play it together.Final RulingHonestly a good game, It does atmosphere, gameplay, and exploration justice in a setting most games would dread. I highly recomend this game to anyone who wants a new experience in single player survival without subscribing to generic ""Crafting Survival Gameplay"". This game truly made me rethink aquatic sections in games and I hope to see much more of this game in the future.			"

								Excellent game and very intoxicating. The graphics, and sounds all make it a very immersive experience that I could play for hours on end, which I have. That is also a reason I don't like it though. All 100 hours I have are from 1 month of owning this game, I actually almost failed 2 of my classes because I played it so much. Nothing really bad to say, just remember that it's early access so the game is always changing and sometimes you'll have to delete your old saves if they're incompatible with the new version. So personally I'd say wait a while, but if you do choose to buy it now, just know what you're getting into.			"

								This game is the first of my 240 steam lib to drive me to leave a review for. I picked it up for the summer sale and I put these 30 hours in over the first 3 days. It is absoulutely amazing and unique. There were a few minor bugs, but nothing that interupted gameplay, and it is early access. The game has a small story built in which is nice copared to other similar genre games. It cetered to my love of base building and resource managment but also scared the hell out of me with some of the creatures, and being stuck way to deep exploring. 800m down and lost in a cave looking for your sub is NOT a good time.. It has a lot of cool customizable options for your base and vehicles which is nice and the progression feels natural, not forced leaving you to do pretty much whatever you want to focus on (base building, farming) and when ready you can try and move to a new zone. Lots to explore, and each zone unique. Soundtrack is very nice to have in the back ground and varies based on zone. Id happily pay more then $13 for this game. No multiplayer, and no set answer on if/when but I still played with a friend just sharing screens as we played so still fun with a friend or solo. You will not regret buying this game			"

								I really like the concept of how in order to progress in technology, you need better and better resources. And to find these resources, you need to explore deeper and deeper into the ocean. And the deeper you go, the bigger and stronger the creatures get.I think the developers should continue working on this concept. There should be more of an element of fear to exploring. Bigger creatures, more generated structured, abysesses, and more ways of putting fear into the players.Overall, a really fun game and unique to other voxel-based survivals.			"

DON’T LET THAT MONSTER EAT YOUR FACE. but this game is relaxing at least sometimes. i like the concept its brilliant very scenographic. the realization of the landscapes and creatures are (wow) for real. At this point you will think (I have to swim all the time?!) of course no you can use a multiple vehicles as the seaglide,cyclops ( a very big submarine) and SEAMOTH ( a small and faster submarine). definitely try it (because if I have to describe everything It would take me a week ahaha) sooooo nothing I recommend it. vote 8/10one thing sorry for my bad english :(   "

Won't make a full review out of this, but even while being early access, there is a lot of content to last a bunch of hours, the graphics are indeed very nice to look at while not being too demanding on the PC at the same time, exploring new places, and seeing the alien life that resides in it, which range from cute to scary, alongside with the overall geographic look of the place is very fun, and so is building a base to function well in such an enviroment. I'd say this game is very immersive. You can even have you own submarine in this, and I'm not talking about a small, cramped minisub, I mean a big one. Altough there also is a minisub. There is not much story as of now, but what is present currently seems to have good potential. Not just the story, the whole game has a lot of potential, while at the same time being good for what it is right now. And I look forward to whatever is added in the future. I won't deny that there are bugs, but they are expected to appear in an early access title, and so far the developers seem to be constantly working on the game, so I don't worry about such bugs actually sticking around.

								Little problems here and there but for early access this game is fantastic. Couple of bugs, mostly visual (missing textures, which I reported in game), only one gameplay related bug but luckily I had a recent save. There are performance issues (pop in, fps drops) but the game is very playable, and these issues are most likely optimisation issues that will be done when content is finished. I would still buy this game again knowing about these issues, and I am excited for the full release as so far the game is already excellent.			"

								I'm not the sort for long-winded reviews, so I will simply try to be brief. This game, even incompleted, has definitely captured my attention and made its way into my top-5 games of all-time. There's something about swimming around in the open ocean, so low in the photic zone that it's nearly pitch-black, and not knowing whether you're alone or with hostile company, that this game just captures so well.The wonderment of an alien planet is something that both thrills and terrifies me, yet this game, with its subaquatic setting, makes it so much more real, as it leaves you constantly helpless and on-edge. It'll be tempting to stick to shallower waters, while it makes it rewarding to explore deeper areas to search for resources. The sheer terror of knowing that you're floating in water, and something could approach from more than one plane, definitely captures a sort of primal fear for me that no horror-oriented games ever have.On top of it all the scenery is beautiful. I don't want to go into spoilers, so you'll just have to take my word for it, but it definitely feels like an alien planet. And nights! The nights are simply startling at times, with how dark the water becomes.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that unlike ye olde Resident evil, the controls feel wonderful and responsive, but you won't exactly go teleporting around, despite how arcadey the controls can feel in responsiveness. You would have to keep an eye on your oxygen gauge. The world around you is responsive to you. Carry more air tanks and go slower but have more air, carry less and go faster but have less air; details like this are simply icing on the cake for me.The AI of the creatures sometimes leaves a bit to be desired - Stalkers especially, as they can be easily side-swam away from - but for the most part they act and feel like creatures on another world. Scary, wonderful, what-have-you-not.Long story short: For me, this game captures primal fear and encompasses survival, exploration, horror, and awe-inspiring all in one game, without overtly going for any.

								Love this game! Nothing like a classic crafting/survival game to keep you entertained. the environment is rich, the music beautiful, and the design quite charming. I have but two things of ""issue"" to say. one thing, is that I wish there was more! I wish there was more to see, more planet to discover. Lucky for us, the updates keep rolling out, and we're far from the final product. Second thing, which really is an issue, is that there seems to be an audio bug that progressively grows worse as you continue playing. Sounds speed up or slow down, and at times repeat. It has gotten steadily more constant as I have continued to play, and now every other sound is either distorted or repeated. Other than that and the occasional minor visual bug, this game is fantastic and only getting better!			"

								I have to say this game is very much worth the cost. Constantly being updated!Many many hours of fun and I have just scratched the surface at 59hrs. Very Few bugs for a Early Access Game. Game looks beautiful! If you are playing on a toaster it might not look as great but may still get decent frame rates! Only *Con* I can think of is there is a VERY STEEP learning curve. Although the game is quite forgiving so you can die alot with very little consequence. You can't blame the game it is still in development and the devs will add more of a guide/tutorial.I keep a wiki page open and check back to it now and then when I'm lost as to what I am doing or looking for.TLDR: Worth the money, fun for hours on end if you like exploring and survival games.

Pros:- Very active development team, full roadmap (with internal schedule) on trello with regular updates.- Story nearly complete with majority implementation.- Creative mode to explore the various modules and upgrades to learn how the game works, or build super bases without   resource cost.- varied lifeforms from the mundane, cool to the downright weird or the outright evil.- TONS of replayability- Harsh enough to keep you on your toes even in the late game.- Absolutely gorgeous visuals.Cons:- like any survival game some resources can be a grind- ♥♥♥♥ some of the hostile mobs :pOverall buy this game!!

								There is another undersea survival game called FarSky, but there are vast differences. The focus of Subnautic is on survival and exploration, while FarSky is on escape and actually penalizes you for exploring too far from your base. Since you can't reach the surface to replenish your air, you can't explore too far from your first base, and this is where Subnautica differs significantly. You've got full freedom to explore the ocean realm around you. You feel as if you are in an alien sea teaming with life. Content wise there isn't to do other than some crafting of items and tools, but Unknown Worlds has big plans for this game. Its hard to imagine a game this polished is still in Alpha. There is definitely room for improvement, and the game has boundless potential for the future.I've been wanting a game where I can explore the dark depths of the sea, and this is could be what I've been waiting for.

								Okay so...Subnautica is, to me, the scariest game I've ever played. And my fear of water definitely doesn't help the fact that this game is meant as a fun, exploration, survival game. I'm not saying it's bad, dear god it is beautiful and fun, but I am horrified by these underwater creatures and the thing that scares me is when I go into very open areas and I see and hear this giant tentacle creature just swimming right above my head. And no, there isn't just one of them...there are a dozen of them...But, overall, this is a great game and I would recommend it to anybody who likes survival games.			"

Early Access Review
This right here Ladies and Gentlemen is what Early Access is all aboutNot only does Subnautica progress nicely, but the developer has both the normal Early Access (EA) branch and an Experimental branch you can opt-in to (It doesn't get more bleeding edge then that. Things will break, a lot). You can even see what commits/code changes they make in real time on their site if you so please, see the (anonymised) bug reports and if (when) you encounter a bug, you can submit it in-game with a nice graphical user interface that can add both your exact location in the game, a screenshot, some text, and your e-mail if you want them to be able to contact you about specifics. Every game should take a hint from this.As every EA game it has bugs (pun intended. EA, gettit?), but in the normal branch it is actually surprisingly stable. I have only had one crash in ~6 hours play-time and it was while using experimental graphic settings. The bugs range from small stuff in the normal branch to the occasional huge game breaking bugs in the experimental branch. If you stick to the start area it almost feels like a real non-EA game for quite a while. Really pretty and polished compared to many full Indie games (heck, even some AAA titles don't do underwater as good as this). You can play it as a survival game, with the need to find food etc., or you can play it as a sandbox and just explore. Both are fun, though the food stuff isn't quite advanced enough yet to be fun for long and outside the starter area it gets strange-looking and empty-ish quite fast. There's also a hardcore mode with permadeath if you have a death wish.If you like supporting early access and see the game grow, this is in my opinion one of the best ways to experience that. If you just want to play, well it is quite fun too! "

								I love this game. I have to admit that I don't play and haven't played many survival games, but of the ones I have played, subnautica is the only one that I have come back to consistently and played more than a couple of hours on. There really isn't any other game quite like it, not really. There are other underwater survival games, like stranded deep for example, but that's not really like subnautica. It's set on Earth. Subnautica is set in a totally alien ocean, where things are much bigger and much scarier than anything in Earth's oceans.Pros: - Fantastic graphics. Things look really, really beautiful if you have good enough hardware.- Very original. Have rarely seen and never played anything else exactly like it. - Updated regularly, with new and interesting creatures, biomes, etc, and a story that gets more fleshed out and creepy with every update.- Not overly reliant on jumpscares. There are jumpscares, yes, but it's a very atmospheric(can I say that about a game set underwater?) game. You don't need to see the giant reaper leviathan somewhere nearby in the depths to be scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You only need to hear that roaring it makes when it's still 100 meters away and all of the♥♥♥♥♥♥in your body will make a hasty evac. The game is truly terrifying at times, but it doesn't always have to jumpscare you to do it.Cons:- Very hardware intensive if you want it to look decent. I have a lenovo Y50 with nvidia gtx 960M, quad core i7 processor, and 8 GBs of ram, and my computer still gets very hot running it, moreso than with most games. Not as hot as it used to I think, but it's still not super easy, even for my computer.- Can get repetitive, especially with resource gathering. It's not a huge problem, but often times I don't go to the trouble of trying to gather every single piece of whatever resources I need by hand, because it is sometimes difficult and tedious to do. I sometimes use console commands to give myself a quick boost. And I'm not the only one. Even youtubers like Jacksepticeye do that sometimes.- It's not finished yet. That's not exactly a negative thing, but part of the reason it can get repetitive is the fact that it's still in early access, so naturally it doesn't have everything it will have eventually. Overall:I would absolutely reccomend. Great game. Props x 1000 to the devs, as they are doing a really great job with it.			"

I highly recomend this game to anyone who wants a new experience in single player survival without subscribing to generic ""Crafting Survival Gameplay"". This game truly made me rethink aquatic sections in games and I hope to see much more of this game in the future.			"

								I really like the concept of how in order to progress in technology, you need better and better resources. And to find these resources, you need to explore deeper and deeper into the ocean. And the deeper you go, the bigger and stronger the creatures get.I think the developers should continue working on this concept. There should be more of an element of fear to exploring. Bigger creatures, more generated structured, abysesses, and more ways of putting fear into the players.Overall, a really fun game and unique to other voxel-based survivals.			"

								Really great fun and has the potential to become even better. Really worth your money in its current state. There is so much to do and so much to explore. If you ever wondered what exploring an underwater world would be like, and surviving in a hostile environment then seriously consider Subnautica.There are of course a few bugs which can detract from the enjoyment (ex. after reloading, my submarine spawned in the sky and has stayed there requiring that I build a second). These bugs require a little bit of finesse on the players part, breaking the rules somewhat which breaks the immersion. However these do not utterly ruin the experience and enjoyment so again, consider buying and playing Subnautica.			"

Early Access Review
								I like survival games, so I may be biased, but I can't help but have dreams of building sea habitations. This game is fantastic in so many ways. From the moment you are tossed out into the ocean the survival ticker starts off. I find hardcore thrilling. Every cave is a risk, every hunting trip the potentially last one, every meter deeper a meter further from the air above. It grips me like other survival games do not. I get a huge, nasty sunken pit in my stomach as I go deeper into the dark, as the lights dim, as the blackness swallows the view of the surface. This game is half the time not ""fun"" to play, it is engrossing, it is nerve wracking, and constantly throws my adrenalin through the roof. What more could you ask for in a survival game?It is early access, remember that. Lots is missing and will add so much to the game when it is put in place. There is no end game yet, no ""win"" and there is no spawning loot so there is only so long you an survive afaik. Even still, it's a gripping, thrilling ride, and well worth the money.I can only assume with proper workshop support the number of lifeforms, biomes, and tools could become really endless.It is lacking co-op, which I understand the difficulty of, but at the same time, feel it will add an entire new layer to the game, though also remove some stress. There is something quite disturibing about being down there all alone, perhaps why I want co-op so bad, haha.All in all, if you like exploring, surviving at all. Get it. If the ocean, the deep, or thallasaphobia disturbs you, get it. It's an extremely fun, intense way to push those fears without actually drowning.Graphic quality: 8/10Art Style:           10/10 (wow)Story:                 5/10 (Early access - little can be ""done"" on the crashed ship, or to rebuild and leave, etc, mostly a sandbox)Pacing of story: n/aCustomization: 6/10 (subs can be colored, upgraded, would like to see more items/buildables/coloring tools for bases)Mod ease:         1/10 (no workshop or mod support at the moment, afaik)Gameplay:         9/10 (actions, ships for the most part very smooth and fluid, some wierd bugs still re; flying subs)Good Ending:    n/a (still early access)Difficulty of game: 7/10 (For non survival vets this could be more difficult)Voice Quality:   8/10 (nice robotic base voice)Music soundtrack: 7/10 (could use more tracks, but the quality of them is high)Sounds: 9/10 (big part of the experience, hearing the rush of water around you as you scramble for the surface)Price of game: 9/10 (great time to get it early access around $20, well worth it)Fun: 10/10 (I love it, it's so captivating when you play, you are no longer here, you are down there)Replayability 6/10 (once you learn to survive and explore it all you are left wanting more, mods will help this) "

								Little problems here and there but for early access this game is fantastic. Couple of bugs, mostly visual (missing textures, which I reported in game), only one gameplay related bug but luckily I had a recent save. There are performance issues (pop in, fps drops) but the game is very playable, and these issues are most likely optimisation issues that will be done when content is finished. I would still buy this game again knowing about these issues, and I am excited for the full release as so far the game is already excellent.			"

Early Access Review
This right here Ladies and Gentlemen is what Early Access is all aboutNot only does Subnautica progress nicely, but the developer has both the normal Early Access (EA) branch and an Experimental branch you can opt-in to (It doesn't get more bleeding edge then that. Things will break, a lot). You can even see what commits/code changes they make in real time on their site if you so please, see the (anonymised) bug reports and if (when) you encounter a bug, you can submit it in-game with a nice graphical user interface that can add both your exact location in the game, a screenshot, some text, and your e-mail if you want them to be able to contact you about specifics. Every game should take a hint from this.As every EA game it has bugs (pun intended. EA, gettit?), but in the normal branch it is actually surprisingly stable. I have only had one crash in ~6 hours play-time and it was while using experimental graphic settings. The bugs range from small stuff in the normal branch to the occasional huge game breaking bugs in the experimental branch. If you stick to the start area it almost feels like a real non-EA game for quite a while. Really pretty and polished compared to many full Indie games (heck, even some AAA titles don't do underwater as good as this). You can play it as a survival game, with the need to find food etc., or you can play it as a sandbox and just explore. Both are fun, though the food stuff isn't quite advanced enough yet to be fun for long and outside the starter area it gets strange-looking and empty-ish quite fast. There's also a hardcore mode with permadeath if you have a death wish.If you like supporting early access and see the game grow, this is in my opinion one of the best ways to experience that. If you just want to play, well it is quite fun too! "

								There is another undersea survival game called FarSky, but there are vast differences. The focus of Subnautic is on survival and exploration, while FarSky is on escape and actually penalizes you for exploring too far from your base. Since you can't reach the surface to replenish your air, you can't explore too far from your first base, and this is where Subnautica differs significantly. You've got full freedom to explore the ocean realm around you. You feel as if you are in an alien sea teaming with life. Content wise there isn't to do other than some crafting of items and tools, but Unknown Worlds has big plans for this game. Its hard to imagine a game this polished is still in Alpha. There is definitely room for improvement, and the game has boundless potential for the future.I've been wanting a game where I can explore the dark depths of the sea, and this is could be what I've been waiting for.

								Been playing Subnautica for almost... well when ever it came out and its the one survial game I keep coming back to. Sure you when a cooler survial game comes out they seem to get boring over time and I personally am a huge fan of survial games from the basic minecraft to the ever complex gaming of ARK survival evolved and so on.Im not sure what it is about subnautica but it keeps drawing me back even if its just for a quick 30 min of gameplay it always entertains no matter what you are doing at day or night in-game. The one thing that gets me going is that in the beginning there is a bit of grinding but nothing to worry about but once you got all the high tech toys you feel invincible but when you get to the hidden lower depths of the ocean you still get a bit squemish and hairs tends to stand on your neck because you are not the biggest fish in that ocean by far no matter what you got in your arsenal.

								If you think you may suffer from a fear of deep water, or perhaps fear what you may encounter within water you can't see through, then this game may not be the best solution to a quiet Sunday gaming night. Unless you feel like torturing yourself, or are just a sucker for a great exploration game with great graphics, then by all means; Play this game.In Subnautica, I feel it puts the very essence into what I felt at the beach, or at an aquariam when I was a child into incredible perspective. That fear of the deep, the fear of the unknown, the helplessness in the water. Not only does the game have breathtaking graphics, and incredibly well thought-out creature designs, but everything from the topography to the Fauna has been designed thoughtfully and exectued well. It honestly feels like you are hopelessly stranded on an Oceanic alien world, with seemingly no hope for rescue.Of course, most people in this kind of situation would begin to adapt themselves to this new environment, and that's exactly what this game is about. Find rescources, catch fish and build better ways to protect yourself and survive. All whilst avoiding the largest dangers the vast underwater map of Subnautica offers you.The soundtrack is nice, but it's quite constant, and sometimes it spoils the mood, although, if you are like me and get terrified very easily to the point of wanting to completely surrender and quit the game, then the music doesn't spoil the mood as much as you might expect, or want. In addition, many of the denizens you will encounter in your various underwater journeys make noises befitting of what they look like. These sounds however, sound as they should underwater; muffled, echoed and slightly distorted.Gameplay is smooth and well designed, but the Subnautica world is constantly changing, with patches to the Experimental client being made up to 3 times a day, however of course due to demand and developer stress, the time taken for large updates to be released is mostly unpredictable.In conclusion, if you want a constantly changing underwater world with nearly limitless possibility for adventure, then this is a game you should buy. However I will not be held responsible for any sleepless nights or for you being terrified of the ocean from now on. Thank you for reading my review.			"

								This is by far the scariest video game I've ever played and it's not even advertised as such. Others may not have the same experience, but as someone with a paralyzing fear of the deep ocean, I can barely even play for too long at a time before my nerves start to get to me- at the very least I have to retreat to the safety of my base. I love it, though- the crafting is simple, logical and provides enough tools to do pretty much everything you'll need to explore deeper in the ocean. There is one exception and that's weaponry- offensive options are fairly limited in Subnautica as an intentional design choice and I think it works well. Something would feel kind of wrong in this game about going around mowing everything down with automatic weaponry. It is a bit rough around the edges here and there, as expected for an early access title, but the developers are transparent and regularly release new updates, as well as allowing the option to play daily experimental releases. Great stuff.			"

								Most games on early access are not worth the money in their current state. But this game stands out as the beautiful underwater adventure it is. Even in it's current state the game is worth the 19,99€ it costs.  The trailer and videos show the true nature of the game, no overexaggeration of the gameplay what so ever. I am the kind of player who likes games with a little mystery in it, and Subnautica definitely fills this criteria. TL:DR This is a great game and i'd buy it again in a heartbeat.			"

								This is a realy nice game to pick up if you like survival games,,and water.Graphics are really nice and the idea of it all brilliant.It's EA so obviously there are odd stuff going on from time to time, but the ingame bugreport system is really nice and simple to use, and will help devs to remove bugs popping up more easily.Can't really say that it lacks content (but yea it does^^) but again, it's EA,,not a ready and done game, so i won't put that up there as a negative factor. Just as a pointer to all, that this is not an epic 1200hour experience...yet ;)As it is you still get a load of gaminghours out of it though, and it has replay value due to it being fun to redo everything.Price 20€...well I must say I played 40h so far, and just restarted a new game due to update so probably another 40h easy.. Yeah it's worth 20€ easy....I mean that's not even 4 beers at the bar and those I chug in 1 hour so... ;)			"

								Im back.Tried it last year in really early alpha, had low Fps, now i rebought it again. I didnt gave it back in anger last time, but it was very laggy and there was less to do. Now there was the H20 update and i like the way the games develops.Underwater is scarry and amazing at the same time. I hope for a story or campaign or a multiplayer in the future. But if this game keeps a sandbox game i can live with it too, if they devs add a lot to explore and to create.And animals. There can never be enough animals in such a game!This time i will keep the game, cause its a excellent deal for 12 €.			"

								Subnautica is a first of its kind, and adds new things constantly. The experience of this game (the good and the insanely good) is something everyone should have. Trying to make this random planet hospitable for us, you crash land and have to deal with the fact that you're the only one left (unless MP someday? XD ). Find salvagable parts, make your own home the way you want, and eat the...yummy....fish (or be eaten). Face your fears, and face the depths of Subnautica!			"

								Hey Everyone! I see you are checking out Subnautica reviews! Well I hope this review will be helpful in some form or fashion.As I am sure you are aware from the Subnautica store page, this is a survival type game based in the ocean. What you may not be aware of (and the reason you are probably looking at reviews) is that this game is awesome! The devs are extremely active and posting new updates to the Experimental branch of the game seemingly daily.Also, for an early access game, it feels quite polished already, the graphics are beautiful, sound track is awesome, and the crafting system is fairly robust I would say. I also like that the way you get more advanced equipment and structures is by scanning fragments, which forces you to explore the ocean :-)Something else I would like to mention is the different biomes they have setup, so many awesome and wonderful things to see on the ocean floor, just watch out for some of the things that tend to live in the deep ;-)Definitely a game I would buy again if I didn't already have it! If you guys want to see some gameplay, I have a Let's Play series on YouTube and there are many others as well.			"

								Probably the best early access game I've ever played. Beautiful, fun, and has developers that are active in the community with at least 1-2 decent or major updates monthly. There's a pretty good amount of buildings and blueprints to build things so far, especially if you use the developer code (cheats) so that you don't need to spend hours farming resources. I've spent 90% of this game using cheats and I've still managed to enjoy almost 50 hours of the game. The only negatives I've had so far are that the game is still in early access, so occasionally a reaper will spawn very close to you if you are in a few specific biomes, and that the game is very time consuming to find resources if you don't use cheats (Plus resources and fish don't respawn without cheats).Great game, worth at least $30 in my opinion even though its priced less.

								This is a realy nice game to pick up if you like survival games,,and water.Graphics are really nice and the idea of it all brilliant.It's EA so obviously there are odd stuff going on from time to time, but the ingame bugreport system is really nice and simple to use, and will help devs to remove bugs popping up more easily.Can't really say that it lacks content (but yea it does^^) but again, it's EA,,not a ready and done game, so i won't put that up there as a negative factor. Just as a pointer to all, that this is not an epic 1200hour experience...yet ;)As it is you still get a load of gaminghours out of it though, and it has replay value due to it being fun to redo everything.Price 20€...well I must say I played 40h so far, and just restarted a new game due to update so probably another 40h easy.. Yeah it's worth 20€ easy....I mean that's not even 4 beers at the bar and those I chug in 1 hour so... ;)			"

								Subnautica is first off, Absolutely great. a bit buggy but it has great potential. they have added so much into the game allready. One of the bugs is that it says I dont have enough memory space, yet i have a whole Terrabyte of storage on my computer. Some lag here and there, but it is a big game. Otherwise, I would totally recomend this game!			"

								If you think you may suffer from a fear of deep water, or perhaps fear what you may encounter within water you can't see through, then this game may not be the best solution to a quiet Sunday gaming night. Unless you feel like torturing yourself, or are just a sucker for a great exploration game with great graphics, then by all means; Play this game.In Subnautica, I feel it puts the very essence into what I felt at the beach, or at an aquariam when I was a child into incredible perspective. That fear of the deep, the fear of the unknown, the helplessness in the water. Not only does the game have breathtaking graphics, and incredibly well thought-out creature designs, but everything from the topography to the Fauna has been designed thoughtfully and exectued well. It honestly feels like you are hopelessly stranded on an Oceanic alien world, with seemingly no hope for rescue.Of course, most people in this kind of situation would begin to adapt themselves to this new environment, and that's exactly what this game is about. Find rescources, catch fish and build better ways to protect yourself and survive. All whilst avoiding the largest dangers the vast underwater map of Subnautica offers you.The soundtrack is nice, but it's quite constant, and sometimes it spoils the mood, although, if you are like me and get terrified very easily to the point of wanting to completely surrender and quit the game, then the music doesn't spoil the mood as much as you might expect, or want. In addition, many of the denizens you will encounter in your various underwater journeys make noises befitting of what they look like. These sounds however, sound as they should underwater; muffled, echoed and slightly distorted.Gameplay is smooth and well designed, but the Subnautica world is constantly changing, with patches to the Experimental client being made up to 3 times a day, however of course due to demand and developer stress, the time taken for large updates to be released is mostly unpredictable.In conclusion, if you want a constantly changing underwater world with nearly limitless possibility for adventure, then this is a game you should buy. However I will not be held responsible for any sleepless nights or for you being terrified of the ocean from now on. Thank you for reading my review.			"

								Take my hours played with a grain of salt; I spend a healthy chunk of my time playing offline because of my current internet situation and Steam doesn't log those hours.Subnautica is an early access♥♥♥♥♥early access game, meaning it has bugs, lacks a number of features, and could definitely use some quality of life improvements in places. However, as of December 2015, there is certainly enough content here to warrant purchasing the game on sale, and unless you REALLY hate the core gameplay mechanics (watch some Youtube videos to get a feel for the game if you must), you can get a solid first playthrough of at least 10 hours with the content that is currently available. The game is gorgeous, plays very well, and is impressively stable (I've yet to see any game-breaking bugs or crashes). I don't normally recommend Early Access games because I don't believe that buying games based on a developer's promise that they will someday be playable and fun is a great thing for consumers to be doing in an industry where a lot of games come out of beta playing like total garbage, but Subnautica is different. I make the exception to my EA rule for this game because right at this VERY moment, Subnautica has enough content to fully warrant a price of <$10, and even if the devs never updated it again, I wouldn't regret my purchase. That said, the developers have a fantastic track record and HAVE consistently updated the game with meaningful content for the last year, so I have no hesitation recommending the game to anybody that's interested in survival games and/or doing battle with giant fish armed with only a knife. It's a good time.			"

								This is by far the scariest video game I've ever played and it's not even advertised as such. Others may not have the same experience, but as someone with a paralyzing fear of the deep ocean, I can barely even play for too long at a time before my nerves start to get to me- at the very least I have to retreat to the safety of my base. I love it, though- the crafting is simple, logical and provides enough tools to do pretty much everything you'll need to explore deeper in the ocean. There is one exception and that's weaponry- offensive options are fairly limited in Subnautica as an intentional design choice and I think it works well. Something would feel kind of wrong in this game about going around mowing everything down with automatic weaponry. It is a bit rough around the edges here and there, as expected for an early access title, but the developers are transparent and regularly release new updates, as well as allowing the option to play daily experimental releases. Great stuff.			"

The only thing I have to say that needs work would be the fact that you can get the achievments in creative mode. I think in creative, the achievments should be disabled, because they should be earned in true gameplay. Just a thought. But is not a big problem. LOVE THIS GAME!!			"

I'm not saying it's bad, dear god it is beautiful and fun, but I am horrified by these underwater creatures and the thing that scares me is when I go into very open areas and I see and hear this giant tentacle creature just swimming right above my head. And no, there isn't just one of them...there are a dozen of them...But, overall, this is a great game and I would recommend it to anybody who likes survival games.			"

								The game is really amazing. A massive underwater world for the player to explore, build, conquer. The entire game is based around survival, and once life vs death isnt an issue anymore- it becomes a game based around completing man's dream to excell and create an easier way to live. The game forces you to discover, to test, to observe. There is no tutorial, and you are literaly dropped into the world clueless (which is sorta the situation of your character). A massive survival-sandbox game that will make you want to board a spaceship and crash into a random ocean planet. Eat, drink, breathe, build, or just do nothing. Honestly the choice is yours and the possibilities are endless.			"

								Most games on early access are not worth the money in their current state. But this game stands out as the beautiful underwater adventure it is. Even in it's current state the game is worth the 19,99€ it costs.  The trailer and videos show the true nature of the game, no overexaggeration of the gameplay what so ever. I am the kind of player who likes games with a little mystery in it, and Subnautica definitely fills this criteria. TL:DR This is a great game and i'd buy it again in a heartbeat.			"

								I think this is by FAR the best survival game becuase of its creativity and aslo beucase it is not reppetitive. The developers have done a very good job at fixing all the bugs and adding stuff every week. I, as a person who is scared of the ocean beucase of sharks and other creatures, did not hesitate to explore and adventure beyond the bounderies. i recoment this game of people who like games like Stranded Deep and Mincraft and those who want to have their own adventure.P.S please give us a way to store the cyclops into our bases and add the sea emporor!

								Watched 2 videos and bought it the next day.  Definatly not a dissapointment.  If you are looking for a game that you can have a relaxing time playing then this is the game for you... well unless you♥♥♥♥♥♥off a bone shark, then all I can tell you is run. Other then a few things here and there that are a little glitchy (what do you expect, it's an early access game) It runs quite smootly.  The graphics look beautiful and even with low graphics the game looks wonderful.  This is one of those early access games that is better then some full games, and it doesn't even have everything in it yet.  I can't wait for whats to come. Oh, and one last thing, the dev team for this game are one of the best, always talking to the community and listening to what we want.  Fantastic, absolutly fantastic			"

								This game has a beautiful underwater world, with very unique creatures inhabiting the depths. There are so many interesting areas to explore, and you can tell the devs put a lot of work into the details. You are on an alien planet covered in water. You crash-landed here, with no idea what type of world it is. You must learn about its inhabitants, and occaisionally eat them, even if they are cute. An awesome survival aspect, that doesn't include the over-used zombie infestation. Instead, you have marine animals, that are both aggressive and friendly. The game can be peaceful, or scary, depending on what you are doing. There are lots of useful items to craft, resources to gather, and a few cool vehicles to make exploring even easier. One of them includes the giant Cyclops submarine. You can practically live in it. The devlopers are very open with what they are working on, and there are large updates often. There is an in-game feedback and bug report menu which allows you to submit complaints or feedback in real-time. The game is really unique and fun, and I'm looking forward to every update!			"

								I will just make this short and sweet. I would not normally touch survival games with a 10 foot pole, since I don`t get them. They are feel like busy work to me and more about messing up other players than playing a game. I was interested in this game ever since it was announced, so I kept and eye on it. I finally got it in the freedom bundle and even though I have played just a little, I can say for sure this is one of the best Survival games out there (I have played a few using my friends accounts, did not like any of them). The fact that it does not have Multiplayer is a huge plus for me. The game is not punishing too much, look incredible and has tons of stuff to do. It is also helping with my hydrophobia which is another plus!It is almost sad that a crap like NMS gets all the publicity and this game goes half noticed, but I guess it must be doing ok since the Devs are working on it still. I hope it gets finished and be one the very examples of survival games that actually gets released. The only negative point I saw was the awkward swimming animations for the larger creatures, I hope it gets fixed.PS: I see many are asking for MP, if they ever put it in they SHOULD put an option to opt out. I do not want to deal with other a-holes tying to mess up my game. I like it just the way it is now.			"

								If you are anything like me and you are fascinated by the ocean depths, this is certainly a game for you. It has an immense amount of potential, as depths have been discovered of up to 3000 meters and plans for the Sea Emperor have been made. The amount of content that this game could contain is huge. Definitely an Early Access game worth buying.			"

								As child I always wanted a game where I can adventure the deep blue in my own submarine. And get out of that said submarine. Unkown worlds has gave me what i wanted. After looking at lets plays and other reviews. I came to conclude that this game. Even in its earlist form. Is the best game I ever played. Its crafting system is easy. The monsters are unique and change from the places you have been. But in its buggy state. I would reccomend this to people who enjoy playing early acess games. The devs are really open to stuff they have been doing.And this community is full of people who want to explore the deep blue too! So hop in your lifepod and press that little button that says eject!			"

Early Access Review
								The depths of the ocean pose more dangers and difficulties in reaching than does outer space.  No other environment can inspire the levels of fear & dread that the ocean can, where the vast distances and minimal visibility mean that colossal beasts can end up right next to you before you can even see them, and everything down there wants to eat you.It can also be a wonderous place, filled with exotic creatures that we could never have imagined before we actually saw them.  Corals, anemones, plants and animals of all kinds can inspire awe & wonder on par with the terror of unknown that only the ocean can deliver.Subnautica delivers all of these things in concentrated doses, carefully structured to instill the player with both the horror and wonder of the oceans.  Then they up the ante by making it an alien world, so you can't even use real-life examples as a guide (well, actually you can - more on that later).  Using an equally liberal hand with both absolute darkness and gratuitous bioluminescence, the depths at night are both terrifying and beautiful.  Everything seems to glow, and the few things that don't you wish did glow, because the darkness is terrifying.Let me expand on that: Very few games out there can deliver any real sense of fear beyond cheap ""jump scares.""  While having a giant moster leap out and thrash your submarine can indeed deliver the same thing, the real horror factor is the fear of the unknown.  It's in not knowing what could possibly be at the bottom of that hole in the seafloor, or hearing the dreadful baying of a giant beast nearby but not knowing where it came from - and in a fully 3D environment, that could mean above or below you, as well.  The game primes you for fear before delivering the attack, constantly teasing your sense of curiosity to lure you into greater depths and greater dangers.  The point being, however, that even in areas free of hostile life the game still keeps you nervous and on edge with it's mind-twisting audio and constant paranoia about what could be living just beyond the edge of your feeble flashlight beam.  And no matter how far down you go, there's always a bigger fish and always a deeper, darker cave.  I haven't this much fun just aimlessly wandering around a map & exploring since Skyrim came out.  But wait, there's more!  The devs wisely gave the player (currently) four different difficulty settings to pick from, going all the way from hardcore survival mode to freeform, danger-free exploration.  This is good because it means both your five year old nephew and your crazy ex-Navy SEAL uncle can both enjoy this game.  It also lets you build underwater bases with a wide variety of rooms, furniture, and functionality.  This gives a good outlet for the player's creative side, as you can build those bases as small or large as you like.  Want a big headquarters with all the comforts of home?  You can do that.  Want to put a network of lone rest & resupply tubes scattered all over the map?  You can do that too.  Whatever works best for you - there is no ""one best way"" towards base design, or even gameplay, and honestly that's a rare thing in survival games.Of course the game isn't perfect.  It is, after all, Early Access and that's something that I've become rather loathe to even look at after so much garbage flooding Steam over the past few years.  I made sure to watch plenty of LetsPlay videos, read guides, wikis and forums before finally caving in and getting this game.  While I've been pleasantly surprised, it's still not without it's flaws - though it's a short list, thankfully.Now I'm not going to complain about the ""story"" being incomplete because it is Early Access so some missing pieces are to be expected.  However, all the pieces currently in game fit together.  There aren't too many ""placeholders"" reminding us that it's still under construction.  There's a lot of things that need tweaking, but nothing that I'd really consider broken.First, and this is likely due to trying to keep it XBOX compatible, the whole thing is done in Unity (not my favorite game engine, and I'll explain why thus).  While Unity is very user-friendly for game developers, and great at making things look pretty, in the long run it tends to suffer from terrible optimization & memory bloat - and this game is no exception.  Even one decently sized underwater base will cause a noticable slowdown, and trying to build multiple bases will further compound this issue until the entire game becomes completely unplayable.Second, and again I blame XBOX, there is zero modding support and it doesn't look like there ever will be.  I find that very disappointing, because modding is the #1 decider in long-term viability & replay value.  Maybe I've just been spoiled by years of Bethesda games, but I find that not including mod support in 2016 to be simply incomprehensible.Third, there is only one map and every game uses it.  This means that, again, long-term replay value is going to take a hit.  When discovery & exploraion is the meat of your game, you're going to want to implement ways to keep that idea fresh without having to personally go in and program new stuff every week.  Some kind of randomization via seed numbers would be ideal, so that people can replay the same map over if they want to (just write down your seed number and use it again), but those who want a new experience every time could pick a random number and see what happens.Forth, and this is the most minor quibble: Most of the technology makes no damn sense.  It's Star Trek in some places, stone-age in others.  I understand that sometimes suspension of disbelief must take a back seat to gameplay balance, but this is more like gameplay jacking realism's car and kicking them out the passenger door at gunpoint.  With everything else being so realistically detailed, this can be very immersion breaking at times.Despite these minor issues, I do feel that I've already got my money's worth out of Subnautica.  It's been a rare treat to find a game that can combine an exploration theme, a horror theme, and a building theme together and have all of it's elements actually work right together.  I can only imagine it getting even more interesting as time goes on.			"

								An absolutely beautiful and intensely immersive game. However, I am an extravert and I like player interaction, and this is something I sorely miss when playing this game. Unless Subnautica evolves into a multiplayer coop with an expanded map, I am afraid I won’t clock many hours on this. Future updates will show, keep’em coming, Devs!Pros: Creative aspectThe beauty and mystery of the oceanPlenty to exploreA gem for the imaginative types who like to explore and create in solitudeHealthy balance between the feelings of fear and safety, strategic thinking and plain wild creativityImprovements needed:Added multi-player to avoid the feeling of lonely boredomMap expansion, new areas to exploreIncreased and more varied creature interactionHumourDolphins, where are the alien dolphins?In conclusion, I would recommend buying this game if you don’t mind a few hours of lonely play.

								I played this game for an hour and then refunded. I then went on to watch some videos of other people playing and saw all the content I was missing and how much work the devs were putting into the future of this game and immediately re-purchased the game. This game is deceptive at first, it's pretty but seems to be sameish after an hour of fooling around until you realize how to unlock the more advanced gear and start exploring further and deeper and properly building up a beautiful base you actually want to live in. This game gets top marks for creativity, visuals, sounds, and replayability. There is quite a bit of placeholder art at the moment which was a disappointment to me but the art that is in place is beautiful. I look forward to playing more of this game (currently played around 6 hours across 2 saves) and discovering what the devs have hidden away in the depths. If you like movies like The Martian and Interstellar I cannot recommend this game enough because it will let you play out your stranded fantasies on an ocean-only alien planet.			"

								If you love survival and being released into the unknown then you will love this game. I've been a minecraft fan forever and it's nice to experience a different approach in this futurist oceanish survival world. Granted, its early access but the bugs are very minimal with minor larger fish colliding but that's rare from what I see. I'm like other Vive VR owners and hate BS cr@pware demos here but this is a nice find for a small $10 with sale.My specs:i7 6700 3.4ghzSSD OS (64bit) 1T sataGeforce GTX 970 4G16G RAM DDR3Graphics @ max (local PC) = 9 out 10Graphics @ max (Vive VR) = 5 out 10 (video studders and need to run @ lower settings)Gameplay (PC mode) = 10 (Game modes are like Minecraft. You can play survival, hardcore, creative etc.) Gameplay (Vive VR) = 7 out of 10 (the vive controllers are not used but you can use gamepad or mouse/keyboard)Cost = $10 @ 50% off (well worth it!)Story line = 8 out of 10 (You really feel like you're stranded and trying to survive. Keep in mind I have not finished it so I may bump this up)Crafting aspect = 8 out of 10 (not bad but I've been spoiled with other games. Has great potiental if it goes multiplayer)Game crashing = I have yet to see it crash in 4 hours of gameplay....Bugs (Vive VR) = go graphic low setting to resolve graphic tears. High settings will glitch like crazy. Larger fish will collide and flip around. etc. As for other bugs, I have yet to see more.Sound Quality = 10 out of 10 (wow, the sound...ummmm wow!). Give that sound editor a raise!All in all, I will say this is a game to buy for folks that love playing a survival solo open world game. You really have to think and manage your inventory when you first start. The devs are doing a super job and bringing the experience to a personal level when it comes to at your own pace.Hope this helps others!			"

Early Access Review
								If you're looking to wander around a giant area, pick up resources, and craft them into things that let you wander more and pick up different resources, this is a very solid game. I'm not a huge fan of the genre, but Subnautica is fun, fair, and challenging. The twist of it taking place underwater adds a lot of depth (hurr).Gameplay is exactly what you'd expect, as written above. None of the resources you can find or crafts you can make are too shocking. Often, survival games make eating/drinking too easy or too difficult. If it's overly easy, you just load up on supplies and eat/drink whenever, which adds nothing but time-wasting clicking. If it's too difficult, you spend most of your time making sure you're not dead, which isn't particularly fun compared to exploring. Subnautica is well-balanced in this regard.I also enjoy the fact that there is something of a story with directions on what to accomplish that you can follow or ignore at your leisure. The occasional radio transmissions you receive and coordinates you can visit kept me playing this a lot longer than I would have if it were more sandbox-y like Minecraft. I didn't encounter many bugs in my 7 hours playing through this Early-Access release. Some missing models/textures for uncommon items, but that's about it. It's a full game as it stands now; purchase with confidence.			"

								Subnautica is another one of those survival crafting games, however it does many things to stand out from the others.Subnautica provides minimal hand-holding throughout the entire game, in order to actually survive you have to figure out several things by yourself by using your brain and a little creativity. Just like actually surviving! Subnautica also encourages exploration by bombarding the player with varied and diverse biomes, as well as multiple creatures that are both hostile and friendly. The only fault I have with the game is its optimization, in some areas my computer tends to freeze up while the world decides to load in every little thing.You might look at Subnautica and think it to be just more library fodder, but it is a very good game. At this current moment, I have about seven hours in the game from two days of playing, and I still have so much left to do. With an abundance of content and promise of more to come with constant developer updates, this game is truly a great example of what Early Access should be.			"

								* GAME CRASHES AFTER 15-20 HOURS AS OF 1/22/2017 FOR EVERYONE*I generally hate writing in caps but in this situation, I believe it to be warranted. Outside of the MAJOR issue which I listed above, this game is utterly fantastic. It is beautiful in almost every way. The game feels balanced. The artwork is fantastic. I feel the perfect balance of serenity and fear. Towards the end of my last save, I made it to this area called the ""Grand Reef"". I won't give anything away but It was daunting. It was stunningly beautiful but filled with danger. I was equal parts excited to explore and ready to get the f' out of there. I could feel my stomach sink as I reached about 500m in the Cyclops. Very few games have made me feel this way without VR. I think the game could add a ton of new content which the Devs have... but until they fix the game crashes it's not worth it. Other commenters have already explained that there are work arounds but those are temporary at best. I work as a System's Administrator and the last thing I want to do is hack away at a fix. I'm not upset or frustrated because this game is in Alpha but it does stop me from recommending this game. I've had steam now for over 6 years and have never written a review before. I love this game so much and I hope the devs fix the crashes. It's been known for months now and it's time for them to set some priorities. No more content should be added until they fix the crashes. Once they do, I'll not only change my review but I'll buy a few copies for my friends. The game is fantastic and it deserves to shine.			"

								I shouldn't have gotten this game. Not becuase its a bad game but because I'm terrified every moment of playing this game. There was this one moment where I had got up and went to the bathroom to ""clean up"", and my mate spawned in 8 reaper leviathans. And this game doesn't have a kill or disable command thus the only way for me to kill the guys are to shank them with a knife. But other than that this game has a weird waypoint system. I know this is a game of exploration but if you going to have waypoints on one thing and not the others then why bother. Here's a tip for those who read this far and are scared of the ocean stay near the bottom of the ocean it helps with your fear			"

								One of the most thrilling games I've ever played, not just within the exploration/survival genre, very recommended especially for you deep sea fans. I suggest you go into this game blind, no ""beginner guides"" or anything, and just explore. And continuously♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants. On a more serious note, as an early access title it surely rises suspicion, I too have felt screwed over by paying for an early access game (cough DayZ cough). However with Subnautica, the devs don't promise diamond mountains, keep realistic goals, and are actively discussing development in the community. Some dissatisfaction comes up about the world not being procedurally generated, but I much more prefer the developer's reasoning to make it handcrafted yet special as to avoid random areas that don't quite work together (I know what we're all thinking...I don't have to mention it).The game itself is very immersive, lots of neat flora and fauna to discover, about half of which wants to kill you because you are the intruder in their creepy deep sea fishy business. Some minor bugs are present, such as clipping rendering when exploring in one of the small vehicles, which the devs have addressed. Even if you're still skeptical, see it this way: if development suddenly drops like it tends to, you still get a great chunk of gameplay for the price. rig specs: Intel i5-4690kNvidia GTX 107016gb RAM			"

								As someone who enjoys the survival-builder type of games, Subnautica has been an amazing experience. The game presents a very unique environment: It is underwater, which can get very alien and also takes place in a fictional environment.The animals and flora seem well-thought and not random, evident by the in-game encyclopedia that explains evolutionary or functional insight into the creatures.In addition to that, the game doesn't give you the easy way out: You don't just find a strong weapon and shoot things. You find alternative tools (such as blasting enemies away) and have to make use of the raw materials to craft such tools and more.While you face vibrant colors and a breathtaking setting, the game is also very tense and bleak: You are stranded, alone and you need to survive.I'm only <9 hours into the game and I've already had a lot of fun and I realize I haven't really seen anything yet.Obviously the game is in Early Access at the moment and has a lot to improve but the developers ask for your feedback and seem to be pretty into it. I'm pretty sure I'll get my money's worth even at this stage of the game, but I also have trusted the developers.I advise everyone interested to buy the game to help its development. I guarantee you, if you like the concept you see in the pictures, you won't regret it.			"

								This review is written for the EA version. I will happily take a look at the game again after the final release and change my mind if needed. Also I just played this game without watching any ""Let's Plays"" or ""tutorials"" before. I was looking forward to give it a try without any spoilers and this is just my impression from the first hours - which couldn't motivate me enough to continue playing this game. Pro:- Nice graphics. Espescially the starting area, the change of light during the day, the waves. Just beautiful.- Interesting underwater setting. Being limited in your O2 supply is not new, but the mechanics are well made in this game. - Good design for the buildings and equipment - at least if you like the style of Apple products. This also leads to a contra point... - Great sound that adds A LOT to the atmopshere, especially from the creatures. <3Contra: - It's way too easy to simply survive for a ""Survival game""*- No feeling of (meaningful) progress, which is probably the most negative point for me- bugs that will make you loose your progress of the first hours* if you don't use google first- unbalanced / unrealistic game mechanics that allow you to create a huge underwater base out of scrap metal in the begining (that would require crazy high tech in real)  - but you have nearly nothing to place inside your base. And you can't even craft a simple harpoon...which would be WAY more important at this point than a fancy underwater home with power and oxygen supply. :D- The base building leads to glitches due to weird placement and doesn't allow you to build really interesting and unique constructions - you are very limited by the segments that are available. - Some parts of the game (when you are leaving the starting area) are empty and are looking like placeholders, including minor graphical glitches. Summary:This game has potential, but there are (imo) far better survival games available on Steam for a similar price right now -  unless you REALLY love the underwater setting and the Apple-like design of your eqipment.""Empyrion - Galactic Survival"" has (imo) way more to offfer. You start under similar conditions, but in the end game you have a whole galaxy to explore. Also you are not limited to base building: You can also create your own land vessels and (capital) spaceships from scratch, without the design limitations that come with this game. Ah, and you also have to keep an eye on your O2 level - depending on which kind of planet you are at the moment. :D ""The long dark"": Just brutal survival in an unforgiving and icecold enviroment. No base buidling, but the fight for every calorie that your body needs is rewarding enough. ""7 days to die"" - A Zombie - Minecraft for adults, with RPG elements and splatter. _____________Explanations. in case you are interested in the details and  the points marked with an *:Bugs:I've placed my gathered stuff and equpiment in the ""waterproof boxes"" that should stay where they are, to store your stuff, 7 of them. For starters without a base this are the only means to store your stuff. All of these boxes have been empty upon my return, according to the forum that is a known bug right now and the boxes work more like a trashcan that will delete your stuff after a while - despite the tooltip ingame saying the complete opposite. I wasted a lot of game time due to this bug. Lack of motivation:I have no clue what I am supposed to do. If the game would be just about surviving its way too easy, compared to games like ""7 days to die"" or ""The Long dark"". In this two titles its clear after 5-10 minutes that surviving is going to be hard and that you need to find food, water, clothing asap. In Subnautica you just swim out and grab some fish, without any danger, and you are done. Enough food and water for the next few days. If the game should be about progressing, levelling up, gathering mats and crafting new stuff: I don't see any of this, anything that could motivate me to continue playing. The story sent me to the other rescue capsules and I went down to the deep bottom of the sea, and there have been random cubes (that looked like glitches or placeholders) lying around, that I had to scan (?) and that either give me A: Blueprints for stuff that I don't want and don't need to build or B: metal that is available in abundance anyway. In addition the bottom of the sea was looking empty and buggy to me - repeating textures and  graphical glitches (flickering).Good night everyone! <3			"

Early Access Review
								I've bought this game after seeing a couple people play it on the youtubes, decided to buy it on a sale, and by the Great Beard of Grouchy Odin, I've enjoyed every hour of playing this game (even when the stalker killed me through 15cm of steel), I can and will recommend this to anyone, but don't expect this to glitch free, (early access), the amount of swimming you can do, and the satisfaction you get after crafting so many things to make your life easier! DAMN. This game is stunning, I've played it for a decent amount of time (All hours on hardcore, which I would recommend to anyone since it makes you really not want to die.), but all in all it lacks content. Sure it is early access so we can expect more  to be added, but it seriously needs more creatures (There aren't that many. Don't let the sounds fool you.) The biomes seem to repeat themselves a lot too. In my opinion the content needs to be tripled for it to become a fully fledged game.  Small pros and cons list for the sake of it:Pros:- Beautiful game (with VR support)- Very atmospheric - Lots to explore- Surprisngly satisfying crafting system (imo) - Terra former gun (for making rock gentials. Get it!)- Supposedly will get better- Resources don't respawn! (YOU HAVE TO EXPLORE!!!)Cons (Mostly related to early access):- Needs more content (creatures, biomes, crafting)- Crafting needs better explanation (In regards to the Pro: Yes its fun, but lacks proper explanation)- Buggy as hell- Unstable- Its early access.Its a mastapiece. A buggy one, but a masta piece. "

Early Access Review
								i love this game and it is probably one of the best early access games i have ever played, and i know im gonna get lots of mixed reactions from this but i would very much love to see a multiplayer version in the future, i think that it can function well as a multiplayer game without any major adjustments to gameplay and story (some minor things like the base saying that someone has entered would be cool, things like that) but anyways on to the reviewTHIS IS MY OPINION SO IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY YOU CAN SHOVE IT UP YOUR ***PROS:-the story (so far) is pretty cool and there are some cool little things that you can notice if you listen closely-the gameplay is very well done and varied, there is so much to do in this game once you get to a place where you arent starving to death, from exploring the depths of the (sometimes scary) ocean to building your underwater fortress i am never bored -the graphics for this game are astounding, especially for an early access game. so much detail goes into every little bit. just looking at the animal life even at the start of the game is incredible (at least to me)CONS:-there are many glitches (as to be expected with an early access game) specifically with the terraformer but im sure it will be straightened out in the future-many of the entities have weird hitboxes or seemingly no hitbox at all and this, as you can imagine is a big problem, it also may have been straightened out in the new update but i havent had time to check-long load times and, at least for me i dont know if anyone else has this problem, but corrupted saves happen pretty frequentlyPlease buy this game it is totaly worth $20        7.5/10Thanks for reading!

								I love the concept of this game, some ideas are cool but I need to say this, right now this game have very, very bad performance. The FPS drop to 0, the full game freeze for a while every x seconds and if I pass trough a creepvine are the game crash always. It's frustrating, every hour in this game I only have 10-15 mins of real gameplay. Developers, I am a developer too, I know how difficult it's to develop a game, but folks I am trying to figure out how to be so unstable and so bad perfomance in engines like Unity and I am not able to. You have a great idea and I really love it, but right now and after your last update (castle and coffee), the game it's totally unresponsible. For now I'll give you a ""No"", but I'll keep trying and if you improve the performance I'll give you my yes.			"

								The art is wonderful. I've been playing this for awhile, and I have to admiit that gameplay has slowly improved, and that the game no longer crashes fifty times in four or five hours of play. That being said.... this is not a game for the goal oriented. The frustration induced by severe bugs at critical moments is (almost- it's been close) enough to make you throw your keyboard through your monitor. I have a total of 318 hours into this game. I've used the f8 (report bug or issue) function every time something made a game unplayable- and I've never yet received a response. I really wish the developers would wrap this up- I'm going to have to stop playing it at this point because the bugs are fatal. Once one crops up, you're done. That game and the time you've invested into it are gone, and you have to start from scratch. I had several advanced games that literally died in the water because there's no debug on load routine- and only one save per game so you can't just go back and lose an hour's play or so. If you worship Sisyphus, this is your game- because you'll be slogging uphill forever.			"

								I'm not normally a huge fan of Survival games, though this game's ability to play in various ""modes"" helps a good deal towards letting me play it as I like.I'd say the two things it most has going for it- at least for someone like me is:A) You can build- a lot and creatively.B) It is ~immensely~ well done in the atmosphere department.  As I've remarked elsewhere in forum threads around this idea: even with damage turned off (I know I basically can't get hurt), standing on the edge of a potentially endless and unknown abyss is really, really forboding.  This game captures a nice blend of sandboxy-goodness and awe-inspiring environments.  You can relax and go all zen while you put things together and create your masterpiece, or you can sally forth into new 'worlds' to witness the beauty and the terror of it all.Highly reccomended.

								As an avid Minecraft player, I had high hopes for this game.  And I was not disappointed.  Fully customizable seabases, several pilotable vehicles, loads of sealife, a satisfying amount of loot and crafting, and so much more!  I remember when minecraft was in early alpha and I have to say this game is much better rounded for being at roughly the same point.  The only MAJOR issues I have with this game so far is the finite loot system and a couple bugs, but the bugs at least will be fixed for sure in the future.  Regardless, Subnautica has promise to be on the same level of popularity as minecraft, while still maintaining its own unique play style and story.  P.S. having played almost every survival game out there, I can say that this is the best package I have seen for the aspiring Steve zissou in all of us.  So to the developers, good work and good luck; I'll be playing this gem just as much as minecraft or terraria.			"

Great game to explore and survive; build things and discover islands and stuff.Story is not main focus but is also pretty awesome.Loads of unique sea creatures all with different purposes. Some to eat or drink; and some to  scare the absolute crap out of you at 1 AM There are some issues such as crashes, regular frame drops/ skips and no autosave (which has screwed me over quite a few times).All around very enjoyable experience and would recommend...10/10  "

Early Access Review
								In a time when the phrase 'early access' is usually met with a cacophony of wails and groans, I was admittedly skepitcal about purchasing Subnautica. It also didn't help that I have mild Thalassophobia - a fear of deep bodies of water. Combining these things together you might expect me to have avoided this game like the plague; however, a chance stumbling upon of a video featuring this game by a Youtuber I sometimes watch(Video Sage) piqued my interest and I'm glad that it did.Having now clocked in a little over 90 hours in just two weeks, I can safely say that Subnautica is worth your time not only as an early access game, but also just in general. Unlike many games that fall into this category, Subnautica featured very few trips to it's wiki page to figure out what I should be doing and how to go about doing it. It's a self contained title which does a reasonable job of guiding new players into it's depths and arming them with the tools they need to explore and thrive.It helps that Subnautica is a truly beautiful game, which makes exploration of it's various distinct 'biomes' well worth your time. Each such biome (usually) contains a diversity of flora and fauna for you to observe and interact with. The lighting effects and ambiance which accompany each biome are also wonderful. From the deep, dark blue of the grand reef to the algae green of the kept forests, each biome truly looks unique and interesting.Of course what good is a bunch of pretty scenery without strange creatures to inhabit it? Subnautica won't disappoint in this regard either as each biome features many creatures both small and large. These creatures range from tiny and annoying to massive and peaceful. Some can be captured and eaten(or even be bred in large alien containment units). Others are merely there to add flavour and wonder to the environment... And some are there to make a meal out of you.It's up to the player to discover which is which, but thankfully you have the ability to construct large underwater 'seabases' to house all your belongings and act as a safe haven. These bases can be thoroughly customized with a variety of useful utilities or even just decorations. They can be built pretty much anywhere and at any depth, and help add a feeling of permanence to your game world.Ultimately, at it's heart, Subnautica is an exploration game though, moreso even than a survival or building game. Swimming out into it's waers and discovering new biomes, creatures, and secrets beneath the waves is what it's best at. Indeed, much of the games progression system and the various base parts, tools, and items that the player can craft require you to venture into the world and find scannable 'fragements' to unlock their use, thus rewarding the players exploration wit tangible benefits.All of the things I have mentioned here are, on their own, offer plenty of the reasons to purchase Subnautica. It's beautiful, deep, and has much to offer. However at the almost insane asking price of 20$ USD, Subnautica isn't just a value. It's a steal. I really don't think anyone would regret their purchase.Pros:- Beauitiful world to explore and catalogue.- Many interesting creatures to eat or be eaten by.- Lots of fun and interesting tools to craft and play with.- Powerful, craftable vehicles to explore and exploit the world with.- Interesting(though WIP) storyline that gently nudges the player forward.- Very near feature completion, this is the best time to get into early access.Cons:- Not all biomes or story elements are complete.- Game does suffer from some bugs, though few and far between generally.- Early access, game balance and features in a state of flux.- Wiki reading is usually not needed, but occasionally may be.

Early Access Review
								A great early access game. The environments are rich in all types of ocean life and it has a mystery and horror-behind-charm that leave me wanting to play more. However frequent crashes upon loading new areas have left it almost unplayable on my only and longest running save. I am completely sure that I meet the minimum requirements, in fact my build exceeds them, though almost every time, upon moving a few meters past my initial starting point, it crashes without fail. To reiterate, this is surely one of the best, if not the best, underwater-survival-horror- (because ya' know, crabsquids and leviathans, need I say more.) building-exploration-games you can possibly find on any game selling website or application, but remember where your money is going. Probably some hard-working super creative devs that simply haven't had time to optimize their masterwork, hence, early access is an exceedingly correct title. Please use your money wisely, if you don't want to experience a few crashes and bugs along the road, don't buy. If you are willing to tolerate them, buy. Buy because it's an amazing visual experience not tailored to those who fear the ocean, or those who fear the risk of early access.			"

								I don't think a lot of people here understand what ""Early-Access"" means. People, when you see that tag on a game, it means that the game isn't completely finished yet. So yes, that mans there are going to be bugs and the occasional crash (Although the game has yet to crash for me!) And for the idiot that is complaining about getting 5 FPS,1) Go and get yourself a better ♥♥♥♥ing PC and quit whining.2) Read the 'System Requirements'.....it's there for a reason.And for everyone else, Enjoy!

								I both love and hate this game. I love it because it's so immersive, the detail is amazing, and the storyline, although not quite complete yet, is awesome. I hate it because I played it for a long while yesterday and that god-forsaken leviathan showed up in my nightmares. I ran into it twice yesterday, once when I was cruising in my seamoth, and it appeared out of nowhere right in front of me. I thought it didn't see me, so i high tailed it in the other direction thinking I could outrun it. Spoiler alert: I didn't. It showed up front-and-center and proceeded to eat my seamoth. I did the only thing I could do. I exited the seamoth, and swam as fast as I could. I looked back and saw the leviathan shake my poor seamoth in it's jaws and I heard the explosion. Thankfully I got away, somehow.I was passing by the area later, ever watchful, and I saw a stalker a few yards away near the surface by the aurora. I looked away from it and my entire screen was filled with red and white as the leviathan bit into the stalker from below and flew through the air like some kind of special on the discovery channel. I sped off and didn't look back. RIP stalker, you saved me and my seamoth.This game is amazing, and terrifying. I'm already afraid of deep water and this game has not helped me overcome that fear. I love open world games like this and it's one of the best games like it I've ever played, and it's not even complete yet. Keep up the great work, I can't wait till it's complete.			"

I got this game when it was new, and I made a big mistake. I went near the Aurora after it blew up when I first got my seamoth, unknowing that the reaper would spawn infront of me. It was a giant jumpscare. I rarely play it, but it is a good game.			"

								Great graphics and super-simple interface.  If you like to scrounge, build, and occasionally fight - yes!  It reminds me of the first time I saw a video of Cousteau on his Calypso.   It seems a little lonely without a cooperative mode, but that didn't stop anyone from enjoying other single player adventures.  Things I like - visually stunning, progressive difficulty, discovery.Things I didn't like - learn as you go, no map or direction finding (except pod point beacon), twitchy fish and short range scanner make scanning a chore. Things I would change or add - character customization (including sounds) for gender, color, etc.; a way to seek rare materials (like a long-range scanner), and a quest list of things to do (remind me to find magnesium for my welder).

								This game is the best horror game I've ever played. It starts off, lulling you into a false sense of security. You're in a bright, colorful, lovely ecosystem. As you adventure, build your base, you feel pretty proud. You've even got a few cool vehicles!Then, you travel further underground.First, you reach a dark, lifeless canyon, filled with dead Creepvines.Second, you travel even further, reaching a beautiful, awesome, nice ecosystem again! Albeit it's filled with bones, but, it's still kind of creepy.Third, there's a deep dropoff. You land in a hellish wasteland, filled with lava.You hear a roar.You turn around.You see a massive creature, at first, a silhouette.Then, it's getting closer.It's too close.It's over.BUY NOW!			"

								so i have an idea for next update since i can rarely kill things or be safe how about we get a harpoon guun or even a regular small pistol for underwater it can go like this crash pwder and titanium can make bullets the gun can be made with titaniuma and will every so often jam from depth or water clogging now for the harpoon it is creepvine and well titanium is used to crafat harpoon and is retrievable. harpoon gun is creepvine and titanuim and for sharper bulletts it is diamond at work bench and for hot ones it is battery with it at workbench i feel this could add to the hunting aspect when more creatures are added i also id like to reccomend modding of seamoth like putting two arm like things on front one for grabbing and breaking limestone the other for whatever you put their like a repulsion cannon or even a harpoon gun and pistol along with the stasis rifle and terraformer that way you dont have to constantly get out and it will use more battery when second hand is in use if electrical object that consumes battery this is just my personal opinion im not sure if its even possible but it would be nice to have the seamoth as a more adventurery type vehicle and i would like new mosnters for it to combat			"

								I absolutely LOVE this game! If you are into open worlds, crafting, surviving, fearing the ocean, building bases, gathering, and exploring then this is for you!It is very much worth it, but if you are like me and don't have the best set up I would suggest waiting because as much as i love it i can hardly play it at all. it crashes a lot on my laptop and there are still lots of bugs, but the developers are awesome and fix whatever they can. It is still very much a work in progress but it is worth it with the right set up!			"

A one of a kind aquatic exploration game.Subnautica is one of the games currently caught up in the survival genre craze. It stands out among the others by having an underwater setting.The game mainly focuses on crafting anything from a knife to a fully fledged submarine, and exploration. Lots and lots of exploration.You're pushed to explore by the aforementioned crafting system, which requires obscene amounts of materials that you have to gather from various biomes. Due to the fact that the game has no respawnable resources at the time of this review (Aug 8, 2015), you'll eventually find that the area you start in becomes barren of resources and you're forced to either relocate your base or go on scavaging expeditions.The crafting and building system really comes into play once you decide to build an underwater base. With the recent Habitat update you're able to craft vast interconnected buildings with everything from a dock for your small submarine (the Seamoth) to an observation lounge and an aquarium. Of course with all these buildings comes an expanded hunt for materials which may bring you to unexpected biomes far from your comfort zone.   ---The survival part of this survival game is a bit lackluster at the moment; Not a whole lot of creatures will attempt to kill you, even fewer will succeed. The only real threat from a creature in the game right now comes from the Reaper Leviathan, who roam the crashed spaceship ""Aurora"", but you'll always run the risk of suffocating underwater - and that's where you'll spend most of your time. There's also a system for food and water intake, however it isn't very difficult to manage.The crafting part of the game is intriguing. You'll have to craft rudimentary tools and high level tech to advance in the game. Most crafts are semi-optional (depending on how you play and where you go), but some gear has to be crafted to stay ahead of the game and not get stuck singing shanties on a lifeboat.The building part of the game is exceptional. A large variety of buildings to choose from, the freedom of choosing any location in the game to start building, and an easy-to-use building system all contribute to an amazing underwater building game.The exploration part of the game is lovely. The graphical details of the glowing flora and fauna in an underwater environment can't be described in any other words. It is lovely.---The only major drawback of this game is that, if you don't find yourself incredibly interested in exploring every inch of the map, it doesn't really have any viable content once you've built everything you can build. But, hey, this is an Early Access game - it's still being developed and new content is added frequently!If you like survival games, exploring, the deep blue sea, and building, you should definitely get this game now and help the developers make it the perfect underwater survival game.

								Subnautica is one of the slickest and well-designed games I have ever played. Everything works, and is amazingly well programmed and designed - one of the best ive seen.The game itself takes around 6-8 hours before it starts getting good in all honesty.. but after that time the game just basically keeps getting better and better the more you play. I was really sceptical in the first 6-8 hours, but now I put this game down as actually pretty darn amazing once you factor in how slickly it runs, how beautifully designed and atmospheric the environment is, and how many things of interest there are to do.. as well as the great storyline that backs up the gameplay. 9/10. Highly recommend.			"

They fix it immediately+ Story is currently done on 80% + very nice crafting system+ This game maybe seems.. peacefull but in reality it isn't when you reach below 400m you can find something... Scary       In short version this game is kinda horror in disguiseAs far as i seen.. I don't have any - towards this game. Everything seems fine to me.			"

Do the math game needs alot more content by now, the game has been in the top sellers list for some time at 20$ a sell for the last 2 years no way they should still be at this phase.  At this point you basically gather blueprints build stuff then you are stuck with nothing else to do accept stair at your creations.			"

								Amazing game, easily worth more than the sticker price. A few glaring bugs, but mostly cosmetic. Nothing game-breaking so far.The graphics are jaw-droppingly gorgeous. The biomes and sealife that abound are beautiful, colorful, and varied. The planet really feels like a living, breathing world, and contains plenty of surprises as you progress into more dangerous areas. I like that the game includes some flavor text for the flora and fauna, which adds some fun to exploration beyond just chasing the next upgrade.The controls are great. I like that base-building is a bit easier compared to most survival games - in others it tends to feel like a chore to me. Advanced upgrades are expensive, but the basic elements like rooms and corridors are cheap, so you don't have to spend hours finding resources just to customize your base.The game is more about exploration than survival, as your advanced technology and the abundant sealife make it easy to subsist indefinitely in the starting area. The real challenge comes from venturing outward. Exploring wreckage, caverns, new biomes, where large predators and dangerous depths are a constant threat.My one major criticism about the game is acquiring new technology, which has to be done by exploring the scattered wreckage from your ship and scanning various items to get more advanced blueprints. In principle I think this mechanic is fine, but a lot of the fragments are rare, only found in a few select locations. I resorted to looking online, which took a lot of the fun out of it, but it was better than searching aimlessly for hours.			"

								When you buy this game, you have to be aware that it is still Early Access. It's not completed. It's still rather buggy. However, to be part of this game as it is being built, to give suggestions and feedback that could have real implications on the final game, is an experience like no other.Pros:- The absolute creativity that went into everything in this game. The different biomes that were constructed, the animals, the utterly unique feeling to every inch of the planet the developers created. It's amazing.- The ability to build whatever you want, wherever you want. Within reason. You want a simple base at or above sea level? No problem! Want a massive, sprawling mansion over 1000M below sea level? Sure thing, just make sure you know how to power it.- One of my absolute favorite things, though others might not agree, is that there are actual consequences to not thinking ahead. Decide to build a bioreactor to power your base in the kelp forest? Then you cut down that kelp forest to fuel it, only to realize later that there's no forest anymore? Then you realize you should have grown your own, instead of cutting down every last creepvine in a 1km radius.Cons:- Stuttering. My computer is above the recommended specs, but I still get a lot of macro and micro stuttering on the medium graphic setting. The High setting is virtually unplayable for me. If you don't care about how the game looks, then play on minimum.- Some predators are overly aggressive. Admittedly, this is likely on purpose as large predators will often attack anything that enters their territory - familiar or not. But I can't tell you how many times I've had my little Sea Moth sub pushed below pressure limits and nearly destroyed while I was exploring a wreck, just because some predators kept attacking it while I wasn't there.- Perhaps the worst downside for me, personally, is that the world is too small. There is a ton of variety, the world is built up and down as well as side to side. But once you get familiar with every corner (which does, admittedly, take a very long time) it just feels so dang /small/. Once you start building the larger vehicles, and getting some speed on your side, it takes no time at all to get form point A to point B. Even if doubling the size of the landscape pushed back the official release date by a year, I'd prefer that.Regardless of whatever cons I've seen and experienced in my game, it won't be the same for everyone. Do I heartily recommend this game to anyone who likes exploring and discovering new things? Yes. Would I recommend this game to someone who doesn't like survival games? Yes, because you don't have to do the survival mode. This is perhaps a game I've had the most fun with since Fallout 4, and before that Skyrim. I love Bethesda games for their freedom, and their explorability. Subnautica hits both of those points right on the nose.			"

								This game is fantastic. It is not advertised as such but it does become a bit of a survival horror game, but I am completely okay with that. Deep sea exploration can be genuinely scary and this is done on a hidden, lonely, alien world, with only dangerous sea creatures and the wreckage of your ship to keep you company.A positive addition to this game which would make it perfect would be co-op support and balance. Subnautica would be so much better if you could play it with at least 1 co-op partner. Perhaps this is in development already but I am not sure, i'm too busy looking for Moon Pools to care. :UThe one game mechanic that I have any gripes about, which are all minor, is the objectives system. You get an objective by answering the radio for incoming distress calls, which will give you coordinates to the escape pod sending them. The problem is that these distress signals are equippable, and you can have 2 radio items equipped, one of which can be your compass. When you're done with the objective, you can unequip the distress signal coordinates and then put them in storage or discard them. This system could be significantly improved if you can just equip and unequip distress signals within its own interface, or within a new tab in your PDA. The system can then be improved by adding information on the signals themselves, such as the date you acquired them, and what research you found nearby, or what PDA's you found nearby.There is also a known Framerate problem in this game which you can correct by deleting a specific file from your Subnautica folder [There are steam community discussions and forum posts about this]. No one besides the dev knows this files purpose, but deleting it corrects a lot of the critical drops in framerates which occur at total random and have no other known solutions or causes, and deleting this file doesn't seem to cause any real big problematic side effects.

I love customising my base and seamoth. The creatures are unique and beautiful. It's also exciting everytime the developers release a new update knowing im going to have a blast doing the things they implemented. Keep up the amazing work!

								I must say I have really liked the game. The freedom is enjoyable, the horror elements and lack of guns is a refreshing change of pace. I will admit there's a number of issues with the game at the moment including textures that look out of place, many frame rate drops, and crashes (save often, just a forewarning to those who have not played the game yet). However I cannot be too hard on Subnautica because the game is not complete and the developers have not yet given the game the optimizations and overall polish that is seen with many triple A titles, similar to how one would not be so much worried about cleaning up a pile of building materials while it's in use for building a house.

								This is an early access review. After buying so many early access games..I've learned my lesson. Just don't do it. Then there's games like Subnautica. DO IT.There is a very clear line of progression in the developer's work. They communicate to the comsumer. Love it. Keep doing that. 10/10 just for that. Gameplay-wise:This game actually manages to ♥♥♥♥ing terrify me. I don't even have VR, but I don't dare do it because I might just♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants. No horror game even gets me to flinch. This game makes me scream at times. Omg that music. So good. The framerate issues will hopefully, get fixed. Early access, ya know.The tech trees and the ability to build bases etc...really satisfying.No multiplayer? I'll admit, I'd love it, but it honeslty doesn't need it. It's still a 10/10 game without it. No female model? Eh, I'd like the option, but then again I'm not the one who designed the game, nor did they force me to buy the game. Hell, it's not even like I had a hand in writing the story, so I'm really not entitled to changing THEIR artistic vision, ya dig?Great Game. 11/10			"

								To me, this game is more terrifying than ANY horror game, on account of my fear of deep water.Still, there is a quality to it, that awakens the instinct of wanting to know more, so despite the fact that i sit at the edge of my seat when i play, i continue to build my base, and prepare supplies for yet another dive into the deep dark below.The sounds, and at times limited access to light, make me feel as something will pop out at me at any moment! (which it sometimes does)ALOT of things that could be improved, but those are small matters compared to how good this game is even in Early-Access.Im looking forward to future updates.			"

Also, the dev's share their project management tracker openly on Trello so you can see exactly what will be in the next update and what the team is working on.Pros: solid gameplay, good graphical style, constant work by devs, just a hell of a lot of fun.Cons: occasional bugs, some biomes unfinished (but should be dropping in the next update), minor balancing issues (I've never found the moonpod blueprint until I've progressed far beyond the logical stage for it)Buy it as is to get a polished game and support devs who openly share progress and ideas.

As you adventure, build your base, you feel pretty proud. You've even got a few cool vehicles!Then, you travel further underground.First, you reach a dark, lifeless canyon, filled with dead Creepvines.Second, you travel even further, reaching a beautiful, awesome, nice ecosystem again! Albeit it's filled with bones, but, it's still kind of creepy.Third, there's a deep dropoff. You land in a hellish wasteland, filled with lava.You hear a roar.You turn around.You see a massive creature, at first, a silhouette.Then, it's getting closer.It's too close.It's over.BUY NOW!			"

Things I like - visually stunning, progressive difficulty, discovery.Things I didn't like - learn as you go, no map or direction finding (except pod point beacon), twitchy fish and short range scanner make scanning a chore. Things I would change or add - character customization (including sounds) for gender, color, etc.; a way to seek rare materials (like a long-range scanner), and a quest list of things to do (remind me to find magnesium for my welder).

Early Access Review
Early access review of the March 15 2015 build (post-sea bases, pre-crash site).In BriefSomewhere between Planet Explorers, Endless Ocean and Stranded Deep, Subnautica is the alien world exploration game you dreamed about as a kid.Most valuable resource: the slick, gorgeous aqua-sci-fi graphics.Of interest to: people who want their survival games to be more about exploration than hostiles, and who fantasise about alien planets.The premise of Subnautica is that you are the lone survivor of a crashed terraforming vessel on a water world and now have to use the meagre technology on your life pod, salvage from the downed Aurora, and whatever natural resources you can scavenge from the sea floor of this planet to survive and, potentially, begin the terraforming process.  Exciting stuff, yeah?So how much of this is in place at this stage?  Enough to give you a good few days' entertainment.  You can craft the basic gear you need, construct a basic submersible and, with patience, a submarine, or build an aquatic base.  You can explore the shallows where you start easily enough with just a single diving tank, but the other equipment, and the vehicles, become a must for deeper or wider wandering.The crafting process is simple at this stage, with only a few raw materials and very little required to make most things in a one- or two-step process of refinement and construction.  Resource gathering is basically swimming around and exploring your immediate environment, which is fun in itself and the real point of the game, so the process is satisfying.  The process for building underwater is handled very smoothly.There are only a few species of marine life at this stage.  A couple are hostile, but they have different behaviours when aggressive which keeps things interesting.  The rest are food, and swimming around catching them is enjoyable.  Some fish are solitary, some swim in schools, and their AI makes them seem quite plausible and unique, which is great for immersion.  When this game has whole ecosystems it will be incredible.  There is some slight evolutionary similarity between some of the fauna and flora - not to the same level as Planet Explorers but some - which is encouraging, although some fish are quite cartoony, so I hope they go for more realistic species design in the future.The biomes are interesting, especially the deep places like the volcanic vents and the jellyfish mushroom cave thing.  You definitely want to head SW at some point to check out the island supported on the back of the giant floaters - although currently it is a purely aesthetic place, when you've spent hours floating around in the water it feels so damn good to be walking around on land, surrounded by trees, however briefly.  My only complaint is that most biomes outside the shallow sea starting area severely lack resources, meaning they are pretty to visit but ultimately there is no reason to take up residence there.  This is almost certainly an early access thing.In fact the game sort of peters out once you have a sub, have gone for a quick circle of the biomes, built your basic sea base and have got a handle on food and water (which is really not an onerous task).  The content there is right now is great fun, but once it's done, there's kinda no point continuing.  New content is frequent enough to have you coming back every month or so to check it out, but it's still quite early days in terms of the play to be had in this game.The graphics have to be mentioned.  Although some (such as the Seamoth interior displays) are a little placeholdery, the graphics in this game are very polished.  The Aurora herself is the most stunning, but even the water textures when you're swimming are really on-the-money, and the appearance of sea base tubes and submersibles is very aqua-future.  The whole thing is very slick.  I especially like that you have a shadow and feet, and that when you swim backwards you can see your feet sticking out in front of you just as you would when swimming.  It's a little thing, but it's a little thing most survival games, especially those in early access, skip - the floating object shadows in Stranded Deep are really off-putting.The always-important question for all early access games is: how's the development?  These guys are up there with 7 Days as a model for early access development.  They have a public progress tracker showing what features are being worked on; they communicate frequently through the varioous channels they have; updates to the game are as frequent as can be expected, and major features seem to be pretty stable on release.  The game overall runs surprisingly well for one with constant physics objects and very pretty graphics, rarely experiencing frame rate issues on the recommended settings.  It does crash with no warning every so often, so save early and save often, but it's not so frequent an issue (for me, anyway) that it presents an annoyance.If you feel the price tag of $20 is a bit steep for the amount of game you get here right now, hold off until more of the core features are in place.  If you know you're going to be buying this eventually anyway, dive in now (ha!) and explore an alien ocean.  If development continues at this rate, by the end of this year there should be a very solid survival-exploration game to be had here.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is fantastic. It is not advertised as such but it does become a bit of a survival horror game, but I am completely okay with that. Deep sea exploration can be genuinely scary and this is done on a hidden, lonely, alien world, with only dangerous sea creatures and the wreckage of your ship to keep you company.A positive addition to this game which would make it perfect would be co-op support and balance. Subnautica would be so much better if you could play it with at least 1 co-op partner. Perhaps this is in development already but I am not sure, i'm too busy looking for Moon Pools to care. :UThe one game mechanic that I have any gripes about, which are all minor, is the objectives system. You get an objective by answering the radio for incoming distress calls, which will give you coordinates to the escape pod sending them. The problem is that these distress signals are equippable, and you can have 2 radio items equipped, one of which can be your compass. When you're done with the objective, you can unequip the distress signal coordinates and then put them in storage or discard them. This system could be significantly improved if you can just equip and unequip distress signals within its own interface, or within a new tab in your PDA. The system can then be improved by adding information on the signals themselves, such as the date you acquired them, and what research you found nearby, or what PDA's you found nearby.There is also a known Framerate problem in this game which you can correct by deleting a specific file from your Subnautica folder [There are steam community discussions and forum posts about this]. No one besides the dev knows this files purpose, but deleting it corrects a lot of the critical drops in framerates which occur at total random and have no other known solutions or causes, and deleting this file doesn't seem to cause any real big problematic side effects.

								This is an early access review. After buying so many early access games..I've learned my lesson. Just don't do it. Then there's games like Subnautica. DO IT.There is a very clear line of progression in the developer's work. They communicate to the comsumer. Love it. Keep doing that. 10/10 just for that. Gameplay-wise:This game actually manages to ♥♥♥♥ing terrify me. I don't even have VR, but I don't dare do it because I might just♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants. No horror game even gets me to flinch. This game makes me scream at times. Omg that music. So good. The framerate issues will hopefully, get fixed. Early access, ya know.The tech trees and the ability to build bases etc...really satisfying.No multiplayer? I'll admit, I'd love it, but it honeslty doesn't need it. It's still a 10/10 game without it. No female model? Eh, I'd like the option, but then again I'm not the one who designed the game, nor did they force me to buy the game. Hell, it's not even like I had a hand in writing the story, so I'm really not entitled to changing THEIR artistic vision, ya dig?Great Game. 11/10			"

								I'll start this review off by saying that I'm incredibly afraid of the deep and open ocean. Playing this game makes me feel unsafe, and afraid, but it's a beautiful game with much potential, and plenty of good things going for it. Since it's being updated, there's plenty of stuff to look forward to, and lots of content already in the game. The biggest aspect going for the game is definitely its exploration. There's plenty to see in the oceans of the planet the huge ship, the Aurora, has crash landed on, and many terrifying creatures living there. Currently, the game is still very early in development, but it's still one of the better early access games I've played.			"

At night, this game feels like Avatar - it is simply beautiful. I have found myself more than happy to just swim around as the detail is excellent. This may be an early access game, but it already was exactly what I was looking for......no game is as fun, when looking for the items needed to build....I actually save the game for my later evenings and simply chill.Anyone who enjoys real world underwater antics, will find everything you need right here.

								I must say I have really liked the game. The freedom is enjoyable, the horror elements and lack of guns is a refreshing change of pace. I will admit there's a number of issues with the game at the moment including textures that look out of place, many frame rate drops, and crashes (save often, just a forewarning to those who have not played the game yet). However I cannot be too hard on Subnautica because the game is not complete and the developers have not yet given the game the optimizations and overall polish that is seen with many triple A titles, similar to how one would not be so much worried about cleaning up a pile of building materials while it's in use for building a house.

								So, First review of anything and all...I am not a methodical grinder, or a pro at 'inventory management games, as this has been smugly referred to in a few reviews, so I spend a lot of time just trying to figure out things like how harvest creeper vines and collect stuff needed and keep alive, etc.And - I LOVE this game.The world is procedurally generated - a new one every start - and I've restarted five or six times (last time because I built myself into a corner with a needlessly elaborate base) just to see what different surroundings will be generated.  the environment is (literally) immersive, the different creatures have very different species personality, and learning those, and trying to figure out even how to survive freaking stalkers and go around those damn' gasopods has filled hours for me.  From the community page and even the trailer I know there is a huge gameworld out there for me, once I figure out how to get there, and I'm looking forward to figuring it all out in, say, the next six hundred playing hours orso...10/10  out of 10/10			"

								Subnautica is one of my all-time favorite games. Ever since I was young I've loved marine biology. I can tell you the state fish of Hawaii in their native tongue (humu-humu-nuku-nuku-apuah) and got my PADI and SSI scuba licenses before I could drive a car. I know, and expect, quite a bit when it comes to anything fish and ocean related and subnautica takes the cake for me. I don't quiet know what it is about Subnautica that makes me feel the way I do, it just does such a good job of replicating the emotions I feel when I dive myself. Of course, you're on an alien planet with alien creatures, but it still feels so... real in a way. You are awestruck by the great blue expanses, curious to explore every expertly crafted cavern and crevace, fearful of the unknown, yet driven enough to search anyway. You can swim alongside goliaths or scoot your sub along the reefs before delving into the dark and mysterious depths. These are the emotions you SHOULD feel when you're exploring an Ocean, and Subnautica does an amazing job of making the player feel immersed in their game.Of course, in order to convey these emotions, the game has to look good. The game features a large variety of bioluminessent and colourful life, not something you'd find in any ocean on earth, but necesary to keep the game looking and feeling alien, especially at night and in the darker depths. Every biome has been crafted to feel unique and every species in them has a purpose. If you find large schools of low-on-the-food-chain fish, you can expect that a preditor of that species is going to be nearby. The only problem with the game's graphics that exists thusfar is that the rendering can get a little messy in louder more clustered parts of the ocean, resulting in large formations popping into view, but this seems to be improving with everypatch.I can't say enough good things about subnatuica. To try and describe what it FEELS like to play this game would be impossible, it's something you have to try for yourself to truely understand, and if you get the chance to buy this game, I would absolutly jump on it. Especially if you are looking for a fun, exploration-driven survival game.			"

Today I went back and gave it another shot, starting with a 500x200 resolution. The quality was terrible, but I ignored that, knowing it would happen.Within minutes I was hooked, what felt like a couple of minutes turned out to be an hour, and wow. I'm in shock!

								I've been playing this game in short bursts (because I suffer from thalassaphobia, an intense and persistent fear of the sea or similarly deep bodies of water) for a total of 14 hours. The devs are constantly releasing updates, and they're not just minor bugfixes, they actually add a lot of new stuff the game everytime. This game is terrifying and beautiful. If you like exploration, then this game is definitely worth a shot. Just remember to keep your ears open when you go near the crashed ship. You'll find out why. Night time is absolutely stunning in the game because just about everything is bioluminescant. The game isn't procedurally generated, which means each corner of this alien world is unique, beautiful, and painstakingly handcrafted. If you're looking for something to help you get over your fear of the ocean, this game won't help. It will just scare you and make you feel like a big blubbering baby, but it's a humbling experience to say the least. If you love your inner explorer, definitely try this amazing gem.			"

The graphics are simple but are also very detailed (e.g. the metal in rooms, hallways etc. is mainly just white, but it is high quality and reflective which is cool). The scenery takes a whole new level of awesome when night comes though. Everything lights up and all you can see in the dark is glowing corals and eyes. When I first heard a Reefback, I was both terrified but also in awe because it sounds quite real. Overall, this game can be a bit tedious at times, but the exploration is never bland. This game also has tons of potential since it is still in early access but the developers have tons of ideas for what to add.			"

								Fun game with a lot of intriguing bits to it. The game tends to be pretty butt clenching at times and offers a different means of horror rather than something popping on the screen doing jump scares every 5 seconds. Incredibly immersive with the ambient sounds and luminescent flora and fauna. If this game had just a little more things to do and things to explore, build, and research it would go a long way. Excited to see what the continuation of their development of this game brings.			"

								This game is the foundation for a masterpiece. I'm not sure if I've ever enjoyed any other game this much. While being strictly science fiction, it still manages to hold some attributes that are analogous to some things in the real world. Creatures, like a stalker for example, are said to have developed streamlined bodies to be able to move fast and chase down prey. That is something you would expect from a moderate size sea dwelling predator living in our ocean. Of course some creatures are a fantasy by our standards, but they try their best to at least look alrightThe playability is pretty in depth, as opposed to the simplistic look you would see from the surface, pun intended. You can alter the way you explore the ocean you're in instead of just wandering around the same way every time. It's all about a balance of speed, thoroughness, and safety. Managing resources? Maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but I personally like it. I feel like it gives me more excuses to look around while going to any given destinationHowever there are some concerns. The game is still early in development so this is likely to change in the future, but as of when this is being typed, the way the game data is packaged is inefficient. As you play the game, collecting resources and everything, the game starts to lose stability until becoming unplayable. This is a major issue for those who invest lots of effort into a single save. On top of that, some of the features that have been in the game for some time aren't working as intended. The most notable is the torpedo arm for the Prawn suit. Very rarely will it actually fire a torpedo instead of consuming the torpedo but not actually firing it. Other things I could rant about here would just be little nitpicks thoughThe best part about Subnautica for me personally is the horror game aspect of it. It doesn't try to be a horror game at all, yet it's genuinely one of, if not the scariest game I've ever played. It achieves this by playing on our natural survival instincts, and using the ambience itself to set a creepy atmosphere. Everything you could classify as a typical jumpscare is us just overreacting to something harmless. But that isn't horror. It's cheap humor. This is where Subnautica really gets it right. It doesn't do anything cheap. There's nothing down there actively waiting to scare you. It's all driven by our fear of the unknown, and fear for our survival. You either have to build a means of transport to go down, or man up a lot. Either way, horror games need to look to Subnautica for inspiration. They don't seem like they're a strong genre anymore			"

								Since I know most don't like long paragraphs to read or vast amounts of info, I will keep the style of this review in short bullet point like chunks.PROS:Large Open World - Game is vast, enjoyable, gorgeous and very addicting. From the moment you begin on your very first time playing it, you starting wondering ""Wow! What else can I do?"" so you keep exploring.Chllenging level of play -  When on survival, it isn't easy to manage your hunger and thirst to begin with. You soon learn what's best to eat and the easiest way to get water. As you progress, it is made easier with discovories.Gorgeous Soundtrack - The game has music that is just beautiful. Going from one section where it's shallow reefs and you hear a catchy, bouncy tune that you nod you head along to, to finding the blood kelp forest where a gorgeous, soothing quire track kicks in and you just think ""Oh my god, it's so beautiful!"" ;w;Clever A.I. - I won't sing to the high heavens about the A.I in the game as it isn't on par with some games out there, but it is damn impressive for what is there. All the creatures have their preferred habitat and ways of interacting with the world and you as the player. Some are hostile, some are peaceful. And some are terrifyingly clever like the Warper who creates portals and can use them to bring larger, nasty creatures into the area to attack you! D:Suspenseful Atmosphere - The game is not exactly the comfort playing kind of game it may seem on the surface, (pardon the pun. XD) All of the screenshots show truth (unlike No Man's Lie, :P), but they're not going to be found with ease. You will have to travel through vast, open oceans, which could hold anything in them. And when there's nothing but darkness around you and  you hear a deep, booming roar from something, you will need to change your underwear. :3Deep Lore - While the game isn't even complete, it already has quite an exansive lore. The use of the in game scanner to study the flora and fauna and finding data terminals and PDA pads to find out more information which all gets added into the in game encyclopedia blows my mind and I can't imagine what it's going to be like when the game IS finished.Fascinating Creatures - A few of the creatures are amusing and not exactly impressive, like the Garry fish named so after a particular SpongeBob Squarepants character who's appearance it's based upon. :P But then you get to some other creatures, like the beautful Reef Backs, that are like giant, living islands, basically the games whales. And then you have Ampeels, giant, electric eel like creatures, Sand Sharks... their name gives it away. And yes, they ACTUALLY swim through sand with their dorsal fin sticking up and out of it. And then... You have the Laviathans... For those of you who may not know the word Laviathan, I'll put it this way... It means big. And in this game, that's unfriendly. O_OImpressive Base Building - I know there are many ghames out there already that give base building, all of which offer their own style from Minecraft to Fallout 4. Some have said this game, Subnautica, is Minecraft underwater. Do NOT listen to them. This game overshadows Minecraft since it's actually not just some cash cow of a game. (No offence to Minecraft, it started off an amazing game, but has become a cashcow.) The base construction is clever and unique, and having to find other parts of the base to scan before you build it gives you a reason to explore the world. The way vehicles can interact with the base is also amazing!Clever Vehicles - From the basic Seaglide that carries you along at a smooth, basic pace to the Seamoth, a small, mini submarine like vehicle that can get you further, and then the cylops. A massive submarine that is just the bomb! The fact you can customize these vehicles with colors and names is also amazing! Oh, and you also get a P.R.A.W.N Suit. Which is basically an underwater mech suit which you can customize as well, including equipping different types of arms. Need I say more? I named mine Iron Man and made it red and gold. ^W^Different Play Modes - For those of you who may not be into the survival part of it and just wish to explore the world without having to worry about food, water, dying and having to find materials to build with, you can play in a creative mode that lets you have free will with no limits while also disabling the story.CONS:Bugs - This is really the only con that there is in the game. The game is BUGGED. And I don't mean lightly. Every update the devs improve and I give a round of applause to them since they do an amazing job. For the game it is, Subnautica can't be easy to maintain with an indie team, but bugs are there. Some are minor, like shoals of fish swimming through your base walls and your custom PRAWN suit color changing your entire characters skin to it as well, to a large one where after several hours of gameplay the game will start CTD'ing. (Crashing To Desktop) Some players have discovered a temporary fix to this issue so it's no longer a game breaking bug, but I am more than sure that the devs are aware of all issues and working to fix them.Other things to note are that not everything is polished yet. Some placeholders are missing, animations could do with some work, etc. All things that the developers are more than likely working on.The only thing to say is just be prepared. This is a warning the game is buggy and not complete, but not unplayable. The devs also are working on the end game content as well, so there's that to look forward to.Overal, would I suggest you buy this game? Hell yes! If you're into survival, open world exploring and discovering stuff and buidling stuff, this is the game for you! And if it's on sale then, oh god, YES you should buy it! But I'd say get it at full price to help the devs as much as you can.This game is AWESOME! It's scary as all balls, but awesome! 9.0/10. (Would be 10/10 for me if it wasn't as buggy, optimized and polished.)			"

								Buy it, just buy it.This game takes a great twist on your average survival crafting game. It's truly unique, and I don't mean to sound like a comercial. The game is beautiful and the story and gameplay is rich.The devs do some amazing work can I just say. I love the devs who don't put time limits on them and just release amazing high quantity and quality updates. That's what you get, in due time.The graphics are quite stunning, but you'll need a good GPU/CPU to run it on high. That being said, the setting and atmosphere is still amazing with graphics on low.This ain't your average survival game. Some say it's survival underwater, but you can build a base on land and such. Some say it's about scary monsters in the depth, but they're cute fish everywhere. Some say it's about exploring the Arora, but there are so many other components to the story. There's a lot of things you can do, and they're still working on this game.I might even call this a horror game if you count the absolutely terrifying giant 'fish' of the deep depths.9.5/10, would ram a Seamoth into a Leviathen again.

								Absolutely incredible game. Pros:- Insane Atmosphere- Fun base building- Just when you feel safe you're still not ;)- Story so far seems kinda cool- Many spooky creatures for you to find out aboutCons:- Seems to crash quite abit- Has some minor bugs such as being able to forcefully clip through walls if you position your seamoth correctly (Current Patch)- Kinda sucky how after every update you have to make a new save to gain access - Game isn't really friendly to noobs as you may have to look up what to do etcetera.- Eats your memory like a b*tch and has lag spikes when loading areas. Sucks :LMany more hours will be put into this game as I absolutely adore it. Can't wait for full release and maybe, possibly, hopefully there will be multiplayer/co-op (That would make this game 100% better)			"

								One of the BEST RIFT EXPERIENCES CURRENTLY AVAILBLE.  If you own a Rift, you have to get this game.  Think Discovering Space but Underwater and with a heck of a lot more content, even at this stage.  If you are like me and have an Oculus that you want to get the most out of, you have probably searched for ""VR"" or used the steam ""VR Support"" tag to find games.  That's how I found this.  This was the most immersive experience I had to date.  Use the F2 key, lean forward in the rift, hit F2 and then lean back ...in the Seamoth that you can build or cheat code (hit enter, type ""item seamoth"" then hit enter again.) ...it has an obvious interface.    There I was, about 1.5 miles down.  It is dark and I am hearing some strange roaring sound.  I am looking behind me (literally, remember I'm in the Oculus Rift so I physically turn around to see anything...nope, it's just my little Submersible.  What was that noise?  Deeper I go still... You know how you can tell a game is fun?  When there was literally nothing at the bottom to find and I STILL had fun looking for it.  The ambience is top notch for an early alpha.  The developers are obviously working at the surface and building their way down.  But these guys made Natural Selection 2, which I also own, and I know they have what it takes to see this through.  FYI I am running this on a 2013 Sager dual GPU laptop.  Runs great on Recommended settings.  You CAN get this to work on Extend mode (Direct always crashes for me)...check the community guide on Oculus, I put some comments there on how to get it to work.  Right now it is very early.  And I have played and have had lots of fun in early games, even the ones that didn't amount to anything.  (like Starforge, such a shame really)...  But I can tell this game is going to get finished.  The parts that are in are, to me, VERY polished.  This is one of those developers that makes takes time to make high quality items.  Note As of date of this review, I still highly recommend, but you cannot craft in the game when using Oculus.  (literally, even if you turn off rift and see the double vision on your monitor, it is an interface problem, you cannot actually click on the crafting menu).  Devs are on it I'm told.  Disregard playing time, it's a lot more.... "

								Recommendation: BUY IT. I was on the fence of whether to buy it or not but then i saw somebody play it on youtube and decided to give it a shot. Here is what i have come to experience: It's a really addicting game. Survival games are usually quite similar these days and therefore not so captivating anymore. But Subnautica and the underwatersetting has really something to it (apart from the primal fear of deep dark open water). I have powered through the existing gameplay possibilities and can't wait for more updates to come. Apart from some small little bugs it is a great early acces game and already has hours over hours of gameplay (a lot of it consisting of recource and fragment hunts - but the biomes make it worth every minute spent in them).

								Subnautica is basically everything I've dreamed of with regards to an underwater-exploration-adventure+scifi game.  In other words, it's amazing!  The content already employed is very impressive and enjoyable.  The mechanics of the game also work very well which is something that I more than appreciate -- everything from crafting to maneuvering.  And, while this may seem like a small and unrelated thing, it is still something to note that is indicative of good developers.  The fact that you can report bugs and give feedback through a simple push of a button in-game is a very positive thing, for everyone involved!  Makes it much easier for the player to report things and makes it easier for the developer to find out about things.  Back to the game...seriously, it's extremely fun.  If you've ever wanted to explore a vast underwater ecosystem full of both wonder and horror, this should be next on your list.			"

								Beautiful game with light survival elements. Crafting new items consists of fetching the materials and using a device to create that item in a menu which is simple to use and very cleanly done, however if you want to make something in large quantities you are going to make several trips to gather materials to accomplish this. There's a lot of fun to be had with this game however and even though its still in development and new content is planned I feel that I have already gotten my moneys worth out of this game. This is how a beta should be handled as this game is very stable and all of the mechanics that are in the game work almost 100% (some minor bugs).

								As a person who never sets foot in the ocean ever due to fear of open water and the ocean in general, it seems quite a surprise even to me that I find this game so accessible. Don't get me wrong I am fascinated and love the allure and beauty of the underwater world but in reality I am happy to appreciate it from a very far distance. I have a dread for sharks and it is the reason I cannot play any similar water based games. However, as I mentioned this game's design and approach is genius with its method of introducing you to its world through the amazing aesthetic of the initial shallows without any threat whatsoever in the beginning parts of the game. The genius part for me are the more threatening aspects of the games where the approach is one where the creatures are designed in a more abstract style rather than mimicking real world forms so much, and this I feel helps, me at least, tolerate it with my inherent fear of real world ocean threats. That all being said, I love this game. Everything about it is rich in quality, and design mastery, all balanced so well with the game play mechanics, at least so far what is available. I have only played a few hours and still have quite a bit to do before I can get the Cyclops and explore the real depths of this world. I am looking forward to the progress of this game as it can only get better. But so far there is enough in the game for me to just enjoy swimming in this amazing ocean of beauty, I can’t get enough of it. It is probably the closest I will ever get to the real thing and I am grateful to the developers for that. Well done Unknown Worlds!			"

After they have added what they want then they will add multiplayer. Pros: great community, active development, great developing story(WIP), and really great creature interaction along with visuals. Cons: a little bit of lag on lower end of PC's. As you can see they're are more pros than cons. You won't regret getting this game.			"

								This game isn't perfect- but d@mned close. Right from the start, it shows that it's considerate of it's players, by giving you fully customizable controls, not the hardwired nonsense some game devs seem to always sneak in. And it lets you choose between a variety of difficulties, based on playstyle. Survival mode isn't brutal, but it's definitely challenging. Creative mode gives you fantastic resources to begin with and lets you explore both the game world, and the game's mechanics, so it's a great way to get the knack of the controls and systems. The world offers up beauty, whimsy, and the gut-wrenching primal fear you only get from swimming over what seems a bottomless abyss. I can't wait to see this game when it's fully polished.			"

								This game speaks to my deeply rooted phobia of deep water environments.  I HATE deep water.  I'm not afraid of the water itself, but of WHAT is lurking beneath, above, and behind me in the water.  Too many close encounters with marine life in my real life experiences I suppose.  That said, this game had me terror stricken from the beginning, and my heart never ceases to want to explode from my chest as I play this game.  It scares the crap out of me!  So in a nutshell, I absolutely love this freekin game!  It's one of the best survival/horror games I have ever played.  If you think it's boring, then try diving down 100+ meters in murky low visibility water with just an air bag to get you back to the surface, before something big and hungry grabs your backside for a quick snack.  I scare myself just thinking about it (phobia kicking in).			"

								It's been a long time since I was genuinely surprised and awed by a game, and Subnautica does just that. It's full of creepy surprises in its vast and beautiful ocean, like large eels jumping out of glowing jelly mushrooms to grab you with their pincers. There have been many times where I just sat back and stared in amazement, like when I built the Cyclops submarine, which is absolutly massive, or encountered some of the huge underwater wildlife. Even some moments inspire a little bit of panic, such as when you're franticly fleeing the massive Reaper that lurks deep underwater near your wrecked ship.Overall, this is totally worth the twenty dollar price tag, and the best part this is still early access, so there will be much more!

								Subnautica is easily one of the best games (propably best one) that i have ever played and it is still in developement so new stuff is getting added constantly. Ambiance of the game is amzingly creepy and there is a lot to explore aside of the Interesting story. Im also very fine with Subnautica not having multiplayer as the creepy ambiance comes partly from the Being alone- feeling.Great experience with a really good value!			"

								I don't like going to the beach anymore, thanks subnautica devs. Now I'm petrified of open waters. On a serious note Subnautica is a gem but do yourself a favour and not look up things on the wiki as it will ruin the exploration aspect of the game. The game is crazy immersive, I'll be cruising in my sub and I'll hear a noise and I'll think to myself ""What the ♥♥♥♥ was that?"".  The game isn't amazing in terms of graphics but they are pretty damn good. There are some small issues that I have noticed with mobs clipping through stuff likes walls and subs but this is an  early access game. Overall I recommend Subnautica I feel as though the devs are undercharging for this little guy.			"

								I was amazed by this game. It had a lot of things i didn't expected when i bought it, such has: - Amazing graphics and well optimized (unlike games like ARK), since an average computer runs it. - Great concept. It is very similar to survival games like ARK, Minecraft,... and altough it doesn't have a tutorial you are able to get used to its mechanics and basics fast. - Lots of content. I feel like this is one of those games where you can get to 500+ hours of playing it and still not get bored. Unfortunatly i haven´t got time to play it often but from those 0.8 hours i've played i have to say that it's an amazing game and if you are in a budget and you want a survival game, this game sould be your priority (games like ARK,Minecraft,... can be a litlle bit expensive).

								I'd been looking for a good, immersive underwater game (tried others: FarSky, Depth Hunter 2, Depth), but nothing compares to the quality I found in Subnautica. It's truly hard to believe the game is in Early Access (with regular monthly updates).The science-fiction setting makes it all the more interesting to me, because it opens the doors for more freedom of creativity, with amazing-looking alien fauna and flora to discover while exploring the beautiful underwater landscape. The feeling of being underwater pervades throughout the game, with realistic sound effects and colorful visuals.The elements of exploration and survival are strong, with a taste of mystery, as you're trying to find out what happened to the crew of your crashed spaceship, with parts of the ship and lifepods spread out all over on the sea bed.Gameplay options allow you to choose the degree of survival difficulty, including a creative mode if you want to build stuff without having to worry about dying or unlocking technologies.Bottomline, I absolutely love this game, and I'm looking forward to it being finished.

Eventhough this game is an early access game, the developers are very dedicated, keeping this game updated almost constantly if you opt for experimental. They keep adding new elements, upgrading biomes, and right now I think they are working on the storyline and its elements. I cannot wait for this game to complete!Keep sending feedback because it helps this game grows! Shoutout for Subnautica!			"

Early Access Review
								- Went into a small wreckage next to the Aurora- Got a battery and purified water- Sea Leviathan eats my Seamoth- Slowly drowned10/10   But really though, Subnautica is a wonderful twist on the typical Open-World survival. Though, in it's early stages, there may be a few bugs (that Leviathan spawned right in front of me! It did!) which I'm sure will be sorted out (why did that Shocker just faceplant into the ground and dive into hell? Well, see ya) in the near future.Right now, the biome placement for the maps are all the same, which can become boring if you enjoy having many worlds. Landscape generation is different every time, though, so I haven't found it much of an issue in my experience. This will most likely, once again, change in the near future.   Other than those small notes, this game is a gem, even for alpha. The game has so much potential, and has so far been reaching it all. I am excited for future updates (and if you just take a peek on the wiki, there is a crazy amount of features in the development stages) and hold a lot of hope for this absolute treasure of a survival game.   In this stage of its life, Subnautica is definitely worth the purchase.			"

								So far one of the better early release games I have played. If you like exploring, crafting, surviving this game if probably for you.  The graphics for me are great and there is plenty to explore.   There is not a lot of action early on, other than dodging the occasional sea creature or making sure you have enough time to get back up for O2.  I am still early in the game, but I would spend the 20 bucks again just in what I have seen so far.  There is an issue where the game starts to lag and crashes, this happened to me after I build the small sub, but going to this page https://steamcommunity.com/app/264710/discussions/0/154644787622360894/  and deleting that one file worked great for me.

								If you dont want to read the post and are just looking for a rating, I rate this game 8/10 if you are interested in my review, keep reading.The game is an early access game for sure. Dont let that deture you though. I have enjoyed playing this game for hours but havnt gotten tired of it yet. Even in creative mode, (dont have to worry about health, air, food, water, temperature) I have spent the better part of 12 hours plaing it and still was finding new stuff. Also the game is very astetically pleasing. The underwater scense are very beautiful and creative. Not to mention the sounds.... Ahhh the sounds! So amazing. One second it is all serene and tranquil and the next you hear a loud roar off in the distant murkey depths and a feeling of dread and terror fills you as you realize you are not by any means at the top of the foodchain. The controls are easy to use and the base building system is simple. I would like to state that there are not many pieces you can build, But the current inventory for building is large enough that you can spend hours constructing a base and still have different ideas to try out. The crafting system in the game is for the most part simple. Some objects in the game are much more difficult to find. you will need to craft new items and equipment in order to reach a good share of the harder to find resources which keeps you busy looking for items such as titanium quartz copper and silver.All in all, i think when this game is finished and is actually released, it will be an outstanding underwater open world survival game. My rating is currently 8/10			"

								Subnautica is a game that is heavily centered towards exploration of this vast ocean planet as well as building customizable sea bases. Being in Early Access there is very little known storyline-wise so far but whats implemented into the game right now makes up for that tenfolds.First off, this is an extremely beautiful game graphic-wise. Many interesting biomes are there to be explored, full of luxuriant plantlife and explorable caverns. I never tire myself to go out and explore this alien world vibrant with diversed flora and fauna. Another thing that attracted me to subnautica is the cool crafting system as well as the Sea Bases building mechanic that allows you to customize your structures to your heart's content. You can also create your very own submarine that acts like a mobile base of commands, as well as a smaller, easier to manoeuver submersible called the Seamoth that makes the exploration a better experience.All that being said, this game is awesome and the dev team keep updating it (via the Experimental mode) once or twice a week with the major updates going live in the more stable game version about once a month. If you are the type of person that love underwater games as well as building and gathering ressources and explore very beautiful environments then Subnautica is definitely for you!			"

								First and foremost Subnautica is IN DEVELOPMENT - It isn't finished yet and much more will likely be on the way before it is.However, even though this is a single-player game, it can be quite challenging. The exploration factor is excellent and the biospheres are diverse. Survival mode and hardcore add to your troubles on this watery world. Add in exploding fish and big things with teeth and it's all very interesting.Subnautica is also one of the prettiest games I've seen for a long while and the technical design compliment the aesthetics wonderfully. Base building and other crafting elements are easy enough to grasp and the possibilities are extensive.It's well worth checking out some of the available videos online to see more. I do hope for some multiplayer eventually but for now, this whole ocean is mine to explore.			"

								This game is very polished even though its still in early access.There is quite a bit that still needs work, however this does not impeed playability as of the time I wirte this.The only things that I find an issue are the unballanced food and water needs, as well as the very unballanced enemy strength vs player / ship health.Almost every fish that is not cookable is agressive and there is no way to fight back other than a small dagger which breaks very quickly.   There is no point in fighting mobs as they have no loot or harvesting factors, nore can you even destroy there corpses.A crash powder fish will explode doing only a few percent of damage to the player, but yet it will totally make a seamoth at full health with 4 hull reinforcement modules into rubble, with no ability to salave.Other than the moth, the other vechiles have no health making them invincible, and I have had some fun taunting and pushing around what I would consider to be end game boss level mobs.On the side of crafting, its very well setup in terms of blueprint access, how ever, nothing stacks and the storage is very limitied, so sorting and managing your supplies is very cumbersome.The game is setup to know rooms or bases type of user housing, so it would be nice if all the containers in the same room / corridor as a crafting station would be counted in available mats.Or even a special room that is designed for crafting, so it would have the fabricators built in, with there own storage grid that has alot of space or stacking instead of big grids.My final point is that I am sure it is yet to come, but currently once you have found all the blueprints and built a base, there is nothing left to do other than just farm to make more bases or explore the sea on finding beautiful areas to sit and admire.

								Regardless of the fact this is an Early Access game, It deliveres a unique survival gameplay in a gorgeous underwater setting.Although I'm not a big fan of the sci-fi genre, I can definitely look past this fact because of the beautiful and interactive environment.If you are not too busy enjoying the view, there is a lot of searching for materials and building new equipment/upgrades/UNDERWATER BASE!Pro's:-Unique survival gameplay-Beautiful HUGE interactive environment (you can dig into the sand to make holes etc.)-Loads of fish/creatures-Cool upgrades/equipment-Awesome vehiclesCon's:-Missing a ""purpose"". There are/is no objectives/story whatsoever, all you know is that you woke up in an escape pod in the middle of an alien ocean next to a huge spaceship.-Would be a lot cooler if there was a co-op/multiplayer feature (discovering the depths with your friends)-Also it would be nice if there are some side-quests stuff to do, like taking pictures of every creature, collecting trophy's or an achievement system.-Some upgrades don't make any sense, if you want to upgrade your O2 you will get another airtank in your inventory. (not an upgrade, just an extra tank)Considering the fact this is an Early Access and loads of stuff will change, It's worth the $20 but there is definitely room for improvement.			"

								Maybe first review, ever. Not sure. Been a Steamer for 7 years or so.  This game is so potentially fascinating, I had to submit.I spent a lot of time reading up on it, figuring out crafting. Not a fan of the grind/craft/grind, but it was quite fun scavenging for parts, elements, scrap and other materials.Unlike some who modded them in, I worked for the Cyclops, the Seamoth, everything I have so far. Started building a base close to one of the magma vents. Hopefully devs keep adding territory. Maybe campaign mode where you find a way to 'finish' the game.Looks like there is an EXOSUIT coming!Cannot put this down. I'm not quite sure why. It must scratch that 'my own sub and an  underwater playground' itch when I was a kid.Hopefully the world will expand. After about 25 hours, I'm probably 2/3 through what I can do.Impressive, nonetheless.Considering buying Oculus dev kit, just to test drive. Scary deep underwater caves. Claustrophobia. confusion on how to get out. Creepy....			"

Swimming through caves and walking through the Aurora alway keep you on the edge of your seat. The amount of things you can do are incredible for an early access game and it runs pretty well. I got this on the OSX update because I have a MacBook and it runs perfectly fine on it. Unfortunately like every game it always has it's downsides. The graphics on the Aurora are not the best but keep in mind The Aurora is brand new. Some of the resources are hard to find when they should be a little easier, such as quartz. It seems like you need quartz to make ANYTHING but it tends to be very difficult to find.			"

								A great game with great concept and so much potential, all thats lacking would be a story (though it would be hard to interprate in a game like this) really addicting to those who enjoy survival games, and has an amzing horror feel when exploring the deep unknown. And for early release, their are little to no bugs, except for some minor details that i think only someone paying extreme attention would notice.			"

Great survival game with all the trade mark things to do, as in get water, get food, keep warm and build stuff - oh and swim away from that big farting fish!Great game highly recommend it if your into survival games.

								Beautiful, this game looks spectacular. While still in early development I would say this still is impressive with the scale and design of everything.  They just updated the lighting and water effects and it really shines....the dark is REALLY scary.  This is pretty much everything I have ever wanted from a game, with beatiful underwater landscapes(seascapes?) populated with a pretty diverse and unique flora/fauna.  I hope they keep going with the VR support and possibly add in multiplayer down the line.  But even if they don't I consider this a must buy while on sale and worth every penny spent. p.s. if you are looking for an underwater combat type game this is definitely not it....you are much more the explorer survivor as opposed to the conquerer type...ie the sea is out to kill you not the otherway around.

								The game is amazing!!!, I love how everything is ether going to kill you or going to.....kill you.....ANY WAYS!!!Subnautica is a great unwater survival game that puts the player in a whole new field to work with, the developers who are working hard to bring us better features and more options in the game are doing an amazing job, they even put in a bug report button in the game if that ain't smart then go screw your self. I am hoping to see more features and hopfully some dlc's i have money to spend but i wish they had some dlc that way i can get something epic and at the same time they can get more work done. any who putting all that aside this game rocks and im hoping to see the ideas of the Subnautica's residence bloom like the stupid bomb fish THAT CHASE ME!!! lol.

								Okay, I'm not the best at reviews and I usually dont say anything as others are more eloquent than myself. But, I feel that this game deserves as many positive reviews as possible, so here I go.This game had me hooked within the first 10 minutes.Subnautica enthralls me at every turn as I explore this aquatic world, searching for the necessary materials to keep me alive. The flora and fauna of the game feel unique from any other and all with their own flavor text, image and uses. The graphics for this game are stunning from the surface reefs to the hidden caverns and thermal vents to the deep sea bed and trenches. I recommend this game to anyone who likes survival, exploration or aquatic games of any type as all three will be satisfied with the content. I have huge hopes for this game and I can't wait for whats in store! "

								Subnautica  9/10-Overall 8/10Addictive. Ive been so hooked on this game, Ive done 17.6hours in a matter of 2-3 days of having the game.Its a crafting survival game but with so many creatures to catch, kill or run from, scenery to discover and oggle, toys to play with, and base building to do its truely fun to go looking for resources. I fairly sure most people that are into adventure will love the game.- Gameplay 8/10Controls are good. mechanics a good. crafting system is easy to follow.swim, ride, submerge, hack, collect, dig, construct, and die repeatedly from diving to deep to suface in time. so much to do.-Graphics Awesome. I wouldnt say realistic, but beautifuly done. Looks great.-PerformanceSave Save Save!Runs really well but on occation will crash out of game without warning.

								Absolutely amazing game here. Not flawless (beta), and not complete, but for $20 you really get what you pay for. Very different from other survial games, and while it's not suppoosed to be inherently scary, it can get very erie sometimes, especially with the kick♥♥♥♥♥3D sound design they have.I would really really suggest thaat you not pass this game over if you're looking for something that stands out from the rest of the sub-par/ okayish pile of survival games that have come out recently. If the Dev's keep on going the way they are, this will easily be one of the best games I've ever played. I'm eagerly awaiting the next update! I've done all there is to do so far :pscore 8/10 purely for bug's/ not finished. Again, obviously it's in beta still, so this is it's score for it's ""as-is"" condition.			"

								LET ME WARN YOU BY SAYING THIS GAME IS STILL IN VERY EARLY ACCESS!With that said, this game has an abundance of game mechanics already.  There are many things to craft and many resources to collect.  This game already has vehicles, base building and crafting.PROS - *Good and easy to learn crafting system*Tons of exploration and adventure to be had, at some moments your jaw will hit the floor*The theme and style of this game is awesome*Diverse crafting system and base building system*Natural incentives to keep going, like building submarines and upgrading your baseCONS -*Random crashes*MAJOR FPS drops when first loading a big saved world*Low resolution icons and UI*Some resources can be very hard to findConclusion -I would whole heartedly recommend this game, it has tons of cool places to explore and the atmosphere is incredible.  While there are some stability issues, hopefully that will change as the game keeps going in its development life cycle.  This game is relaxing, awe-inspiring and can be tense sometimes.8/10			"

								It's been a long time since I was genuinely surprised and awed by a game, and Subnautica does just that. It's full of creepy surprises in its vast and beautiful ocean, like large eels jumping out of glowing jelly mushrooms to grab you with their pincers. There have been many times where I just sat back and stared in amazement, like when I built the Cyclops submarine, which is absolutly massive, or encountered some of the huge underwater wildlife. Even some moments inspire a little bit of panic, such as when you're franticly fleeing the massive Reaper that lurks deep underwater near your wrecked ship.Overall, this is totally worth the twenty dollar price tag, and the best part this is still early access, so there will be much more!

They encourage you to report bugs, which so far for myself are few and in between, so to me that says, ""We give a damn"". Its open world aquatic sandbox. Already sounds like a good time. Vast biomes and a great variety of aquatic life, both peaceful, and absolutely terrifying.The creatures move rather naturally all things considered, and continue to get better. Since I have owned this game, I have seen creature models go from rigid robotic movement to more fluid and natural motions. Some still need work.Then the building. While it is restrained to building with modular tubes, these too are being updates and expanded, giving players more options.First time you meet a Reefback, youll be sold on it.			"

								This is one of those early access success stories happening and we should vote with our wallets to support such behavior from the industryThis is the exploration game many of us have been wantingYes I would HIGHLY recommend buying this game.Either get it now while it's early access price, or wait until full release so you don't have to wait for as many updates and can support the devs a bit more.This game delievers it's core gameplay VERY well. All about exploration of the unknown. Sure we all want even more after so many hours playing the game, and the nice thing is that the devs are still adding in even more to explore as of this review.But it's current content will keep you interested for quite a while.Over all it's a very well polished game, the planet feels alive with personality where ever you explore.It may not be a grand scale size. But I feel like it's quality over quantity. You can tell the devs put a lot of care into this game.This is the intricate exploration experience we were promised from no man's sky.I am very excited to see how the story will end for this game. Very well done to the dev teamSIDENOTE: The one minor gripe I do have with the game is a bit of lagging from loading different biomes in if you're traveling too fast. There's just so many plants, animals, and terrain that it slow down for a bit.Nothing gamebreaking but hoping they might be able to smooth it outAnd of course always wanting more biomes, animals, locations, items and it would be really cool to have a few more vechicles			"

								             Ever wanted a ocean simulator? Well don't get anything else and get Subnautica. Subnautica is the ultimate oceanic simulator. It has a very rich backstory and much information and theories about the alien life before us, the Precursors.If you every thought that you beat the game when you got the biggest submarine in the game, the Cyclops, your very wrong. To beat the game it takes hundreds of hours of gameplay and lots of patience. If you don't believe me, Jacksepticeye and Markiplier are on episode 45+ on Subnautica, and are still exploring the vast world. Don't get ahead of yourself and go into creative mode, because you'll regret it.             Heres a bit more information about the game for people who can't decide if they want to buy it or not. First of all, if you buy it, you'll never regret it, as I said earlier in the review, there is a very rich backstory and much to explore.P.S - Use the fabricator in the lifepod to craft items, not the PAD you hold all the time.P.S - Don't make the Cyclops in the shallow area			"

								A beautiful exploration-based survival game set under the sea, Subnautica is definately a lot more streamlined than some of the other recent survival titles that have been coming along recently. But what make this game truly enjoyable are the stunning visuals of the aquatic environments, which you get to explore in your own submarine!Don't get me wrong, though, this game isn't just about the looks. There's some definate signs of progression in the works and plenty of dangers out there in the open sea. And whilst after a time, the game world might start to feel small and the options limited, I fully expect that to no longer be the case upon release.So... the features... base-building, submarine construction, power management, resource management, equipment crafting, exploration, sea monsters, spectacular glowing fungi and plantlife, environmental dangers, terraforming... the game already has all the concepts it needs to be great, though some areas still need some fleshing out. The only real downside is the lack of multiplayer, but the game has enough single player content to be fully enjoyable for a good few hours (maybe more if you're a completionist or the explorer type).Personally, I enjoy playing Subnautica whilst listening to podcasts and the likes. It's one of those games that you can play casually if you want to, but can also be engaging if you want to focus on it in a more hardcore manner.So yeah, a fun game to pass the time - but give it a while, and I'm sure it'll evolve into something fantastic.

								Beautiful looking, fair survival game. You cant play with your mates which is what stops it from being truely great. Devs made a decision early in the development to not include MP as it would stall further development. Now it seems half of the community wants it, and im guessing they have lost thousands of sales because of this oversight.			"

								As far as early access survival games are concered, you should always be hesitant to buy.  I am pleased to say that Subnautica is so far, a great game. The game is being developed by a more experienced team than many other survival games that have been sold in the past and it show. From Absolutely amazing graphics to great feeling gameplay this game is a must for survival fans.The enviroments in this game feel great from beautiful coral reefs to dark sea caverns filled with bioluminescent life and the team went out of their way to make the game feel like you were really on a mostly oceanic planet. It also helps that the game feels pretty well underwater, with smooth feeling swimming and simple but great feeling submersibles. It's genuinely really fun to make under water habitats although there aren't too many decorations yet in the game (subject to change as the game is developed). The game is still in early access so it still feels a bit sluggish when loading things in and I've encountered a couple of bugs, but nothing to ruin the game for me. There are more features that definitely needed to be added but for where it's at in development, I say good job. Solid 8-9/10			"

								I spent 12 hours on survival learning the game and getting chomped on by a plethora of sea creatures before the game was no longer a challenge. Death, it would seem, was not permanent. So I decided to play hardcore mode. Then I spent the better part of 16 hours getting everything i had on suvival mode, on hardcore mode. Built a huge base in the safe part of the sea and worked my way up to getting my beautiful submarine back. Once I achieved this, all without dying, dodging sand sharks, bone sharks, stalkers, crab snakes, and crab squids i finally got the cyclops submarine. It was now 14 hours in and I decided that a change of scenery was in order to celebrate this great achievement. I decided to build a seabase deep beneath the waves at around 413 meters. I packed up my base and put it all on the cyclops and found a suitable location. I  built a terraformer to make the ground better suited for base building, got overly excited, and then drowned. This, was my experience playing subnautica so far, and the game isn't even released, yet I find it to be an awesome change of pace from the typical survival by murder games. This game actually had me terrified for my characters life, after all, in hardcore, you only have one. I plan to start another hardcore game and see where the waves will take me.			"

So lets say you build a base surrounded by fish and it looks stunning, breath taking at times, then you start needing fish to survive..... you literally start killing the beautiful graphics of the game, you go from staring at packs of fish and really nice green resources, to staring at an empty gray sandy dead erea.... which is boring....

								This game does a multitude of things right. The visuals are stunning, beautiful and haunting. The sound design and music really shows they're true colors when entering a vast open ocean and encountering new and mostly massive sea creatures. The survival and crating systems are simple, easy to understand and tightly designed. This game will have you asking yourself questions from the moment you start playing to the moment you stop. What was that frighteningly loud roar I heard at 200 meters deep? Why did the Aurora crash? Who am I? These questions and more importantly, the answers, or rather the lack of answers, give this game quite an atmosphere, and that brings me to what really makes this game shine. Its atmosphere. In the beginnig, this beautiful alien, underwater world will leave you breathless. Later, when you dive deeper into the ocean,you will be breathless again, only because of fear. The game is'nt purposely scary. I dont want that thought to deter from buying this game. Its the non-scariness that is frightening. Because as you get deeper, it gets darker, quieter and nothing happens. You are truly alone. Ocassionly, you'll hear a roar or a moan and soil youself. Thats what makes this game great, the unkown... No game has truly captured an under the sea enviroment this well. Sure, you could argue that Stranded Deep captures the sea quite well, but the Earth's sea isnt scary, we know whats down there. Not in Subnautica's ocean. The unknown makes this game.			"

								Subantica is a beautifully detailed game produced by Unknown Worlds Entertainment. The game is opened world, sandbox, survival (It also has a hunger and thirst system to keep you on your toes!) and based in the ocean. For me this game was a blast to play when I first got it on February, 1. I had trouble deciding on if I should get the game or not. So I posted in the discusses asking if the game worth paying full-price? I got responses within the next day saying that my computer could run it, the money goes straight to development of the game, and that is a really unique and interesting game. So on that day I bought it and because of the hype I had for the game (I previously watched a little bit of gameplay on YouTube before I purchased the game) I played it for 6 hours straight. I couldn’t believe that the game was that addictive.I myself I have good computer for running games, but for Subnautica I didn’t have a high enough graphic card. The graphics had to be reduced to minimal (would you rather have reduced graphics (50-60fps) or have recommend graphics and run the game at (20- 40fps)). But for my resolution it was at the max thankfully. I have no complains about the graphics, its my fault for having a high enough graphic card. Aside from that, the gameplay is magnificent and everything looks realistic as can be. But the game is still in early access which means that there is room for many unsuspecting bugs to appear here and there in the game randomly. But I haven’t come across major bugs in the game itself, but that doesn’t mean that there isn’t any present.The game I pretty sure will still grow even more spectacularly, also the developers are very active and the updates impact the game positively. Also from reading numerous articles about the game it seems that the developers have a plan for implementing a multiplayer section in the game, but the game in its current stage is not yet ready for this kind of big update. Sometimes I freak the heck out when I hear random sounds in the game and when I swim alone at night.I myself occasionally get scared when I go deeper into the ocean because I never what I may find…...My Overall Score 10/10 – Simply Outstanding			"

Hostile and passive alike.I'd definetely rate this game a 10/10 when it's finished but the bugs right now and being Early Access 9/10 is still really good :D Keep it up and i'm interested on what all you are going to add to the game!

								Pretty good game based off what I've watched and the little I was able to play. I've got the Alienware Alpha and according to the requirements of this game the Alpha can barely run it. I refunded the game for now but when I upgrade to a better PC I'll be buying this game again. It's definitely worth putting quite a bit of hours into. The gameplay is excellent and runs pretty smooth. Again, based off what I've watched. From what I've played I was able to analyze some of the mechanics and a bit of the indivisual loot system. I give it a 9/10 would play it again. But of course I will since I only put like an hour into the game. Didn't get much done.			"

								I really love this game. It is beautiful to just explore the vast underwater world. You always find some new wrecks or caves that you overlooked when visiting an area for the first time. The scenery just looks beautiful. There are still unfinished areas but this just made me curious for the next update.It is huge fun to craft all the items required for surviving and searching for the ingredients. I thought that once everything is in my inventory, the game would become boring. However, it turned out to be just as much fun to extend the base and start exploring the world using the cyclops (a huge submarine that acts as a mobile base).While exploring you find different PDA's that tell you the background story which is actually a nice addition and makes the game more immersive.I really look forward to more updates and hopefully more tech to build and the next pieces of the story. As it is an early access game there are some glitches and bugs. Mostly they are tolerable and the developrs seem to be actively working on the game and constantly release updates.The game is definitely worth buying.			"

Does a good job keeping your main goal of escape center stage, and the bits of the story that exist right now make me hungry to learn more.This is also probably the best experience I've had with early access.

								One of the best Early Access games I have ever had the pleasure to play. As a big survival game fine, this is my favorite one of all, and its not even finished yet. Of course it needs some work, its Early Access so go in knowing you will have to start anew or deal with some bugs. There is plenty to do and explore, all while trying to survive in different biomes that come with different dangers. Not to mention all while building a safe haven for you to stay. I would love to see more wild-life and plant-life to research with in-depth descriptions but the list is quite long even now. And if you think.......""What could be scary about a underwater survival game."" I'm with you. I didn't think that with the way the graphics are that I would even think about it being creepy.(I'm not knocking graphics, just saying the style led me to believe it would not be scary.)  I was very wrong. If you like survival games, this one is a must. You do not know the struggle and terrifying experience of having everything you own surrounded by darkness trapped in a cave system with some big ocean creatures roaring in a hidden location, not sure which way is up or down.........yeah.Great game dev's.

								A great early access game. The environments are rich in all types of ocean life and it has a mystery and horror-behind-charm that leave me wanting to play more. However frequent crashes upon loading new areas have left it almost unplayable on my only and longest running save. I am completely sure that I meet the minimum requirements, in fact my build exceeds them, though almost every time, upon moving a few meters past my initial starting point, it crashes without fail. To reiterate, this is surely one of the best, if not the best, underwater-survival-horror- (because ya' know, crabsquids and leviathans, need I say more.) building-exploration-games you can possibly find on any game selling website or application, but remember where your money is going. Probably some hard-working super creative devs that simply haven't had time to optimize their masterwork, hence, early access is an exceedingly correct title. Please use your money wisely, if you don't want to experience a few crashes and bugs along the road, don't buy. If you are willing to tolerate them, buy. Buy because it's an amazing visual experience not tailored to those who fear the ocean, or those who fear the risk of early access.			"

Early Access Review
								Ah, where to begin that others have already covered.I won't go into how it's still in development (that's already abundantly clear) and how they're still adding things to the game (and taking things out); the news releases should be clear on that point.First things first - Subnautica runs off the Unity engine.  Love it, hate it, it's a flexible tool the developer uses (for the most part) quite well.  I'll say for the most part because there are still some interesting graphical glitches (for example, I found that when piloting my Cyclops submarine that some items in bases will render, and from QUITE a ways away, occasionally causing the game to crash).And, as others have noted with the recent updates, the cache files do tend to grow in time, and the memory management not entirely the best, so the game will eventually grind to a halt if you don't quit every now and then.  Quitting to the main menu, deleting the cache, and reloading the game WILL stop the issue for a short time, but if you dropped anything, it gets deleted - AND that process respawns all the PADs you've picked up thus far.  With some other fun, if minor, glitches.The user interface, fortunately, is pretty simple - they follow the 'two level deep' rule to make it easy to find things to craft / create at the fabricators once you have the blueprints.  Click to interact / pick up or use.  I haven't found any real glitches with that, other than some minor graphical issues.Exploration?  It's a very big map (about 1.25km radius), and several layers deep.  The lack of an in-game map does make things a little interesting, especially when going to the new, deeper zones which only the Cyclops can easily take you to; there is a lot of winding through crevices and tunnels that slope downwards, so you'll find the camera system something to get used to.  You CAN get around the lack of a map by placing beacons to mark important landmarks (a wreck you want to revisit, an opening to one of the deeper zones, that sort of thing).The progression is pretty straight-forward.  Search in the shallows for the plans to the seaglide to extend your range, search in the mid-range for the plans for the seamoth to go deeper, and use that as a platform to find the plans for the Cyclops.  You'll pick up some other items along the way, necessary to visit the irradiated area around, and inside, the Aurora spaceship to unlock additional blueprints AND progress in the storyline.Weapons?  Well, they're limited.  For in-universe reasons, the most 'dangerous' item you can fabricate is a knife.  But the things they consider TOOLS ... are fatal if used right.YES, you can kill things.  NO, it's not going to be easy outside of the fish you kill for food (and some enemies are still invincible at this point).  You'll have to get ... creative.  The one most folks will be familiar with is like HalfLife's Gravity Gun.  Small creatures you can pick up and smash against a wall.  Larger creatures - pick up something heavy nearby and lob it at high speed.  Using it like that uses 5 points of energy, so carry ample batteries if you're going into a truly hostile area.  As for using it against leviathans?  Uh, no, run.The stasis gun also makes an appearance, which (naturally) freezes targets in a sphere, allows you to get their library entries, then (hopefully) get back into your sub before they decide you're tasty.  You can only freeze one area at a time, though; launching a new stasis bubble negates the previous one.Torpedoes mounted on the seamoth minisub / PRAWN will either hold them in place, or make them recoil from a noxious cloud.  The PRAWN suit (essentially a small mech), in addition, has customizable arms that can be used offensively, but the thing's limited to walking, so you have to let enemies come to it... which, depending on the enemy, isn't fun.  It has its own version of the Gravity Gun, but that's not the only thing you can use.It promises to be even more fun to explore, as they add items and patch... and hopefully, a conclusion to the storyline they've introduced.

Early Access Review
								Subnautica is unique in that this kind of underwater survival game has not been done before and when it has it wasnt done well. This game is a breath of fresh air (no pun intended) in a time of sequals and re-masters. Subnautica is truely original in its own concept. The game is set in the far future in an underwater alien world. Not constricted to our own oceans gives the game much more potential for further creativity. Such as new species and technology aswell as story elements.The game itself gives it a look of a more comedic and enjoyable atmosphere with the occasional threat popping up to try and kill you. But under the skin this games overall story is much darker the deeper you delve into its depths. I cannot recommend this game enough, the developers at Unknown Worlds put time and care into this game and with every new update and touch of detail it really shows compared to more AAA titles which are constrained by deadlines and market releases.This game may not be for everyone true, if you are the kind of person looking for all out action then this isnt the game for you. While this game has its fair share of threats and unknown dangers more often its about thinking your way through the problem rather than going on the attack. This is a game where time must be taken. Explore, build and survive all at your own pace while traversing the deeper depths to unravel this worlds more darker story elements. So sit down, relax and take a deep breath while you dive into the world of Subnautica! "

								I don't think a lot of people here understand what ""Early-Access"" means. People, when you see that tag on a game, it means that the game isn't completely finished yet. So yes, that mans there are going to be bugs and the occasional crash (Although the game has yet to crash for me!) And for the idiot that is complaining about getting 5 FPS,1) Go and get yourself a better ♥♥♥♥ing PC and quit whining.2) Read the 'System Requirements'.....it's there for a reason.And for everyone else, Enjoy!

								Yet another survival game. Well... yes. And no. This time, no zombies, no radiactive waste... ok, radiactive wasteland, but only as a side note 'til you repair it, not as some sort of plot replacement.The plot? You're on a space ship, something goes belly up, you manage to jump into an escape pod just as the thing goes boom and wake up in a burning, floating pod in the middle of an ocean on a strange, alien planet. Here's your PDA, now find out how to survive.The learning curve is quite nice, the interaction with the surroundings logical and you're given just enough information to be able to connect the dots so you can survive in this incredibly beautiful under water world. You build equipment to dive longer and faster, some (very limited) tools to defend yourself against the hostile fishes and to catch the tasty (and juicy) ones, a while later you find out how to build your own little under water home, then a cute little exploration shuttle and finally a big a.. submarine. Plus tools, pools, materials and gadgets to modify and enhance your base, equipment and submarines.Only one big black spot in this awesome experience: The devs already told us that this is probably not going to get multiplayer support, at least not in its first incarnation. Is it still worth it? Well, given that I have clocked about 30 hours in so far and just now started to build my big sub and I haven't even seen that elusive dry land that allegedly exists somewhere, I'd say that you get quite a few hours per buck spent out of this.

								9.5/10♥♥♥♥ing love it. Its still Early Access, and more content keeps coming down the pipeline. They encourage you to report bugs, which so far for myself are few and in between, so to me that says, ""We give a damn"". Its open world aquatic sandbox. Already sounds like a good time. Vast biomes and a great variety of aquatic life, both peaceful, and absolutely terrifying.The creatures move rather naturally all things considered, and continue to get better. Since I have owned this game, I have seen creature models go from rigid robotic movement to more fluid and natural motions. Some still need work.Then the building. While it is restrained to building with modular tubes, these too are being updates and expanded, giving players more options.First time you meet a Reefback, youll be sold on it.			"

And they clearly listen to players, even watching youtubers who play the game.A word of warning though, if you are afraid of deep water... you might need to play in small doses.  There is a lot of deep water, and those fears are legitimized by some of the critters in there.Also be aware that at the time of writing this, there are still many bugs.  But every patch a few get fixed and they have a very simple bug reporting tool in game.In short, if you get only one early access title, this is definitly a top contender.			"

								Subnautica is truly the survival game we've all been waiting for. With new and exciting game mechanics, objects, creatures and biomes being added constantly, it's hard not to check the updates list every time you enter steam for this game. It is an absolutely beautiful game, with shafts of light that blaze into the depths below. As of June 2015, the only 2 things Subnautica lacks at the moment are MASSIVE monsters found in rare biomes, and multiplayer. It has 3 major ""big"" monsters at the moment being the Reaper, Reaper Leviathon, and the Reefbacks. Apart from that, Subnautica is an ideal game to follow through development and have lots of fun with. I HIGHLY recommend this game.			"

Early Access Review
 OVERVIEW Subnautica is an early access game where you take control of a diver who has become stranded on an oceanic alien world and must find materials and craft to survive. I've liked Subnautica so far being new to 'crafting games' and I feel l barely touched the surface of what this game has to offer(I don't even have the submarine yet). The one thing you should remember if getting Subnautica though is it's still an early access game(abet a solid one), avoid the mistake of buying this and expecting some 60$ full priced game with tons of content and hours of things to do. Subnautica shows lots of promise, but still isn't there yet and still feels very bare bones, however it's still a very enjoyable experience. PROS The world and ecosystem feel alive. Schools of alien fish will swim around, you'll see underwater mushrooms growing, and brightly colored reefs dot the ocean floor. It's very fun to explore and makes finding the materials that you will need to craft enjoyable. I haven't gotten that far into the game yet, but there's also giant alien sharks and giant squids that will prey on you that you have to avoid. The game manages to have its own atmosphere which is nice. The music and sounds along with the art style give the game its own sci-fi identity that adds some character to the world.Crafting and finding the materials needed is fun and feels rewarding.The deeper depth you go the darker things get and more dangerous creatures lurk down there, along with greater and rarer crafting materials. Most of the time, you'll need a flashlight, a knife, and an air sack in case anything goes wrong. It adds an almost survival horror element to the game, which I liked. CONS Game is still early access, expect the typical lack of polish and features.Some bugs, framerate drops, and weird textures. Again expect the early access-nessThe crafting system is somewhat confusing in it's early state. Especially since most of the items are exotically named since it's an alien world. It would be nice if there was a in game guide or if you could pin crafting formulas on your PDA to show what you needed quickly without navigating menus. ENDING NOTES If the idea of exploring underwater or if you enjoy crafting games like Minecraft - Terraria - etc then you'll probably enjoy Subnautica. I can see how some people would find this game boring and it's still in its early access stage, but I'm expecting good things from this game so far. "

								This game is still in development, so if you go for it keep that in mind. That being said, BUY IT. Do you like Minecraft? BUY IT. Do you like survival exploration gameplay, with intense moments of fear and butt-clenching? BUY IT. Do you like new and unique games, with some originality? BUY IT. And lastly, just buy it. It is definitely worth it. Here are some pros and cons:Pros:-Unique and Original-Addicting fun-Large randomly generated worlds with all kinds of exploring-You can submit feedback to help with bugs and development-Friendly UI and controls-Lots of potentialCons:-Still in development (but with a bright future)-Not a whole lot of a tutorial as of yet, may change with future development-A vague story to vaguely follow, but that also allows more player freedom. Hopefully there will be more to follow in future updates.-Clunky ground animations, definitely designed for swimming and not walking.Overall, this game has HUGE potential if it is finished correctly. So far I have faith in the developers, as long as they listen to the community interactively. Worth the measly amount of money they are asking for, especially if you can get it on sale.			"

								I finally bought this because of the steam sale. The bright colors were a bit of a turn off at first, and were a lot of the reason for my hesitation, but at night they are about the only thing keeping this game from being terrifying.I'm a SCUBA diver IRL so this game has been constantly at the back of my mind, every time I saw it I would consider it.I can say for certain that the feeling of swimming to the edge of a large shelf and seeing that deep open ocean in front of you gave me anxiety that was almost too real. The gamer in me wanted to explore caves, but my inner diver sees them as extremely dangerous and the anxiety creeps in again any time there is something overhead.The game makes me want to build a big sea lab with an aquarium and enjoy a life of fishing and relaxation, but the way you are tempted to explore more, and then realizing that you need more resources, it works very well.I'm excited to put more time into this game.Update: Base at 200 Meters deep. I'm addicted.Game is still very much early access, and there are plenty of annoying bugs. I swore I'd never buy another early access game, but I'm glad I went back on my word.			"

I love the fact that you can alter the terrain and build custom bases. Plus the fact is this is still an early access game. They’re encouraging people to point out any bugs the game has so they can give the best experience back to us.

Early Access Review
								Taking into account this is an early release product...1. When playing in fullscreen mode, in either dx9 or dx11, the game repeatedly failed to pass the loading screen and subsequently locked my laptop such that a battery pull was necessary to restart.2. When playing in windowed mode in dx11 the results were the similar to the above, however, the initial tutorial was at least started--with a consistent crash and computer lock occuring when the inventory was pulled up.3. When playing in windowed mode in dx9, the game will run fine.Solution:In game options set the program to run in windowed mode.In steam, select subnautica, go to properties and ""set launch options"".In the ""set launch options"" enter: -force-d3d9Save/close.My system meets or exceeds the minimum specs for this product and my drivers are current/stable. Many other titles run fine under dx11. To say the above has been greatly frustrating is an understatement--with over a dozen battery pull restarts required through the day on an otherwise very stable and reliable system.So is Subnautica worth a buy? Yes.This is an early access title with vast potential. The gameplay is marginally frustrating, as some resources visually very indistinct--can we say limestone? However, there is enough depth to make the game very seaworthy. The environment is fairly unique, in the survival paradigm, and I have not found it overly grindy in my limited playtime to date.As resources seem to be universally finite, I remain uncertain as to just how open-sandbox this title is. Equally, I hope that  more back story gets flushed out over time and/or a proper end game, if resources remain finite, is coded to afford either proper colonisation or escape. Again, this is early access and the potenial makes this worth a purchase whilst on sale.			"

								This game is the best survival game I have ever played. Yeah, it's that great.Subnautica has hands down THE most unique environment. It's all underwater (except for a few areas that I won't spoil for you). Plus this game is futuristic, so you get to use highly advanced tech to move around or stay put underwater in style. The atmosphere is perfect. The graphics and sound make sure of that. Creatures will often groan off in the distance, giving you the chills. The deep ocean is full of things that nobody has seen, so you might just stumble upon some ancient monster that'll swallow you whole.TL;DRThis game is very unique and I would recommend it to just about anybody. Buy it, love it, feel it, wait for the updates, and repeat.			"

								To the developers of this game,Ok so, I have had this game for a few days now, and I am in no sense a professional at this game. However, I do love this game with all my heart, it is probably the best game I have ever found on this planet. Now obviously this is not a complete game yet, first of all it has bugs, glitches, and a few major hiccups. For example what has gotten me very aggravated in the past is the disappearance of my Seamoth, now I know there is probably a way to stop that or fix it, but i wasn't going to spend hours searching YouTube for a guide. Another big issue i see in the game right now is opinionated (idk if i spelled that right or if thats even a word.) I do not enjoy the fact that every tool in the game that uses batteries or power cells (seamoth, cyclops and the seaglider) uses the power WAY too fast. I think that i'm not the only one who thinks this because i have read a few ""comments or discussions"" on the official Subnatica web page and i saw someone discussing this. Other issues that are very small things that I do not believe are major: no animation for entering hatches and the subs or even going up ladders, when building a base you can not turn the corridor into the upright position, there is a bug where you glitch into the base and the game thinks you are still in water (BTW if anyone has this problem just go to where you entrance is to your base and press it, the game will make u enter the base and u will be safe from drowning), some materials that you need the most, besides titanium, for example quartz is SO HARD TO FIND after a while of playing the game. These are MY (again, just my opinion) top dislikes of this game. NONE THE LESS, I love this game, it is the best game in the world in my opinion, it is highly addictive, ONLY 20$ which is a good price for a game with so much potential, and it HAS F****** AlIEN FISH THAT WANT TO KILL YOU, HOW COOL IS THAT? And yes, IK what u might be thinking, you think that i have so much criticism toward the game that i shouldn't play it. NO! that is not entirely true, I do criticize the game harshly, BUT I only do it because i see the potential in such a great early access game. So all in all, this concludes my review on Sabbatical in early access. My major points: fix the bugs which do exist, keep updating the game so people don't get bored of it, and just keep up the good work! I dont actually know if any Subnatica developer will read this, but if they don't then at least i shared my thoughts on this awesome game to all of you who are indecisive of whether you should buy the game or not. TX for reading this, it has been a pleasure writing this, sincerely ♠ℳℬѦ♠ ♚100$BILLS♚. PS, I forgot my major thought to the developers of this game: PLZ, ADD MULTIPLAYER WHEN THIS GAME IS FULLY DONE, the reason why I ask this is because my friend and I bought this game so we want to play it together (I showed it to my friend and he liked it right away) I told my friend to buy the game because i want to support the makers of this game so the game is awesome when it comes out fully finished. So yea tx for reading this and if you know any way to get this letter to the developers copy and paste it and send it to them so they can read it, because I want them to see this and keep in mind what the players want. TX for reading again. XD			"

								Subnautica is one of the most creative survival games to date. The gameplay reflects this creativity with very intriguing wildlife, stunning underwater reigons, and almost limitless construction possibilities. If you typically like survival games with a crafting oriented system, and you don't mind a little farming/grinding, I highly recommend this title. Even if you do not like survival games you might get want to at least look at some gameplay and judge it for yourself. If co-op does become a reality in this game it would be almost a must-own title. It is one of my favorite games of all time.			"

The graphics are stunning, the colors are vibrant, the sounds you hear will excite or possibly put you on edge.All under the ocean.The gameplay itself is enjoyable, swimming around collecting resources, hunting for things to allow you to build submarines and other gadgets, you can even build bases now. The developers are always releasing really great quality updates with awesome features.No complaints from me at all with Subnautica.Definately worth the price. Give it a go.			"

It got quite some unique mechanics and stuff that makes the game harder than other survival games.I can't really give the game a rating beacuse its currently work in progress and has still alot to be added and fixed, but I swear if you are into survival games then you will not regret picking this up!PS: Remember that we barley know much about our own ocean in real life. So beware what suprises this game is gonna throw at you!			"

								I really love this game. It has pretty solid gameplay (Excluding experimental sometimes). There are a good amount of tools you can use against your enemies. I would really like to see more vehicles make it into the game though. There are only three as of now. (Seaglide, seamoth, cyclops.) The survival aspect can become a bit lacking in content after you have gotten so far in progression. But they will add more soon. Also the enemies don't seem to be that big of a threat right now. They are pretty easily avoidable and rarely engage you ever. You'd have to really try to get attacked. They will add more creatures in the future and hopefully tweak the aggressivness of the current ones. There's one thing I like is a real challenge. In terms of atmosphere the game literally nailed it! I don't reccomend this to people who fear the depth and vastness of oceans though xD			"

								Potentially the BEST game of its genre/type & the immersion level sends chills up my spine.  The strengths of this game are many...1.  Best Ocean Graphics I have ever seen, I wish they released a Screensaver App so I could show my base on my desktop somehow! (An Animated style, like the seascape screensavers from 3rd parties.)2.  The audio is creepy as heck, the deeper you go the more intense the sensation of vulnerablilty and creepiness.3.  Easy to use items and storage is not too cumbersome, it could use some tweaking like auto pulling crafting mats from nearby chests (IE: H1Z1's Materials Crafting Proximity Collection)4.  The Equipment works well overall & is easy to use/understand.  (Utility belt would be nice instead of the Inventory, but I am sure the Dev's have this kind of stuff on the drawing boards)5.  The Flora & Fauna are simply amazing, you guys did a GREAT job on this aspect, near Perfect.6.  SIngle player is ok for now and even if it's never mulitplayer, the game could add Alien Colonies perhaps or lost civilizations maybe?  (ie: XCOM 'oldschool' style...what Terror from the Deep could of been in a new modern gorgeous engine?!?)7.  Vehicles work well and its rewarding to craft/build them, the attention to detail is great!  The difficulty of coding a water -based game must be just insane?)8.  The Dev's actually work hard and provide professional methods of tracking the progress.  This was the reason I bought yet another EARLY ACCESS Game despite saying I would never buy another ALPHA game.  (Kudos Devs, you got me hooked afterall?)9.  The community is not nearly as jaded and bitter as the other survival games discussions have become.  Maybe single player is the key to this...if you're having a bad game in single player it mostly your own fault or the occassional bug.10.  As cumbersome as the code is for my new PC to handle, it's still Quite smooth & well polished.  The recommended settings look great & the FPS is not bad.  (H1Z1, 7dtd & Robocraft have much bigger problems and have been out longer in most cases, so good job dev's!!!)*  If the game was crap I would say so, this is not an attempt to kiss the devs butts.  It's just  my honest 2 cents about a great game thats unique & immersive beyond most games I play.  Such a good game, just simply brilliant.....IF YOU ADD EVEN A 2 PLAYER OPTION, I WILL BE HOOKED COMPLETELY!!!Despite the occassional crash here and there, I can play for hours on my OEM HP Tower with an $400 - AMD A10, 12GB RAM, Radeon Integrated 8750D ... so even a crappy HP tower can run this at about 30-40 FPS.   I have a new tower I'm building just to play this game & I can't wait for the NEW BASE UPDATES!!!!Just stunningly good example of a professional, thought out Early Access game among a 'SEA' of ""STEAM""ing turd EA(early access) titles here on STEAM.EARNS A SOLID -  4/5 Only due to a lack of multiplayer, everything else is gorgeous!  It can get boring :steambored: , but thats just normal this early in every good games development, the next update should add hours of playtime to this game :steamhappy:5/5 score would be a perfect game rating, not many of those around at the moment anyhow...  :steamfacepalm:			"

								I have been playing this for about 23 hours so far and though I realise it's just a vary short time, I wanted to give my thoughts, so here goes.  I don't normally by alpha/beta games as so many of them are just about playable and sometimes they even get abandoned by the creator even though you've paid money for them.  The first thing I noted about Subnautica was the beautiful graphics, they are a joy to behold.  The sounds of the underwater creatures and environment is quite atmospheric, and the scenery really is eye candy.  The gameplay on the whole is smooth though every so often I get a bit of stutter as if the game is loading in another area.  My labtop is custom built with the following specs:Intel® Core™i7 Quad Core Mobile Extreme i7-3940XM (3.00GHz) 8MBMemory (RAM) 32GB 1600MHz SODIMM DDR3Graphics Card NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 680M - 4.0GB DDR5 Video RAM - DirectX® 11Memory - 1st Hard Disk 750GB WD SCORPIO BLACK WD7500BPKT, SATA 3 Gb/s, 16MBCACHE (7200 rpm)It’s a meaty machine and so I don’t think the machine specs are too little for the game, besides it runs games such as Far Cry 4, Skyrim, X3 and Elite Dangerous with no lag, so I am guessing it’s the way the game loads areas up that causes the slight lag.The game is vary easy to play; you need to search the seabed for various natural and man-made items to enable you to take them back to your pod and use the machine inside to craft various items for you.  These range from small pipes, flippers, extra oxygen tanks, right up to underwater habitats and submarines.  When playing you really do have the sense of shallow and deep water exploration.  Initially you only have about 40 secs of air but you can craft for yourself more tanks giving you more air.  I currently have 4 tanks which gives me 225 seconds of air. Then there’s a rebreather thing to help you use less oxygen on deeper dives, and I guess the submarine (which I haven’t built yet) will give you a much longer air supply.  Plus there are plants that give of air bubbles which you can swim into and fill up your tanks.Some of the creatures that live in these waters are friendly and some attack you. So carry a knife with you and be aware of your surroundings. So far I have built a Cyclops submarine, that has loads of room to move about in and to create lots of store lockers, and I have a sea moth which is a mini-sub that can be parked inside your Cyclops.  The Cyclops has a safe depth of 100m but between 100-200m the hull is weaken and can start to take damage, and below 200m then you’ll like to have hull collapse.  I have also built myself an undersea home with observation dome about 200m down.  I have also found some really deep seas in which I went down to about 800m and still couldn’t see the bottom.  I am going to have to go right down and build another home there.If there were a few tweaks I wish the creators would make they are: an on-screen compass to better enable you to get your bearings and the option to turn the underwater music off.  It is atmospheric music but in games I prefer to turn the music off to better hear the background sounds. Oh, and there’s a bug where the sea moth will not recharge its batteries when docked in the Cyclops, which it is supposed to do, so once your sea moth battery dies, it becomes a useless piece of junk.So, on the whole a great game with so much potential. Good work to the creators, but please iron out that sea moth bug.			"

								An early impression - minecraft reimagined to an alien world under the sea. As a relatively cheap early-access game, the developers deserve every single penny. Undeniably, there are glitches here and there but it's easy to look past considering how they're developing the game rapidly and bugs are quickly fixed. It's always difficult to make a review based on a large and successful game like Minecraft. Nevertheless, as a first time player, it's safe to say that the game is very intuitive and gives an enough degree of challenge without it being to overhelmingly frustrating. This game features an expansive and unchartered ocean where it is filled with digging, exploration, crafting and even monsters at night which will require your full attention throughout the game. It's exciting to see where this game is going as an underwater sandbox exploration game and is highly recommended~			"

								Been playing Subnautica for a while, now, particularly the Experimental builds as of late, and I have to say, I really love it.  I've always liked the Survival Sandbox genre, especially the ""realistic games within that genre, and, so far, with the exception of one other,  Space Engineers, Subnautica is my absolute favorite.  Now, I realize that the story leaves a great deal to be desired at the moment, what with you being the miraculous lone survivor of a ship crewed and inhabited by assumably hundreds, possibly a couple thousand people.  However, once you start playing, all of the current plot holes seem to become as nothing, as you really get drawn into the beautifully designed world, with its photo-realistic environment, and the busying tech tree advancement, which, admittedly, at the moment, is not entirely awe-inspiring, as you assume the role of a McGyver-like scientist/architect/engineer, and can fashion a computer chip out of a chunk of quartz, a chunk of silver, and two pieces of coral.  That being said, however, from a technological standpoint, it's pretty darned impressive that you can do so.  As the great author, Arthur C. Clarke said, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology can be percieved as equal to, and indistinguishable from magic.""  And this kind of rings true in Subnautica, though, familiar concepts do deaden the blow of this ""magic"" to some degree.  But, it's still enjoyable, and fascinating, to watch your character wield a small, phaser-like tool, and build a base solely from titanium, and various forms of quartz slag, most notably glass and silicone.  The biggest draw, for me, at least, is tthe exploration aspect of the game -- So many beautiful biomes, with so much life.  Sometimes, I almost forget it's a game, I get so immersed in it.  But danger balances out beauty, with Stalkers, Bonesharks, Gasopods, Bleeders, Crash, and the immense and equally deadly Reaper Leviathan.  And the game does so in a way that I think feels rather natural.  It feels like there's an already established food chain, and you just landed square on your tuchus, at the very bottom link.  Amazing job, Unkown Worlds!  Keep up the good work, and may you always create such wonderfully enthralling worlds!  It's my opinion that if you don't at least try this game, you're missing out on the time of your life.  So, please, give it a try.  I think you'll be ever so glad you did. :)			"

								This is one of the most entertaining games I have ever played. First off, the price is outstanding. You can spend hours and hours on this game and you always seem to find something to do and it is still in a very early state. I also love the fact they always seem to update it. This game gets updated every two to three weeks give or take and every update brings tons of new features that make you want to jump right back in. The developers are amazing and actually listen to the community. From the time I bought the game until now, I have seen countless problems that the community has complained about fixed. The devs even respond about topics the community is curious on, like multiplayer, and they have a website where you can see all completed updates, updates they are currently working on, and updates they plan to do. This game is cheap, has an amazing community and developers, and seems to only get better and better with each update.			"

Needless to say, I quit the game and didnt even save it. 10/10 would brown my pnts again.			"

								This game took me by surprise. At first, I thought it would be just like The Forest, and Strandest Deep. Though I was wrong. Subnautica enrolls you into an alien world, a great deal of creativity. You will never know what will attack or not, because all of the creatures are completly unknown to you. Though the part I like the most is base building. You could make important things, such as fabricators (its the future, and thats a point that is awesome in my opinion), workbenches, and lockers. Though also, you are allowed to make things purely for decoration. Such as windows, aquariums, and benches. You should really get this game. It isn't finished, though that means that there is more excitment for whats coming. You could help. You could make a diffrence and make the game even better, clicking that one button.			"

Early Access Review
 OVERVIEW Subnautica is an early access game where you take control of a diver who has become stranded on an oceanic alien world and must find materials and craft to survive. I've liked Subnautica so far being new to 'crafting games' and I feel l barely touched the surface of what this game has to offer(I don't even have the submarine yet). The one thing you should remember if getting Subnautica though is it's still an early access game(abet a solid one), avoid the mistake of buying this and expecting some 60$ full priced game with tons of content and hours of things to do. Subnautica shows lots of promise, but still isn't there yet and still feels very bare bones, however it's still a very enjoyable experience. PROS The world and ecosystem feel alive. Schools of alien fish will swim around, you'll see underwater mushrooms growing, and brightly colored reefs dot the ocean floor. It's very fun to explore and makes finding the materials that you will need to craft enjoyable. I haven't gotten that far into the game yet, but there's also giant alien sharks and giant squids that will prey on you that you have to avoid. The game manages to have its own atmosphere which is nice. The music and sounds along with the art style give the game its own sci-fi identity that adds some character to the world.Crafting and finding the materials needed is fun and feels rewarding.The deeper depth you go the darker things get and more dangerous creatures lurk down there, along with greater and rarer crafting materials. Most of the time, you'll need a flashlight, a knife, and an air sack in case anything goes wrong. It adds an almost survival horror element to the game, which I liked. CONS Game is still early access, expect the typical lack of polish and features.Some bugs, framerate drops, and weird textures. Again expect the early access-nessThe crafting system is somewhat confusing in it's early state. Especially since most of the items are exotically named since it's an alien world. It would be nice if there was a in game guide or if you could pin crafting formulas on your PDA to show what you needed quickly without navigating menus. ENDING NOTES If the idea of exploring underwater or if you enjoy crafting games like Minecraft - Terraria - etc then you'll probably enjoy Subnautica. I can see how some people would find this game boring and it's still in its early access stage, but I'm expecting good things from this game so far. "

								For those who want a good sea game, but expect more graphics then Far sky, or more gameplay elements than stranded deep. It certainly does contain decent graphics, and when you first pilot that cyclops you will be VERY impressed with the game and her potential, despite potentially frustrating some with the rather short food and water metersHowever, unlike the two games aforementioned, Subnautica contains several key features that mean you should pick the survival game over any other (or with them, as I do :P).1) The world is pre-generated. So whilst it is the same every time, any limitations that would be had on poor randomly generated world coding (dead linger anyone? Bless them) the underwater sea world appears as full of life as the real ocean would, in more habitable regions that is.2) The marine life is both diverse, yet still believable. I can't be the only one who loves Planet explorers, but finds the large array of creature life to be a tad unrealistic. Far sky stuck to real life creatures which, whilst 'boring' looked beautiful and brought life to the game. In Subnautica the same is true somewhat, with the many animals looking either tasting or vicious.3) The floating sub, or above water ‘hub’ if you like, is surprisingly fresh, i.e. original, and there was just something about having this floating base that made the whole adventure seem a lot more manageable... even with the exploding red bomb fish (spoiler? :P)4) Graphics; now I am not a graphic ♥♥♥♥♥ like some people, yet I will certainly appreciate decent graphics, especially so if they run on my laptop which, whilst not too bad, can certainly chug sometimes on certain games. But luckily for myself that is not the case with Subnautica, I can appreciate the underwater world presented to me whilst not gagging inwardly towards the graphical presentation of this marine world.5) CYCLOPS SUBMARINE! I can’t stress just how damn satisfying it is when one first makes this beast of a machine, the  wide viewport, the docking bay, the ability to have your name of choice emblazoned on the side of the ship, hell there is not a thing wrong with this beauty of a vehicle.For those who lost interest around the second sentence here is a brief summaryDamn good game, buy said 'damn-good' game... Enjoy said game.A solid 8/9 out of 10. Buy it, as well as Far Sky, both are decent games.			"

								While there's not that much to do right now (and I've heard a lot that the game get boring when you build the big sub), it's just the kind of ""explore, build and survive"" game I was looking for to go to from Minecraft. Yup, it's not even close to what you can do in MC but it's still fun and my son loves to watch the underwater life as we slowly expand our base in all directions.It'd be nice if we got more modules, biomes and ships to build (an possibly some day a small land expansion). I'd love to catch some big nasty fish and put them into a giant aquarium and make that a trap for intruders (in case we'll get multiplayer) :DAnyway, if you're looking for a game where you can feel like on an adventurous vacation, Subnautica is just that... Also, since there's between 34°C to 40°C here for last few weeks, it's nice to spend most of the time in the water.			"

								so i have an idea for next update since i can rarely kill things or be safe how about we get a harpoon guun or even a regular small pistol for underwater it can go like this crash pwder and titanium can make bullets the gun can be made with titaniuma and will every so often jam from depth or water clogging now for the harpoon it is creepvine and well titanium is used to crafat harpoon and is retrievable. harpoon gun is creepvine and titanuim and for sharper bulletts it is diamond at work bench and for hot ones it is battery with it at workbench i feel this could add to the hunting aspect when more creatures are added i also id like to reccomend modding of seamoth like putting two arm like things on front one for grabbing and breaking limestone the other for whatever you put their like a repulsion cannon or even a harpoon gun and pistol along with the stasis rifle and terraformer that way you dont have to constantly get out and it will use more battery when second hand is in use if electrical object that consumes battery this is just my personal opinion im not sure if its even possible but it would be nice to have the seamoth as a more adventurery type vehicle and i would like new mosnters for it to combat			"

								This game is INCREDIBLE! The fish and plants in this game are all incredible. The atmosphere is great as well. Swimming through caves and walking through the Aurora alway keep you on the edge of your seat. The amount of things you can do are incredible for an early access game and it runs pretty well. I got this on the OSX update because I have a MacBook and it runs perfectly fine on it. Unfortunately like every game it always has it's downsides. The graphics on the Aurora are not the best but keep in mind The Aurora is brand new. Some of the resources are hard to find when they should be a little easier, such as quartz. It seems like you need quartz to make ANYTHING but it tends to be very difficult to find.			"

								Recommendation: BUY IT. I was on the fence of whether to buy it or not but then i saw somebody play it on youtube and decided to give it a shot. Here is what i have come to experience: It's a really addicting game. Survival games are usually quite similar these days and therefore not so captivating anymore. But Subnautica and the underwatersetting has really something to it (apart from the primal fear of deep dark open water). I have powered through the existing gameplay possibilities and can't wait for more updates to come. Apart from some small little bugs it is a great early acces game and already has hours over hours of gameplay (a lot of it consisting of recource and fragment hunts - but the biomes make it worth every minute spent in them).

								Very relaxing yet terrifying when i go too deep. At least it cure my phobia of deep sea, somehow. For an early access game, this game is amazing. I hope game dev keep working hard on updating it and polishing the game.			"

								This is one of the best games on steam. Do you know my reasons?Well here they are! 1. Its open world do whatever you want to do! 2. It has somewhat of a story to it! 3. It inspires the future! Those are my reasons! I recommend this game to anybody who either loves the ocean or loves the future.Signed, Happy Customer			"

								Even if this isn't finished, it's an excellent and well build game. Today, April 11th, is my birthday, and I bought this for $20. I was not disappointed, and was the best birthday gift, truly.I highly recommend this, however, the nauseating screen tilt when you move sideways and the buggy foliage beneath 200m depth are the only cons I have for this.

								So Subanutcia is a game where your spaceship has crash landed onto a planet full of water that has alien life below the water. It is a very early access game, but it does have some great stuff hidden inside it. Good Graphics, Good Functions, Rareness of objects is balanced, overall I would rate it a 10/10. I am looking forward for more updates on Subnautica			"

								Subnautica  9/10-Overall 8/10Addictive. Ive been so hooked on this game, Ive done 17.6hours in a matter of 2-3 days of having the game.Its a crafting survival game but with so many creatures to catch, kill or run from, scenery to discover and oggle, toys to play with, and base building to do its truely fun to go looking for resources. I fairly sure most people that are into adventure will love the game.- Gameplay 8/10Controls are good. mechanics a good. crafting system is easy to follow.swim, ride, submerge, hack, collect, dig, construct, and die repeatedly from diving to deep to suface in time. so much to do.-Graphics Awesome. I wouldnt say realistic, but beautifuly done. Looks great.-PerformanceSave Save Save!Runs really well but on occation will crash out of game without warning. Save whenever you hit an important milestone in your adventure.-just get it.			"

								I have only played for a little while, and I love the game so far. The atmosphere is amazing, the ambience is superb and the controlls are really smooth. I found it weird that when you climb up the ladder and down the escape pod you just teleport there. It would be nicer to see some kind of animation for it. Other than that I would recommend this to anyone who's looking for a beautiful and entertaining game.I haven't met up with any sea monster yet, to be continued..			"

								This game is absolutely fantastic!In most eary access games I feel that I'm looking at the future patches beacause I feel like I allready experienced everything that particular game can give me for the moment. Subnautica is not like that, and I feel as if I only experienced 10% of what this game can give to me, and when the new patches rolls out I feel a bit flustered even since there is so much new things to discover.Subnautica brings the horrifying experience of dicovering what truly lies beneath the Sea.

								I bought this game a little before the Farming Update, and have been playing it ever since. It's fantastic to start up and kill a lazy Sunday with.Each update, even the minor stuff, brings notable quality of life improvements. From the ""power nap"" update that added beds and let you kill time in-game without burning your hydration/nutrition, to the Machine Update that added a whole new set of functionality to your base, this game is quickly turning into a surprisingly complex survival-exploration game. There's a very organically-found story on this planet the player is stranded on, with something fascinating and beautifully crafted waiting around almost every corner.Definitely a game to pick up and kill a weekend with once in a while. Grab it now, as what's available is going to feel awesome to play through on a slow weekend. It even has modes that let you turn off the typical ""survival"" elements of nutrition/hydration, allowing you to enjoy Subnautica however you see fit.			"

								Subnautica is a game where you learn to listen to the sounds around you, they higher pitched and softer the sound, the safer it is. The lower pitched and louder the sounds, the more dangerous. That being said, if you are Deaf, definitely buy this game as the greatest horror game available to you. If you want to roam around like Captain Nemo of The Nautilus and fight (scream♥♥♥♥♥♥at) sea monsters then this is the game for you! Not only can you customize the colors of your submarine, you can name it too, plus you get swords and rifles.If you are working over your fear of the water due to watching Jaws as a child, then Subnautica will be your greatest aid. The game will help you understand that your fears are irrational, as long as you stay in shallow waters. And that unless a nuclear meltdown occurs and radiation effects the wild life, everything will be OKAY.By the way, my only parting words of advice would be that the puffer fish that make a loud high pitched shrilling noise and come out of clams, like to HUG (you will see hearts) don't  hurt them and they won't hurt you.

I've yet to explore more then a small part of the map before a another major update comes out. Also  there is Plenty to do construction wise in the game.

								Been playing Subnautica for a while, now, particularly the Experimental builds as of late, and I have to say, I really love it.  I've always liked the Survival Sandbox genre, especially the ""realistic games within that genre, and, so far, with the exception of one other,  Space Engineers, Subnautica is my absolute favorite.  Now, I realize that the story leaves a great deal to be desired at the moment, what with you being the miraculous lone survivor of a ship crewed and inhabited by assumably hundreds, possibly a couple thousand people.  However, once you start playing, all of the current plot holes seem to become as nothing, as you really get drawn into the beautifully designed world, with its photo-realistic environment, and the busying tech tree advancement, which, admittedly, at the moment, is not entirely awe-inspiring, as you assume the role of a McGyver-like scientist/architect/engineer, and can fashion a computer chip out of a chunk of quartz, a chunk of silver, and two pieces of coral.  That being said, however, from a technological standpoint, it's pretty darned impressive that you can do so.  As the great author, Arthur C. Clarke said, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology can be percieved as equal to, and indistinguishable from magic.""  And this kind of rings true in Subnautica, though, familiar concepts do deaden the blow of this ""magic"" to some degree.  But, it's still enjoyable, and fascinating, to watch your character wield a small, phaser-like tool, and build a base solely from titanium, and various forms of quartz slag, most notably glass and silicone.  The biggest draw, for me, at least, is tthe exploration aspect of the game -- So many beautiful biomes, with so much life.  Sometimes, I almost forget it's a game, I get so immersed in it.  But danger balances out beauty, with Stalkers, Bonesharks, Gasopods, Bleeders, Crash, and the immense and equally deadly Reaper Leviathan.  And the game does so in a way that I think feels rather natural.  It feels like there's an already established food chain, and you just landed square on your tuchus, at the very bottom link.  Amazing job, Unkown Worlds!  Keep up the good work, and may you always create such wonderfully enthralling worlds!  It's my opinion that if you don't at least try this game, you're missing out on the time of your life.  So, please, give it a try.  I think you'll be ever so glad you did. :)			"

								This game is honestly one of the best games i have ever played on steam. It is a purely amazing experience that kept me on the edge of my seat everytime i began to starve and was forced to improvise, every time i discovered a new fascinating biome , or evaded a terrifying sea creature that was intent on making me its next meal. Another great aspect of the game is its wealth of content just waiting to be discovered, this includes research, bases, submersibles, and even the flavor text which just increases the quality of the experience. Unlike many other early access games the developers are consistantly releasing new content in the form of updates which are as plentiful as they are thurough in their quality.with all of this said and with a mere $20 price tag i see no reason not to stop reading the review section right now and buy the game as soon as possible................SEARIOUSLY BUY IT!

Early Access Review
								To keep it short and sweet, the reason I give this game the thumbs up is simply because of a unique take on an overdone crafting mechanic. I have many survival/crafting/exploration games, but this one stands out for two reasons: no game I have ever played has done so much with an underwater feel, not even bioshock or GTA5 has given me such a sense of being in the ocean. As for the second reason, well I kind of mentioned it before when I said that this crafting mechanic is done over and over again, but one thing that makes it worth it is the style. Not only do you pretty much have a no-clip-like opportunity due to swimming underwater, but you also get to explore how to build things not just from the ground up, but also from up to down, from side to over to out and such....if that made any sense haha. Lastly, I do want to include that I worked at The New England Aquarium for just over a year and a half, and in that time I became very facsinated with marine biology. I haven't delved too much into the actual species analyzer devices, but the fact that they are there tells me that the makers of this game created an entire circle of life and food chain to go with it. In basic form, there is a ton of things to do in this game. You can have a care-free creation mode and build the ultimate fortress with unlimited resources, or you can play varying versions of the story mode and learn to fight and survive on an unknown alien planet in the ocean. Now, there are some things I would like to address, which many of you Steam players would know already, but with Early Access comes faulty functioning. Sometimes, you will glitch off the map, sometimes you will get stuck, and a lot of times you'll see some textures not loading in time. But that won't effect my review, as it's still in early access. I hope these things are addressed sooner rather than later, but it's no big deal. Even state of the art games such as Borderlands or Team Fortress 2 see these problems from time to time.To any developor of the game who is reading this, bravo! Although the game lacks a few things I would love to see (such as more weapons, vehicles, and a LOT more base building pieces) it is in Early Access, and I am satisfied as it is. Any and everything you have done with this game so far has been amazing! EDIT: I just wanted to come back here, and it's 8 months later than the original review that I posted....and sooooo many more hours put into this game. I have been watching this game develop more and more, and at nearly 120ish hours put into this game, I can say without a doubt that I am very much looking forward to the full release of this game. To me, I live for games like this. Subnautica and I have a very special bond, and by that I mean I am more than happy to wait for this game to develop into a full version....I don't say this with many Early Access games, because they usually get shelved....but I give full support to the devs. They give us a pretty decent update every 2-4 weeks, usually something either to do with a bug fix or new content. I'm okay with that. It's fine as it is now, and as I have been watching the story come together, I am SOOOO excited to see what will happen when the game is complete. 100/10, would♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants when I see a Sea Dragon Leviathan again.

								This is what an EA title should be, pretty close to feature complete, almost bug free, and enjoyable now.  I don't mind testing games to give constructive feedback, but most EA titles end up never releasing as they figure out that they can't supply the things players want while still making the game enjoyable.  This game came out with a strong indication of where it was intended to go, and the devs have kept to that and made improvements along the way.  Looking forward to the final product!			"

Yes the game is not perfect and there are some glitches and even a bug now then but over all the quality of the game is good enough now to recommend it even though its not done because there is a ton of stuff to do thus far.

								I both love and hate this game. I love it because it's so immersive, the detail is amazing, and the storyline, although not quite complete yet, is awesome. I hate it because I played it for a long while yesterday and that god-forsaken leviathan showed up in my nightmares. I ran into it twice yesterday, once when I was cruising in my seamoth, and it appeared out of nowhere right in front of me. I thought it didn't see me, so i high tailed it in the other direction thinking I could outrun it. Spoiler alert: I didn't. It showed up front-and-center and proceeded to eat my seamoth. I did the only thing I could do. I exited the seamoth, and swam as fast as I could. I looked back and saw the leviathan shake my poor seamoth in it's jaws and I heard the explosion. Thankfully I got away, somehow.I was passing by the area later, ever watchful, and I saw a stalker a few yards away near the surface by the aurora. I looked away from it and my entire screen was filled with red and white as the leviathan bit into the stalker from below and flew through the air like some kind of special on the discovery channel. I sped off and didn't look back. RIP stalker, you saved me and my seamoth.This game is amazing, and terrifying. I'm already afraid of deep water and this game has not helped me overcome that fear. I love open world games like this and it's one of the best games like it I've ever played, and it's not even complete yet. Keep up the great work, I can't wait till it's complete.			"

The animation and world a beautiful and fasinating world are amazing! It is curently still in early access when I right this so the developers ask for feedback during the game. The developers listen and care about what we think offten fixing things by hte next time I play it. I can't wait to see where they take it and hat other challenges they will give us!

								Don't let the early access dissuade you.  Out of the dozens of early access titles in my library, this is by far the most polished and finished one.  Also, the dev's share their project management tracker openly on Trello so you can see exactly what will be in the next update and what the team is working on.Pros: solid gameplay, good graphical style, constant work by devs, just a hell of a lot of fun.Cons: occasional bugs, some biomes unfinished (but should be dropping in the next update), minor balancing issues (I've never found the moonpod blueprint until I've progressed far beyond the logical stage for it)Buy it as is to get a polished game and support devs who openly share progress and ideas.

								Great graphics and super-simple interface.  If you like to scrounge, build, and occasionally fight - yes!  It reminds me of the first time I saw a video of Cousteau on his Calypso.   It seems a little lonely without a cooperative mode, but that didn't stop anyone from enjoying other single player adventures.  Things I like - visually stunning, progressive difficulty, discovery.Things I didn't like - learn as you go, no map or direction finding (except pod point beacon), twitchy fish and short range scanner make scanning a chore. Things I would change or add - character customization (including sounds) for gender, color, etc.; a way to seek rare materials (like a long-range scanner), and a quest list of things to do (remind me to find magnesium for my welder).

								This game is the best horror game I've ever played. It starts off, lulling you into a false sense of security. You're in a bright, colorful, lovely ecosystem. As you adventure, build your base, you feel pretty proud. You've even got a few cool vehicles!Then, you travel further underground.First, you reach a dark, lifeless canyon, filled with dead Creepvines.Second, you travel even further, reaching a beautiful, awesome, nice ecosystem again! Albeit it's filled with bones, but, it's still kind of creepy.Third, there's a deep dropoff. You land in a hellish wasteland, filled with lava.You hear a roar.You turn around.You see a massive creature, at first, a silhouette.Then, it's getting closer.It's too close.It's over.BUY NOW!			"

								I have thoroughly played through both the experimental version and the stable version. I really enjoy the new things to build in experimental mode for your base, however there are several glitches in the moon pool. The moon pool can dock the Seamoth, and is supposed to charge it, but it doesn't actually charge it. You can fall through the side of the moonpool as well and get stuck outside, because the game still thinks that you're in base, so you get stuck outside. The placement of the moon pool also is really difficult to deal with. Also, for some reason the moon pool doesn't completely connect to the base, and seems to randomly get flooded. I really do like the game as a whole, though, and I like the direction they're taking the game. 10/10 Developers. Keep up the good work.			"

								Fall Sale 2016 - Subnautica on discountI urge you to get this game, especially now while it's on discount. I got this a year ago in another sale and I've never regretted it, I'd even pay the full price now that I've explored and built for many hours (and that's nothing compared to the time some players have spent). If you've been burnt by No Man's Sky and still search for a great exploration, crafting and survival game, this may be it!It's still in early access, but there are dauly updates to experimental mode and regular (mostly monthly) large updates to the regular mode. Also, you can choose survival modes (hunger and thirst are factors), exploration mode (no hunger or thrist, but you need to find blueprints and raw materials) and free mode (all blueprints are available from the start) to fit your play style.It's a hand crafted world, not randomly generated, and large enough to spend many many hours.

Today I went back and gave it another shot, starting with a 500x200 resolution.

								I've been playing this game in short bursts (because I suffer from thalassaphobia, an intense and persistent fear of the sea or similarly deep bodies of water) for a total of 14 hours. The devs are constantly releasing updates, and they're not just minor bugfixes, they actually add a lot of new stuff the game everytime. This game is terrifying and beautiful. If you like exploration, then this game is definitely worth a shot. Just remember to keep your ears open when you go near the crashed ship. You'll find out why. Night time is absolutely stunning in the game because just about everything is bioluminescant. The game isn't procedurally generated, which means each corner of this alien world is unique, beautiful, and painstakingly handcrafted. If you're looking for something to help you get over your fear of the ocean, this game won't help. It will just scare you and make you feel like a big blubbering baby, but it's a humbling experience to say the least. If you love your inner explorer, definitely try this amazing gem.			"

								There's a short list of games that are both really good and filling their own niche. This is one of those games.  Be it Kerbal Space Program or The Long Dark some games take a new approach to their subject and add something really worthwhile to it. Subnautica does that for the Survival/crafting. Surviving in a high-tech environment but underwater without a lot of high-tech things to create. You're not building space ships or turrets or the like, you're trying to carve out a safe, habitable environment in the hazardous underwater environment of a water-world. It's a challenging environment, staying up on food and water in a sustainable way has challenges. Getting the supplies to build a base under water is challenging - I'd take hiding from zombies over trying to dodge a Sea Reaper while attempting to get into the radioactive wreckage of the Aurora any day. This is not a real combat game in the same way The Long Dark isn't a combat game. The challenge is in just surviving. The difference is that where The Long Dark is about survival in a hostile environment with sparse resources Subnautica is about survival in a hostile environment with plentiful resources... if you can just manage to get ahold of them and get them to a dry, safe place to convert them into something useful. Trying to get deeper, get into and survival more dangerous environments. Avoiding all the things who want to kill the interloper in their domain, which you always are. There's never a point at which you don't feel like a 'fish out of water'. One of the best strengths of this game is the environment. It looks and feels alien, hostile, but beautiful. Absolutely worth it and worth the money. Gets regular updates and great love from the devs. Seaglide, Seamoth, Cyclops and PRAWN all provide very different but interesting ways to interact with the environment. Division of resources requires you to stay on the move and constantly visit and re-visit areas, while the map is large already (and expanding). One of my favorite purchases on Greenlight. Absolutely worth the money.			"

								This game isn't perfect- but d@mned close. Right from the start, it shows that it's considerate of it's players, by giving you fully customizable controls, not the hardwired nonsense some game devs seem to always sneak in. And it lets you choose between a variety of difficulties, based on playstyle. Survival mode isn't brutal, but it's definitely challenging. Creative mode gives you fantastic resources to begin with and lets you explore both the game world, and the game's mechanics, so it's a great way to get the knack of the controls and systems. The world offers up beauty, whimsy, and the gut-wrenching primal fear you only get from swimming over what seems a bottomless abyss. I can't wait to see this game when it's fully polished.			"

								First and foremost Subnautica is IN DEVELOPMENT - It isn't finished yet and much more will likely be on the way before it is.However, even though this is a single-player game, it can be quite challenging. The exploration factor is excellent and the biospheres are diverse. Survival mode and hardcore add to your troubles on this watery world. Add in exploding fish and big things with teeth and it's all very interesting.Subnautica is also one of the prettiest games I've seen for a long while and the technical design compliment the aesthetics wonderfully. Base building and other crafting elements are easy enough to grasp and the possibilities are extensive.It's well worth checking out some of the available videos online to see more. I do hope for some multiplayer eventually but for now, this whole ocean is mine to explore.			"

								Probably one of the most complete EA games iv played. Recommended for people who love exploring. The alien world is very unique and interesting. Immersion at its finest.			"

								Honestly, one of the most enjoyable, fun, imaginative and beautiful games I've ever played. Interesting gameplay, and an overwhelming sense that something amazing or terrifying is always beneath you... The scenery is stunning. Absolutley stunning. Surviving this alien waterworld is as much a pleasure as it is a challenge. I can't say it enough, I love this game... and It's not even finished yet. I cannot wait for what else they put in this brilliantly designed game.			"

								11/10 would buy again... and again... and again.. :( but whyyyy!!!i love the underwater feeling, how is this not yet available for HTC vive ?it's early to say it wil be a good game.. but i think the game offers allready hours of fun and gametime. Dont let my gametime statistics fool you because i allready played the game on non steam platform before i bought it on steam. I bought it because the underwater feeling is unmatched by any game and i love the dark deep scary ocean feeling im getting from playing this game. Also i think the developers are doing great on the updates.STILL GOOD GAME!			"

								Subnautica.The potential of this game is ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING. I love the sea and the wonderous depths of it. You know what I do not love? Glitches. Although this game is an Early Access game, the FIRST world i played.. My bulkheads were stuck. I could't go anywhere without dismantling my bulkheads in my base.Aside from this right off the bat glitch...I was genuinely entertained with the gameplay, it proposes a new concept that hasnt been done before. Surviving in a complete ocean environment. I had loads of fun collecting resources and building my underwater base and crafting many tools and items.The creative mode is extremely relaxing and almost theraputic.One thing i believe this game should have is more out of the water items, like boats and bases on the surface, so your'e not stuck making a dangerous undersea base.Aside from obvious glitches, this game is amazing!I truly love this game after only 10 hrs, I would definitely recommend it!

								Absolutely love this game and will continue to love it, However I am still pretty bummed about not having at least a co-op feature, but like I said this game is still a ton of fun nonetheless and will continue to play it! So therefore I am giving it a 10/10 rating. Would love to see an expansion on this game for at least co-op maybe in the future!			"

								So far, I like this Game, but for some reason it is laggy to a behemoth level for me. I do not know why. I am just geussing maybe my computer is not powerful enough. I am just going to guess that you need a Quantum Computer to operate this game			"

								Fantastic game if you love exploration and survival games. Gorgeous graphics, engaging mechanics. Not many games have unknown areas of their maps that i'm actually scared to go near, so they've done something right there..9/10, multiplayer would make this game incredible. (Although the developers have said it won't happen) "
