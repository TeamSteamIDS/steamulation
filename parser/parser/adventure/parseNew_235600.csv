												OK... given my playtime now, I think it's finally time for my review. No plot spoilers. A proper review would take a look at all aspects, but I don't have much time so I'll be brief. The Good - Singleplayer The game itself is surprisingly good. Of course... it's no Chaos Theory, but regardless, the game is actually fun. By playing on perfectionist, the game's hardest difficulty, you'll find yourself hiding and waiting a lot; examining the guards' patrol routes (which by the way change every few deaths to keep you on your toes). Also you won't be able to use your vision through walls, giving (albeit briefly) you that similar experience in Chaos Theory when you find yourself constantly wondering what's around the corner.So what else is there? A diverse array of gadgets, guns and accompanying upgrades for starters. I loved being able to use the money earned from missions to upgrades and improve my loadouts. There was a chain of progression, and I could feel my character becoming a 'stronger' spy, equipped with more stuff as the game continued.The environments are pretty damn awesome. Exploration is the key to achieving your preferred playstyle. There are neat cinematic scenes and unique parts of the story which require you to play out these almost 'mini-game'-like bits; but they're so well integrated into the story and allows you to take a break from all the running, jumping and stabbing. The Good - Multiplayer - Coop/SvMNow let's switch over to the multiplayer. There's not much to say about coop. It's essentially singleplayer but with a partner. There is a fairly wide variety of missions to choose from. Each of the main characters have varying game modes depending on what you're up for. Nearly all of them can be played solo if you don't have anyone to trust your life with.Grab a mic, join your friend, and off you go. That's right. A mic. Whilst not completely essential- it will drastically reduce the number of times you die because of silly mistakes. Bouncing information between you and your partner will really help. But... if you're with a random person you might not be able to do that. In which case, you'll just have to grit your teeth and go with the flow.Spies. Versus. Mercs. It's fun. Believe it or not, it's actually fun. With friends. By yourself... yeah, I'll admit, you can have some pretty decent matches. But seriously, for some laughs and a better chance at winning- play with friends you can talk to. Skype, TeamSpeak- it's all about information exchange. You can better anticipate that ambush if your buddy just saw a spy heading your way. You can let your friends know where the hacker is by utilising the merc cameras whilst your dead.The SVM loadouts are different to the singleplayer loadouts, so be prepared to start paying up the big bucks again. This time you'll also need SVM tokens, which allow you to purchase weapons and stuff. You only get a few when you start levelling up and then one token each level after that, so spend wisely. There should be enough to unlock everything, but it's the order you choose that matters. I'll be writing or recording an updated SVM tutorial sometime in the future, to help the new players with how everything works. You'll have fun creating custom loadouts with a combination of gadgets, gear and weapons to your liking and playstyle. The torso abilities are pretty cool. Each side (mercs, spies) get three choices of abilities to aid your plight. Used wisely, you can be a valuable asset to your team.Since Blacklist is 4 vs 4, it's the perfect number. Every player counts, and when your team mates goes down, you best be prepared for what happens next.On the face of it though, SVM is fun to dive into for a quick match (I say quick match, it's about 25 - 30 minutes per match). You can just join and start playing straight away. It's fast paced and will require some level of awareness and reflex reactions in order for you to survive. Playing smart is a key skill. Anticipating enemies, knowing your way around the map, always paying attention to the little things that might give away the position of a spy. Classic, Blacklist and Team Deathmatch are probably the only active game modes at the moment. The others could do with a reboot, as they're fun to play... when there's enough players. The Bad - Singleplayer I honestly can't really fault the singleplayer. There is one thing though. It can be very easy to speedrun. Grab one of the sniper rifles and just headshoot everyone. Job done. Of course, some armored enemies require a little melee time, but with two or three shots you can drop them just as easily. It can ruin the fun, but it's completely feasible.Oh, there's also the whole Michael Ironside thing. Yes, Fisher does appear younger. No, it won't stop you from enjoying the game. You'll get used to it. Or perhaps not. It's really up to you.My negative points reside mostly with the game launcher rather the game itself. Ubisoft only had to go and slap Uplay on its products AGAIN. Why even bother releasing this on Steam if it was going to need Uplay anyway?! For example. I load Uplay (ugh, I know) and click 'Play' on Blacklist. It then says... 'loading Steam. Please wait for your game to load from there'. Like... wut. Then Steam launches Blacklist, then it goes BACK to Uplay and Blacklist opens up. ???Not only the Uplay interface a pain to reach on a laptop (since it's Shift + F2 and laptop users have to press FN as well...) but it's slow as hell and actually caused me to crash Blacklist once.Ugh. The Bad - SVM Here we go. I'm leaving coop out of this by the way.Spies vs. Mercs feels like another company developed it and just slapped it onto the main game. Seriously. The sonar vision is completely different to the sonar vision in singleplayer, the way the stun crossbow works is different, there's no crouch sprint... the list goes on. When I first started playing, I got bugs. I mean... BUGS. One particularly game breaking bug was the fact that every time I went into cover and left it, I'd stand up and start sprinting around. It was hella annoying. Ubisoft put out THREE patches and none of them fixed it. It was only after I'd posted a couple ideas and experiments of the forums that someone else picked it up and fixed it. A fix, from the community ._.If you're buying Blacklist for the SVM, wait for a deal. SVM, in its current state, is just not worth it. Overrun with hackers and the likes, SVM has become a tense community, filled with paranoid players who don't trust each other. And why should they? With Ubisoft turning their back on the game, with no dedicated servers (Host changed. Migrating match.) and no anti-cheat system, you have no idea who could be hacking, or who's just damn lucky. Tired of the hackers? Want to quit the match? Tough. Ubisoft removed the Quit Match button to 'reduce the number of unfair rage quitters'. Uhm, wut.Seriously, all the more reason to team up with people you trust and can communicate with. You can still beat hackers, because they're dumb. They can whiz around and kill you with one bullet, but they're idiots who can still be killed with Death From Above and unexpected melees. Even hackers bleed. The Conclusion Conviction was fun, but Blacklist brings more to the table. With new ways to play, and new gadgets to play with, the singeplayer and coop are definitely a must. Just watch out for the SVM, it might not be what you were completely expecting. Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist is a 9 / 10 .			"

												One of the first good mainstream stealth games in the last five years or so, aimed at general audiences.Multiple playstyles are supported, from the sneaky ghost, the brutal ""lethal stealther"", or the tactical ""the world must burn"" assault-lover, the game doesn't actually go out of the way to punish any one playstyle, since all of them are valid and rewarded.Difficulties are actually very well encompassing, since you have a nearly hand-holding rookie level, down to a ""half of your advantages are handicapped, and you have no mark and execute"" perfectionist style.Above all else, though, the levels are actually well designed 99% of the time, compared to the tripe that most stealth games have these days with simplistic AI; the guards in this game are disturbingly smart, so if you come inside expecting the usual guard behavior you saw in something like Splinter Cell Conviction or Dishonored, you're going to be surprised. To put it simply, this game pulls off what Hitman Absolution did, tried to, and then goes on to cover even more.The only complaints I have about the game are the usual ""you're on the Unreal engine, so animation errors are practically inevitable"" (though to be fair, the game does a damn fine job of hiding the fact that it's ON Unreal), and the story is hilariously asinine, to the point it practically doesn't match up to the quality of the gameplay. Oh, and the usual ""Uplay isn't something anyone wants"" crap, but that's a given with a Ubisoft game.Also it's buggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥and the netcode needs work, but oftentimes the results are more hilarious than gamebreaking.If you want a challenge, be it loud, lethal, or silent, this game (Splinter Call: BlackopsList, or GI JOE SNEAK SQUAD) actually does a damn fine job of it. Just don't expect an award winning story.			"

												Splinter Cell Blacklist combines the best elements of Conviction and its predessors into one fine package. A package that deserved more attention, because even though Splinter Cell is still popular, it didn't manage to sell enough copies.Anyway, Blacklist lets you play as Sam Fisher (who else ?), but with an all-new voice actor this time. Michael Ironside will be sorely missed, but I have to admit the new voice of Sam did a very decent job. The game has plenty of content, including single-player missions, co-op missions, multiplayer and even a metagame. The single-player portion can be completed in roughly 10 hours. I didn't have a chance to try the other modes just yet. The single-player missions can be played with a stealthy approach, as an action hero killing everyone you see or a mix of those two. Since this is Splinter Cell I'm thinking most of us will play this game in stealth mode and use a more action oriented approach if they're ever discovered. The graphics look extremely well and the game is a blast to play. It also runs at a solid 60FPS, something I personally adore. Blacklist looks like a compilation of all previous games and as a result it's, in my opinion, the best game yet, or the more complete one anyway.[Rating: 93/100]			"

												[8.9/10] (new voice actor sucks. this is not our Sam Fisher !  -0.1)The best Splinter Cell series since Chaos Theory. It has an interesting campaign, superb co-op and an engaging multiplayer. thay are all filled with fun and addictive gameplay.Story is bit a crap. but gameplay is amazing, Ubisoft provides a wide array of tools, many of which work to support one of the three play styles (ghost, panther and assault). the levels are very complex and well designed. you have multiple choices in levels to take different routes and utilize your surroundings. you can also go back and replay each mission to try and get the high score !Overall, this is a great game worth a lot of your time and effort !

 Splinter Cell Blacklist is a return to form for the Splinter Cell franchise after a long 3-year break, and for anyone with doubts, it delivers. STORY:  Set after the events of Splinter Cell Conviction, the president of the United States opens 4th Echelon, a ""blacker than black"" clandestine special operations and counter-terrorism unit that answers solely to the President of the United States. Our beloved hero, Sam Fisher, is its commander. A terrorist group called the Engineers are terrorizing America by announcing 5 attacks on major parts of the United States. It is up to Sam and the help of 4th Echelon to stop them. The story is fresh and exciting at first but then takes a huge turn for the worse only to become a very predictable story. There are also a couple of story inconsistencies such as Sam's mid-20s look and moves. Also, why is Sam such a d*ck all of a sudden? GAMEPLAY:  Stealth perfection. Every action you make grants you points in one of the following paths:1- Ghost (classical SC: hardcore stealth, no kills, and no detections)2- Panther (SC Conviction style: modern stealth, fast fluid stealthy kills, and no detections)3- Assualt (CoD playstyle)The developers made sure that every style feels different and fun to play, I was a Ghost myself, and it was such fun. Each playstyle grants you points that you spend upgrading Sam's gear and his airship, The Paladin.I had a problem with the unlockables, though. They are very easy to obtain. I maxed out everything almost halfway through the campaign. One thing I liked was that the points you get are shared between the singleplayer and multiplayer unlocks, thus giving a sense of interconnectivity between the modes. GRAPHICS:  Varied environments, fluid animations, lovely color palette. Night time missions look much better than the daylight missions, but in the end, the graphics are good enough, and (mostly) nothing special. AUDIO:  Good soundtrack, but nothing memorable. Cheesy dialogue, bad writing, and forgettable voices.***** IMPORTANT NOTE ***** The infamous new voice of Sam Fisher, Eric Johnson, isn't bad, he just isn't as good as Michael Ironside, and the poor cheesy dialogue doesn't help. MULTIPLAYER:  Spies vs. Mercs returns, the 2v2 (or 4v4) multiplayer with its various modes is a breath of fresh air from all those heavy action shooters and FPSs. It is slow, stealthy and balanced. When the action rises, you feel the adrenaline pumping in your veins. It seriously is a blast. The co-op is good fun if you have the right friend to play with since the game demands good teamwork and communication.Overall, I think that SC Blacklist is a great game, the designers had something really special, but sadly the writers took a dump over all that. SC Conviction was the perfect finale for Sam. Had the writers started out fresh with a new, young protagonist and made Sam a mentor, I think it would've been so much better than the mess of a story Blacklist has. 9/10  "

												Don't let my 10-hour-playtime on Steam fool you; due to an unknown bug, Steam stopped tracking my stats for Uplay games. I've played Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist for well over 30 hours, and it's a stealth experience unlike any other.The Pros:· Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist is a perfect combination between Conviction and Pandora Tomorrow. · Choose your playstyle. Whether you're new to the series or a die hard Splinter Cell fan like myself, you'll definately find your cup of tea here no matter what. There are three different playstyles: Ghost, panther and assault. Ghost will have you completing a level without anyone ever noticing you've even been there. Use your gadgets and avoid getting close to hostiles but take them out in a silent, non-lethal manner when you must. Panther allows you to play a more brutal but still silent approach. Mark three targets, crouch-dash to a nearby fourth hostile, take him out with a stab to the throat and shoot the other three with a silent headshot by simple pressing the button. Assault lets you go in guns blazing, not caring about detection what so ever, as long as it gets you through the level. Unsilenced weapons, grenades, taking hostiles as human shield and bashing their heads against the wall when all the bullets that needed soaking have been soaked. All this can change in the blink of an eye. Situations will rarely feel the same depending on your playstyle. I played hundreds of hours of Conviction, so the Panther style allows me to build upon the experience I've gained through playing Conviction.· A strong cast of characters. Sam Fisher himself, his daughter Sarah Fisher, Anna Grímsdottír, Andriy Kobin, the new isaac Briggs and Charlie Cole and many others all have a certain chemistry with each other due to events in the previous Splinter Cell titles, which makes the story a lot more dynamic.· Where Pandora Tomorrow allowed you to choose your loadout at the beginning of a mission, Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist lets you create your own custom loadouts, complete with primary and secondary weapons and gadgets, but also upgradable goggles, vests, gloves, pants and boots that can be purchased with money you earn for completing missions. This allows you to mold Sam's equipment to your playstyle even further, as your outfit can either be heavily armored or extremely light and stealthy.· Many cool moves make Sam fast and agile. There are countless animations when you're taking down an enemy which is extended upon by the choice of lethal and non-lethal takedowns, you can swiftly climb along wall, pipes, ropes, ledges and what not, and the ""sprint"" allows you to move faster and vault over obstacles instantly.The Cons:· The shadows often don't look dark enough to be believable. You can, in theory, stand a few meters in front of an enemy and they won't notice the bright lights on your armor. These same lights will indicate when you are visible or not though, so it's generally clear to know when you can be spotted and when you're safe in the shadows.· If you're not playing with a controller, the controls might sometimes be a bit frustrating. I started playing with a keyboard and mouse and it felt like it didn't offer the precision I needed in terms of movement. If you have an Xbox controller, I recommend using it. Sam's movements feel a lot smoother and the gameplay is overal more controllable when you have a full 360° rotation with a joystick.The Visuals:· Superb. Amazing camera positions durning cutscenes, great lighting effects, detailed and varying levels, gorgeous textures. It's everything you'd expect from a Ubisoft game.Final Verdict:· Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist is hard to hate because it offers playstyles for almost anyone, from die-hard Splinter Cell veterans to newcomers to the stealth genre. 9.5/10			"

												It seems the 5 years between Chaos Theory and Conviction had everyone forget what made the series so different than everything else.""Stealth Action Redefined"" was the original subtitle of Splinter Cell. I always thought that the point of a secret agent was that his existence remained as much a secret as possible. In SC:B, it's quite the contrary.The SC fans will likely opt for the Ghost approach. In SC:B, being a Ghost means you can be seen by the enemy as long as you knock him out within a second. You can knock out as many people as you want, shoot out light bulbs, destroy cameras, you name it. The next morning, nobody will remember a thing and will probably blame the destroyed light bulbs and cameras on a power surge or something.You'll go on this mission where you must hack some computers, and where, if you're ""detected"", the enemy will wipe out the data and the mission will be a failure. But apparently, if you knock out the entire base before hacking the servers, it's not suspicious at all and they won't wipe out the data, because, bleh.And if you remain completely invisible without leaving as much as a drop of sweat, the game rewards you with a lame 11000 points and a few thousand dollars. If you opt for wiping out the whole base, you'll get 20000+ points and even more money. Even shooting light bulbs rewards you with money.Everything that was challenging in the previous games is now gone.It's a somewhat fun game, but it's pretty far from what made Splinter Cell ""redefine the stealth action"" genre. Sadly, I don't think it's ever coming back			"

												Finally played this game that I've wanted to try for a very long time. Blacklist came out 2013, and I have to say that it still looks brilliant. It was a blast to play since the game is very nice optimized. SLI supported so I played it on ultra at 1440p, 144 fps. This most have been one of the best looking games of 2013, because it's still impressive.Personally I would really like to play this in first person. There's 2 missions where you can play first person, but the rest is in third person. I looked around for a camera option, but I found that there is none. It's only in the missions that they selected. Too bad about that, because I though that was a lot more fun.The strong part of this game is in my opinion the story. A terror group called the engineers is threatening USA with attacks if they don't pull back their troups out of other countries. Sam Fisher and his team is trying to find the people behind it, and the cutscenes add a lot to the story. Voice-acting and lip-sync is good and help the story out. What kept me playing to the end was absolutely to see how the story ended, and I liked it.There's a pretty cool upgrade system. You get points based on what you playstyle is. Combat, panther or ghost. Now I tried to sneak a little, but most of the time I went for combat. Since I chose the combat/panther path I upgraded my gear for that. More powerful weapons, and gear with better armor. If you wanna sneak better you can upgrade to more sneaky gear and gadgets. I really like that I got the choice and wasn't forced to play in any perticular way. Some missions are unfortunately sneak only, but it's limited. Those missions frustrated me a little, but I can look past it.I didn't feel like the guns had that powerful feeling and the gunplay was a little dull in my opinion. Melee takedowns was cool though. I though the gunplay was much better in the few first person missions. I just wish I could choose to play that way in every mission. But that's really the only downside that I personally felt.All in all, this is a good AAA-game that you can play in your own way. Blacklist has a nice story, that is pretty lenghty and definitely replayable, with maps that have multiple paths and bonus objectives. I rushed through it and it still took me about 10 hours, but if you want you can spend a lot more time then that. I'm personally done with blacklist after one  playthrough and have no desire to go back, but im still glad I played it. I simply have a lot of other games I wanna play too, but if you are that person that like to play a game many times over, this is probably a game for you. There is a lack of stealth games on the market, and this is one of the better ones. It runs super well, sounds good and the gameplay is fun. Sure I have some criticism on it, but it's minor things that most people won't care about. I would recommend it to everyone that like sneak games, third person shooters and games with a good story. I'm happy I played it, even though it wasn't what I expected before going in. I think people should give it a shot, on sale or even at full price. Gunplay was no more then decent in my opinion, but story, stealth, graphics and optimization made up for it.			"

The game has high re-play value, & to all that play it, it is addictive & interesting.It is after the release of this game that Tom Clancy moved on from us. I couldn't stop fretting that DEV's should FAITHFULLY consult with microscopic detail his archive of writings on further releases from Tom Clancy. This game impressed me SO MUCH.(about this time Edward Snowden of the NSA began his expose' making many doubt his sincerity as an NSA agent against Sam Fisher's :-))Plainly put this game is like CONVICTION and a sequel to it, although it is similar, the bound controls for CONVICTION differ, I re-configured mine to match BLACKLIST. I understoodhere how controls can make a game feel clunky or smooth. THIS game is the smoothest of all Tom Clancy : Sam Fisher releases, the ultimate creation (ito gameplay) of all of the previous installments.There is also play that must be completed on your ANDROID to unlock additional gear for your missions, the SPLINTER CELL BLACKLIST companion app, downloadable from google-play (free).Notes.-Multiplayer has 5 different modes.-Multiplayer has only 4 maps.-FPS is available in multiplayer.I purchased all the DLC and was satisfied with my choice.I want this game to win steam award because I want more of this game..i want a sequel :)I highly recommend this game.

												Is this game better than Chaos Theory or Double Agent? Not quite, but it does give the splinter cell series another variance, or at least a build off of Conviction.The first probable thing the player will note is that Michael Ironside, the original voice of Sam Fisher is no longer in the game. This is brutally apparent as the new voice actor is simply way too soft and cannot be taken seriously. What is sort of nice though, instead of walking around in a warehouse like in double agent, Sam is now on a giant airplane which is his new mobile air base. This essentially is the RPG element to the game. You may update everything from your inventory, to your suit, even to the airplane adding special GPS features or infirmary upgrades. The main map table the player is able to approach allows the player to choose single player, co-op, or multiplayer game modes. The story revolves around terrorists in which every few days they activate a new doomsday type of scenario (poisoning water, remote explosive, etc...). The pitch here is that Sam is to prevent the doomsday before occurring. Old faces prod up such as Anna Grimsdottir and new characters also join the team. At one point in the game, you switch from Sam's 3rd person view to his partners, Isaac Briggs first person view (there is also first person view in multiplayer spies vs mercs). The story is interesting and does provide good plot points, but I can't help feel it's a little corny at times.The game play seems like a cross breed of Conviction and Double Agent. I like the game, but it seems like sometimes you can simply rush through and shoot anyone. Not certainly a bad thing as Sam Fisher is quick to shoot, but it went from a fear of being spotted, to now simply bouncing from cover to cover. The cover system is neat and let's you plant yourself where you want to be with a simple look (using the right thumb stick) and pressing A to initiate the action. Blind fire like Gears of War is available and outlines of where enemies think you are, show up when you move to another spot. Technical aspects such as these exist in the game with the complement of Sam's gadgets such as sticky cameras or grenades. The game play it alright, and feels sort of boxy and restricting at times unlike the other Splinter Cells. Lethal and non-lethal take down options are available and hiding the bodies (or throwing them for that matter) sometimes becomes fun and easy. Throughout the game, Sam receives cold hard cash depending on his performance on the mission. This money can be used to unlock further gear, guns, or gadgets that suit you. Sam's movements are smooth, but I feel Double Agent just feels a little better than this one. I like the three combat system score they have in game. Panther (silent kills), combat, and stealth all make up your unique performance. At times, you will feel Sam can take on an entire army. Then there are times where taking on a guy with armor suddenly becomes tricky. Stealth is still here, but it isn't as authentic as it was in Chaos Theory or the first.The sounds and graphics are good. You will hear Sam make his usual remarks throughout levels. Side commentary relevant to the game, especially when Sam's calling out there's dogs up ahead, is certainly helpful. The menu music to background music is good. When you get caught though, it isn't as suspenseful as the first SC. They tried nailing every little last piece of sweat on everyone's face. Sounds are appropriate as multiple gun types are available. It's nice to hear a silencer do it's job or an AK go off and alert everyone in the vicinity.The only way they could have made this game better (from the rating I'm about to give it) was to add a LOCAL co-op feature. I'm not sure why everyone thinks no one plays video games together anymore, but adding that would have been an astounding addition to the game. That, and getting Michael Ironside back. He literally made Sam Fisher who he is today.Rating : 7.8/10.  Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B+ Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B+ Overall  B+Would recommend a buy on sale, it's a good game with a lot to do, but I feel previous Splinter Cells had much more ingenuity put into them. This feels like Conviction 2.0 + DLC. It does provide, however, a lot of replay-ability. Multiplayer, co-op, and singler player should keep you occupied just enough. It would have easily hit a 8+ with local co-op.***I should add, indeed you need uPlay, but if you take a second and set it up properly, you can run this game through steam without a problem. Again, yes, it's uPlay... but this is definitely a game worth setting it up for!ScreenShots :  They changed the detection system to make it more simple. I find Chaos did a better job Execution feature of the game is still present This is the RPG element I spoke of in the review The game is discreet in showing what actions you can do, and where you can do themSomething to do aboard the PaladinNew face of Sam FisherScreenShots : Co-op Co-op screenshot, distracting the guard holding me hostage as he shoots him Some areas you cannot proceed until both of you are there Communication is pretty vital, so wearing a headset really helps Even your partners ghost is viewable by you "

												I like the game, but my big complaint is that the rewards structure is kind of ♥♥♥♥ed up. Why does the game only reward you for sticking to one of the three pure styles? The game is tedious to play 100% ghost, but playing 100% panther makes it really difficult to immerse yourself as a covert military operative. I tried to do a combination of both styles (trying to stay hidden but using weapons when necessary), but the game seemed to punish me for my decision when scores were tallied at the end of each level. I guess you can ignore the scores and the game telling you that you failed to reach the designated goals as a ghost or as a panther, but for me it felt unfair to be punished for trying to play pragmatically in synch with the story.

												I was surprised by Blacklist, it's a lot of fun for a Tom Clancy game made post golden era. The story is alright in single player, nothing to write home about. Love all the weapons/gadgets you can unlock by playing, with the need to earn virtual money to buy each one, I spent a lot of time re-doing missions/co-op to earn more money for all the items. Re-doing missions with different loadouts or going different playstyles is a lot of fun.The co-op missions are even better online, and a lot of fun. Just wish they had built in VOIP as it's sometimes hard to tell your teammate not to do something stupid. The PVP multiplayer is kind of meh. Yes they brought back spy vs mercs but it just feels very unbalanced and unfair at times. It really comes down to being a spy, hiding in a shadow, run up to merc, press x, boom merc is dead, rinse repeat. Gets old.OTHER than that, the CO-OP is fun, the single player is fun, and it's a lot of fun unlocking everything and re-doing missions. Well worth it for less than $30. (check Ebay, you can usually buy a key from there for around $20)  "

												Ah Splinter Cell, this game got a special place in my heart.When I saw the trailer on this game for the first time I felt that this game looks very cool and really fun. And MAAN I wasnt mistaken this game is amazing in all ways and its still super fun to play.The story Well the story is basiclly that a terrorist group called ""The Blacklist"" spreads fear over the planet! And your mission is to stop them to every price. Seems easy right?My thoughts about the game The game is a masterpiece, the stealth mechanics, graphics, gameplay is so good that I cant even believe that this game is real!

GameplayThe gameplay is centered around stealth. But you can also ignore it and just kill everybody that stands in your way. You have three styles of play: Staying undetected and sneaking by enemies, staying undetected and silently eliminating enemies, or just go into combat. - The game rewards you in all ways. There's also a lot of gadgets with different abilities as well as co-op and multiplayer modes.StoryAs far as I'm concerned, the story is pretty good and lasts about 10-14 hours, depending on your playstyle. It revolves around a terrorist group launching weekly attacks on America, which they'll stop only if all the US troops return to their homes. The US government forms a counter-terrorist team with Fifth Freedom policies to stop the terrorists.Seems to be your everyday Clancy-esque thing.GraphicsThe graphics look really good, I really don't understand the rumors that say they are outdated. Seems to be a console issue, since it was released for previous-gen consoles just as the current ones were marketed.PerformanceIt ran fine on our medium-rig PC, only some minor FPS drops.LongevityAs you can see, I've clocked more than 100 hours on this majestic game, and I didn't get the chance to play multiplayer. The different styles of play, co-op, side missions and DLC keep you in the game.SummaryThe game is extremely underrated, it may be different from the classic Splinter Cell games, but it is a damn great title on its own and an overwhelming upgrade from Conviction.9 splinters out of 10 "

												I do recommend to purchase this game but only when it is on big sale and I will explain why in details.First of all, I have to be honest - I am SC fan and I was playing the series right from the first title. And yes, I do not care about graphics - more about overall atmosphere. Though I do care about how devs supporting their product.PROs:The game has very good single player and if you play it right it feels like that old SC's that I loved so much - you can do the things silently or even without touching anyone (there are some counter-examples though). I have to mention ""train break-in"" and believe me you won't be happy with this situation if you are fully stealth player. Overall, single player is a good way to entertain yourself for another day or two but that's all. If you are the ""loud guy"" you can also re-play everything as panther or assault. The only question remains is why those awesome night infiltrations have gone? You encounter only several in this installment.CO-OP. Well, it took the best features of SC Conviction co-op and executed them just perfectly - it is another great game to play with a good friend of yours for some time. The only thing I don't love is that it is way too short (I am also extremely dissapointed with that Briggs'  missions never-ending bug, but let's keep it aside as it might get fixed). It's an outstanding co-op if you play it right - you have all the tools you need but if you fail to deliver you are the only one to blame.However, the thing I was so excited about is SvM (Spies vs Mercs). This was initially introduced in Pandora Tomorrow and in next installment, Chaos Theory, it keep many gamers entertained for years. Double Agent also presented us with SvM but it was not so popular. With no SvM in Conviction I though that the series is getting worse (like many others on the market, sadly) but SvM got its place back in Blacklist. It is so much fun that you can play it for hours and hours, again and again. It is almost perfectly balanced, and, aside for some bugs, you can equally good play as a merc and spy and there is no loosy side really. You might think that one side is better than the other one at first, but as soon as you start to use your equipment properly and your skill increases - you will see that SvM is balanced nicely. I was in worldwide top 15 at the moment of writing so I do know what I am talking about. What about modes - I was so hooked by SvM Blacklist that I abolished that SvM Classic mode, which many claim not to be classic (and I agree with them). They re-introduced Deathmatch as well, which still looks weird for me, even though my beloved Chaos Theory also had one. For newcomers I recommend to try out SvM Blacklist and SvM Extraction.Points are - if you are looking for Chaos Theory Redefined - Blacklist is a good choice as it is Chaos Theory ideas blended with some Conviction mechanics. If you are looking for exact copy of Chaos Theory or Pandora Tomorrow - you better look for an unsold copy of CT or PT at your local store - Blacklist has different focus - it is more action-driven than Chaos Theory (single-player and co-op) and  more diverse in terms of SvM. Yet it has many bugs in each of the modes of game so you have to live with it. However, as I have been playing CT for years I glad I now have something else to play.CONs: Major technical issues - Ubisoft failed everywhere it can. Let's start:General. You have reinstalled your game?  Congratulations, your saves, DLCs and friends on the list are now messed up. Everybody complains about it since the release and nothing was done here. You have high-end PC? Well, that's good for you but still you will witness FPS drops, launch failures and whatever the game can possibly present you with. Even on Official Gameplay reveal day the game crashed. ANd again, Ubisoft fails to make it work.Single-player. There are moments when you are forced to use your weapons or whatever you don't want to as a ghost. Many missions are just not from Splinter Cell world and you have to deal with it. Ending? Well, you have to wait for someone to think of something else. After some patches Sam are likely to bash all doors he can see. Definitely an improvement.Co-op. Short. And by this I mean extremely short. Random picture distortions, FPS drops in some locations. You can spend 2 hours passing the last Briggs' mission in ghost style just to face the never-ending bug. And what Ubisoft has done about it? They say, start over. That's all. Additionaly, you might be unable to play with your friend - you can play with randoms but not with your beloved friend who also bought this game.Multiplayer (SvM). Ubisoft completely failed technical part here. You can see half of animation of you killing a person and then you drop dead and that person is near death. You can see Merc's reloading animation yet he completes reloading in the middle of animation and shoots you. Many complaints - nothing was done here. You will kill (and be killed) your enemies while they are already behind cover just because you started shooting early. You can sometimes see spies through cover when they stick to it. Some pieces of spy gear (takedown gloves) has absolutely no real effect - even support cannot say what it does exactly. And there are many, many more issues in SvM. Oh, one more thing..Cheating? It is allowed so you can't really distinct between really good players and cheaters unless their cheating effect is obvious.Overall, 7.0/10. If not some major issues - the game might be perfect one. Though Ubisoft managed to fail another good title.			"

 Feels like... Splinter Cell! (tldr is the overall impression on the bottom)I've been a huge Splinter Cell fan since the first part and so played every single one of the franchise. So I felt like Chaos Theory was the last )  real  (and best!) Splinter Cell in terms of gameplay and stealthiness. The 2 following games,  Double Agent  and  Conviction  felt quite disappointing and not like good 'ol Splinter Cell to me. That being said, I was unsure if I really should give  Blacklist  a chance, as I also was warned that it might disappoint me aswell. When the game was offered for around 10 bucks, I decided to give it a try. And honestly I was quite surprised! The positive :+ the game offers you to choose your own playstyle. You're able to choose between 3 different approaches each mission: Ghost (remain unseen and no kills!), Panther (no alarms and stealthy kills) and Assault (just shoot at everything in your sight). If you want to have that original Splinter Cell feel, you definitely should go for Ghost, as it is the most fun (Panther too, but it feels too easy) and I think also most rewarding gamestyle.+ you can do a lot of sidemissions and you're still able to do a lot of stuff after the quite short main campaign (around 8-10 hours, depending on how your playstyle is)+ a lot of different weapons and gadgets.+ the story is quite alright, although nothing really extraordinary. But it does keep up the tension (although you might already know how it ends anyway)+ the maps/levels are quite cool, also because not everything is during night. The neutral :~ it has a coop mode! (Note: I didn't really play it, so I won't judge it as positive or negative. But there are still people who play it, so go ahead!)~ Uplay. While I'm actually not bothered by it, some people may see this as  negative. I just wanted to mention it, but it doesn't really bother me. A negative point would be that your achievments can only be seen in Uplay, but that's it for me.~ The soundtrack is alright, but nothing outstanding. Does fit to the game.~ Graphics are decent, too. The game is around 2-3 years old, so it should run on most computers. Nothing special, though. The negative :- I'll start with the biggest one: the last bossfight. Oh god, it's so awful. I don't what their aim was for that one, but it is boring, annoying and you don't really know what to do. I think I needed to do it 5-6 times, not because it was difficult but because it's so confusing. As it is the only boss fight, it's forgiveable, but it will be my alltime favorite for worst boss fight of all time. ( I don't want to spoil your *fun*, so that's everything I'll say about it)- cheesy characters and dialogues.The hacker dude really has some cringe-worthy moments and lines (tells a bad joke, nobody laughs, he says ""What?"". Oh god.)  and is such a stereotypical character. Also some dialogues are just too action cliché like. It isn't that bad, but I can't just overlook it .- The main story is quite short, but I think the additional side missions somehow make up for it. Overall impression :I generally recommend this game, as it feels like old splinter cell again (if you're choosing to play ghost!).I wouldn't say that it is a must have because of some minor to major flaws but if you're a fan of the Splinter Cell series and a fan of stealth games, I definitely would say that you should pick it up! Also because it isn't that expensive right now and most importantly it's fun!Gets 80/100.			"

												First up, this requires UPLAY which is an instant negative.Next, the game's starting UI design is very annoying. You start in a windowed mode and get thrown straight into the game, you can't change your controls, video settings until the intro for the tutorial mission plays out and you're in the level. No main menu is given to you to load or adjust settings initially.I've played one sitting and then quit. When I returned to the game, MY PROGRESS WAS NOT SAVED!! I had to restart from the beginning again! There's no load game option... I can't resume to where I left off! WTF!--------------------------------------On the game itself - I've played almost every Splinter Cell game (SC1, Pandora, Chaos Theory, Double Agent, Conviction) obsessively since the franchise began. I was one that hated (ok, disliked) Metal Gear and loved SC's methodical and open approach to stealth, and would play the games over and over, and did Ghosts runs/No disturbing enemies and no alerts.I rented and finished Conviction in 1 day and actually enjoyed it as brainless fun even though it was the least favourite of the series.I had hoped that Blacklist would be the return to SC's former glory.-------------------------------Unfortunately, while Blacklists incorporates stealth elements back into the game... it feels very restricted. The levels are on rails and the enemies perform the same routines over and over.There doesn't seem to be variation in AI pathing and behaviour, everything is scripted in a very linear manner.If you follow specific timings you can automatically get through stealth sections as a routine. It almost feels like a bot could be programmed to run through the levels because of how little randomness there is.The KB + Mouse controls are very awkward and more than once Sam climbed over a car instead of shifting to an adjacent side. This is one of those games where you need a controller, and that's understandable given SC's console origin.All in all - I recommend RENTING this game if you're playing SP. I haven't tried the MP yet so I can't comment on it. If you have a console, go down and rent this from the shop, it's not worth buying IMO.			"

												My review for this latest installment in the Splinter Cell franchise is well overdue! To cut it short: It's an excellent game. It was the first game I played (upon release) that had the enter/exit cover option, and in the beginning I wasn't sure if I liked it, but it definitely grew on me. It allows for superior tactical planning.You definitely have a choice here how you want to handle a mission, and you can tailor your load-out to match. I find that I usually prefer a good medium between stealth (ghost) and silent takedowns (panther). The third option, assault, ultimately turns into chaos and that is not really how a Splinter Cell (by definition an operative who is a silent infiltrator that has the freedom to choose on how to proceed) works. I find that a non-lethal takedown usually works quite well, but there are situations in which pacifying a room permanently, is definitely a good plan (e.g. hostage situations) if safe to do so and if the mission parameters allow for it. There are definitely some targets tht need to be captured alive!During the game you will have the option to upgrade your gear which will also provide you with much better intel while you're deployed, and will give you better abilities to protect yourself. Spending available Uplay points on available suit options is also definitely helpful, if you're pondering that. They're both worth it.Some have complained that the ""execution"" system (you gain up to three points for silent takedowns which you can then use to automatically execute marked targets with a headshot) is making things too easy, but ultimately the truth is that you have to work for that option to become available and it is not an automatic ""recharge"". You will, however, find several weapons crates during a mission that will allow you to restock on ammo and gadgets.If you liked any of the previous Splinter Cell games (and if you like tactical/stealth/military games I can't see why you wouldn't), then this is definitely a recommendation. Get to your next best (online) store and exfil with this game. Mission accomplished.			"

												Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a stealth third-person shooter developed by Ubisoft Toronto and published by Ubisoft. It was released in August 2013. Blacklist is a very good game that excels in freedom of approach in mission in which complements the excellent story. The main protagonist is Sam Fisher and Fisher is one of the main operatives part of the new Fourth Echelon. Blacklist incorporates a new story while expanding and not forgetting events that occurred in the previous game Conviction. This review will discuss the campaign in relation to missions and story, the gameplay and the Paladin, the multiplayer, and the graphics and performance. I did not play the DLC.CampaignBlacklist features a very intense campaign that shifts the dynamic from typical FPS shooters. The Fourth Echelon's motive is to combat The Engineers, who are perpetrators of the Blacklist and these are a bunch of attacks aimed at America with a countdown on each event. Your team lives on a Paladin and uses a Strategic Mission Interface (SMI) and this replaces the traditional menu screen in other FPS games. It features a world map and allows you to coordinate your plans. For instance, you can play campaign missions, side missions, and the multiplayer portion. The SMI is very unique and frankly I love it because it fit right into the context of the story and setting. In saying that, it was frustrating to launch the game to play multiplayer with friends only to be inserted right into the campaign because I was unaware that the SMI was a thing and was the main UI of the game. Upon beginning the game there was already tension attached to the story and a sense of urgency. This is where Blacklist excels at, making sure the prologue kick-starts the story and each mission and the overall story are progressed while never ceasing intensity. Furthermore, Blacklist improves on the storytelling aspect of making Sam's personality shine through his drive on stopping The Engineer and not doing it sorely for his daughter Sarah Fisher because in Conviction all his motives were for her, so it provides a nice change. I highly praise the dialogue because the profound amount of it complements the story. For instance, it's refreshing that after every campaign mission there is new dialogue for all team members, Sam and other personnel. I think the dialogue adds to the characterisation of all characters within the game by creating diversities between each while not forgetting past issues. The game features sixteen refreshing side missions. I love it because there is a total of sixteen missions from four different team members and all have unique objectives, gameplay approaches and add to the overall story. They have good length and while they are not long as the main campaign, they are not short which means they feel significant and not unnecessary. Lastly, the various missions are set in different locations in the world so the feature does not ever feel stale. The campaign overall was excellent but I felt it really missed the jackpot. It's difficult to explain without spoilers but I felt that the game could have had some more time to breathe because the motives of The Engineers were major and certain sequences in the campaign were significant so I think more explanation and more storytelling would have added a ton to the quality of the overall game and story. But, for what was presented, it still was great.GameplayThe game's core component is the Paladin. The Paladin is a plane that is the home of Fourth Echelon and that is where you conduct all briefings for missions and communication with team members. It is very unique because the Paladin is the operations area for the campaign, it includes the SMI, which as stated replaces the traditional menu, and it is involved in a major way that I will not spoil. Furthermore, you can upgrade it using in-game currency that you earn through completing missions and challenges. For instance, you can upgrade the medical bay on the plane to improve your health during missions. In other words, I commend Ubisoft for creating something new to use and I think it worked for them.Blacklist features standard FPS gameplay but moreover expands on the gameplay and combat known to the Splinter Cell series.  It emphasises experiment on how you approach your missions as the majority of missions you can approach with gun-fire and action or proceed with stealth, so it expands on the Splinter Cell concept in being secretive in your movements and actions but has enough leeway that certain missions do not penalise you for shooting people without stealth. I believe the overall gameplay quality feels more fresh and fluid and is a clear upgrade from Conviction.MultiplayerI enjoyed the classic multiplayer mode of Spies vs. Mercs. It features 4v4 games with different maps. Each map had varied objectives as one map would have the attacking team find positions and plant bombs while the defenders had to defuse them or, the attacking team would have to hack certain positions and get data while the defenders had to stop them. So this mode is fun as there were diverse objectives on varied maps and the servers do have a niche fan base. I found the matches to be rewarding by the end but at the same time, frustrating if on the losing end.With positives comes its negatives and the multiplayer had some serious and unfixed issues. For one, you cannot leave a multiplayer match, enough said. Secondly, I hated the spawn positioning because there was frequent spawn killing and frequent enemy players spawning right next to some of the objectives. Lastly, online players have very high sensitivity, particularly among walls, because I found a lot of the time I was sprinting I would latch onto walls instead of sprinting and potentially killing an enemy.  So, I found the gameplay portion of online to be sloppy.Performance/GraphicsI played the game on high settings with v-sync off. I obtained mostly a 50-60 FPS window making for mostly smooth gameplay. With these settings, the graphics were good and there were some nice textures and colours, but for the most part they feel dated. My screenshot showcase has some screenshots of within the game and its settings. NegativesI was extremely annoyed at the game starting in windowed mode on every launch and also the game reverting to windowed mode whenever I alt-tabbed. I also encountered some bugs in the campaign and multiplayer but the main source of in-game issues was with the coop/side missions component which in some missions was mostly unstable and buggy. Other than these negatives, the other negatives I encountered were mentioned above.OverallSplinter Cell: Blacklist is a very strong game that is a true sequel to Conviction. It triumphs in a well-thought out and intense story. It incorporates side missions that add to the game rather than negate from the overall experience. It has compelling characters that are likeable and does not omit their past issues. And, I praise Ubisoft for creativity in regards to the Paladin and the SMI being the main interface. I played 26 hours of Blacklist and the majority was spent in single player, which exceeded my expectations, but the multiplayer hurt my overall score of the game. Regardless, I loved this so I highly recommend this game.RatingsRatings are calculated by adding up each discussed component and averaging them. Then, I take out or add points to the overall score depending on the severity of issues or negatives with the game.Campaign: 9.5/10Gameplay: 9.5/10Multiplayer: 7/10Performance/Graphics: 8.5/10Overall: 8.75/10Thanks for reading my review!

												Splinter Cell:Blacklist is a perfect example of how Ubisoft developers have perfected the 'sneak and peak spy genre' but fail to focus on the things that make Splinter Cell a great series.Splinter Cell: Blacklist is confused about what it wants to be. On the cover it is a spy-themed game about infiltration and the gathering of intelligence, but on the inside it wants to be a game about shooting people and blowing things up - which I dont think it does particularlly well. I enjoy the campaign missions and I have found that the storyline isn't half bad, but the majority of side missions, known as '4E'  are repeditive, lack creativity, and generally go against what the game series is good at. For example, the objective of most 4E missions to kill everyone - some missions are just a seemingly endless wave of enemy fighters that you have to kill. Once again, a franchise is ruined by developers who tailor their games to the twitch shooter crowd. You took Ghost Recon and now you've taken Splinter Cell.			"

												Tom Clancy's games are amazing and if you never played one of them, you are missing ALOT. He has alot of Game series like:-Rainbow Six series-Splinter Cell series-Ghost Recon seriesand more...Since this is in Splinter Cell series, I would say this is one of the best games of Splinter Cell series [writting in 20 of March, 2015]Maybe my computer is not the best and can't handle the game very well, but I am enjoying it because I am playing with my friends, or just enjoying how they made the game.Singleplayer and Multiplayer are very nice, no delays, very good.Oh yeah, forgot... In Singleplayer and/or Multiplayer, sometimes it happens that bodies of Enemies/NPCs Breakdance on ground when killed x'D. And sometimes it happens, that when you kill someone, he continues standing in the position that you killed him [for example, if he is standing and shooting at you, and then you kill him, he will continue standing, but he is actually dead... just standing .. lol]Doe, there is nothing much more to say, this is an awesome game, one of the best Stealth/Action games made... atleast for me... Buy this if you have a chance, or on discount! :)Rate: 30/10			"

												UPLAY is like malware. Do you realise that the pirated versions of this game cause players less hassel because uplay isn't involved? What is the message you're trying to put out? I already regret buying this game because of uplay but the developers really deserve my money. I LOVE the game. HATE uplay.			"

												Splinter Cell has been a series I can remember starting. I played the very first one on the original Xbox with my step sister and have then played every continuing title. Of course this brings me to the newest one, Splinter Cell Blacklist. Blacklist is a spy, thriller, and action game all in one. One of the most iconic things about the series is the protagonist himself, Sam Fisher. Fisher has one of the most recognized voices in gaming, however in this iteration they used a different voice actor (I'm not entirely sure why). Though, I think the new voice actor portrays Fisher very well. He still embodies Fisher in character and spirit.The premise of the game isn't anything new, the generic ""Terrorists are attacking us, we need to figure out why and stop them."" However, I think this story arc is an interesting one as it takes place in a variety of locations that all have a unique feel to them. Gameplay wise, it feels just like Splinter Cell has always felt. You've got your stealth mechanics that require patience, skill, and wits. While stealth has always been the preferred method, they've included ways that allow you to be a ruthless killer in the shadows along with going on an all out assault. There are a ton of weapons you can use and that are customizable with scopes, attachments, and ammo types. Gadgets play a big role, maybe even bigger than the previous games it feels. There are several that are also customizable. Sticky cams, noise makers, and tricopters let you take different approaches to a level. Want to scope out ahead and mark or even neutralize the enemies? Fly that tricopter in and use the sticky shock shooter it has attached. Need to lure a few guards away to make a quick escape? Throw a noise maker in the opposite direction. The ways you can utilize these gadgets is endless. Though, the problem that stems with this is that sometimes it makes the levels feel too easy. Once you unlock the sonar goggles (I think there are a few more levels past that but I didn't bother), you pretty much have it easy from there on. Being able to see the enemies through walls allows you to anticipate them easier, there's even one that tracks footsteps I believe.Back to the level design, I'd say it's fairly well done. For the most part the levels are pretty straight forward (not linear per se). You go from point A to point B to complete your objective. There are different paths you can take inbetween that allows you to mix things up and still not feel too linear. When you explore and find that one spot, you'll usually come out with an advantage. These paths can make things easier when you're aiming for a no kill approach to the game, which frankly makes the game way harder than it needs to be (there is a professional mode as well, will go through on a second playthrough to do that). The game takes a good while to go through, my play through was about 15 hours and then I did a few of the side missions. I also ended up taking my time, making sure I could memorize the enemy patterns and when my best oppurtunity was. I think the pacing is pretty good. I wouldn't complain that it's too short because I wanted to keep playing so it was nice when I wasn't able to anticipate when it would end right away.There's also a multiplayer where it's Spy vs. Merc, but I haven't played that, I wasn't too interested. I believe all of the missions allow a co-op option which sounds like a lot of fun. Some paths are geared towards having another teammate like an extra high ledge you'd only be able to reach with one. If you have a friend, I'd say give it a go and play through it coop, it'd be a lot of fun.So all in all, I would recommend this to anyone who has played and enjoyed the previous Splinter Cell games and anyone who enjoys stealth and being a spy. I wouldn't say it's the best in the series, (Chaos Theory holds that spot) but it's one of the better ones. It's graphically amazing, gameplay stays true to the series, and a fairly decent story.

												Ubisoft presents Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Black List by Tom Clancy published by Ubisoft and played by me is pretty cool I guess. As some people may know, I am a big fan of the Splinter Cell series, being dragged into it back in 2005 with Chaos Theory. But being a fan of a series owned by Ubisoft is like having your lover fart in your mouth. Yo that is foul as ♥♥♥♥. After the mediocre Splinter Cell: Conviction, Ubisoft Montreal decided to stop being like the stuff I find in the back of my box, and actually try and make a Splinter Cell game. The problem with this is, they still need to meet publisher quotas, or atleast that's what I've been told.You once again play as Sam Fisher, but now he sounds like he could be my big brother instead of my actual dad. The game revolves around a terrorist cell known as the Blacklist who commit to attacks every week the United States doesn't pull it's troops out of every country in the world and send them back to America. We, of course, cannot have this, so instead the president lady has Fourth Echelon (That's one more than Third Echelon) go on a mission across the world to hunt down Blacklist and it's leaders and be home in time for apple pie. The gameplay works, it's like they wanted to make Chaos Theory again but had to use Conviction elements. Now you can go in non-lethally like the older games pre-Conviction, and you aren't put into set-piece like arenas where you have to end the lives of everyone who came into work that day. The game's levels, while not as open and expertly crafted as prior games, give you enough freedom so that you aren't bogged down by memorizing enemy patrol patterns to get past them unnoticed. It cuts down on the frustration and stop me from resorting to abusive alcoholism.  You get money after each mission that you can use to buy new stuff, such as suits, or guns, or gadgets, or a girlfriend. And if you're lacking money for that new hug pillow with Rise-Chan on it, you can always go on sidequests that you can bring that one friend you actually have along with you. Which is neat so when I eventually do mess up, I can blame on them instead. Good job, Mark.  Although these missions have less of a variety as the story missions, they still manage to be open and free enough that you can go about it your own way instead of having to follow a beaten path, which means you have time to get that wedgie out of your crack because your OP suit is riding up like it's asking you to prom. If you're returning to the series, you'll notice some noticable differences in the characterization. Sam is nowhere near as snarky or as comedic as he was in previous installments and since Lambert died in Double Agent  most of the charm of hearing two friends screw around has really hurt both the tone and the likability of the lore and the story. Michael Ironside is gone and replaced with a guy who I didn't bother to remember, who makes Sam sound like he's a fresh young member of the agency rather than a grizzled old veteran. The change in tone from Conviction onward has honestly hurt the series, further proving that Conviction is like that other guy that lives beside your box but insists on spooning with you because ""We have to stick together."" If having feel-good fun time with your friends doesn't tickle your pickle gay, you can always go online in the Spies vs Mercs mode. In this game mode you play as either Paul Blart mall cop in first person or Frankie Muniz from those Agent Cody Banks movies in third person. So what you have are Mercs in defense, where you move around and♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants because a spy could be around any corner ready to steal the colonel's secret recipe from you. Or you play as a spy while you move around and♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants because a merc can come around any corner and fill you without enough holes that it's both a war crime and a sex crime. Dirty. While not being as pulse pounding as Chaos theory's or Pandora's Tomorrow's multiplayer, it's still a rather fun diversion and may keep you around if you enjoy both competitive and stealth gameplay. Don't expect anything revolutionary, though. They're video game developers, not miracle workers. But should you play Splinter Cell: Bar Bouncer front gate? It's fun. Not 30 Canadian Funbux fun, but you'll get some enjoyment out of it. It's certainly better than the fifth game in the series, but nowhere near as good as the second or third. Splinter Cell:White chart gets seven Oscar Mike's out of a possible ten Tango Downs. Megamouth sharks are so rare that there have only been 63 sightings in record history. The curator has reached 101 members. I'd like to thank my publisher, my manager, and the cafe owner across the street I've repeatedly  called ""mom"". http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curationoh yeah, and this game uses Uplay. So if you're not okay with Ubisoft talking loudly and spitting bits of chewed food in your face, proceed with caution.			"

												     A 3rd person stealth & action game that will keep you busy for some time. Very challenging, superb graphics, and great sound design. There are hundreds of ways to solve an objective the choice is up to you. Many upgrades are available for your base of operations and gear. The game also has coop missions and pvp matches. Splinter Cell is a great series and Black List is one of the best. It's a great game and one that i revisit time and time again.Pros:-Outstanding level design-Great graphics-Very challenging-Lots of missionsCons:-Controls can be a bit tough to get used to at first-Enemy A.I is hit and miss "

												After reading reviews saying that this was the second best SC game behind the truly brilliant Chaos Theory, I had high hopes that were ultimately smashed. Blacklist is a horrible amalgamation between Conviction's enjoyable-but-misplaced action gameplay, and Chaos Theory's truly inspired stealth. What you get are rather linear levels that have two or three multiple paths (with all of the logical stealthy ways locked out for co-op only), AI with x-ray vision who discover hidden bodies in bins and through walls, enemies who know your exact location after just one shot, and truly terrible gunplay with bullet deviation (not recoil) and questionable hit boxes. I have had a fully upgraded pistol with a laser sight aimed right on an enemies head in ""zoomed in/accuracy"" mode from a few metres away, and had the bullet embed itself in the wall above him, causing him to be instantly aware of exactly where I am. I've had bullets pass straight through the head of a well lined up headshot, again from close range. Ubisoft have also decided to limit the range on weapons to incredibly short distances, with pistol being effective at distances up to around 5-10 metres, and rifles up to around 20-30. This is incredibly jarring and removes any possibility of picking off enemies quietly from the distance. There is a sniper rifle in game, but I could not bear the game long enough to buy and try it. They also limit some missions to co-op only. This should be an appealing and tempting option to experience the game, not a way of punishing solo players or those (like me) who have picked it up on sale a few months after release.I am unsure if this is simply a poor port, which is possible with Ubisoft, but the game feels clunky with incredibly poor gunplay. Fundamentally there is the basis of a good game with lots of gear and weapon customisation, replayable levels, a wave-survival mode, and in-game challenges. However this is ruined by very poor gunplay (on a level of Alpha Protocol terrible), hit and miss AI who inexplicably see bodies through walls and are able to pinpoint your exact location after a misplaced shot, which is more often than not caused by the terrible gun mechanics. I really want to enjoy this game as I loved the SC games of old, but this is just a slapdash game that tries to please both the stealth and action fans, failing miserably on both fronts, whilst alienating those who play solo by cutting off a lot of map routes.4/10 - not even worth a sale buy. Pick up Chaos Theory and enjoy SC the way it is meant to be played.			"

												tldr:7.5/10 - Blacklist is definitely one of the good projects Ubisoft has had in the past few years. An interesting take on a 3rd person stealth-action game which should please both Splinter cell newcomers and veterans. too long part:GENERAL GAMEPLAY - 8/10As a SC veteran, I gotta say things changed a huge deal since Chaos Theory but I really enjoyed basically everything this title has to offer gameplay-wise. Controls feel pretty smooth and natural after a short while and the infamous Assassins Creeds ""press this button to either live or jump off a cliff"" syndrome is not showing its presence as much. AI difficulty settings offer an adequate challenge for everyone, while the games arcade side keeps you fairly rewarded for everything you're trying to achieve. No matter which mode you are playing, every little step forward feels good.Some people find the economy of unlocking stuff rather questionable but it's definitely not a reason to make you stop playing the game.SINGLE PLAYER - 7/10If you've never played a Splinter Cell game before, it's not a problem - there are no essential references to earlier games which allows anyone to embark on this Jack Bauer's ""24-style"" storyline with decent actors and moderately catchy story (pro-american as hell but you can't avoid that these days it seems). The game attempts to go rather back to its roots while still trying to maintain the action-hungry audience and does a very decent job at that. You can play the game the way you want and that is awesome.COOP - 7.5/10As far as the coop campaign goes, unless you have a friend to play with, the odds of matchmaing giving you a guy on the same note as you are pretty slim. There is also a nice horde mode which is good for farming money and practicing your abilities. Both modes are a lot of fun and youll most likely play each map and mission more than once. Important note is that your cash is shared in both COOP and MULTIPLAYER which is awesome and it lets new players get into the game more easily.MULTIPLAYER - 6/10Basic matchup is 1st person heavy armed mercs VS 3rd person agile spies. Modes with mixed teams and lot of variation are available. Some maps seem imba one way or another but since its not competitive, nobody really cares. Latency is a ♥♥♥♥♥ here. Due to the hand-to-hand combat system which requires a really fast response rate youll be suffering more than in most other action games. Skill and time invested really pays off here as your♥♥♥♥♥is gonna be kicked hard by higher level players, which leads me to another good point - NO LOGICAL TEAMBALANCE. The game is gonna stack the highest level players in one team and dump the rest in the other. You might as well leave before the match starts.There is NO LEGIT OPTION TO QUIT while your match is in progress which is incredibly F'n stupid.			"

Blacklist is easily the second best iteration of the Splinter Cell series, right after Chaos Theory. The execution system returns, but, unlike in Conviction, pure stealth remains a viable option throughout the game. The game makes concessions to modernity with two unwelcome additions: grinding money to buy equipment (although this can be considered an improvement on Conviction, as you no longer have to grind unrealistic PEC challenges to upgrade your gear) and easy-mode DLC, which gives you access to unique medium-tier gear from the start. Thankfully, the portable EMP does not return in Blacklist, which means you can no longer rely on it to instantly stun everyone around you whenever you get detected. Despite these problems, Blacklist features fun, thoughtful gameplay and a large variety of missions, as well as the ability to seamlessly replay any mission you choose from the game's hub. The ability to team up with friends for side-missions, which are playable in single-player, helps bridge the gap between solo campaign and co-op; although there is a dedicated co-op mini-campaign. which features elements that simply would not be possible with missions designed to be playable alone or with a partner. The game feels and controls like it was developed for PC rather than being lazily ported, which is fantastic.If you've been burned by Conviction, Splinter Cell: Blacklist will restore your faith in the series.

												So it's not Chaos Theory, it's not Conviction. It's an even-numbered Splinter Cell game that doesn't suck - is that not amazing enough?Featurring the redefined stealth/action mechanics in Conviction (mark & execute, faster movement, better interaction with objects to hide behind), and the tried and tested mechanics from Chaos Theory (the knife - cut through tents again, interrogation, optional slow pace and the return of the ""flaring"" equipment to signal zero visibility), this new entry adds a system of evaluating your performance under the usual alarms and detections, but refines this by scoring how you approach these detections (or how good you are if you're not detected at all).The Ghost score (stealth, no fatality) rewards the player for knockouts, non-lethal takedowns, or no detection at all  - a must for the purists. The Panther style (stealth, no alarms, lethal - can be detected, but no alarms raised) rewards those who like to kill and disappear, or who kill upon detection before an alarm is triggered, even counting bodies found. The Assault (alarms, detections, kills while in high alert) rewards those who prefer the Desert Eagle over the silenced pistol, and prefer to use stealthy approaches such as shotguns, grenades and explosions. Of course, points are given, rewards appear based on this (such as armour or tools), and allow you to level up to the ultimate agent in your own style.Each level features multiple paths and approaches to tailor the game to the player's chosen style, and allows for exploration without feeling too linear (it's a stealth game with plot-based directives, we can't all worship phantom pain and expect open-world) or constricted.The storyline continues the plot from Conviction (in a way), and pales in comparison, but keeps the player entertained enough to want to achieve goals.Visually, this game is amazing, the assets shine bright and loud, but don't cost like some games - the people in this team truly achieved some amazing work under the optimisation stage (Conviction stutters at 720 on my machine on medium, this runs just under ultra at 1080).Overall, a very well-oiled machine, with plenty of levels, plenty of routes and goals to keep the player re-trying again and again to reach perfection. One quibble though - The quadcopter was a complete waste of time. Far too gadget-loving, and cripples the difficulty in some places; avoid for true fun except where mandatory.Great fun, and welcome to most SC fans, if a little underwhelming and possibly preachy with story.

												Got this game as a gift from a friend with the intention of only playing the coop missions and the online multiplayer. After spending about an hour figuring out how to navigate the terrible menus and resolve the ""connection failed"" issues (forwarding ports, turning off firewall, disabling programs on startup) we finally got into a multiplayer lobby together and played a couple games, and they were pretty fun.Fast forward to the next day, we go to play another game and we run into more similar issues when trying to connect to each other's lobbies. After reading on the forum that this is an extremely common problem that Ubisoft doesn't seem interested in resolving, we decided to refund. I've played a ridiculous amount of online multiplayer games, so when your multi million dollar game studio can't develop a working multiplayer system without a slew of extremely difficult to resolve connection issues, you lose all respect from me.

Ubisoft doesnt have the best support, but I'm not stupid and was able to trouble shoot every problem without contacting them. Even with 170+ hours I will be returning to this game to make sure my steath skills dont get too rusty for the next Splinter Cell game, which was confirmed to be in development			"

												Compared to Conviction, Blacklist is very good! It really feels like an AAA game, voice acting, graphics, story etc. Only thing I hate is the requirement for multiplayer on extra missions (Can't find randoms, this isn't mmorpg) You are given three styles, Ghost = Stealth non-lethal. Short range and somewhat slowPanther = Stealth-lethal and long range.Call of duty style = KILL EM ALL WITH GUNS, F*** STEALTH, THROW GRENADES, SEND EM FLYINGIt's much different from Chaos Theory now so it's a much more fast paced stealth game (No more environment sound levels, just noisy and silent). The greatest thing about this is that there's so much way you can eliminate your enemies now so being creative comes in play. The bad thing is that your gadgets aren't as useful anymore. All you need is your gun or crossbow and see through gogglesOverall 8/10			"

												I don't get why so much hate on this game just because of Uplay, I've played it perfectly fine and Co-op is a blast! All you have to do is just connect to uplay to play the game, thats all. Nonetheless the story is okay and it has co-op in some of the story campaign. Whether you want to play it yourself or with your friend. The game uses slight micro-transactions, but that doesn't affect the game since you can use your money earned from any finished missions. You can also earned money by shooting the security camera or take out lights which is kinda cool I guess. The gameplay is solid to the original Splinter Cell and no doubt this game is worth your money. If you want a third-person stealth game then this is for you. I can't recommend enough			"

												Blacklist feels like a combination of Conviction and the older Splinter Cell titles. It plays like Conviction, but now you can avoid enemies and do non-lethal takedowns like in Double Agent and previous titles. The story is pretty interesting, and the graphics are good. I didn't have any problems with Uplay, so I guess I'm lucky.What's disappointing is that Michael Ironside is no longer the voice of Sam Fisher in here, and he's replaced by a much younger actor instead. It's kinda weird to see Sam getting older but his voice and movements are actually getting younger.Still, better than Conviction, though.			"

												I'm an old skool Splinter Cell fan. I've played all the games and I consider Chaos Theory to be the best. With Conviction Ubisoft turned a hard-core stealth series into a generic action/adventure game, good, but not Splinter Cell as we knew it. With Blacklist Ubisoft have tried to please both the hard-core Stealth fan and the casual action/adventure/3rd person shooter fan at the same time and in my opinion failed at both. As a stealth experience the game is sorely lacking when held up against ""The Trilogy"" (Splinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow, Chaos Theory) Everything has been dumbed down; the game plays more like a trial-and-error kind of experience - Try a section, fail, try something else, fail, try again, fail, rinse, repeat. The old games rewarded patience, and planning, the new ones feel like they were made by someone that doesn't understand the genre. Sam no longer acts, sounds, or feels like sam anymore. As a long time fan this series this game has angered me more than it has disappointed me. Avoid! 0/10			"

												Now that is what Conviction should've been! Blacklist is A M A Z I N G, it's true to the roots, it's innovative and manages to keep the perfect balance between being a ghost and being aggressive. It doesn't force you to be either stealthy or aggressive but it rewards stealth a lot more and provides a lot of ways to avoid confrontations. Brilliant missions(story, side and coop), fantastic design, addictive gameplay. New voice actor for Sam Fisher did a phenomenal job and I never really felt like ""it's not the same Sam..."". EASILY 10/10			"

												The latest in the Splinter Cell series, where you play the perennial NSA ninja, Sam Fisher.This is the first time in the series that the voice is not provided by Michael Ironside, which is s shame, but doesn't detract from the game overall. Also,Sam Fisher seems to have grown younger by a  decade, and also now looks like Doplh Lundgren.One of the new game mechanics is a broadening of play styles, allowing CoD type players to run and gun, whilst allowing the ninja gamers to sneak through a mission. It's a good idea, and opens up the variety of approaches for redoing missions.However, let's be clear here, this is less hardcore Splinter Cell source gameplay and more CoD with sneaking, and I suspect this is to cater for the ADHD twitch gamers, who do not have the patience to watch an enemy patrol pattern for five minutes.Single PlayerThe campaign sets a scenario where a rogue MI6 agent is conducting a major offensive against US assests. Your goal is to foil these attacks before each event counts down.The campaign missions, in true geo-political style, aspan across the globe, and in true Splinter Cell style, almost every high security facility in the world is run by demon accountants, who demand the greatest savings in lighting, giving plenty of shadows to hide in. Naturally, if they modelled them on real life facilities, the entire area would be bathed in incandescent lighting, and Sam Fisher would be shot dead before he reached the first climable ledge. However, moving on..Spoiler alert One thing that was never clarified was Sadiqs motivation for wanting to kill the US presidency and Congress, and to be honest, he could have achieved the same aim much easier than the menu of demands provided over a week. He just was presented as eponymous bad guy, with no strong motivation for his actions Side MissionsThis time you have a team under your command. These team members are essentially quest givers, with different play styles.Grim is strictly Ghost style. Any alerts and the missions is over.Kobin is Panther/Ghost. Kill/subdue all enemies on the map. Reinforcements get called in if you are spotted.Charlie is wave based. Kill/subdue all enemies in each wave. Can extract after wave 5 for completion. 20 waves total.Briggs is co-op story missions. These side missions, along with the main missions will net you money, and can be farmed to get more money, as well as to perfect a play style.Why do you need money ? Well, you can upgrade both your plane, gear and weapons, all of which is highly recommended.In additon to the side missions, there are daily and weekly challenges  and Gone Dark missions which are lightweight investigation missions.MutiplayerThe game was released in mid 2013, and as a result the gaming herd has mostly moved onto other games. There is still a lot of fun to be had in completing coop missions, and if you want to explore that side of the game fully, I'd recommend getting some of your mates to buy the game as well. Most of the players appear to be US  based, so there is some lag and time differences to take into account, and that brings me onto the lobby system.It is very much in the CoD interface style of 'hide everything from the player'. Seach for players, and if no one is around, you are given the opportunity to start a lobby for players.Other than that, the lobby is very basic, so no setting max ping or region based gaming. Furthermore, there is no way to text chat in the lobby - has to be via microphone.In game, you can both voice and text chat, but there is no history view, often is obscured by a game alert banner and when you are incapacitated, it is removed all together, which completely bemuses me.The games' origin from a console is obvious, especially when you are trying to complete an action - many of the action triggers use the same button, so you will have situations where you want to open a window, and he flicks off the light switch.  Just for fun, many of the actions are closely grouped together, so when you are trying to move quickly, you get a Benny Hill scenario where Sam Fisher will leap over a fence, leap back, jump up onto a ledge, jump through the unopened window - shattering the glass. All you want to do was switch off the bloody light.In one co-op game, my partner was downed, and I had to race to him to resusitate him, leaping over obstacles and dashing forth with courage and valour, under fire.Well, that was the intention. Closely grouped actions, panicked button pressing and lag all conspired against me, so rather than a heroic rescue, it appeared my character had suddenly decided now was a perfect opportunity to demonstrate a bracing set of gymnastics, all whilst my partner rapidly bled to death.Unimpressed, he disconnected shortly after.Adding to the action hilarity, is that fact the developers have bound some contextual actions to key combinations - but then failed to document them anywhere.For instance, you are running up to a door, pressing (Shift + W). Once you arrive at the door, rather than stopping to allow you peek under it, Sam will instead kick it in, despite the action for Door Bash is bound to (F). Of course, kicking the door in alerts every ♥♥♥♥ing guard in the area, and may well terminate your mission. The average PC keyboard has 104 keys, and yet Ubisoft have only utilised 2 for action keys.♥♥♥♥♥♥poor effort.There is a lot to like about this game, but there are so many bugs in this game, I could fill several reviews with the bugs found in gameplay. Most of these issues stem from Ubisofts general disdain for PC gamers, catering to the console market first, and as this is a business policy, highly likely we are going to see the same style of issues in other PC games.There are also some questionable design decisions (such as, you can't press Esc to skip through the logo loading screen, but once it has loaded, Esc dumps you out of the game with no confirmation; evidently a very clear decision from Ubisoft to say ♥♥♥♥ You)In summary, it is a good game, and a lot of fun to play. Given it's age, it can be picked up cheap from a number of outlets, along with the DLC. so, if you can see past the game bugs, it will provide you with a lot of entertainment (and frustration) and is a blast in Co-op.

												(((EDIT: This is a negative review that reflects less on the game itself, and more on the platform and game launchers. If you're looking for a review of the _game,_ keep looking.)))Thanks to Ubisoft, my ten dollars is gone forever.I bought the game this weekend, during the sale, thinking it was going to be a pick-up and play experience. Upon launching the game, it politely informed me that I needed to launch the game through Uplay, and that I needed to create a Uplay account to play it. I complied with their requests, signed into my account, entered my activation code, and launched the game(let's ignore the irony of playing a game through _two_ launchers).The game crashed immediately. I tried restarting the game, it crashed again. Didn't even get to the loading screen. I figured ""Hey, benefit of the doubt, maybe Uplay is a bit buggy. I'll try restarting it."" So I exited out of Uplay and relaunched it through steam.Upon relaunch, it informed me that I needed to sign in again, despite clicking on the ""remember me"" box upon my initial sign-in. I tried signing in again, but it told me that my password was incorrect. Let me interject here and tell you that by this point, I had been trying to play this game for only about 5 minutes, there's no way I forgot my password in that time.Nevertheless, I decided to restart my password. This didn't go over well, because the Captcha system they use is broken and will only let me use it if I use the audio version, which I only learned after a few minutes of frustratingly retyping the numbers on screen several times.When I finally got it to work, it informed me that there wasn't an account associated with that email. That's garbage, because I was looking at the inbox of said email address, and viewing the email they sent me upon creating the account. I even made sure the email in the box was the same as the email I was looking at, double checked the spelling, everything.The best part is, since I activated the code, I can't use that if I tried making another account. Quite frankly, that code is GONE FOREVER, activated on an account that flickered in and out of existence within a few minutes. So thanks for stealing my money, Ubisoft. Don't expect me to buy any more of your games from here on out, hope you use my ten dollars to buy yourself something reeeeally special. Like another Assasins Creed sequel that nobody wants.Avoid this game on this platform like the plague.			"

												I'm a huge fan of stealth games, and the fact that this game actually rewards you a little more for being a ""Ghost"" is something I like.My biggest problems with this game is:......The thing I don't like about this game and games like it is the fact that it won't alow me to save at my own descresion. That means that, I can get all the way through one of it's mission sections and nearly be completed, then wind up having to start that whole section over again if I get caught or killed before completeing the last faze of the mission! That really pisses me off!Then, on top of that. if a mission has two parts to it, and I'm nearly through with both parts, with just a few ment left or one more objective to complete and for some reason, I have to leave the game completely, I wind up having to redo BOTH parts of the mission! Again, that really pisses me off!I've had to play one (two part) mission over 3 times because because each part of the mission is so long that I've been unable to complete it within a reasonalble time frame before getting tired hand having to step away from the computer. Then, I wind up having to shut down the computer for the night because it's too late to continue by the time I can get back to it. So, when I do finally get back to it and relaunch the game, I have to start that mission from the very beginning! It won't even let me pick up at the last completed part of the mission!I personally might not have perchased it if I had known about this agrivating restriction!For those that aren't anoyed by this irritating console saving restriction, you will most likely really enjoy this game.<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>This is a further review that my friend Aliona did in english for us.A Reviewi of Splinter Cell BlacklistWritten by my friend Aliona(English translation by Aliona)„Waiting for a light that never comes... “Linkin Park  (Nice music video)

In a few words: Splinter Cell Blacklist is a game I was looking forward to in fear that Ubisoft produces the second version of SC Conviction (there were many predictions). However, fortunately, that disappointment has passed me.More details:Nice graphic, stealth possibilities in all missions, various play-options, co-op, multiplayer – the biggest Splinter Cell yet.I found successful the mixture of attributes of the previous Splinter Cell parts.The main mission of the game is linear but many additional tasks, which you can complete optionally, already give you an impression of ""open world"".Ubisoft has not spared on locations: they are various and interesting.I also have to note that this is the first SC game, which you could play through without killing, of course, getting some extra points.I liked the map quizzes “Gone Dark” and the gear menu, although I had to explore it properly for a while.I also found the soundtrack interesting. I cannot imagine anybody would enjoy it outside the game (not to compare with the brilliant achievement of Michael McCann in “Double Agent”) but the music fits good in the situations increasing a little bit adrenaline in blood.Real perfectionists will surely like a new possibility to improve constantly their achievements in every completed task without finishing campaign mission. They will get more and more money for those walkthroughs but more points only in case of breaking their own record.In SC Blacklist you will get the points not only for successfully finished missions and achievements but for SPEED too. Anyway, I should warn player who will try to get achievements in the game: there is simply no logic in getting such of them as “ghost” and “undetected” in some missions. Sometimes you will have to invest a lot of time in your own experience or use spoilers.Here are my video-examples: Sam was detected right at the beginning of the Airstrip mission. The “undetected” achievement missed but in the mission results, you could see „ghost” nonetheless:Airstriphttp://steam://openurl/http:/steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=283968305Other way in the “Hacker’s Den” mission: I got “undetected” and “non-lethal” achievements but no „ghost”.Hacker’s Denhttp://steam://openurl/http:/steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=283595939Now about some other shortcomings:First, I found the saving options extremely irritating. SC fans surely remember that the saving menu was available last time in “Double Agent”. SC Conviction already disappointed with its auto saves. At least, they were reliable.Auto saves are working in the current game too but in some missions although in-between saves were fixed they disappear when you interrupt the game at that point, and you have to return to the beginning of the mission after the next boot.It concerns all Kobin’s missions: they consist of two parts with in-between saves. When you fail to complete them in “one sitting”, you have to start the missions from the beginning next time.There are also some temporary saves in Charlie’s missions too but you get the first “fixed” save only survived after 10 attack waves.The invaluable advice “do not switch off the power when this icon (saving) is displayed” sounds more sneeringly.Anyway, I recommend copying of saves after every session because Uplay could meanly remove them all during its next “synchronization”: that problem is still relevant. You could also deactivate synchronization in Uplay options.Game controls came mainly from SC Conviction, but some extensions were not finalized and unfortunately, the last patch could not really help. For example, the replacement of the ""E"" key on the “space” in some places has not solved the problem, and readdressed it elsewhere. I just mean that to fix on the same “space” key three functions (Use / Jump / Climb) is not a good idea.I found the hackneyed story about ""terrorist threat"" not particularly real and inventive. I think we have to attribute this to the lack of imagination of old and seriously ill Tom Clancy (R.I.P.)In general, I can only recommend this game to all fans of Splinter Cell, stealth and action. You will not regret – it is a truly wonderful adventure!			"

Hi all^^ From start i will say that i never played before Tom Clancy's franchise. So it's something new for me^^ And this something new suprised me alot. Game really good from stealthable part. Alot of ways to complete mission by stealth. Really interesting, you can just avoid all guards or use some equipments  to kill them in really different ways. Really alot equipments in this game so i wasn't boring with them :) Or you can just quietly run and kill or beat enemies with your butt of the rifle  from behind. In this game exist 3th and 1th field of view but main field of view it's of cource 3th to be honest i didn't play alot multiplayer but i know that exist kind of competition where some guy playing as spy he is a hacker(3th person) and another guy who must to protect pc's merc he is an enforcer(1th person). So if you are real fan of 1th person shooters  this game must interested you too a bit :3 But anyway it's more related for 3th person. I remember in one mission you must play from Briggs and this part in mission only from 1th person. And i can say that from 1th person  more harder than from 3th person especially stealth. Story in this game really cool.It's just all about secret agents epic story , explosions, attacks which you of cource must stop, etcetera. Not alot of jokes in Blacklist but i really like when not alot of jokes in game but alot of them shows up in right  time and right place at least it's better than not funny jokes every  min. In Co-op really great to spend time with friends....it's just something awesome :3 There are missions which you can complete alone in co-op and with friend. You can plan your actions do something interesting together :) I think  this all what i wanted to say.Of cource i recommend this game! Good luck and bye~ P.S.: Sorry my english is really bad :c "

												Sooo, the game itself is amazing, I like the story, the gameplay and graphics, however due to UPlay, the game is unplayable. What does that mean?, it means that the game will not connect online, making coop and multiplayer useless, as well as any DLC that you might have bought, although it says it does, the game will crash exactly every 30 or so minutes (google it) due to several errors that are related to DX11, which is not true, since if you switch to using DX9, it still does the same thing. There are some fixes around that work here and there, and they are aware of the problem (supposedly) but do nothing about it. The achievements you get do not count as actions and are not cosidered through Uplay points. If you try to play the game offline, due to the beauty of Uplay, it won't save, so once you leave, you will have to restart everything again. Oh, and also their tech support is very dissapointing. My reply to the problem, was that because I use a laptop graphics card (NVS 5200M), it is not supported so tough luck, ticket closed. My recommendation, DO NOT BUY.			"

												Let me start off by saying the game itself is an enjoyable mix of stealth and action, other reviews cover this more thoroughly. However, I have been unable to connect to Shadownet (Blacklist's multiplayer service) since I bought this game. I've checked everything on my end; ports, firewalls, virus checkers etc. I've changed routers and that didn't help either. I was even asked to disable the Bitlocker service... Support have been giving me the runaround for months now, insisting that they're looking into it and could I just post my msinfo32 and launcher log again. This and the 50+ page thread about people with the same problem make me think that if you do get this problem, there is NO solution and there never will be since Ubisoft don't care. They'll just keep 'investigating' until you give up. Unfortunately there is no way to tell if you will have this problem before you buy the game. Since this game also has UPlay, my advice is to not buy it or any other game with UPlay because UPlay is terrible, superfluous middle management and their customer support is very unhelpful in the most friendly, 'we understand you're frustrated but suck it' way possible			"

Note: the following review currently covers only the single player portion of the game. It will be updated if I am able to play the coop/multiplayer portions.Splinter Cell: Blacklist is the game the series has always wanted to be.It acts as a culmination of every cool idea the series has ever had, finally finding that middle ground between the hardcore stealth that used to define the series, and the faster, more approachable and dynamic gameplay introduced in Conviction. It still isn’t perfect, as Ubisoft has stubbornly held onto a few of the less severe problems of the franchise, but for all intents and purposes Blacklist is far and away the best entry the series has ever had, which coming from someone who has enjoyed every Splinter Cell game ought to mean something.The biggest problem of past Splinter Cell games up to Conviction was their strict adherence to set paths through levels, which were often difficult to discern and as a result required trial and error to get through. They presented you with a huge assortment of gadgets and tactical moves but rarely allowed you to use them unless they explicitly planned for you to, essentially removing any player choice with how you tackle a mission.Conviction in contrary was the series rebirth, removing many of the extraneous stealth options but introducing levels that were far more open, and allowed a greater amount of freeform play. It transformed the series from one in which you were constantly vulnerable to having you be that danger, hunting down enemies and making your way through areas like a hi-tech ninja.Blacklist as I said before takes the best aspects of both these fairly different experiences and rolls them into a gloriously dynamic bundle of options and an endless supply of ways to make use of them. For once you are no longer punished for playing however you want to play, be it sneaking through levels leaving no trace you were ever there or rolling in guns blazing and allowing no witnesses, and paths and opportunities for every playstyle have been designed into each level, never locking you into one particular way of playing but giving you the choice the take on encounters any way you see fit.Expanded climbing options offer a level of verticality to levels that further extends your tactical abilities, often allowing access to secret paths or surprise takedowns. It made me conscious of the environment and how I could best make use of it, and nearly without fail anytime I looked for a solution it was there waiting for me.I always felt in control playing Blacklist, whether I was hiding from hostiles or taking shots at them, and this freedom makes for an experience that’s extremely empowering and encourages you to try out different approaches. I’ve never replayed a Splinter Cell game, but Blacklist gave me reason to revisit levels and see what I might have missed the first time around and a scoring system that rewarded exploiting every tool in my arsenal. Being able to customize said arsenal further allowed me to tailor my playstyle how I wanted, ranging from which guns and gadgets I used straight down to the color of the LEDs in my goggles. These choices all mattered and I was able to see my abilities increase as I progressed and gained better gear, giving me yet another reason to go back to older missions and see how much I had improved.Unfortunately, much of this doesn’t factor into the 4th Echalon side missions (which also act as the coop mode, though most can be played solo if you want). These smaller supplementary missions tended to lock me into a particular playstyle and in many cases harshly punished me if I attempted to deviate from it as I had been able to the entire campaign. It’s not that these missions aren’t still enjoyable or are particularly poorly designed, but they represent a step back to some of Splinter Cell’s most archaic design principles in a game that takes so many strides to finally distance itself from them. There are a few moments in the campaign when this happens as well,, but thankfully they are generally brief and at least contextually make sense.Context is more important this time around, as Blacklist continues Conviction’s trend of finally giving me a story that I could be bothered to follow. The plot is a fairly standard Clancy terror conspiracy with an outcome of World War 3 proportions, but it’s told in a way that removes the dry, technobabel of past narratives with one that’s far easier to follow and allows for substantially more characterization. Your team at 4th Echalon is comprised of characters with actual personality, with little exchanges you can take part in between missions adding to the subplot of the personal dynamics between such a small, tightly knit team. It has a lot of ground to make up still, but the fact that I wasn’t skipping cutscenes because I actually cared and was interested in what happened is a marked improvement and hopefully will continual to improve as the series goes on.There are still a handful of stubborn rough edges clinging to Blacklist from Splinter Cell’s past, but the overwhelming improvements and intelligent design present kept them from ever being more than a minor nuisance. I’ve loved Splinter Cell since its exception, but this is the first time that I feel almost everything has come together as planned, with smarter level designs, an excellent sense of progression, and the allowance for so many different playstyles that could likely all make up their own games. It’s everything I’ve wanted the series to be and then some, and I'm almost giggy thinking about where it could go now it's gotten to this point.			"

												I picked up this game over 2016's Summer Sale, I had been interested in it for years but never considered actually purchasing it up until then. I jumped into the game and immediately started enjoying it. The game (in my humble opinion) may not have a fantastic story base, really lacking of plot catch-up for newcomers to the series like me, but in spite of that I was able to get used to the controls and mechanics really quickly and before I knew it, I was on 4E's Paladin, getting my loadout set up for my first campaign mission. Since then, I've ghost mastered almost every story mission on perfection, and I've started digging into coop missions, trying them online. I was looking forward to this part of my time in the game, getting to do missions with a coop partner, but I feel that there is a serious lack of multiplayer maps, and that's just for coop. At this point I've found PC coop is almost dead, and I'm sure SvM Multiplayer isn't far behind. The few times I've been able to perform coop missions with other people have been quite fun, though. It takes real skill and cooperation to commit to completing a mission through a certain playstyle without screwing up. Overall, despite the issues this game has, I really enjoyed it overall, I hope to invest more time into perfecting each mission and seeing everything the game has to offer. Please pick it up if you have the motivation (and money) to do so, It's a stealth game that lots of people can enjoy.			"

												Great game, ruined by Uplay.New Sam Fisher is kind of a♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I don't like those changes, but as far as gameplay goes, they hit a sweet spot between stealth on early splinter cells, and not taking 5 mins to cross a pipe, sacraficing some (a great deal of) realism for improved gameplay. It's a very well done game, and I WISH it was just listed on steam like a normal game.But it's not. You have to deal with UPLAY. Ubisoft INSISTS on making players go through this poorly-coded middleman, like they think they have their own Steam or something. Even after plenty of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off players ranting on forums, they still push out games with it. Well I will add to those rants that fall on deaf ears. If UPLAY breaks, you can't play your game, and uplay breaks, a lot. Uplay is also required for multiplayer, but is very picky on what internet connections it likes and will work with. Basically, if you want to play this game's great multiplayer, forget about it. Which is a damn shame because its a great multiplayer the few times it works. Phenominal coop, but you can't play it when UPLAY says ♥♥♥♥ you.They recently reduced the invasiveness of UPLAY which was a nice touch, but at the end of the day, if it breaks, you can't play your game. so might as well not have it. It's truly pathetic and I can't recommend this game because of how poorly it is implemented. Ubisoft, if you read this, just give up and remove UPLAY. I will not buy another Ubisoft game until it is gone. It has ruined so many games, and I'm done with it. I miss the old days when I liked seeing the Ubisoft splash screen because my favorite game was starting up, hassle free. Then Uplay happened.			"

												Horrible. Bought this game for the coop in the first place. Coop is not working... great... Single player? 10 minutes in and I have had no freedom of movement whatsoever. Quicktime after quicktime event of running for cover. Ubisoft should be ashamed to call this game one of the Splinter Cell franchise. Worst 18 bucks I've spent since Takedown: Red Sabre.			"

												After spending an hour or so trying to get this game to play, much of that on the phone with UBI tech support, this is a prefect example why UPlay DRM needs to die and UBI needs to go out of business. I bought a large set of UBI games over this recent (2015) summer sale (of which this was the most recent) and finally decided to return them all. Anything that was later than 2010 had issues configuring the controller or registering with UPlay.You need to understand, when you buy an UBI game for the PC, you don't actually own it. You cannot, for example, install it on a PC and let your family use it. All UBI games are explicitly removed from being able to be shared with family members on other machines and dues to UPlay, EVEN ON THE SAME MACHINE if you have EITHER different Stream accounts OR different UPlay accounts (you cannot link 2 different UPlay accounts to the same Steam account).The following is my last message to them on the ticket I openned:---------------------------------------Don't worry about this. I decided to return all of the UBI games I bought over the last few days.Most of the newer ones didn't work without a lot of reconfiguration and effort. And, UPlay is one of the worst apps/control moves I've ever seen in the industry and I refuse to give any more money to UBI. I will be buying ALL UBI games used, and for the console, to ensure UBI Soft realizes no direct monetary gain from my purchase.I truly hope you go out of business and the talented people there (the story writers and game developers, minus QA) find a home in a better company. After all, there's a pretty low bar.Good luck.-------------------------------------------------- "

												Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist is an Amazing game, no matter what your playing style is. Whether you like to play Full on 4th Echelon stealth mode, The Panther stealth/combat mix, or full on ""Screw all of you in the♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; combat mode, it's still a rewarding expeiriece. Now onto the multiplayer. Blacklist has an immersive, quick paced, and all around well balanced multiplayer mode called, ""Spies versus Mercanaries"". There are several game modes, and the cash you earn in multiplayer and in singleplayer intertwines, so if you want to level up Sam Fisher a bit, you can use any cash you earn from playing SVM. Mercs team: Whilst playing on the Mercanaries team, your camera will be set in the first person, giving you little vision compared to the spies, which I will describe later. However, the Mercanaries have MUCH more powerful weaponry. Having loud and powerful assault riflles, pistols, shotguns, and Submachine Guns limits the little amount of stealth you can have, for the spies can use utilities such as sonar goggles to see a theremal image of you through walls. You start out the game with one class unlocked for each team, similar to Call of Duty. Spies team: The spies team is much more stealth based, and they have much less lethal weaponry. However, as an advantage over the Mercanaries, the spies have a third person camera angle, and just as much manuverability as Sam Fisher in the single player campaign. They can climb walls, preform stealth kills, climb through ventilation systems, and much more. As you progress through the multiplayer ranks, you will eventually have enough money to buy the ability to create your own customized class. Although it is pricy to unock this feature, it is still very much so worth it. For the singleplayer/co-op experiece, however, I have played a good 3-4 hours of, and it has an impressive, and immersive storyline about a group of terrorists called ""The Blacklist"". The voice acting is outstanding and Eric Johnson makes a great new Sam Fisher, with the same old Rustic voice. Overall, Ubisoft and the late Tom Clancy did an amazing job with devoloping a game far more impressive than the previous title, ""Conviction"" R.I.P. Clancy, we'll all miss you.			"

												In my mind the words Ubisoft and Uplay have become synonymous with Broken and Terrible. I bought the game over 3 months ago, and I am yet to finish the introduction because the game crashes at a specific point. Ubisoft support have run me around in circles and dodged questions. They don't care, because at the end of the day they've made their money and they move on to their next broken PC port ""cough"" Assassin's Creed ""cough"". Everywhere on forums people are having issues, DO NOT GET THIS GAME, unless you want to be robbed of £15. To be honest, there is probably a crack version out there that works perfectly. Screw Ubisoft, screw Uplay, the fact that this game remains broken after nearly 2 years show that steam are happy to sell a broken product as long as they make money and don't suffer a backlash. So to sum up, go buy something else, as long as it's not Ubisoft.			"

												Great stealth game. Very enjoyeable for anyone who likes that type of gameplay. Players start off by choosing a mission they want to do. Once that is underway, the game rates players according to their playstyle. There are 3 categories an action can fall into: Ghost, Panther, and Assault. Each action is then tallied up at the end of each mission and a score is given accordingly. A stealthier approach will earn better rewards. Those who want to go in guns blazing can do that too on most missions. However, there are times when stealth is the only acceptable approach. There is an excellent multiplayer component as well. Playing ""Spies Vs. Mercs"" is extremely fun and I'm glad Ubisoft decided to bring it back. I actually bought the game primarily to play it after watching some footage on youtube. My only complaint is the co-op portion, which never seems to work. I'm guessing this is probably due to the game being a few years old now and not enough players being available online. And I did not try to play it with a friend, so I can't speak in regards to that. Thus far, I haven't been able to play any of Brigg's missions during the single player campaign as they are all co-op only. But they are not required to finish the story, so it's not a big deal.The story was just... ok. It's not bad, but nothing spectacular either. It took me a little over 30 hours to finish the game on ""normal"" mode, including all side missions that weren't co-op only. They also apparently brought in a new actor to play Sam Fisher. He seemed a bit stiff and boring for my taste, but I've seen worse.Everything ran smooth on my PC for the most part, but the game did freeze a few times. I had it on Ultra high settings the whole time. My current rig has an i7 4790K CPU, a Geforce GTX 960 GPU, and 12 GB of DDR3 RAM. And yes, there is Uplay. So if you're one of those people who hates it, you've been warned.Overall, I would definitely recommend this game and I had a lot of fun playing it.			"

												Fantastic addition to the series, I personally disliked Conviction after changing so much what was great from the older SC games.This one thankfully returns to the stealth roots, although it does allow those COD gamers to ""pew pew"" there way through as well. However best way to play this is as a ghost and stealth your way through.There are a couple of times where you are forced to act like a John Rambo wannabe which is annoying, but thankfully the rest of the game makes up for this.Top notch graphics, good difficulty scale, story is largly forgettable but is enough for you to play it through.Co-Op mode is a nice addition as well, just as long as you have mates to play them with as randoms all seem to be 10yr old COD players. Shooting everything in sight and alerting all the guards.Recommended.			"

												There's a lot of people who hate this game, people who will tell you that it strays too far from it's roots and instead goes into a more action oriented approach. Of course, to me...it mostly sounds like people just don't like the idea you really can run and gun in this game and still beat it.Basically, this game is Spinter Cell: Conviction on steroids, with almost everything being improved. An large amount of weapons, customizations, suits, gadgets, there's no shortage of things to unlock and use and experiment with. Chances are, though, that you'll find a good set for yourself and really stick to it.The maps are varied, the story is alright, though nothing special. I can't really complain about map design or lack of variety in the locations you travel to and through.I had lots of fun with this game, and you're rewarded more for playing stealthily than you are by shooting the place up. You can really feel like a stealthy silent assassin badass in this game. I would recommend this game if you like stealth/action games, shooters, and games that you don't mind going through slowly in order to get the best Splinter Cell experience. "

												This is one of the best tactical stealth games I have ever played, it's kinda hard at the beginning but the longer you play the easier it gets. It's a good game to start with if you haven't played any stealth based games yet. There are a few things that make this game great. First of all we got the animations, there are a lot of smooth and beautiful animations in this game. I mean things like picking up bodies, zip-lining between buildings even reloading and just walking or sneaking around. The animations are making this game feel more cinematic and smooth. The second thing is the story. At the beginning you don't have a choice of which mission you want to do, you basically go from location to location all over the planet. When you make more progression you can choose any mission you want to play or replay. The third, and the last thing that make this game as awesome as it is are the graphics. It has some great lightning effects and sharp, rough textures. This make the game feel more real and exciting.I do totally recommend this game to anyone who likes action games or tactical shooters.7.8 / 10			"

												I love the Splinter Cell games over the years. If you like assassin / spy based games? Look no further. This one doesn't disappoint. The game has many pros:-Great graphics (not top but they're great to look at on max).-Strong storyline (was watching this almost as a movie at the end - never happens for me).-The gadgets are all there that you'd want from previous games.-Compelling movement and realism at realistic difficulty and beyond (better than the previous games).CONS:-AI usually is always in the CONS as main complaint. Same here. Sometimes they just glitch where if they spot you andyou've hidden. They just know where you went instantly and all converge on you.-Sometimes you'll knock a guy out or kill him and the body goes flying like a rag doll. Physics problems of the old days lol!Overall, if you can get passed the CONS. This game is a solid 9 out of 10 for me at 26 years of age. I'd have loved to see a longer storyline but that's because I'm a big fan of the series in general (not because it isn't longenough loL!). Looking forward to the next one.			"

Splinter Cell: BlacklistI got this game from my GPU and I was really excited to get it :DI remember when I played the first Splinter Cell, I was amazed by the crazy and ground breaking effects of the lighting,And I loved the gameplay of it, with all of the sneaking around and the sweet gadgets...StorySo, in this chapter of Splinter Cell, there's a group called ""The Engineers"" who are set on killing US forces and assets all over the world until the US will call back all American troops deployed abroad.Well, yeah, the story is kinda generic, but it works!You play as Sam Fisher, and with a small task force you command a cargo plane, named ""Paladin"", from your plane, you see the tasks and missions all over the world, upgrade your plane and loadout.GraphicsGraphics are just amazing! really, the game just looks insane! just like the first time I played the first game, I was just amazed by the graphics here!The shadows and lighting feel so realistic, it's just gorgeous!nothing really to add here, it's just amazing.GameplayThe gameplay is Third-Person, just like all the previous games,for each mission you do, you get money, with that money you upgrade your plane, buy and upgrade weapons, armor and gadgets,each mission can be done in 3 styles, Ghost style which is the stealthy way, Panther style, which is stealthy yet deadly way, and the all out Assault style... no need to explain here.Along the main story you have more side missions from each member of your Task Force that you can do, when done, you get better equipment and the missions are fun too, from getting Intel, to guarding an embassy while waves of terrorists attack you,Each Side mission can be done Solo or Co-op with a friend.the gameplay itself is really fun, makes you feel like a real bad♥♥♥♥♥ killing your enemies from the shadows or just shooting them with bad♥♥♥♥♥upgraded weapons.also, I gotta add, the AI is really smart here, you can see the enemies are talking about what's happening, and they are working together if they are threatened, from guarding their friends and walking back-to-back searching you.ConclusionThis is one of the best Splinter Cell's I've ever played, the game is just amazing, it sucks you in, and if you love a good challenge like me, you will love this! i found my self playing a side-mission for 2 hours just trying to make a perfect run of it,You need to learn the enemy routes, and make a plan of attack, setting traps, calling them from a shadowy place and smacking them!I also love the customizable equipment, from buying black market weapons and adding upgrading them to buying a flying little helicopter like machine that can shock enemies and deploying EMP.The cut scenes are very very good! really well made and deliver a good story with the game! the characters are real actors, one of the main terrorist is Carlo Rota which also plays on the TV series 24,and there's also Multiplayer gameplay where there are 2 teams, Spies and Mercenaries which is fun too, didn't play much, I'm still playing the Main story :)So, overall, the game is just sweet! great gameplay, good and solid story, amazing graphics... what more do you need?Some screens:

												Splinter Cell Blacklist is the best Splinter Cell effort since Chaos Theory, and one of the best pure stealth games I've played in years. Traversal is a dream. Sam moves fluidly and intuitively. You feel like a cat prowling around these levels, stalking enemies, and darting quickly to and fro outside their paths of patrol. Sam Fisher's hand to hand takedowns are superbly satisfying, particularly the deadly variants with his karambit knife. The choreography there is spectacular, and unlike some stealth games such as Human Revolution, the takedowns never get old. The game is also designed in a way that rewards you for your playstyle, no matter how decide to play. Want to play ghostly, never touching enemies, and never leaving a trace? Me, too! You get a lot points for that, which you can use to unlock better gear and weapons. Want to take down every single enemy you come across, alternating between fighting, popping off a couple of shots, then throwing down a smoke grenade and disappearing into the shadows? They give you quite a few points for that, too. Want to just go balls out and play the game like you're John Rambo, throwing incendiary grenades and fire an unsilenced heavy gun? Totally viable way to play the game, and, yup: They give you a boatload of points for that, too. This game has succeeded in allowing the player to drift between full stealth and action shooting in a way that many stealth games have tried over the past couple of decades, but few have succeeded in doing. It does exceptionally well at allowing you to play the game the way you want, and seamlessly transitioning between different styles. I's an amazing accomplishment, and it's the biggest reason why this is such a good game.The replayability I touched on is another asset of the game. Sam Fisher is so customizable that this game could also be described as having RPG features. You can customize all of his gear and weapons to help him better perform either at stealth or combat. You receive money for accomplishing things like takedowns or disappearing after alerting enemies, and then use the money to purchase pants, better goggles, better guns, and more. It does more to allow you to play the game the way you like, and that's something I can always get behind, especially from a company as typically reprehensible to consumers as Ubisoft generally is. It also creates a ton of replayability and does a lot to keep you coming around. Just look at my stats: I've put 60+ hours into this game and have replayed it several times. That's more than I've put into any Splinter Cell game since Chaos Theory.A big part of the success here is how bad♥♥♥♥♥you feel while playing the game. I mentioned how strong the hand-to-hand takedowns are, which is a big part of it. Another is the mark and execute feature that's been carried over from Conviction, which I absolutely adore. It functions in this game as an excellent ""Oh,♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; tool to use if you're about to be spotted by an enemy. Check out the surroundings, mark the enemies, and commence sneaking. Take a wrong turn and get spotted? Hit the button and Sam instantly takes out anybody within range that you've marked, bailing your dumb♥♥♥♥♥out and giving you another shot to keep sneaking. It's a great way to incorporate a kind of undo button into a genre as unforgiving as stealth. I'm not sure whether the developers purposely intended for the feature to be used in this fashion, but it works great, especially considering that you can now use mark and execute at extremely long range when equipped with sniper rifles, which is a neat feature.I've played several Ubisoft games the past few years, and none have run very well aside from the Far Cry series. This game, happily, runs like a dream. It looks great, too. Textures are excellent, and motion capture for the actors is terrific. I do think the game loses quite a bit without Michael Ironside, though, and I question why Ubi even deigned to put Sam Fisher in the game to begin with. The justification was that they needed a younger actor to do the motion capture, which is understandable. But Sam has to be in his late 50s by this point. Why not just reboot with another character altogether, and relegate Sam to the Lambert role of the older games? Ironside is an excellent voice actor, and the series is worse off without him.Anybody who has read my reviews in the past knows that I have a big problem with checkpointing in stealth games. There's nothing more frustrating than sneaking through nine tenths of an area, getting caught at the very end, and dying, only to be put right back where you started and having to follow everything you just accomplished again. It's unbelievably frustrating, and it has no place in modern video games that could easily provide a free save feature. If you don't like save scumming, then don't do it. I don't. But not having free saves is a terrible design choice and it harms people who play the game on the hardest difficulty, which I frequently choose when playing stealth games. This game, sadly, does feature checkpointing, which is one of my few complaints about the game. However, the checkpoints are frequently very manageable, which does some mitigating to the repetitiveness caused by their presence. They are still annoying, though, and I have no idea why game designers continue to use them.The story is another weak point with this game. It's your typical Call of Duty-esque American military story, with the gruff hero saving the world from the sneering villain. I thought Conviction actually had a really great story, but unfortunately this game doesn't continue what they shot for with that one. Gone is pretty much all of the Tom Clancy flavor out of the series that was present in the first three games. This is all Hollywood action movie, which is disappointing, but doesn't matter much in the long run since the game plays so fantastically.I also found the music wanting. Chaos Theory had what I consider to be the best soundtrack in any video game, ever, and this game lacks Amon Tobin's stunningly beautiful score that that game featured. Tobin did such a great job with Conviction, despite having only two songs present in the game, that I would linger on that game's menu just to listen to the excellent menu track that he composed. The fabulous sound design in Conviction does not return, either, but it's manageable here. Seriously, Ubisoft, Amon Tobin is a god. Bring him back, please. We miss him.Another complaint I've got are the stupid first person shooting segments of the game. I can see the value of using them to break up the pacing and add something different, but come on, people who buy Splinter Cell games buy them for stealth gameplay. If I wanted a shooter, I'd play Battlefield. I'd rather Splinter Cell sticks with its strengths.The multiplayer and co-op features in this game are some of the strongest since Chaos Theory as well, and I'd be doing a disservice to the game if I didn't mention them. I don't play much competitively, but I had a blast with the co-operative segment of the game. I only wish it were a bit more meaty -- It's easy to blow through all of the co-operative levels in just a few hours.Overall, you could do way worse than Splinter Cell Blacklist. If you're looking for a pure stealth experience, this is your game. It looks great, it runs great, and it plays great. It's got great replayability. The minor nitpicks I have with it do nothing to really damage the experience. This is a great game, and it's a promising return to form for the Splinter Cell franchise. If you're a fan of the stealth genre, you'll adore it. If you're not, it's still worth playing, as it's a solid game even when played just as a third person shooter with some stealth features.			"

												To be honest, I have never played a Splinter Cell game before this stunning game.Yes, I played the Splinter Cell Conviction app on my I-pod.Yes, I did own one of the Splinter Cell Games but I sucked so much at it that I stopped playing ( This was when I was more inexperienced)Right now, this is most definitely the best stealth game I've played. Hands on. Best.It even beats Hitman Absolution for me. The game has a wide variety of techniques to use against enemies and upgrades. You can even have scores depending on if you evaded all the enemies the entire mission or if you decide to go rambo or if you decide to go stealth knockouts all game. I recommend this game to those who love stealth games such as Hitman Absolution. To be more specific, this game has more techniques and methods of stealthing and finishing the mission than Hitman Absolution. The game offers incredible game mechanics for stealth and a good story-line with the legendary Sam Fisher. I plan on playing the previous games when I have time.Thank you :)			"

												Judging by the media and art regarding the release of SC: Blacklist, I was convinced that the series had taken a relatively bad turn for the worst as in transforming the setalth game into a military third person shooter. Albeit the initial doubts and suscpicion I harbored for the title, I purchased it shortly after release and was pleased to be welcomed with the same generally solid SC: Conviction framework, in addition to sporting missions and levels more akin to the well received SC: Chaos Theory, which focused more on conventional stealth and leaving enemies unharmed rather than hunting enemies from the shadows. Aside from one or two missions which are story oriented ( such as the introduction mission which can be skipped) the levels can be completed entirely on ones own terms. Due to the nature of Splinter cell being a stealth game, the favored approach of most players would be to kill as few enemies as possible without alerting others or raising suspicion from cameras, but akin to others in the series, Blacklist allows for no-kill completion by using the tazer and non lethal hand to hand combat, which offers a generally more intense challenge due to the range limitation and need of disposing unconcious enemies. In terms of story, the game does not offer anything particularly interesting which is slightly disappointing, but the game does feature some great locales and mission sandboxes, so that's a plus. All of the aforementioned details pretty much sum up the gameplay experience in my own words, although in terms of visual aesthetics; the game performs exceptionally well for a Ubisoft PC port, and the level design and texturing is quality work, even for being an Unreal engine game, it manages some remarkable ligh and shadow work in addition to convincing animations.Ultimately, the game suceeds in most aspecrts regarding what formulates into a enjoyable and elaborate stealth game, although it stumbles in the story department, Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a worthy entry to the series and a must have for those who were  slightly off-put by the fast paced nature of Conviction, as it approaches mission design with a more open, sandbox framework.

												awesome sauce.it kind of reminds mass effect when you're picking your quests - which being non-linear makes the game feel less go to X and do X - and the storyline is quite solid.Awesome details like the ability of luring enemies by simply switching the lights out. Speaking of lights, the shadows are your best friends, but enemies are not blind and with a good AI they will hunt you down and ambush you.If you're not used to stealth games, the learning curve will be quite steep, as soon as you go on medium difficulty you'll get yourself out of ammo as fast as any single enemy can shoot poor Sam down. Go stealth however and the game will reward you superbly.Must have for people who enjoy stealth and puzzle games.			"

But it's not a big deal.- AI felt reasonably smart as far as games go.Disliked:- Uplay- Day missions- Some missions lacked some gameplay choices- No news about another Splinter Cell, I want more!Overall the game was a lot of fun.

												Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a sweet middle ground between the Panther-like action of Conviction and the Ghost-like stealth of Chaos Theory. The delightful improbable success of this compromise is a testament to game design that always has choice in mind. It’s well worth replaying the campaign with an alternate playstyle, a different set of preferred gadgets, and/or on Perfectionist mode. And, like the series’ Chaos Theory peak it can’t help but be compared to, Blacklist’s also packing a pair of multiplayer modes that could stand proudly on their own. Splinter Cell is back on the right shadowy track.			"

												An improvement in almost every way over 2010's Splinter Cell: Conviction, Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a perfect start to a catalogue of games from the new Ubisoft Toronto Studio. In fact, it's as best a start the studio could get, as this game is a shining example of supporting player choice, enabling player freedom, and making each level look and feel like a huge sandbox, from start to finish, where your actions may have consequences, but ultimately, YOU are the Splinter Cell, you take control and handle the mess you create.Possibly one of the most exciting multiplayer experiences to date, SvM makes a return in Blacklist, pitting spies against mercs in the most satisfying way since Chaos Theory made the mode popular. A series of different game modes, some even with non-asymetrical teams, makes for endlessly exciting and fun multiplayer match ups, where quick thinking and team work throughout each game will make each victory earned, and you'll just keep coming back for more!Yes, this game isn't Chaos Theory in any respect, but in many ways, I see this as a technological reboot for the franchise, showing us as gamers what we can expect from the stealth genre, at least within the SC franchise, and giving us an opportunity to just ponder over how much the excellent gameplay can evolve even more, to top Blacklist's, and form possibly the best stealth experience ever found in gaming, but within the SC franchise in the future! :)Splinter Cell: Blacklist deserves a 9.2/10! An excellent game and a sheer joy to play. A title i'll keep returning to from time to time! :)			"

												Pre-ordered this game on the xbox 360 back when it first came out, purchased again years later on PC.Definitely one of my favourite entries in the Splinter Cell series, and probably one of the better Ubisoft games in recent memory. It's not Chaos Theory but that doesn't mean it's not fantastic. And once you get a feel for the gameplay, it starts to feel very fluid and fast-paced, even when it comes to performing combos of stealth kills/knockouts. It never fails to make you feel like a stealthy badass and/or silent predator. My only complaint would have to be the fact that the multiplayer is a pain to get working for some people, and unfortunately for me, I was one of the unlucky ones who was forced to learn how to open their ports and other sorts of dandy♥♥♥♥♥♥in order to get the multiplayer/co-op working. But the issue never really bothered me that much anyway because I mostly play Splinter Cell for the singleplayer.Overall, a very solid experience, and a good entry in the Splinter Cell series that built upon the foundation set up by Conviction successfully. Some fans might hate the fact that this game isn't the same as the classic splinter cells (I certainly remember back when the game was first revealed it got a lot of controversy for that, lol), but personally, I'm content with this game, and I'm sure there are other Splinter Cell fans who feel the same way.

												The perfect comeback of a great series.Splinter Cell becomes a stealth game again after the action capter ""Conviction"".The gameplay is pretty solid and while it has some issues with the shooting handling the amazing level design and quality of the production make it for a great experience. The level design in the first place is what sells this game, it's not as good as the excellent ""Chaos Theory"" but is nevertheless outstanding, the missions are not one sigle big open map that you can explore and exploit as in ct, the missions in blacklists consists in segments, you have to go from point a to point b, then from b to c, and when you reach b you cannot go back to a, now this may sound bad but every single segment is so well designed that you will actually apreciate it, also it makes for a more cinematic experience, with its pros and cons.The game rewards every type of gameplay, from action to total stealth but it always feels it encourages a more stealth killing way of playing that pure stealth.The coop missions are also a great part of the game they have the same quality of the single player's.

												At first, I was reluctant to purchase this game because of the sole fact that Michael Ironside wasn't going to reprise his role as Sam Fisher. His rough, grizzled, I've-dealt-with-enough-crap-to-last-two-lifetimes voice was perfect for the role of an ex-Navy SEAL in his 50s. To have anyone else portray that iconic role wasn't just wrong in my mind, but darn near sacrilege!I noticed this game was on sale and thought ""Okay, let's see how bad this game is...""Man, I am a fool. Eric Johnson did an admirable job portraying Sam (especially with the phone calls to Sarah). The gameplay was something I expected from the franchise (with ""Mark and Execute"" functions returning from Conviction). The story was quite compelling!One minor flaw, though: there were instances in the game when I should have been able to perform a stealth takedown from pieces of cover, but couldn't. Sam was frozen in place repeatedly being shot until he died. Other than that, the game's all right!			"

 DISCLAIMER: I HAVE PLAYED MORE THAN FIVE HOURS, WHEN YOU PLAY IN OFFLINE MODE/INTERNET DIES BEFORE YOU START UP AND COMES BACK AFTER YOU CLOSE, YOUR PLAYTIME DOESN'T COUNT  First thoughts Going into this game, I was really thinking to myself ''Oh boy! Another crappy Splinter Cell game like Conviction, as if we needed another one of the same tired, dead franchise that's not been good since Chaos Theory'' but after maybe 3 hours of playing and generally trying to enjoy the game, I'm genuinely happy with the game. I actually was enjoying myself. I didn't play the general ghost way like I do in most stealth games, I enjoyed my time and I played my own way and didn't care too much about being detected and going  FULL  ghost mode and refusing to kill/get caught. I just played by being a mass murdering ghost. The game doesn't punish you for playing your way unlike other Stealth Games where they give less XP/bonuses (Deus Ex HR gave you less XP for just going guns blazing, MGS4 gave you less Drebin Points if you got alerted or killed/ Dishonored gave you a worse ending if you killed a lot) and I enjoyed that a lot since murdering pixel-people didn't make me seem like a monster because ''TURRISM''. Gameplay The best way to describe this game in my opinion is to imagine if Splinter Cell got a true mechanical sequel with some mechanics like throwing bottles removed and better graphics. The movement in Splinter Cell Blacklist feels right in my opinion. The best way to describe detection is just Far Cry 3. It's literally just Far Cry 3's method of giving you a meter pointing towards the enemy that sees you.You can easily use this moment to look and mark then execute with a special execution move that can take up to three people down with whichever weapon you have equipped instantly. Useful if stuck in a sticky mess but other than that, it's really gamebreaking and should be (in my opinion) used as a last resort. Personally, the stealth works and that's what matters for a player who's gonna be playing stealth (either ghost or panther)The gameplay can be devided into three methods of play:Ghost:     -Non-lethal, always hidden and relies on knockout tactics and gadgets like sleeping gas and tri-rotor.Panther:      -Letal, always hidden, doesn't mind getting hands dirty, Gets caught at times and evades predatorCombatant:     -Lethal/Non-lethal, never hidden, gets caught often and doesn't care, eliminates all enemies  Pretty easy Story Something about a list with CIA operatives, really didn't matter to me, I just wanted to play the game.This seems unprofessional but if you want a good story, I can't honestly tell you if this one is good or not. Verdict This is just Chaos Theory with different landscapes but a bit more linear and smaller than before, definitely a bunch of fun.Definitely worth purchasing on sale, might be not-so-worth it at full price.  To the guy who keeps downvoting all my reviews, and I mean all of them, even old ones nobody noticed, I love you <3  "

												Combining some stealth mechanics of Chaos Theory with some awesome set-piece executions with the Conviction mark and execute system makes a great game worthy of the Splinter Cell name. My only complaints would be Michael Ironside not retaking his role as Sam Fisher. The new voice actor Eric Johnson looks a lot like a younger Sam Fisher, but his tone makes him sound like a 30 year-old when Sam at this point is in his 50's. Other then that its damn good. It may not have the say amazing stealth gameplay that Chaos Theory had, but at least it does not over the top action like Conviction.9.5/10			"

												This is, in my opinion, the best Splinter Cell to date. It takes the best bits from the classic SC1 and Chaos Theory and combines them with the modern, fluid controls of the newer games.Fantastic graphics, locations that span the world, intense COOP and a pretty good plot. If you're a fan of the series, don't miss this!			"

The best Splinter Cell game since Chaos Theory!Developers played it safe and unlike the godawful Conviction this game is actually pretty good.I recommend Splinter Cell Blacklist to both Splinter Cell fans and to fans of stealth games in general. "

												Edit: Changed to negative due to that final boss fight. QTE at their worst what a pathetic way to end a game.Little unsure which way to rate this, but I do enjoy the game despite its flaws. + RPG elements; You can customize your loadout to your playstyle. Nice mix of gadgets. + Different playstyles; stealthy, aggressive or a mix. All are rewarding and helps with replayability.+ Assymetrical multiplayer; haven't played much but it is good fun and a nice change from other games.+/- Gameplay is good overall, but it can be a little clunky leading to some frustrating deaths especially early on.- Uplay *shudders* I could write an essay on this abomination. It now opens up an advertisement when you exit the game.... why ubisoft? why?- Too much focus on coop, even in singleplayer missions; closed off routes such as doors and high ledges.- Some annoying little quirks; acog sight aiming into your cover instead of over it. Weapon accuracy (especially over distance) is a little random. Object interaction aim can be dodgy too, looking at a light swich but jumping out the window 2m away is the highlighted action.			"

												Splinter Cell Blacklist is one of the best stealth games I have ever played. It has a great story, good visuals, and realistic sound effects. There are tons of things to do in this game. There is a great campaign, a fun Spies Vs. Mercs mode, tons of challenging co op missions, and you can level up your plane and gear. The stealth mechanics are near flawless, the weapons/ gadgets are well thought out, the voice acting is pretty good, and the AI isn't super dumb like most stealth games. Splinter Cell Blacklist can be challenging at times, but it is very rewarding. I don’t have any major complaints about this game. I have a few small complaints though. One mission made you play the game as a clunky FPS with no stealth mechanics whatsoever. This bugged me a little, but it was just one mission. I think some of the character models are crappy and its difficult to play co op because most people are total idiots. With the few small flaws aside, Splinter Cell Blacklist is a remarkable game and a must have for fans of stealth games. I give SC Blacklist a 9.5/10. "

												A good campaign, and good fun co-op but when you go online, some reason some of the controls change and it feels weirdThe graphics are pretty decent.  Not amazing and certainly not bad.  Easy ultra this game.Controls are annoying and keyboard and mouse is complicated for me some reason.  I have played ALL splinter cell games and enjoy them but this one I found the trickiest with the controls for some odd reason.The audio usual spot on to the key, and has no issues.The campaign is really good and decent fun to play.The co-op is good fun provided you have good players with you.The multiplayer is where ALL the fun is.  It can be extremely annoying playing your first time because you die so many times, no matter what your rank but you play more and more and become good and enjoy the game, even more for what it is.(I even have a Twitch video of myself raging at dying all the time)Anyway is the game worth it? Yes.  It is Splintercell grown up, with more toys and gadgets and updated, and now that co-op and multiplayer has been added to a more adept game, it is worth the money and time you put into it :)			"

												Well, for once Ubisoft's marketing team didn't overstate the hype for this game before it released. They actually did what they said they would; incorporate the best ideas from previous SC games into one.  As long time fan of the series, I can confirm this isn't as bad as people made it out to be. Each SC game has pros and cons, but that's no reason to skip any of them if you're a fan of the series at all. The only parts of this game I don't like are the first person sections, luckily it's only done in part of one level.  Oh that and the new Sam actor being a c*cky prick, it's a wonder anyone wants to help him.And Spy vs Merc is a horrible mess, don't even bother.			"

												The stealth genre is a personal favourite and Splinter Cell Blacklist is one of the best games in it. With tight stealth mechanics, solid enemy AI and intricate maps with multiple methods of achieving the varied mission objectives, Blacklist has all the necessary components of a good stealth game and puts them together with atmospheric sound and visuals that still hold up several years after its initial release. Previous experience of the Splinter Cell universe is not required as the characters and plot stand alone, being just interesting enough to augment the great gameplay. To summarise, this is a must-have for any fan of the stealth genre.			"

Posted: February 27, 2014
												So, I had a pretty good time with this game.  I only have a few issues with it.While it is far more reliable (crash speaking) than any other splinter cell game that I've played, I ran into some glaring balance issues while working my way through the campaign.  I realize that I'm not the sharpest gamer in the world, but the fact that completing Normal difficulty was neigh on impossible, with more ""checkpoint"" reloads than I care to admit to, I will likely not be making an effort to complete the game on any higher setting.On the note of checkpoint reloads, have developers forgotten that we're on a PC platform, and have access to an exponentially higher capacity hard disk than exists on consoles?  Checkpoint saves are mind numbing, especially when the checkpoint is spaced so far behind where you are, and you've accomplished very difficult objectives and then you happen to run into a bad guy with heavy armor and a shotgun and when he finishes redecorating the room with your brain matter you have to work through laser traps, patrols, and god knows what else you may have already dealt with.That brings me to another issue, goggles have always been a big part of the splinter cell game series.  The ability to see in the dark, see magnetic resonance, thermals, even footprint vision.  Cool stuff right?  This game introduces a foe called the ""drone operator"" which jams your goggles, somewhat arbitralially I might add.. as no other electronic gear you carry is affected by their presence.  They don't just do this after you've been detected mind you, but constantly.  And the drones they send after you, while easy to dispatch with a single shot from your pistol, if you do happen to be detected nothing is more annoying than some dog biting your arm forcing you through the ""Mash the ""E"" key sequence"" while drones roll up to you and explode over and over again.  Especially on the missions where you have to survive waves of enemies, horde style, necessitating yet more endless reloads in a vain effort to work through the missions.  On these horde missions, the drone operators were consistenly the biggest pain in the♥♥♥♥♥of all other enemy types, even the juggernaught types which I'm pretty sure are supposed to be the apex foes.  I'd rather deal with superman in body armor (the jugs) than deal with a single drone operator, largely because he could be ANYWHERE and regardless of his positioning will constantly send those irritating drones out whilst simultaneously rendering your goggles inert.That rant down, I don't typically attack a game for being hard, but if it's supposed to be a stealth action game than why do I constantly feel like the game wants me to kill everyone?  There really isn't anyway to argue against that the easiest way to complete a given mission is to go heavy armor with your nastiest guns and shoot your way through.  Stealth is possible, but invariably ends up with you killing everyone anyway...  and the routes in various level which REQUIRE a co-op team mate?  I get it, we need to encouarge people to play these games, and fill out the various co-op campaigns, but the truth of the matter is that nobody is ever on for it.  Even the multiplayer games are an endless stream of watching people join ""Oh this guy is only level 1, screw that!"" and leaving the game lobby.  It's impossible to get it done unless you have some cadre of friends which love games that seem designed to give them a headache.At any rate, I finished this game through on normal difficulty, despite the fact that very VERY few games make me actually rage while I play them.  This game did it.  I was going ""Seriously?"" to my computer, followed by ""Is this for freaking real?""  And finally, ""I'd rather go play... basically anything else.""  I love splinter cell, the storyline has always been excellent, and I finished it to see how the story would play out. But again, I wouldn't try to push this on anyone after the headache that NORMAL difficulty provided.  As a complete footnote to everything else, replacing Michael Ironside with some twenty something kid to 'jazz up' the franchise probably had the exact opposite effect.  You lost your 30-40's cold war demographic, who could relate to the ""old man"" that was the gravely voiced, dry humored, Sam Fisher.  This punk kid who you've turned him into is not only unrelatable, but serves to undermine the ENTIRE story of the series.  Or is it a Michael Bay reboot?/rant			"

												Honestly in my opinion, Tom Clancy's Splinter Blacklist is a pretty rad and awesome game! But never the less, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory will always be my most favorite Splinter Cell game of all time. Anywho I disgress on all that but lets get to the real deal with this game.Blacklist is a fun stealthy, action-packed, and thrilling spy video game! To make this game even better, there are loads of weapons, gadgets, and equipment at your disposal. Also another awesome thing about this game is the scoring rating system based on how you play this game. You can go all Ghost which is you (the player) heavily relying on non-lethal takedowns, stealthy movements, no alarms, etc. You can also go all Panther which is you (the player) killing bad guys quietly without no alarms or anyone noticing it. Or you can go all Assault which is basically screw stealth and go all loud and with a bang.The story of the game is basically this................ you're fighting against a terrorist group called The Engineers. And that's all I'm going to say about it.Also there is a multiplayer game mode called Spies Vs. Mercs which is an absolute blast and some players still play that multiplayer game mode.All in all this game was a blast to play with and I definitely recommend you guys/ladies to play this game. The only con I have for this game is Michael Ironside doesn't voice act the character Sam Fisher on this game.			"

												Best Third Person Shooter I've experienced in a long time, and for so many reasons:1. Great platforming, smooth and pretty much everywhere you can jump up / climb around.2. Co op missions vary in playstyle, with many leaving it up to you to decide how you play3. Great balance of stealth and action, and as mentioned many missions allow you to decide how to play.4. Horde mode survival wave-based missions! Yes!5. Tons of gadgets, not just a shooter, take out a group with a tear gas gernade, shoot a sleeping gas bolt, lay a mine, emp shockwave a camera etc etc.6. Great progessions system, earn $ buy upgrades7. Great replayability due to harder difficulty levels, and the option to play a mission in a different style, plus the charlie missions (survival wave missions) never get old for me8. PVP is great but its not my thing so look elsewhere for comments haha.If you get it let me know! :) "

												Feels like an upgraded conviction. Find playing stealth very dificult compared to previous spliter cell games, but on the flip side run and gun is a hell of a lot easier than before. Like the multiplayer, coop survival is probably my fave, followed by spies vs mercs (PvP). Pros -Shiny grapics (especially torchlight)Run and gun friendlyGood customisationDogsCons -To me mkes run and gun the prefered tactic, when in a splinter cell game you should really regret being detected, this game says ""hey.....dont worry.....its quicker to just shoot them all anyway ;)""All in all a nice addition to the series, but for the next one i think stealth gameplay should be easier than shooting, if only to make it the prefered way to play this ""stealth"" game :)			"

												Ah, now I remember why I avoid anything Ubisoft when possible. Get their stupid little UPlay app working again - check, get past the console controller prompts (even though I dont have the horrible thing plugged in) - check. Go to remap keys....cant remap aim, in fact cant even map it back to the original when I try to back out and save what I have already spent time setting up...CTRL-ALT-DEL....Ubisofts friend. Eventually get back into the game after 5 mins of it refusing to launch, then the keys wont work at all, cant even select the menu items. Restart 2 or 3 times, back to square 1, change graphic settings, screen judders, intro videos drop to something like 5x5 pixels size, again after 2 or 3 restarts it suddenly works...and back to the control bug. Oh and in the process of opening a ticket with Ubisoft I get prompted to change my credentials, reminding me the dumb moronic idiots got hacked not too long ago. Never again you pathetic excuse for a software company.			"

												Splinter Cell: Conviction removed so much of what made Splinter Cell, Splinter Cell. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed Conviction for what it was it but it wasn't really a Splinter Cell game.  The game really felt like you had to go out of your way to avoid killing anyone at all. Thankfully Blacklist is all about freedom of choice. Levels in this game are laboratories in which you can conduct all means and manners of special ops methods that you like. How you play the game is mostly entirely up to you. The only constraints the game forces on you during the experience are remaining undetected and non lethal. Often times both are independent of one another - you can still kill if you wish as long as you remain undetected. That said, Splinter Cell is best enjoyed as that game where you spend several minutes doing safe recon, scouting out an area with your gadgets, noting guard patrols patterns and sneaking past them untouched while throwing dogs off the trail. Do this on ""perfectionist"" mode difficulty and feel the adrenaline flow. Or not, the choice is yours. Either way, the adrenaline will probably still flow. The only negative is that the game has some ridiculous 'on rails' sequences where you control drones and the like. While they do provide a mix-up from the stealth pacing, they're just not that much fun. In fact, I have to say I found some of them to be rather boring. A shame really because the rest of the game is bucket loads of fun.Welcome back Sam Fisher!			"

												Splinter Cell Blacklist the game I was hoping for since the annoncement back in 2012 (or '11). The sequel I was so excited for I preordered the digital deluxe edition as soon as it was avalible on steam. The game which made me download the gameplay videos for in 1080p hd and watch them every night till the game got released. Then I got it....Splinter Cell Blacklist is an amazing game but i suffers from what many ubisoft pc ports have since time immemorial. I got the game at 1 in the morning and stayed up to play it for 6 hours after that on a school night. The single player was fun so was the coop but that is not why i bought the game. I bought it for the Multiplayer (Spies vs Merc). Now this is the holy grail for me but I realised the longer i played it the duller it became. Now i am a fan but I dont know how but they managed to mess it up not from a gameplay point of view but technical. I guarentee you play about 3 matches of this and if you dont live in the US or any country which heaps of people play the game you will scream at your monitor and curse because of hideous lag and  poor net code, overpowered weapons and the Merc Melee ""Dun Dun Dunnnn""The net code for starters is horrible. The game constantly kicks you in the♥♥♥♥♥♥as you are always being shot from behind cover, melee'd through walls and being shot at in unbelievable situations. Like for example you see a spy camping behind cover, you constantly aim at him and start walking towards him and he kills you without taking a scratch. Half time your the spy the same situation and when you try you get blown up in the face.Now the overpowered weapons, In this game you can tell if your versing n00bs or pros. Pros usually have ak-47s or some assault rifle, its a balanced gun and not too cheaty. And then there is shotguns, These things are way to op most of the time insta kills to enemy (or friendly) spies and you don't want to go near anyone carrying these things cause if they see you first you die there is no way you are getting them which is a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥because the only way spies can effectively kill mercs is with melee.Finally the Merc Melee ""Dun Dun DUNNNNNN"".This is probably the most unbalanced thing because most people(including my self) just rock up there in adrenaline suit and sprinter boots which automatically makes them fast at spies and almost win every melee encounter. Did the devs not see this in testing. If your stuck with a match full of pros and your a low level i am almost certain they will pull out their pistols and rush you trying to melee. And you know how i was mentioning lag before, one time i had so bad lag i managed to melee a merc as a spy and then after the animation had finished he had got back up then melee'd me then dropped over from bad luck(battelfield reference).Anyway i've done enough fanboy raging final thoughs the single player was fun but nothing to come back to the coop was alright but Ubi really let me down with this one and they didnt even bother to put ded servers or better stability. Ubi thinks all they have to do is change the controls around and give the game better graphics and put a PC sticker on it to make a good port. Well the game was a real let down and a bad pc port giving it 5/10The end.			"

												Being an amazing and always evolving series, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Splinter Cell: Blacklist. And god, after the enormous changes the previous game (Splinter Cell: Conviction) made, I was hoping this sequel to come back in a slightly more classic way.And here it is! Blacklist is the perfect balance, in my opinion, between the Splinter Cell ""older"" gamers know (from the first to Double Agent) and the changes made in Conviction. The result: a stealth-action game with fluid gameplay, badass movements and giving you a certain degree of freedom in your approaches. You can sure as hell go all gun blazing, but this is not the recommended way to go: being sneaky is still the best approach.The only (maybe) downside to this game? Well, I guess that is the main character, Sam Fisher, who looks like in his 30-40's, when he is supposed to be approx. 60 years old according to the story. I'm playing with french voices, so the change of voice actor does not affect me.I really hope to see a sequel to the series, or a prequel; but in the first case I think this would be better to make Sam Fisher a secondary character (example: he would be the new playable character's instructor).Conclusion: Splinter Cell Blacklist is an amazing game, who made the good move to head back to its roots without doing a complete 180°. The only thing I'd like to see is some consistency in the universe, but that's about it.8.5/10 - Obligatory game.			"

												This game is actually fun, I do enjoy it for the most part, but there is one very important system that had been ruined by Splinter Cell Conviction, and that is the stealth. In Chaos Theory, you would have a Light and Sound meter, simple, yet made the game far more challenging. In Blacklist, these great systems have been totally thrown out an replaced by Conviction's stealth system, which is far more fast paced and action oriented. Usually you would be able to hide in darkness, without having any cover, in this game, you absolutely NEED cover in order to stay hidden, no matter if you are in what you think is complete darkness. In chaos theory, you could also control your speed, which affected your sound meter, in this game, you are at 1 fixed speed, which at some times got me detected.  This game had so much potential, and like I said it is fun, but if you make a game where if the player misses one shot, the enemies know where they are, you might want to think about the older games in the franchise and how people said that they were some of the BEST stealth game, and even today people say that. I guess all I can do is hope that if there is a new splinter cell in production, it will be just like the old ones.			"

												Do not purchase this game unless it is on sale, the story is decent although Sam Fisher's new voice actor was a pretty bad choice for Sam Fisher, but he delivers a good performance. As it stands the gameplay is great however, despite Merc vs Spies being fun there are noticeable development flaws ranging from the matchmaking system seemingly being made from a developer that bashes rocks together with his freetime, most of the playerbase play Blacklist mode which you won't be able to play until level five, so you will sit in matchmaking for 2+ hours trying to find a game.They remove the ability to leave a game which causes people to idle or Alt Tab and manually close their game anyway. Merc vs Spies also lets you monitor who is alive on the other team, so if the Spies are wiped out the Mercs run to the Spy spawn and melee kill them the moment they appear causing two or more minutes of you and your team being spawn killed.Hackers run rampant and will ruin a game easily, phasing through the floor and shooting up at you among other crazy things.TL:DR Gameplay is good, Matchmaking is terrible, Multiplayer is great but poorly designed, Story is decent, Playerbase sucks.8/10; Recommended when on sale only...

												Fantastic stealth game. Basically an improved and heavily upgraded version of Conviction, and worth every penny. The addition of choosing to go into each mission with one of three strategies, Panther, Ghost, and Assault, makes every mission much more replayable. With Panther,  you basically do what you did in Conviction and the other Splinter Cell games. Kill silently. With Assault, you still kill all the baddies, but with loud weapons and explosions. Ghost is trickier (and a bit more frustrating, to be honest) but provides more score. Ghost basically means don't kill anyone. You can still use non-lethal takedowns on enemies to knock them out, thankfully. But you get the most points from avoiding enemies entirely.Definitely worth the buy. 9.5/10!			"

												Basically the heavy action of Conviction mixed with the extremely polished stealth of Chaos Theory. It's a blast to play. You can play however you like and the game does not punish you for it. For example, if you want to be completely stealthy and sneak past all the enemies on the map, you can! If you want to silently take them out one by one, you can do that too!! If you wanna go full Rambo on everybody and let out some pent up frustration, this game won't knock ya for it!!! It's a pretty solid entry to the series, although I'm sad to see the traditional voice actor replaced by a much younger- and much less likable newbie.			"

												This game has the funnest single player I've played in a very long time!The story is a bit cliche but it's done well and is interesting. The presentation is very cool and cinematic. The gameplay mixes old and modern school gaming. It's awesome. The only big problem in this game for me are the controls. It's not the default keys themselves (I could get used to them) but the whole system. For example, [e] is used to bash doors and holding [e] over a body is used to pick up the body. If the body is near the door, it's very, very easy to bash the door instead of pick the body up although I hold [e]. That can get annoying.The multiplayer and level up system is great and rewarding. The only problem is that there aren't as many players as before. Uplay is also annoying and there are quite a bit of cheaters. :/All that being said, Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a very good installment in the Splinter Cell series. It's much better than Hitman: Absolution IMO. It's not as frustrating and more fun.			"

												This is a fun, and epic, well-crafted Splinter Cell game.  Perhaps the best one of the entire series!  The new voice talent for Sam Fisher actually will grow on any SC hardcore fan, as it did myself.  The co-op missions and character development, along with well-thought-out humor and plot make this one to remember and talk about for ages.  The addition of armor/weapon upgrades to specify your play-style really benefit the fight overall.  You can spend hours, days, weeks, attempting to best the highest scores out there on Assault, Ghost, and Panther missions...and trust me when I say, ""you can spend hours, days, weeks"" - the time just flies by.  If you love Splinter Cell?  Or Stealth-based games?  This is a must!  Over 9,000% must-have!!!			"

												I absolutey love this game. Bugged my friend to gift it to me, got it eventually and now am in love. Every single time i fly down 15-20 metres to bury a karambit in an enemies neck, it feels good (well that was sadistic). The singleplayer is immersive and free, allowing you to play 3 different ways: ghost is leaving enemies or non-lethally subduing them, panther is stealthy taking down and killing enemies, and assault is going in, getting noticed and then causing a whole load of clips to be emptied. Now the multi-player. The multi-player here is much different to anything else. Yes there is FPS shooting, but this is merc only. In the main mode, the spies (third person stealthy kinda guys) have to hack terminals and not get killed while inside the area, while mercs have to find the spies and kill them. Spies use shadows and cover to melee insta-kill the mercs, while the opposite side have the advantage of heavy firepower. So you might look at it and say the spies have advantage, but trust me, they do not. Being dropped from long range in 2 seconds is not an advantage.So all together, I love this game, and I would recommend it to anyone else who likes stealthy third person games (can't even think of another one). So yeah			"

												Conviction was fun but not very Splinter Cell like, so I wasn't really expecting anything great here. However, they seem to have got the best parts of conviction and mixed it with the best parts of the old games, and I'm loving it so far. I've chosen to go down the non lethal stealth route, but if you fancied going guns blazing for example, you'd get rated on a different set of rules and still earn a nice sum of money.The money system is extremely similar to Payday 2 (down to ShadowNet as the mission selection as opposed to CrimeNet, I'm not sure which came first), and it seems to work really well. It gives you something to work towards without witholding anything important (like having no goggles for most of conviction), even if it's just for the stats since everything pretty much looks the same.So far I've not had a chance to try coop (we're doing the campaign to get kitted out in better stuff first), but in Conviction I had more fun in coop than I did with the campaign, so hopefully it'll be the same here. One downside is that the new look and voice actor for Sam Fisher just makes it feel like you're playing a generic spy, but he's still pretty badass at least.			"

												Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist is a great game and if you like stealth, you should definitely check this one out. If you've played or seen any of the previous Splinter Cell games, then you already know pretty much what to expect. In this game, you can choose to do your missions in one out of three gameplay styles. 1. Ghost: Stealth and non-lethal. 2. Panther: Stealth and lethal. 3. Assault: Loud and lethal. I completed the game in Panther style. You have your trusty optics with night vision and sonar vision that has served well from the very first game. It can be upgraded as you progress and get more funds. You can unlock and buy better weapons and suits and upgrade them. Different weapons, gears etc. are suited for different play styles. So it is better, although not necessary, to stick to one play style throughout the game. You can replay missions at any point in the game to earn more money. Apart from the missions, there are also side missions given to you by people in the team. Although they can be played solo, they are best played co-op as solo can be quite hard. The game doesn't save in these side missions and if you mess up in the middle, you have to start over. I didn't have anyone to play co-op with, so I didn't play them. I tried one mission but found it quite hard to do it solo and gave up. Multiplayer is dead now. Graphics is really great considering it came out in 2013. Storyline is decent enough. Overall it's an enjoyable game and if you like stealth, you should definitely check this one out.			"

												I feel so conflicted... Damn this was a good Splinter Cell game, the most fun IMHO. Especially on Realistic, it's an awesome addition of the series, but... I DIDN'T 'FEEL' LIKE SAME FISHER! WHERE'S HIS HUMOR? THE CYNICAL DRY SMART MOUTH? AND WORSE IT DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG TO REALIZE IT'S NOT EVEN THE SAME VOICE.How old is Fisher now?? Is he supposed to be 52 or 25 because he sounds like a 30-something with his old bones doing acrobatic take-downs. I mean it's awesome, but I think I could've gave this a pass if this was a prequel instead it being like, what, a week after Conviction ends (and mind you Fisher looked OLD in that game)TL;DR: Great. awesome fun game I definitely see myself playing again, but as a long-time fan this ""new"" Sam Fisher is so immersion-breaking it felt like a different game.

												This game left me mouth open and looking to the sky, It was probably the best 20+ hours of gaming I have ever expirienced! Like Sleeping Dogs it focuses alot on what is happening behind the operations like talking with your daughter. If you like shooting people, lights, sneaking around, pretty much anything to do with stealth! Then this game is built for you! I suggest this game to any gamer looking to play a good, challenging game.I bought the Deluxe Edition for this game, which is what I suggest you do if you are planning to play coop mode because of extra co-op missions. Regardless of the Co-op DlC's, the coop in this game is very interactive and includes dual boosts, breaches and even dual take downs! Each co-op and singleplayer game lasts around an hour, I thought this would get boring at first but boy was I wrong! after playing one mission I immediately jump to the next in exitement wanting to know what happens!The different play-styles in this game: Ghost, Panther and Assult provide a sense of freedom and make it more appealing to differnt types of gamers which I think is a great addition.A great game with an unmissable ending!

												If you are saying that this was the high point in all of the Splinter Cell games, you are wrong, sorry to say, the best game(s) of the series to me had to be Chaos Theory, and Double Agent, but I loved Chaos Theory more.PROS:Back to stealth (Somewhat): It may not be the best stealth it was years and years ago but it was still nice to see that they actually brought stealth back into the game which surprised me, after annoying Conviction I figured they did what Dead Space, Resident Evil, and FEAR had done to their series.Multiple ways to do a mission: There are 3 ways to do a mission, assault, panther, or Ghost, obviously me being the total stealth nerd I am I did Ghost, which was really fun through most of the parts.  This means you don't get ghost ""Points"" for killing, only for Knocking Out the enemy targets, Panther points are for killing stealthy, and Assault is just for gunning down everyone who gets in the way on alert.Upgrade gear, and the plane: You can buy and upgrade Sam's gear as you go with money you get from missions, which was really cool that you could actually pick the gear you wanted, although most of the gear isn't very useful when it comes to stealth, you'll end up getting a few pieces of clothing for stealth and then you will pretty much have everything you need.  You can also upgrade the plane to give you more things in the field, like health, items show up on the map, etc.Several missions from old characters: With Sam, Grimmsdottr, and others, even that guy from Conviction that was supposed to kill Sam's daughter you end up capturing him and get missions from him, which is weird but honestly, that guy is pretty cool minus the fact he tried to kill my Daughter.  You get money from the missions they give, which means upgradeable stuff.Better gear: You get some useful gear, like a crossbow that shoots knock out gas, very useful for Ghost style play I must say, I pretty much used this thing the entire game, I only used the guns for lights and that was it actually, I only killed if it was seriously necessary, and even then I tried to knock out a person.More points for not killing: If you go through a area without killing/knocking out someone or a group of people you get more points for leaving them alive, which is nice for the ghost side because I honestly try to keep as many people alive as I can, it just seems better that way.CONS:Still acts like Conviction: Conviction was one of my most uninteresting games because it went from stealth to basically pure assault with stealth mixed in, and it kind of killed off the series for me, and they still implemented it in the game, why couldn't they have tried to be more like Chaos Theory or Double Agent, you know, when the stealth was actually stealthy.No sound/Shadow Meter: This was a huge dissapointment to me, I heard they went back to stealth and I was like ""Oh they are finally going back to their roots!"" Then I played it and that went down the toilet, the only way to tell you are in the dark is the lights on your suit light up, that's it, I can't tell if i'm completely hidden regardless of how dark it is or if i'm just slightly hidden and still obvious, not to mention not having a sound meter f$%ks up most of the game, basically there isn't a way to walk slower or faster when crouched, you just walk and that's it, and you get noticed half the time because of that fact, you basically just have to mash the melee button when you are near a guy because he will end up turning around and seeing you.Brutes: F*%k these guys, if they notice you and turn to the side you can't knock them out cause you can only do it from behind or above, and when they are in the open you are basically going to have to get behind them or try to go around, but since you can't really tell how much sound you are making you are basically going to end up running past them or ""Attempting"" to knock them out, and the knock out gas doesn't work cause they have masks on, I ended up hating these guys the entire game.No killing missions: I'm all for not killing enemies in missions, but that one Cuban camp was just rediculous, I was RIGHT near the end and there was a dog, I figured, I would just kill it cause I ran out of ammo for my crossbows Knock Out gas, I shot it, I lost, because it counted as a ""Soldier"" are the people at Ubisoft Imbred or something? Dogs are easier to replace than the actual soldiers are for gods sake.Not much interesting gear: You end up finding the few pieces of gear that do the best in a tactical way (Ghost, Panther, Assault.) and then never try anything else, that's it, you find the things that do well and the other stuff can go f$#k itself because you know that it won't do as well as the stuff you have already.Never used sticky cameras: I used to use these all the time in other games, I never touched them once, I think it's because once I got the upgraded goggles to see through walls everything involving a camera was useless to me, I never touched the cameras or anything else, which is kind of sad since I used them all the time in the other games.Characters: Most of the characters I sadly didn't care about, I cared about a few like Briggs and Koban, but the rest I didn't realy care for.  Not even Grimm who's been in the game since the very beginning, that's kind of sad that I end up caring about the guy that tried to kill my daughter and my partner more than the person who's been in the game from the beginning.WHAT I THINK: After playing through the whole game I didn't think of it like a good stealth game, it was fun and had stealth in it, but I didn't like it as much as I had with the other games, before, probably because I was expecting them to go back to the way they had originally but I was kind of dissapointed with the fact they went with Conviction more. Then again this is Ubisoft we are talking about, they can't do much right honestly, did you SEE Watch_Dogs?  Score? Eh...i'm stuck between a 6-7/10 it was fun, but I didn't get as much feeling as I had with other games, it still acted like Convcition too much than it had with it's predecessors, I say get it on a sale.

												Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist (SC6)Just a little disclamer: I am trying to be as balanced as I can be but I am a huge fan of the Splinter Cell francise from Day One, i am also a fan of many other Tom Clancy games, including Ghost recon, Rainbow Six and Hawkx. I am just saying if you feel inclined you may want to take this review with a grain of salt and make up your own mind.To start this review without comparing this game to the rest of the Splinter cell series would be BLASPHEMY!!! So i will start with just that.Blacklist gives a whole new aspect to the steath genre by incorparating many of the amazing things the previous games brought to the plate, for example: SC chaos theory's differant ways to complete missions, a free roam aspect but without as much hand holding as there was in Conviction. It still contains convictions assualt attitude but you can choose whether to be ""Ghost""(Super stealthy, no killing) ""Panther"" (Still very stealthy, but with gunplay) and of course, ""Assault"" (All guns no stealth). You earn more points in differant areas for the behaviors, but over all you earn more skill points for having a ""ghost"" style.  A lot of people think Chaos theory was the pinnacle of the series, I agree, but with all the experience Ubisoft have gained over the years of making Splinter Cell, they have really changed my opinion on the ""best game"" of the series. This is a serious contender in my opinion.The multiplayer.I never really got to play the multiplayer in the first games as by the time i had got round to playing them the multiplayer was abandoned. This game heavily incorporates multiplayer. But its done well. Amazing Spies vs mercs, i just can't describe how it just works so well. The teams are nearly always balanced,(I was worried about this as many online games have this issue and also, Ghost recon phantoms, a F2P title is sliping into a game i don't like, with the unfair teams and lagswitching.) and the way the game is layed out it just plain works.There is just one thing i am worried about, the fact that in a year from now the multiplayer will probably be deserted and the game will lose a huge chunk of it mechanics in the doing so.Great for the steath fans, brutal takedowns and a true contender to the top spot of the series.9/10 Would Sam fisher again			"

												Overall a good game. The graphics are decent, and the levels are varied and exotic. The stealth-gameplay is very good. I especially enjoyed Sam Fisher's takedowns, and the fact that you are free to choose your own playstyle. The game does however have some shortcomings. For starters the story is kinda bland, and the ending comes suddenly out of nowhere. The game is too short. The new voiceactor for Sam Fisher is ATROCIOUS. Seriously! I havent heard a voice that monotonous since... well... HAL 9000 from the movie 2001: a space odyssey (only that was monotonous on purpose). Sam Fisher's new voice is not the only problem with him. Sam Fisher doesn't have much personality, and is a very boring for a main character. He is kinda smug and not particularly likeable. I didn't find the rest of the good guys (Grim,Isaac and Charlie) that interesting either, but thats just my opinion. The main villain Sadiq, really steals the show. He is both charismatic and intimidating, and has a playful approach to the evil deeds that he must carry out. The game is fun to play if you are willing to overlook its shortcommings. I recommend it to all stealth-fans :-) 7/10			"

												I have to say. Did not believe it and ignored it after Conviction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It is not an old splinter cell, but give you multiple choices, which old one did not offer in such a scale. Setting it up on realistic difficulty leads into very interesting and creative gameplay. Only negative thing is that I am tired of saving the world all the time. The story was tense and animations/voiceover excelent, but you can make it with a bit of a more decent and realistic story. Totally the best thing is the cooperation and the way it is composed into the main campaign in a form of side missions. Sadly I have no friend who would like to play it with me, so playing it with randoms is a bit of a matter of a luck, but for a long time I did not have such a funny coop experience.			"

												Despite being somewhat casual (you know, mass culture means profane more often than not, especially with Ubisoft latest trends), this game's exception in that it has surprisingly polished playstyles and difficulty settings to fit every taste - whether you're a sissy one button shoot'em up grunt or hardcore stealth fan that feels aroused when actually ghosting around without touching or disturbing anyone. Yes, the game can be played like Conviction OR like Chaos Theory - the choice is yours and it's great to see that Ubisoft have learned from their past mistakes with Double Agent and Conviction. One can say that this game takes and combines all the best feats of other Splinter Cell installments - except for the split jump of course... We miss you, mate!The main plot is a bit dumb... Dramatic, with good scriptwriting (scriptwriters know the trade more than you'd expect - Guantanamo Bay, Stuxnet, Denver Int. Airport bunker and etc.) but still closer to Hollywood reality than to actual life... Yes, this game has coop and multiplayer. I haven't tried the latter yet but coop is nice - probably even better than in Chaos Theory since you have more missions to play and they're more diverse.			"

												First of all, I am a huge fan of the Splinter Cell series.Now with that out of the way:This game improves where the 2 last ones failed; it adds the option to play missions in full stealth with no kills, Conviction didn't give us this kind of option I even played the whole game using H2H takedowns with the gun hidden so that I could excuse it as non-lethal.Double agent had the gameplay of Chaos Theory (The best in the series) but it failed in delivering good missions especially with the trust meters.This game is good to play with friends in CO-OP and in VERSUS mode, the VERSUS mode is practically dead now but you might still be able to play it with some luck and timing.

												At first glance, with his accessible gameplay and rich in possibilities, aesthetics rather successful and excellent soundtrack, no doubt that this new episode of Splinter Cell should attract a maximum of players. Especially between the single player modes, cooperative and multi, diversity seems assured, as the life that looks important. In short, all good perspective ! However, one year after his release, the game was abandoned by Ubisoft. Unfortunately, it is infested with cheaters and glitchers, too many people have tampered with the game.			"

												Finished this and overall it was a very good game. It did a great job of implementing all play styles (panther style for me), the maps were good in size and had multiple areas of attack, graphics (maxed settings) were great as was the sound. I was able to fully customize all controls the way I want without 3rd party software. No FOV slider but the default was just fine and I only had one crash. Total game time says 19 hours but I'm pretty sure I left Uplay running after I quit the game a few times and Steam still detects this as a ""running game"" so its probably more like 13-14 hours. Ending was crap though felt very rushed with nothing answered, bummer. Also not having Michael Ironside as the voice of Sam Fisher should be considered a felony punishable by slow death. The new voice was not too bad but it was NOT Sam Fisher, also why the ♥♥♥♥ did they change the way he looks? His face looks nothing like the old Sam, dumbass decision. It really feels like you are playing a totally different main character based in the same world, really sucks If you are a fan of the Splinter Cell games this is a must play. I rank this pretty damn close to Chaos Theory, my personal favorite.			"

												They replaced the voice of Sam Fisher, so prepare yourself for that downside if you're a fan of the series.  It's weird to not hear the voice you've grown up hearing for the character, but I got over it fairly fast.The coop elements are great in this game, with some missions that are entirely coop oriented.   It captures the feel of the older games where you and a buddy could just sneak through entire areas stealthily, with some areas being high action and fast paced.If you hated the last of the series, this one probably won't turn you around.  The game play is mostly the same, just with a few different gadgets.You have to solve some missions without alerting enemies or being detected, forcing stealth game play at times.  Others you're given more freedom to beat them however you please. I had a ton of fun playing it, with a few hair pulling moments in coop where we'd have to replay an area several times due to one or the other half messing up something.			"

												DO NOT buy this game! You have to download and run UPlay to play it, and for a lot of people, regardless of how powerful their gaming rig is, it just wont play. looking online, there are problems with this running going all the way back to a year ago, and still ubisoft has not fixed the issue. I've tried every fix that people have suggested and none of them work for me or many others. So buy at your own risk. If it plays and goes more than 23 minutes without crashing, you are one of the lucky ones. If it crashes at the first mission load screen, forget about ever getting it fixed and just write off the money you spent as a lesson learned about UPlay and Ubisoft			"

												Not gonna lie, this is one of my favorite games.  My goto during the looooong wait for MGSV, and even afterwards.  There's a great variety of missions, and the challenge is extreme.  There's no ""wrong"" way to play, however - there are great rewards for staying as stealthy as possible, and improvising when you can't.  The only sad thing is that the multiplayer is dead - spies vs mercs is a thing of beauty.tl;dr - This game does tactical stealth espionage better than everyone in the genre.			"

If this would have been a prequel i would have been fine with it not happy just fine.You cant replace the humor old Sam had when grim made him feel old or Lambert and Sam had old people talks.All in All Story 5/10, Gameplay 8/10 ""The items you get are fairly fun like the Tri Roter"" Stealth 5/10 "" It doesnt feel as hard as the older games like in Splinter cell The first level you start up you can just barely sneak by  these guards because its so bright around the area! Combat 10/10 ""Combat has been improved amazingly sense Conviction and the older games im tired of just tapping my mouse on a guys head and have the bullet fly past him, Theres realistic and then theres just stupid."" Overall its a pretty solid game but i recommend Chaos theory for a Better Splinter cell experiances. Also  the PC controls arent the best thing ever i recommend using a Controller if you can.Sense some people cant really understand ive owned this game before so i have to write this in			"

												I was willing to give this game a chance after the horrible nightmare that was Splinter Cell Conviction.  Interviews with the devs highlighted a game that they promised would go back to some of Splinter Cell's roots while still moving the franchise forward, which is fine by me.  The execution of the game however still lingers like acid reflux that no amount of tums can put down.The uncomfortable:Long gone is Splinter Cell alumni Michael Ironside, the voice of Sam Fisher for the 6 other (I think 6) entries in the franchise.  This is such an immersion breaker for me, and I suspect anyone else like me, that is a long time fan of the series, but not the direction it took in Conviction.Michael Ironside IS SAM FISHER, the choice to either not hire him on purpose or for whatever reason is such an alienating mistake for long time fans of the franchise.  But here's the thing, Ubisoft does not care about the old fans of this series, they care about getting new fans and competing with call of duty.The EXTREME:The game gets in your face, granted in a bit more subtle way than Conviction did, but there's this intense Monday night drama!!!!!! feel to the game as you're introduced to your new base, your team, and your goal to protect the world from the most extreme bad guys ever by going to the limit!Promises broken:I was interested in the 'ghost / phantom / whatever' game play mode, one that emphasized a pure stealth approach to the game, because that's what the old Splinter Cells were about, because Sam wasn't equipped for extended combat.  So the idea appealed to me, as well as the insistence that there were multiple ways to clear an obstacle...Which there are, to a degree.  Movement is still totally linear, it would be nice to have this game take some lessons from Assassin's creed and give you a bit more of an open world to use in your approach to a target.  I understand a narrative needs to have some degree of linearity to move a story to a point, but the ""alternate paths"" feels like:""You approach the bad guy, do you want to close one eye, both eyes, or have both open?!""Everything leads to one point, and if you are trying to play a zero kill playthrough there are moments where they do their hardest to make that improbable.  You have to exploit the AI to make it work.The missed opportunity:I'm done with this franchise, I'm done as long as they are going to use Sam Fisher and Anna Grimmsdottir.  The new guy playing Sam is just plain terrible at voice acting and has no shred of the gravitas that Michael Ironside brought to the character.  And why is Grimm suddenly this extreme beeyotch of a boss?  She was never like that in the original run, she was an operational advisor for Sam.  I could see her succeeding Lambert, but not in this way.Honestly, if they ditched the old characters but still called it Splinter Cell, I'd have less of a problem with it.  Give me new characters in a Splinter Cell world you want to redefine, my brain won't reject it as much.Because I grew up playing Splinter Cell, I knew Splinter Cell, and this game is not Splinter Cell.Conviction was a terrible turning point, they invalidated amazing character choices from Double Agent.  Sam's daughter is killed in a random accident and Sam hits rock bottom, taking on an absolute zero success chance suicide mission to infiltrate the JBA.Hey, guess what, his daughter is alive, because feels!  It was a setup so bad guy number 7 could get to him and enact Independece Day Initiative!Sam is so deep undercover, the only man who knew he was is dead, Sam's on the run as a wanted terrorist, he may have to straddle the line just to survive and clear his name!Nope, never mind, let's throw him in some cliche plot where the world is in danger and he must auto murder people and explode helicopters to do it.Blacklist is more of that, it's more from people that just don't get what Splinter Cell was.  Which is fine, if you didn't grow up with Splinter Cell, or better if you stop trying to hang on to the old guard.""Hey, drink this.""""What is it?""""It's coke""""Um, okay, wow this is gross what is it?""""Just brown water I found and put in a coke can.""""That's gross, wtf?""""Here, let's put some real coke in there, now drink it!""""But it's just dirty water with coke!""""RARRARARARRGGGHHHH!""""Dude, wth?""""PUSH Y BUTTON TO DRINK COKE AND WIN GAME!""

												So far, this is my least favorite game in the Splinter Cell series.  The game puts more of an emphasis on movie style action than on the stealth game on which it was based, and worse still is the fact that this game doesn't do it nearly as well as Conviction did.  Instead, this game is trying to a hybrid of earlier games with the cinematic style of conviction, and it fails to live up to either expectation.Other things that are bothersome include the voice acting (none of the original voice actors apparently returned for this entry) and the changing of characters.  Somehow, Sam Fischer is becoming younger all the time.  When I first started playing, I didn't even realize that we were playing as Sam and friends, until they beat you over the head with his name a few times.  Using a mouse and keyboard to play this feels like a no-no.  Blacklist was definitely created with consoles in mind, so you'd want to pick up a PC-controller in order to really play this.Overall, I'm unhappy with this game.  It's not unplayable, but it lives far from my expectations set by previous installments in the series.  I must even commend Double Agent for its ability to be a better game than this one, and it was previously the worst in the series.  This one has fitted its way into that lowest slot now, leaving me waxing nostalgic about the previous adventures of Stealthy Sam instead of this Keifer Sutherland in 24 wannabe.Do not recommend.			"

												I like the overall execution of the game, since it's a few miles ahead of Conviction.  But on the other hand, it's many miles behind Chaos Theory.  The controls are weird, especially since they're mainly geared for third person shooter fans, rather than fans of the original trilogy.  For instance, there is no jumping like normal, only contextual parkour (let alone split-jumping, which I loved doing), and the ""action"" button takes too much use in everything: jumping up walls, activating objective stuff, switching cover, etc.  The cover system is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ since it's so restrictive; movement speed is very slow (it is for me, but I'm not sure about everyone else) when leaned up against cover/walls, and there's not much skill involved with using cover-based stealth in this game, since it takes intelligence and patience for the right moment to break cover and concealment just to sneak by the normal way without reliance on the cover system.Here's a funny mishap with controls: the ""bash door"" key is the same as the ""takedown"" key.  I tried to KO a guard who was standing right next to a door.  Unfortunately, senile old Sam Fisher decided to kick the door instead, alerting the guard, causing him to get lead in the head.  Dammit, Sam!  You're out of your mind!Oh yeah, there's no variable speed with PC controls.  You have to zoom in with your weapon to move absolutely silently, since crouch-walking can still be heard.  You'd have to buy special stealth boots just to not be heard when crouch-walking, which doesn't make sense since Sam is supposed to be an old guy who naturally moves slowly, and therefore shouldn't be too loud when CROUCHING.  And the mouse sensitivity is painfully bad, especially when I maxed it out.  My hand must patiently align the crosshairs when aiming just so I hit the light bulbs correctly.  I hate low sensitivity because it means less precision with aiming, especially when I'm very particular with where I throw/shoot my gadgets.The main redeeming quality I found was the loadout customization plus the balaclava mod I downloaded.  Now, Sam's ugly de-aged face is properly covered up with a ninja mask that suits his job like in the days of old.  I don't recommend using the balaclava mod in conjunction with a Spies vs Mercs session, since the multiplayer servers might process the modded files as malicious code that could lead to banning.  If you're gonna use the mod, use it only for single and coop, and deactivate it when playing multiplayer.  Since I got this game during the sacred Steam Sale (all praise Lord GabeN), I managed to get the Homeland DLC for cheap, allowing me to start the game with Sam's original suit plus Archer's suit.Lastly, I think the level designs and story are extremely buggy.  The levels are broken up into small sections, where any actions taken in previous ones won't affect you in later ones.  Like if you left a corpse in a brightly lit hallway, just waiting to get spotted, it won't matter once you leave the section because all that stuff will disappear and de-rezz to make room for the next section.  The checkpoint system hates your guts, since certain parts of the game force you to painfully redo stuff all the way at the beginning of the auto-save point when there are so many guards and stuff that you worked your♥♥♥♥♥off to avoid.  Even shot light bulbs and meticulously placed bodies respawn after you restart a checkpoint, even though the game auto-saved in that original state that you purposefully left.  As for story, there are too many forced-action sequences that simply could have been avoided with better writing.  Like the forced alert stage of the Private Estate mission made no sense.  In that mission, Sam decided to hack into the estate's security system to force the bad guy to move to his safe room, of which Sam had no idea where it was because he had to use his sonar goggles to find it.  Dammit, that's not good planning at all.  He should have just snuck into the guy's bedroom while everyone was sleeping and NOT on alert, in order to kidnap the bad guy undetected.Special Missions HQ had to be the worst mission I ever had to do, mainly because of the buggy NPCs and their bouts of stupidity and magical detection abilities, as well as the fact that lots of crap went down in that level story-wise.  First, Sam got into a trap and a firefight in the first few minutes of that level, due to his newly-found senility and stupidity.  Next, he spent the last few minutes of the game desperately trying to escape, only to find a bunch of heavily armed guards and vehicles just waiting for him.  That is not stealthy at all, especially since that missions ends with a UAV segment where you shoot down trucks chasing Sam's van... using missiles and machine guns.  He should have just found a better way into the HQ without relying on an untrustworthy general that led him into a trap, and he should have found a way to not alert the whole place that an intruder was around and messing things up.  His escape should've been stealthier too, without the need for saving his♥♥♥♥♥with drone strikes.			"

												Having played the previous version of it, Splinter Cell Conviction, Blacklist is pretty like the previous game, but with improvements of course. As usual, the game place a huge emphasis on stealth. Fans of games such as Hitman: Absolution will find Blacklist similar in many ways. However, it has to be noted that since Splinter Cell isn't just about an assassination game, it's core gameplay lies in the use of the gadgets given, as you play as a covert op by the name of Sam Fisher. Although running and gunning may prove to be a success in some stages, most of the gameplay require careful use of the various techs given to the protaganist Sam Fisher. Along the way, players can also upgrade their utitlities and weapon array via the in game ""SMI"" (something like a customization and launching of mission menu) Since I have been a long standing fan of Ubisoft Games and Tom Clancy titles, I would like to point out that Blacklist is a game that should not be missed. As much as the emphasis and primary objective of the game is the utilization of stealth tactics and gadgets, enough freedom is actually given to do whatever you want to fit your style of play. In conclusion, I would give the game itself a solid 9/10 (-1 just because if you are a perfectionist like me you would be spamming the restart button constantly after making a mistake, other than that, it is perfect). Get the game, strap yourselves in and prepare for a hell of a ride.			"

												One of the most fantastic games I have ever experienced in my life. The voice-acting is very well done. The story is very intriguing. I put over 24 hours in this game alone through the campaign and 4E side missions. (4E is what they call them). The game play is very fluid. Moving from cover to cover is very nice and well-thought-out. It took a moment to get used to, but once you do it is incredible.Most games these days put you through an 8-10 hour campaign and that's it. But this one is incredible. The side missions are very unique and complicated. The game is linear, but there is a ton of routes you can take throughout each stage. You can go through the whole game without kill a single person if wanted. You have the choice to knockout enemies or kill them.The weapons are very well made. You also have a choice in loud-n-proud or stealth with weapons. Some weapons don't have silencers, some automatically have one built on. There is a TON of choices in weapons.I give this game a 9/10. Most people who are in-love with stuff go 10/10. But, I will probably never give a game a 10/10. There were no problems with it, big or small. The only hate I have is you use Steam to launch it, which launes uPlay, then you can play the game. Little annoying but it's no problem.I played this game through on the Steam Machine (I am a beta participant) and it ran like a hot-knife slicing through butter. I did not use or try the Steam controller on it. But this game was great.If you enjoyed Deus Ex: Human Revolution, then you will without-a-doubt love this game. To me it was 10x's better than Deus Ex and I really enjoy Deus Ex. I picked this game up for $20, it's a game worth $50.The multiplayer is pretty fun too, unless you get levelled with high level players. I haven't played a TON of multiplayer, but with what I have played it is fun. It's Spies vs Mercs. Pretty much a tank vs a ninja. Tanks have limited mobility and ninjas move in the shadows and kill. The gam mode I played had 3 stations. There is a large room the 2 spies need to be in. Once they are in the room it starts to be ""hacked"". You only need 1 spy in there, but there is you and another player. It's 2v2. The 2 tanks search and try to kill you and keep you out before each room reaches 100% hacked. Pretty fun game.Worth the money, give it a try and check it out!(Sorry for any misspelled words or type-o's, the Steam Client doesn't have a function to show you any words that are misspelled and what not)			"

												Another great addition to the splinter cell series. (I personally started way back with the original ""Tom Clancy's: Splinter cell"") Even without Sam's original voice actor, this new one does a very good job in his place. Oh, and the uplay? Doesn't really bug me, just another background program to y'know, just sit there and do nothing while you play your game besides allow you to play it ( and taking up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ memory ) Either way, it's a great game. I don't get ""great"" FPS while playing it, around 35-40, 50 in good places, but Spies versus mercs (What I play mainly) gets great fps, 80+ at times. Overall wonderful game, thanks ubisoft. Oh, and my USB xbox 360 controller works just fine with it. Yay.Oh, ho. You thought I forgot the negatives? Ahaha, no.So, let's begin, shall we? ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pings are very present in SVM, especially when you're in mid-stab animation with someone and JUUUUST as you shove your knife into their neck, suddenly, you're dead. Uplay is just another stupid version of steam. A ripoff, if you will. I DON'T NEED TWO STEAMS, UPLAY. Spies versus mercs is infuriating to play, even as a new player (I am not a new player, for I maxed out everything on the console version- Which isin't as hard as you think it may be.) Stun crossbow is such an annoying weapon, espcially to have it used against you with someone who has basically the best aim in the world, you're guranteed to die about 10 times through the match.Oh, and speaking of matches, are you ready for this? There's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ leave button during the matches. Okay sure, I get the idea of having to play out the whole match, but...REALLY? Suppose you have to, I don't know, tend to something else on your computer and quit the match? Tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ you either force quit the game via task manager or you keep playing.Oh, and SvM is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Mercs ♥♥♥♥ing hug eachother and the only way to get them is to have every spray with machine guns into them.			"

												While the game is top notch in almost every way that matters, there are some important points to consider:The game is VERY easy in comparison to earlier titles like Double Agent though not as simple as Conviction, the conveniently placed hiding places are frequent and diverse. Getting through levels on the hardest difficulty while not killing anyone is not only possible but routine after a few practice runs.The story takes a serious course alteration from earlier titles to fall somewhere between a hollywood action thriller and tv action comedy. The main drag is bits of forced humour (mainly coming from Charlie and the ""prisoner"") that simply feel completely out of place with the pace of the rest of the story. Those two things aside, the game is solid, gameplay mechanics and controls are very well done and levels are diverse and complex in nature so that there is often oppurtunities to explore alternate routes through missions.If you play the multiplayer replayability would probably increase but as is, it becomes a fairly forgettable title once you have gotten the hang of mechanics enough to solo wave after wave of charlie's survival missions.

												I picked this up during the 75% off Ubisoft weekend. Played through the single player and all of the co-op missions. I hadn't played a Splinter Cell game in many years, probably not since I played the original way back on 02' on my PS2. I was pleasently surprised by this game. The game itself looks great and the gameplay was pretty good as well. Although I was and still am confused with the whole Ghost, Panther, and Assualt scoring in the game. Assault I get, but the other two I'm not completely sure on how they differentiate between a Ghost kill and a Panther kill.If I had anything bad to say about the game, it would be the default key layout, but that was easily fixed by remapping the keys the way I wanted them. Anyways, I said I played through the entire SP portion of the game which I normally don't unless a game grabs me, which this one obviously did. I also played through all of the co-op missions with my son and had a blast with those, especially the defend the embassy missions. Didn't get to play very much of the MP as there are not a lot of people playing since the game is already 6 months old.All and all it was a pretty good game and worth the purchase price.			"

												My only problem is Uplay, other than that, it's a good game.Stealth is pretty hard (Perfectionist) but not as hard as the previous Splinter Cell game (Chaos Theory, Double Agent, etc.)Graphics, it's wonderful.Animation is outstanding, when you want to take down enemy there will be animation, you don't just punch them and done. You'll strangle the enemy and it'll take some times.Combat (Gun), it depends on what difficulty you're play.A.I. also depends on difficulty.Story is pretty nice, but story is based on opinion so your opinion may be different.Multiplayer is pretty good, more gamemodes.The problem with the multiplayer though, sometimes you can't join your friend's session. You should contact Ubisoft Support to help you because not all problems are the same.			"

												A solid entry in the SC, but still not it's best. As someone who enjoyed the improved tactical options and fluidity of movement in 'Conviction', I can say this takes that even further. Options to complete missions completely undetected, or by taking out enemies quick and quietly are a blast. I understand why the 'assault' option of guns blazing is there, but it's really not that much fun for me. It doesn't feel like how an operative like Sam Fisher is meant to operate. My biggest complaint is that while this is the best splinter cell gamer mechanically, and is plenty of fun, it doesn't feel much like a 'sam fisher splinter cell game'. The character is not there. It's not too shallow to say, but  a new actor created dissonace I could never fully ignore. A new character, under the tutelage of Sam Fisher would have been more interesting, and understandable, especially considering how much younger Eric Johnson--Sam's actor--is. Lastly, the dissonace is a matter of the game's general tone, as well.  You can be stealthy, but it's to a backdrop that's still  too actiony, too Jack Bauer, and too bright.			"

												After the utter disapointment that were PC Double Agent and Conviction, needless to say I approached blacklist with a great dose of apprehension. In Splinter Cell terms, that means crouched and in the darkness. Be advised though, if you see pets crouched and in the darkness, usually it's a sign they are about to deliver a smelly present in your living space. But that's not the point.So, it was a good thing that I was actually pleasantly surprised by Blacklist. Blacklist have a more open approach to missions which is akin to what Phantom Pain did, namely giving you a hub/nexus from where you decide which mission to tackle next, and which you can upgrade as well as upgrade and purchase gear using money you gain by completing said missions.I kinda like that, and it helped the game controls were refined and actually more instinctive than in previous games. They aren't perfect, and prompts are still wonky, but it's getting there. Instead of forcing us into a more actionny gameplay that was in Conviction, Blacklist come back to the fundamentals of stealth, albeit with a more simple system than in Chaos Theory. It also leave room for people who want to play a more action type of gameplay, though it's not avaible for all missions, some having stealth requirements for scenario reason, and for people who don't want to go non lethal and avoid ennemies, but want to sneak around and cut throats and shoot people in the head. Each mission has you rated in thoses 3 categories(Ghost, Panther and Assault), and add replayability if you want to get the best score possible for each.Side missions are gimmick missions with special conditions, which offers challenges and story in equal measure, and can, best all, be played in coop, which is a pretty good thing. Coop is actually pretty fun and usually enjoyable, albeit it suffers from a chatting system not working for a lot of people. The problem is, your partners aren't always playing with a style similar to your, so trying to get ghost mastery when you have a guy near you who is going loud and lobbing incendiary grenades everywhere can be quite a nuisance.The single player campaign is mostly well done and enjoyable(though it has a few missions that are pretty annoying and meaningless and which could have been served better with a very long cutscene instead). Characters are surprisingly pretty well done, and we get to see how Sam has changed due to the events he had to go through. It hits a more grey moral zone. The story still has big chunks of Tom Clancy in it, and you will find again the cliché of having antagonists who are pretty much against the US dominion and must try very hard to not say ""capitalist pigs"" every 5 seconds. The problem I have with that is it doesn't convey the real problems some of the third world countries, or war torn countries can have, or what their opinion really is. Honestly the US dominion did nothing in comparaison to the british colonialism in term of dammage, and the US have considerably reduced their involment in foreign affairs thoses last years, so the whole thing kinda falls flat. So for me, the motivation of the antagonists is misguided and overplayed with very little true motivation, which is a shame, because they could have done something better with their villain. Also it's difficult to not think of Kane from Command&Conquer every time you see the guy.The missions are pretty well designed, offering multiple avenues of approach, and usually giving you tools to deal with what you have between you and your objective.Weapons are a bit disappointing in the sense most of them are pretty useless if you don't go loud, and among the others, some are simply way better than all the rest. Some balencing would have helped here. Especially because if you go ghost, you won't be using any or so little, because you will need non-lethal stuff.The soundtrack though is extremely dispointing, often on the border of electronic stuff which is more of a pain than anything. The pause menu soundtract being the main offender.Be also aware that the game is buggy, especially in some places where you climb/chimey, and where you can get stuck if you try to do something like shooting or opening a window. This happens way more than it should, and it's a complete soft lock forcing you to restart at the last checkpoint. The game will also get into windowed mode for no reasons at time when you launch it, and all the times you alt-tab.Overall this is a pretty enjoyable experience, at least worth 20 euros to me, but which you will probably be able to get for less(you can get it for 5 during a sale, which is a pretty good deal). People are still playing the game at the moment of this review so finding a coop partner is easy, which is appreciable.Also, if you are still crouched in the dark, at least I hope you dug a hole and plan to cover it before you leave...

												Each year, I usually like to go back and replay some old games that I really liked and havent played in a while, and this is definatley one of them. I've played through the campaign of this game at least 3 or 4 times now and I just love coming back to it each time. There is tons of replayability with different ways to play the game, plus the really fun multiplayer, and Co-op! Sure, the multiplayer doesn't have very many players but you are still able to find games in it, as long as you can wait for 2 or 3 minutes to find one. I highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes games with fun, challenging gameplay, different strategies, a great story, and tons of replayability. Good job on this one, Ubisoft! Please make another Splinter Cell game, no more Assassins Creed!			"

												My only problem is Uplay, other than that, it's a good game.Stealth is pretty hard (Perfectionist) but not as hard as the previous Splinter Cell game (Chaos Theory, Double Agent, etc.)Graphics, it's wonderful.Animation is outstanding, when you want to take down enemy there will be animation, you don't just punch them and done. You'll strangle the enemy and it'll take some times.Combat (Gun), it depends on what difficulty you're play.A.I. also depends on difficulty.Story is pretty nice, but story is based on opinion so your opinion may be different.Multiplayer is pretty good, more gamemodes.The problem with the multiplayer though, sometimes you can't join your friend's session. You should contact Ubisoft Support to help you because not all problems are the same.			"

												A solid entry in the SC, but still not it's best. As someone who enjoyed the improved tactical options and fluidity of movement in 'Conviction', I can say this takes that even further. Options to complete missions completely undetected, or by taking out enemies quick and quietly are a blast. I understand why the 'assault' option of guns blazing is there, but it's really not that much fun for me. It doesn't feel like how an operative like Sam Fisher is meant to operate. My biggest complaint is that while this is the best splinter cell gamer mechanically, and is plenty of fun, it doesn't feel much like a 'sam fisher splinter cell game'. The character is not there. It's not too shallow to say, but  a new actor created dissonace I could never fully ignore. A new character, under the tutelage of Sam Fisher would have been more interesting, and understandable, especially considering how much younger Eric Johnson--Sam's actor--is. Lastly, the dissonace is a matter of the game's general tone, as well.  You can be stealthy, but it's to a backdrop that's still  too actiony, too Jack Bauer, and too bright.			"

												It's a solid stealth game that is more in line with the older games than its predecessor, Splinter Cell Conviction. Of course, you have the option to either go in loud or be silent and tactical, but be prepared for serious resistance. There's quite a few complaints about the change in voice actor compared to the previous games, but I think the new guy did quite well and executed the character perfectly. The game is also well-optimized (better than Conviction), and I can run it on hardware that's dated by a few years. I have yet to play the multiplayer or co-op, but the single player campaign alone stands up on its own merits. I'd give this an 8 out of 10, its quite worth the time you'll put into it.			"

												Another great addition to the splinter cell series. (I personally started way back with the original ""Tom Clancy's: Splinter cell"") Even without Sam's original voice actor, this new one does a very good job in his place. Oh, and the uplay? Doesn't really bug me, just another background program to y'know, just sit there and do nothing while you play your game besides allow you to play it ( and taking up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ memory ) Either way, it's a great game. I don't get ""great"" FPS while playing it, around 35-40, 50 in good places, but Spies versus mercs (What I play mainly) gets great fps, 80+ at times. Overall wonderful game, thanks ubisoft. Oh, and my USB xbox 360 controller works just fine with it. Yay.Oh, ho. You thought I forgot the negatives? Ahaha, no.So, let's begin, shall we? ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pings are very present in SVM, especially when you're in mid-stab animation with someone and JUUUUST as you shove your knife into their neck, suddenly, you're dead. Uplay is just another stupid version of steam. A ripoff, if you will. I DON'T NEED TWO STEAMS, UPLAY. Spies versus mercs is infuriating to play, even as a new player (I am not a new player, for I maxed out everything on the console version- Which isin't as hard as you think it may be.) Stun crossbow is such an annoying weapon, espcially to have it used against you with someone who has basically the best aim in the world, you're guranteed to die about 10 times through the match.Oh, and speaking of matches, are you ready for this? There's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ leave button during the matches. Okay sure, I get the idea of having to play out the whole match, but...REALLY? Suppose you have to, I don't know, tend to something else on your computer and quit the match? Tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ you either force quit the game via task manager or you keep playing.Oh, and SvM is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Mercs ♥♥♥♥ing hug eachother and the only way to get them is to have every spray with machine guns into them.			"

												If you get this game, its probably for SvM because it is an actual stealth ONLINE MULTIPLAYER game and it also has a single player campaign, Im not dissing the campaign, i just have not played it becauese I wanted the multiplayer.  Turns out it is the best $20.39 I have ever spent on it.  Its so good that i have had it for 2 days now and allready have 31 hours.  This game redefines the word ""Stealth"".  It comes with wall climbing, pipe shimmying, vent crawling, and much more! There is like 20 different ways to kill someone, wheather it be pulling them off the edge of a building to there death, or dropping from the cealing slitting there throat, or just the plain ole shoot em in the face with a big gun.  Me personaly do not like playing Merc as much as i like playing Spy.  Mainly because no matter what, the spys allways know where you are, and i dont really like that feeling.  Plus the spys are more adept in offence then defence, and Mercs are more into Defence then Offence. Now there are some cons to this game. #1 you have to do 1 story mode mission to unlock multiplayer, Only reason i didnt like that was because of I specificly bought the game for Multiplayer. #2 THE EFFING DRONE, Man the drone online is absolute NOOOOOB, it should not have been added, if you are Hacking a terminal they just use a drone to go in and blow you up, Its also like the easiest thing to buy. #3 Ranking/Matchmaking system is weird, I dont want to be playing with level 56 people if i just started, It has happend were i was matched with level 3 and 4s which at the time I was a 4 and we were facing all level 56s. They completly obblideratied us.  #4 when ever I leave to open up a new tab then go back in to Blacklist, it puts my game into windowed mode, and there is no way to change it unless you leave matchmaking then go back to the menu then click settings and change it, or go into game and do it. Although there are some minor pros, I honestly LOVE this game I hope to start on the Single Player soon. -Wigger "

												This is the best Splinter Cell game (since) forever. Interesting story, eye candy presentation, freedom of movement, stealth action, in your face bang bang action. Everything is here and you can play it like you want to. I prefer sneaking, so I completed the game without killing anybody, but it's completely viable, and often easier, to just run guns blazing killing everything. It's like the first Splinter Cell, just better in almost every aspect. Almost, as I liked the movement speed slider from the first game better than one run key. Other than that everything is better.The single player campaign, plus Grim's stealth missions, took me almost 30hrs. You can probably do it in half of the time, but even then there are more solo missions, more coop missions and the multiplayer. Definetely recommended.			"

												While the game is top notch in almost every way that matters, there are some important points to consider:The game is VERY easy in comparison to earlier titles like Double Agent though not as simple as Conviction, the conveniently placed hiding places are frequent and diverse. Getting through levels on the hardest difficulty while not killing anyone is not only possible but routine after a few practice runs.The story takes a serious course alteration from earlier titles to fall somewhere between a hollywood action thriller and tv action comedy. The main drag is bits of forced humour (mainly coming from Charlie and the ""prisoner"") that simply feel completely out of place with the pace of the rest of the story. Those two things aside, the game is solid, gameplay mechanics and controls are very well done and levels are diverse and complex in nature so that there is often oppurtunities to explore alternate routes through missions.If you play the multiplayer replayability would probably increase but as is, it becomes a fairly forgettable title once you have gotten the hang of mechanics enough to solo wave after wave of charlie's survival missions.

												I legitimately enjoyed this game, so you might wonder why I'm not recommending it.  I've just had a slew of problems with this game, mostly attributed to uPlay.  I really enjoyed playing the single player campaign; the UI looked good and the gameplay was solid.  It provided a decent challenge, and always gave incentives for doing it the hard way.Now, on to the problems I had:Since this was on Uplay and not steam, there were plenty of foreseeable errors, but when speaking exclusively about the game and the problems in game due to uplay, they made me want a refund.  First and foremost, at some point in time, my internet bugged out and after closing the game and relaunching it later, I couldn't get past the loading screen.  I disabled online syncing and went offline on Uplay, and the game ran fine.  I ended up beating the game in this fashion and when I re-enabled online mode for Uplay, it continued to lock up at the load screen.  After talking with Ubisoft support, if the online cloud data gets corrupted, they can't sync it with your offline data.  Furthermore, after telling me this problem was ""resolved"" I ended up having a clean wipe.  All my save data was gone.  I think the cloud data overwrites the offline data, so I lost all my hours of gameplay.  I talked to Ubisoft a bit more and they said I was just♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck.Game was good, 8/10Uplay and dealing with all that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, 0/10			"

												This game is my favorite shooter in the 20+ years since Doom was released on PC.  This game features an excellent story, great coop, and exciting multiplayer.  It even features a type of intelligence minigame that rewards you with score multiplayers in SP and MP.  There are tons of customization options for your gadgets and weapons.  You can: be a heavily armored door breacher that flashbangs then shotguns everything in sight,  be a ghost who uses stealth and gadgets to distract and complete the mission without ever being seen, be a sniper who lays proximity mines for would be flankers, also be an assault rifle weilding/grenade sniping nightmare.  The AI is one of the best out there (but still can be exploited) where the enemy that spots you will run to cover, summon reinforcements, and then they will either: surround you, stack up and rush you, or spread on a line and toss grenades at you.  Increasing the difficulty to perfectionalist will challenge.  The graphics are still great compared to current games.  The combat animations are superb, done with heavy emphasis in krav maga.  The single player dialogue amongst the characters make sense.  It's like jumping into a Clancy novel.  Multiplayer is smaller, sometimes only 2vs2, and you may have to wait a couple minutes for a fourth player to join in off hours (the game doesn't appeal to the COD crowd).  You play as either a stealthy spy, or an armored merc in an objective based game.  You don't get spawn killed in this game, don't have kill streak paladins raining death on you, there's no running around two minutes just to get killed by a guy camping out either.  The learning curve for the spy can be stiff until you understand the maps and how to misdirect and lead mercs into traps.			"

												You like sneaking through shadows? Waiting for your enemies to make a mistake and strike? Or do you like to run and gun? In Splinter Cell Blacklist you can do both or a way between it. I admit that i didn't expect much of the game as i bought it. Somehow i played every Splinter Cell game till now, but it never really got me hooked. I always liked the sneaking tho. The same happened to me with this game. But hold on. This doesn't mean the game is mediocre. The story is decent enough. Easy to follow, but not really impacting. The characters are good. Some known characters like Grimsdottir are  on board as well as new ones like the CIA Agent Briggs. The first time you see Briggs you know that he was mostly included to offer a partner for co-op gameplay, which is part of the game as well. Nonetheless i liked Briggs at the end. He showed a lot of character and the development of not only him, but all characters is very well done.The mission design is the usual Splinter Cell formula. Hack computer system, defuse bombs, rescue hostages, kill HVT's. Nothing really new, but still enough to never get boring. Aside from the Single Player missions there are also 20 side missions. 5 for infiltrating and hacking, 5 for assassination, 5 co op exclusive missions and 5 last stand missions where you have to hold of against an ever increasing number of enemies. The side missions are good enough. Offer a bit of plot even if not that much.The game has really good mechanics. The sneaking feels great. The ""stay in the shadows to not be spotted"" is great and is really accurate. The game calculates the chance to be spotted very precise or so it feels at least :) The climbing is abit limited because of the amount of spots you can climb but still enough to create a lot of opportunities to sneak by your enemies or or engage them from different angles. The cover system is solid. You can take cober at basically everything. With a press of a button you can switch covers or leap over em. Pretty solid work in that regard.The AI is good. On higher difficulties they spot a bit too fast and easy, but it was never really unfair to me. Most enemies have their patrol route and like in every splinter cell game. you have to be silent and study their routes. Especially if yo uwant to be as sneaky as possible.The animations look okay for the most part. Only the sprinting looks a bit weird. Sam looks like he♥♥♥♥♥♥his pants. Other than that the movement animations look good. The facial animations not so much. SAm and all the other characters look like they are not allowed to open their mouths when speaking. Also the faces look like out of stone. The graphics are decent. Nothing really astonishing, but they are good to look at. The amount of gadgets and weapons are massive. Each weapon customizable with a lot of different attachments. Gadgets are a lot too. For every situation there are gadgets that feel good to use. Being more sneaky or more action oriented? Doesn't matter. You have either sleeping grenades or frag grenades. Each item has to be bought from ingame cash you gather during missions. You can achieve extra cash by doing some hacking inside each mission or capturing high value targets. So that should be it. I really liked the game. I have not really much to complain about. The game is good. Bought it on sale for 5 bucks and i have to say it was worth it. The game is entertaining.  "

												I would recommend this game to any fans of Chaos Theory and Conviction. You get the best of both worlds... Sure it's not the 100% stealth game style as Chaos theory and the few Splinter Cell games before it but I guess Ubisoft wanted to evolve their splinter cell games to a new style of play. As much as I miss Deniable Ops (Spent almost 100 hours on Deniable Ops on console version). There are side-campaign missions that kind of replace it and not to mention spies vs mercs so I guess I have other things to do. The actual customization is also a great new feature in the franchise. Suit and weapon customization makes for different styles of play such as guns-blazing or pure stealth or even a mixture of both. The mechanics have been improved a lot from Conviction and, as mentioned before, you get to see somethings return from Chaos Theory. The only thing I am a little dissapointed on is that at the beginning of the game there are too many desert-daylight-middle eastern missions. I kind of miss the dark, night time missions but you do get a handful of those in the game. Take it from me, an avid Splinter Cell Chaos Theory and Conviction player, this is a very good game. It is worth the price.			"

												About the only bad thing about this game is that Ubisoft Toronto prioritized in-game cutscenes to such a degree that Michael Ironside could no longer fill the role of voicing Sam Fisher. Instead he is voiced and mocapped by the rather generic sounding Eric Johnson, which put a real damper on my experience.Otherwise the game is great. Gameplay is an acceptable modernized Splinter Cell adaptation. Stealth is center to the experience and purists, like myself, will be satisfied. Execution is not as intricate as that found in Chaos Theory. Sam and Briggs only have two speeds, fast/noisy and slow/quiet. You don't have to worry about what you are stepping on giving away your presence. Newcomers to stealth will face much less frustration in achieving victory in this game than they might in the three first games of the series.If you have a friend (I hope you do), then you will have a blast in the many CO-OP missions the game offers. Note that you should bring some extra patience. That is a multiplayer stealth pre-requisite, of course.			"

												This is one of the most amzing Splinter Cell games out there. It has all the elements that you expect from the game series. The multiplayer and coop features are awesome! Playing coop with a friend has been nothing short of amazing, the guns, the gameplay, the graphics, and the customisability. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking a a challenging game to play by yourself or with friends. If I could give it a thumbs way up, I would.			"

												Think Chaos Theory + Conviction only it is more like 70% Conviction and 30% Classic.Still, this game really suprised me with the loads of side content there is to do. The main missions vary in length depending on if you go guns blazing or stealth and have a great amount of variety when it comes to environments. Missions generally involved getting from Point A to Point B and stealth boils down to hiding around corners/chest high walls, or finding a secret path that circumvents traditional paths. Playing on Perfectionst (Highest difficulty) from the start proved to be just right when playing stealthly. Hostiles are very alert and can catch wind of you if you are in sight in about 1-2 seconds. Lower difficulties will allow you to see through walls, mark and execute (from Conviction) and re-supply at checkpoints.I can only comment on the Co-op portion of the multiplayer as I have yet to try Spies vs Mercs. The side missions allow for a Co-op partner to play alongside you and the experience is quite enjoyable. There are some gimmick co-op style moves that can be done but it is mainly only for progression. The most satisfying experiences are when both teammates sync up and perform take outs fluidly. The actual servers and latency are generally fine but I have had too many issues with the game soft crashing in long On-line sessions.I can recommend Splinter Cell: Blacklist at its current $30 price range for anyone who is a fan of previous Splinter Cells (Especially Conviction) or stealth games in general.

												[NOTE: up to this date, this is the only Splinter Cell game that actually works with the XB360 controller accurately].Awesome game!Good graphics, interesting story, and epic gameplay with a lot of replay value.For those that are wondering and enjoyed previous Splinter Cells, this game is a perfect mix of SC:Conviction and the classics. The game has a more ""optional"" approach as to give you the choice of playing Stealth-ly, Panther-ly, or Assault-ively. Meaning you can choose to play like the classics (slow, steady, sneaky and tense like in the classics) or sneaky but aggressive like in SC: Conviction.The game re-introduced the highly innovative yet super underrated multiplayer Spy VS Mercs, an awesome gamemode where Third-Person Action-Adventure Spies take on First-Person-Shooter Mercs in a highly tactical and teambased match.(Also, impressively enough the new voice actor did good in maintaining the style Michael Ironside gave to Sam Fisher.I still prefer Michael Ironside, and it is a huge shame for fans of the franchise as myself that he's not the voice actor anymore, but the new voice actor did good enough)			"

												*Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist - 6/10*Dissapointing and average singleplayer, but a solid co-op and a very well made multiplayer.Singleplayer - 5/10The singleplayer falls flat. What is suppose to be the best part about Splinter Cell is the worst. This game feels more like an action movie than an actual tension filled stealth game. There's even obvious moments in the campaign where they are forcing the action onto you. You feel like a one man army with all your mines and grenades. And with all the enemies, tight spaces, and bad level design, it feels like the game wants you to go all out rambo. These are the problems that make the game a straight forward action shooter. That's the complete opposite of what Splinter Cell is suppose to be. Where's the REAL tension that the older Tom Clancy games provided? And the plot, oh god, It's terrible... Cliched, unoriginal and generic. ""Oh my god! Terrorists are attacking USA, WE MUST STOP THEM!!!"" Simple and stupid. The characters all feel dull and generic, even Sam Fisher himself. Also, where's the dark humor that the other Splinter Cell games had?Co-op - 6/10Now this would be a wonderful co-op if it weren't for the several bugs it has. It's still very fun. There is a decent variety of missions and all of them are exciting and fun to play with a friend. Unfortunately, everytime I play the co-op I encounter several bugs. I always encounter another new bug sooner or later. Other than the annoying bugs, the co-op is solid.Multiplayer - 7/10The best part of the whole game. Spies vs. Mercs is extremely fun, unique and surprisingly deep. I love it. You play as either the spies who have to hack 3 locations or mercs who are heavy gunners that have to stop the spies from doing so. Both teams have different abilities and gadgets. Whenever a spy activates the hack, the match fills with tension. The spy that activated the hack has to hide from the mercs. If the spy dies, the hack turns off. It's awesome when you see a merc go right by you unaware where you are. As a merc, you have to find this spy before the hack reaches 100%. You also have to watch your back as a spy can sneak up behind you and kill you. There's also a good amount of strategy involved and it makes for a very fun competitive game. There are only 5 gamemodes, but SvM Blacklist is really the best one. The others are okay, but nobody really plays them unfortunately. Sometimes, the game doesn't balance out the teams very well. I've experienced matches with high levels vs very low levels. The turning radius in this game is also pretty wide for some reason. Other than those problems, the multiplayer is great.			"

												Boy this game was chore to finish.This is the first Clancy game I've played, and I expected a semi realistic stealth shooter, which allowed you choose a playstyle and go with it. I had read about how the playstyles were categorised as ghost, panther and assault.I soon found out that the ghost playstyle is often either absolutely forced, or basically the only viable option. I hate playing ghost.Moreover this game doesn't have quicksaves, and sometimes the checkpoints are imo way too far in between, so sometimes I had to put the game away simply because I had enough of playing the first 80% of a checkpoint for the 10th time.Some side missions don't have checkpoints at all!The AI is simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and your opponents have infinite gadgets (e.g. drones and grenades).The damage model is also incredibly unrealistic. A bullet into the unprotected face of someone wearing a bowl helmet just makes a *PLING* sound and the helmet comes flying off. You can also put 3-4 bullets into the leg of someone with no apparent leg armor, and he just runs away. Oh and the heavies can step on a proximity mine without getting handicapped. Etc. etc...The presentation is excellent on all accounts though. Well, the textures were a little lowres if I had to mention something.If you love playing ghost style you'll probably like this game (although there is actually some forced FPS action in it too, not that I'm complaining).  Huge disappointment for me though: 55%			"

												If you liked Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, you're bound to like this game!  Much of those gameplay features from the former make their way back into the newest installment of the Splinter Cell franchise.  While it doesn't make sense that Sam Fisher looks and acts like he's in his thirties (when he's actually in his sixties), along with the fact that Michael Ironside doesn't voice the gaming icon this time, the new Fisher makes espionage look bad♥♥♥♥♥  Not only is there a campaign to weed through, but endless waves of a terrorist hunt type game-mode that is addictively fun.  Equally as entertaining are the stealth missions that must be accomplished without letting the enemy know that you are there.  Perhaps the most solid experience of this game comes from the multiplayer.  Chaos Theory's legendary Spies vs. Mercs does a comeback in this game.  Offering the ability to be a spy or a mercenary, you are free to choose your play style.  Want to go full-on Rambo on some stealthy saboteurs?  Be a mercenary!  You are equipped with the ultimate firepower and protection.  Feel like sinking a karambit into those lethargic brutes?  Take on the role as a spy!  Sneak your way across the map using the latest stealth technology to dispatch your enemies.This offers a fresh take on competitive multiplayer and will leave you playing for hours on end.  Upgrade your gadgets and character as you rank up to take on the more veteran players.  This upgrading model is also present in the single-player side of the game... allowing you to become a more powerful Sam Fisher.  Something else worth mentioning... there is a cooperative portion of the game that I haven't yet tried.  It plays through some of the same levels as the single-player missions, only you can do it with a friend.  That's cool!The game has plenty of features to keep you occupied for a good while.  I give this game a 9/10... it loses a point for getting rid of Michael Ironside, and making Sam so young to the point that he can scale cliffsides without difficulty.Besides that, you wouldn't be disappointed if you bought this game.

												Not even close to the best Splinter Cell game in the series though it's a step in the right direction. As someone who likes playing these games on the highest difficulty, this game is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t problems and cheap mechanics. Regardless of what difficulty you're on, if you're in pitch blackness, you should NOT be seen by the enemy. The enemies in Blacklist have Godlike sight and will see you from a mile away and it takes all of the fun out of playing the game on a higher difficulty.The story is rubbish, the characters are boring and voice acted with no enthusiasm. At the very least, it does look quite nice, but then that's hardly a reason to buy it alone.			"

The story was ok not as good as privious splinter cell game ( which I also recommend. ) I did not play any of the co-op campains. The levesl offtered multiple solutions and paths to achiving goals.

												Well,♥♥♥♥♥♥ what can I say. This game tries to combine the stealth from the original big trio, Splinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow, and Chaos Theory, with the action from Conviciton. I think it successfully does so, and the gameplay is quite satisfying, however the amount of problems with the game aside from gameplay are overwhelming. This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port, for one, and it's made apparent when you start the game and have to watch the intro to the first mission and enter gameplay before being able to even change video settings. Mine started windowed at 800x600. Spies vs Mercs is back, and so is the piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥lobby system. With so few players, chances are the host will leave if you push his♥♥♥♥♥♥in too far, closing the game and causing everyone to lose their progress, or it will just shut down with the same result. Roughly half of the games I was in ended this way, no ♥♥♥♥ing joke. A large amount of bugs, crashes to desktop, blatant port issues, and probably the dumbest storyline of the series means I can't recommend this to anyone. Also Sam is some random army♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥voiced by a different guy, and he seems completely unrelated to any of the other games.			"

												Graphics, voice-acting, the action-movie story, all of that stuff is great. But it’s really the stealth mechanics, the great upgrade system, and the really tight controls that make this game so much fun.Missions are varied, and level design encourages exploration, finding secret paths, and rewards playing as a “Ghost” most of all. The stealthy, non-lethal path doles out the highest rewards. It also poses the greatest challenge, though run-and-gun in this game isn’t really a viable option.			"

												Just bought the game, and played not longer than 1 hour. Below are the true reviews!Pro: 1. Good graphics2. The weapons, armor upgrades etc are something to look forward to and interesting.3. Gameplay so far (30 mins) are good!Con:1. Can only play for 23 mins before the game crashes. Game will crash precisely on 23 mins for me. Searched the forum, some will crashed at 25 mins, some 50 mins. But the timing is precise, only different timing for different users. And no, my PC spec is way higher to support this game.2. User cannot save the game manually, all depends on auto-save. Meaning if you get caught in a stealth mission, most of the time you need to go ALL the way back to the front and re-play everything again! And since there's no manual saves, I need to complete every mission within 23 mins (before it crashes), if not, I'll have to re-play the mission from the beginning.3. Cannot go online. Meaning cannot redeem those ULC that I've paid.4. Since cannot go online, meaning cannot join multiplayer game.Still waiting for Ubisoft to fix my problem. Until they're fixed, especially for crashes, I'll not recommend this game for everyone.Update on 10 March 2014:The only fix for the above mentioned problem is to reformat the HDD, and re-install a clean windows. Everything works fine after that. Now onto the real gameplay, co-op mission is definitely fun. And I'm actually enjoy myself. Kudos for a good game from Ubisoft. Only drawback is.. well.. re-install windows is kinda tedious just to play the game don't you think?			"

Posted: February 27, 2014
												So, I am a little torn up about this game. There is some good writing, some great gameplay, and some good graphics, but I have just been playing some of the side missions and dang, this game can be punishing.Now, I do not mean difficult here. It can be. What I mean is that some of the side missions will require complete and total stealth and force you to completely restart if you do not perfectly stealth it. These would be the Grim missions. Look, Ubisoft, mid-game checkpoints ARE GOOD. I like stealth games, but if you are constantly asking me to retrieve 3 objectives and then extract on the other side of the level without a single mid-level checkpoint, that is a recipe for rage, not tense and gleeful stalking. Don't go Super Meat Boy on your checkpoints but at least give us something.Now, I do say this as both a warning and a message to any stealth developer: this game is good but seems to have occasionally missed some good stealth game design points. Overall, I enjoy my time with this game, but its memory is marred by the somewhat crummy side-mission designs. Currently, I have played some of side missions for Kobin (kill x terrorists, y more will show up if you are detected), Charlie (defend position from x waves... no it is not that easy) and Grim (get these 3 objectives and then extract without being spotted, complete mission redo if you are). Grim's missions are punishing, and you will probably rage-quit if you screw up on that last objective (which I have done several times, because PRECISE TIMING IS REQUIRED in some cases). Charlie's missions can be a drag (kill a guy or two, run and hide, wait until everyone calms down, repeat; also it has a checkpoint after each wave), and Kobin's missions can be just as boring if you are trying to stealth them (also no checkpoints here). Thankfully, there is some decent level design, and the campaign missions are pretty tight (complete with checkpoints, thank heaven). I have not played any of the co-op missions yet as I have yet to get my friend over to try them out.For mechanics, I like how the mark-and-execute mechanic is now a set number across all weapons, that you can REMOVE weapon mods and select your own loadout (it is fun to see what you can do with a loud-only setup), and that there is a large amount of weapon and gadget variety. I also like that there are multiple ways to get through a level, and that there are new non-lethal ranged weapons (only 2-3, though, but that's better than hand-to-hand only). Additionally, the ability to carry more gadgets is a huge plus in my books, and the new stealth notification of your lights flaring up in shadow doesn't marr the visuals by doing that black-and-white thing that Conviction did (although it does make me want to scream ""How can you NOT see me!?!"" to every enemy when it comes up).I do feel that the new ""press B to attach to walls"" is a step backward though. I really liked the smoother hold-left-trigger-to-stay-attached-to-walls mechanic from conviction, even if it made gunplay a tad more difficult (but it did make for a smooth stealth system with a decent incentive to not go all gung-ho and stay in cover).In the end, I tenatively recommend this game. Good graphics, good gameplay, and the new voice actor for Sam Fisher is pretty good (although I do miss Michael Ironside's growly quips on getting older from Chaos Theory and his threatening tones from Conviction). However, expect the game getting a lot more rough when it comes to the side missions, which need to learn the difference between punishing and difficult.SIDE NOTE: I am playing this game on ""Realistic"" difficulty only, so I cannot comment on Easy, Normal, or Perfectionist difficulties and their changes.

												Proper Splinter Cell game right here, solid gameplay and level design that suits any play style - you can sneak around without perturbing anyone, you can sneak around and whack the tangoes over the head, you can sneak around and kill said tangoes, you can go in full guns blazing and lobbing grenades, or any combination of the above.The only complaints would be the somewhat corny dialog, kinda meh story and the fact that some missions are very obviously split into a few smaller ""sub-levels"".

												No idea why it's taken me so long to review this game. This was easily my favorite game of 2013. I'm currently playing MGS V, and I feel so incredibly limited by Snake's moveset that I had to come back and play Splinter Cell. I get it...two completely different experiences...yadda yadda yadda. When I want an awesome stealth actioner, I'll take Blacklist over anything. I've beaten this game on Perfectionist so many times. It's awesome every time. Taking different approaches in each level. Every takedown feels righteous. Everything has impact. Karambit stealth kills are spectacular every single time. They never, ever get old.Among my favorite stealth games of all time. While the story isn't all...whatever...at least it's not a convoluted mess as in the case of whatever passes for a story in the MGS world these days.Get this game. It's cheap...but I'd still recommend purchasing it at full price.			"

												TL;DR #2: Everything is fantastic, just buy it already! If its on a sale, there is even more of a reason to buy it. Best stealth game atm in my opinion and it's just 30 (or less) Euros anyways.TL;DR: Excellent stealth game, more human-like enemies than 99.99% of the other games out there (sometimes a bit blind), three classes which you do not have to specialize in if you do not want to + you can play them all in one mission, you do not select a ""class"", but rather get rewarded with points for what type of kills and actions executed, you do not get screwed over by going Assault (loud) as the enemies are balanced for both loud and stealth, this goes the other way around as well, stealth is just as good as assault and if you get forced to go loud, you can still just sneak away and start doing ghost/predator stuff. Ratings:Voice acting and character models: 9/10Graphics and Environment (if you are really into this, the game has an excellent shadow system and almost every light is breakable): 10/10Enemies: 10/10CO-OP: 9/10 (we should have gotten more of these...)Multiplayer: 8/10 Weapon and customization: 10/10----------------------------Game = 10/10This game is without doubt one of the most awesome stealth games you can get at the moment. It seems like no one designs good stealth games anymore, but Blacklist has definitly got it. As pleny of people have mentioned it has three possible playstyles, but it is NECESSARY to mention that you can mix them as well. You do not choose a class and roll with it but you can rather level them all in one mission. You get points based on what you do and the most dominant playstyle will be shown for the mission. There is also a little bonus (""gold medal"") if you manage to stick mostly or completely to one playstyle. Your equipment contains a tooltip of what the creators recommend them to be used for (for example smoke is tagged as Ghost, Flashbangs are tagged as Panther and Grenades as Assault), still, you can use flashbangs while going ghost. Anyways, the game has:- Ghost, where you do stealth the old fashioned way. Do not get spotted and do not kill. YOU CAN STILL USE NON_LETHAL! Meaning you do not have to dodge every enemy if you so feel like it.- Panther, where you do stealth and you kill at the same time. You kill everyone, but also remember to hide both yourself and dead enemies in the shadows. You enjoy the use of guns and stealth at the same time. As long as you are not detected you will get panther points when using lethal takedowns. (this is the playstyle i enjoy the most, but ghost is also really fun for me).-Assault, for those who just like to go rambo on everything that moves. You basicly just stock up on grenades, explosive equipment and shotguns/assault rifles with attachments like sights, extended mags, modified barrels to increase damage and so on. I myself recommend to play every style to see which one suits yourself best. Enemies in this game are balanced and the only unit i find a little ridicilous is a guy that sends out RC-cars. When several of them come onto the map and there are fifty RC-cars that try to blow you up, it feels a little tiring (good thing they can't climb walls like you can!) If i recall correctly you will only meet many of these RC-guys on the Special missions (optional CO-OP missions) anyways, making them ok to deal with.  I would like to add that these are not the typical enemies of games today, as they are a bit smarter. They will try to flank you if you stay in one spot. This also goes for stealth, since if they see you while you move from one spot to another (if you give them enough time to spot you), they will come look for you and search the surrounding area. Also they are not enemies who can radio contact their friends just by looking at you, so if you get spottet you still have some time to react before they call up reinforcements/warn their buddies.As for the game in general it handles all the classes perfectly. If you love to go assault, it will not screw you over by making it insanely hard. This also goes the other way around. If they ""force"" you to go loud/assault on a mission, you can still just escape and run behind enemy lines, while using the shadows. I love it and as others mention, uplay messes up your playtime with some games, and i do have over 100 hours in the game.If its on a sale, there is even more of a reason to buy it. Best stealth game atm in my opinion and it's just 30 Euros anyways. "

												I am giving this game a thumbs up not because it is a good game, which I've yet to determine, but because of the hidden DLC that comes with it.  Oh, I'm not talking about UPlay, no no, I'm talking about the hidden 'Gypsy Curse' DLC it comes packaged with.  This special DLC really brought the excitement to life.Think I'm making things up?  Ha, I wish.After running the gauntlet that was UPlay to get it installed and play it, I thought my trials were done, that I'd survived the worst the game had to offer.  What more could it do? I sat back and enjoyed being a badass black ops♥♥♥♥♥kicker.  Life was good.Then my computer started making a weird noise.  Well, these things happen, everything seemed to be working fine.  I loaded into a mission, a pretty tough mission, and I put in the work to succeed.  Just as I'm about to exfiltrate and claim my reward, the Curse strikes.  My computer powers off suddenly.  What?  What could have happened?  Just a power surge, just gotta turn it back on and pick up where I left off.No, wait, the power supply completely blew.  Burnt right out.  Dead.  Kaput.  Executed, if you will.  For the first time in my computer owning life, a part of my computer actually kicked the bucket.Now I have to go out in the middle of the Chinese New Year and try to find a PSU.  Yeah, right.  Well, somehow I manage it, so the next day I'm out a hundred bucks and a day of holiday, but I can get back to playing. Alright!I load back into that mission, and ghost it like a boss.  I turn to head for exfiltration, and the game closes suddenly.  Is it the power supply again?  No, it's the Curse.  This time in the form of a forced Windows update.  No warning, no option to delay, just bam, restart.  What could have been so important?  A security update for a version of Word I don't even use.  Do I dare boot the game a third time?  Do I risk suffering the curse?  Can I afford to?  What might happen next?  ...literally as I was writing that last sentence my virus checker asked if it could restart the computer.  Play the game if you must, dear reader, but beware always...the Gypsy Curse! Also UPlay, which really sucks and added several hours to the set up of the game.			"

												In short, Blacklist is a solid, enjoyable stealth title that nails the basics and has enough features to justify its price tag.Fans who were unimpressed by Conviction might see this as more of a return to an older style of Splinter Cell. Sure, it has the fluidity of Conviction (and the maligned 'mark and execute' training wheels), but gives more freedom of engagement. In many ways, I feel that Blacklist attempts to cater to all tastes, because you now can choose to play missions loud with all guns blazing ('assault'), strike from the shadows ('panther') or slip past enemies like a ghost ('ghost') ... or some messy combination of the three. Sure, some maps force stealth, and you'll certainly want to pack heavy armour if you intend to keep it noisy; but, crucially, it offers a little something for everyone. Purists might be frustrated by this as dumbing down, but the highest points are still awarded for 'ghost'. I imagine that the game is trying to jettison the brittle nature of some stealth games where a single alert is enough to fail the entire mission. If you want pure stealth, then you are free to play the game in that fashion. However, I will say that this game lacked challenge. The level design is almost too helpful, with a multitude of helpful vents and ledges, strategically placed to avoid encounters. The gameplay is very solid and improves from Conviction. The easy switch between styles and quality level design make it a fluid and enjoyable experience. Attempting to master different styles adds replay value, and there's a great quantity of side missions that can be done cooperatively which is always amusing. My gripes centre on the game being too easy, a rather tenuous multiplayer (see below) and a slight lack of imagination. The story is passable, but the missions are too diverse. Although this makes them interesting as standalones, the whole narrative doesn't fit together so well. I didn't feel as engrossed as Conviction. The multiplayer is an interesting one. It styles itself as an asymmetrical multiplayer pitting mobile, gadget wielding spies against armoured mercs. It's a rough attempt to bring the stealth action into a multiplayer format. Whilst it sounds interesting on paper, I wasn't convinced, and I imagine that it's probably dead now anyway. Nonetheless, the single player is certainly enough to get your money's worth. To sum up, Blacklist is fun and enjoyable to play. It's accessible to all, but stealth purists might find it too easy. The multiplayer is unnecessary, but there is plenty of fun coop action and a reasonable amount of replay value. Overall, I think it does plenty to justify its price and is worth playing for fans of the series (or similar games like Hitman) or those looking for something different.			"

												This is the only Splinter Cell I've played on PC - the others I've played on consoles, many years ago.I thoroughly enjoyed this - stealth mechanics work for the most part, gunplay is lovely, graphics are quite nice, levels designed well (Seriously, what is it with Ubisoft and oil facilities? They must love them!) And the storyline isn't all that bad. There are also many weapons with appropriate upgrades alongside several gadgets and customisation features (give me sleeping gas arrows any day). Side missions are fun and long - adding to the storyline of about 10ish hours, maybe 11.There are a few downsides  - there is an FPS mission with an alternate character. Its not bad, just a bit clunky. This has uPlay, but it kept out of my way and never interrupted me.  These are minor downsides - but the game is worth it.And if you refuse to buy it because of uplay, well, you're stupid.			"

												Very hard game with no way of saving the game so if you die or get soptted you need to do the mission from the start! Even though its hard I like the graphics and its very realistic too. Oh and there is dogs in here :P yay ♥ ok its more open world than the previous splinter cell games, you get to walk around and talk to your crew and each person you meed has side misisons and things you can do for them.. I love this game ♥			"

												Oh Lord... I bought into another Call Of Fisher game... but now with added first person mode when you play as the mercs or Briggs... However it did manage to bring back the stealth element to the game thanks to some of the lovely new gadgets and short cuts... Or if you just wanna blitz through the game... just like Call Of Fisher: Conviction, Grab that AK and shoot your way through because you're nothing but a filthy casual. I however will try to complete this game full Panther mode.Oh PS. Because i'm sure some of you are like ""But the multi player"" Yes... The multiplayer is good... on one gamemode and that is SvM classic because there's no bull♥♥♥♥♥♥it's spies with a knife and Mercswith an M4 and firstperson view equiped with mines and hand grenades however the spies are fast, they can climb walls, thay have nightvision goggles and EMPs so it's pretty fair all the spies have to do is hack 3 consoles before time runs out and the mercs have to stop them however in the new and improved ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mode SvM blacklist they have... custom loadouts... and unlockables... Again... Making it seem more of call of duty than splinter cell like FFS... the spies can have a loud♥♥♥♥♥assault Rifle and the mercs can get X-Ray Vison turning the game into nothing but a team deathmatch rather than a cat and mouse type of game. anyway my ratings:Graphics: Solid 9/10Gameplay once again 9/10Story: 7/10Multiplayer: I wanna give it an 8 so badly but that other game mode brings it down to a 6/10Overall: 8/10 I will most likely revisit this Call Of Fisher: BlackList			"

												Graphics, voice-acting, the action-movie story, all of that stuff is great. But it’s really the stealth mechanics, the great upgrade system, and the really tight controls that make this game so much fun.Missions are varied, and level design encourages exploration, finding secret paths, and rewards playing as a “Ghost” most of all. The stealthy, non-lethal path doles out the highest rewards. It also poses the greatest challenge, though run-and-gun in this game isn’t really a viable option.			"

												Greetings soldiers,As a man with real hopes of becoming a Special Forces Officer in the military, this creation of genius by Tom Clancy is a masterpiece of tactical espionage, skill and the recklessness and selflessness that those without name do unto us. From going in ghost style, to being a panther (my favourite) and systematically eliminating enemies such as Iranian commandos (QUDZ force) or renegade american freelancers, this game has it all. The graphics are fantastic for 2013, the gameplay is immersive and the campaign is quite extensive if one seeks to earn all achievements and replay value is high, 9.5/10 would shoot out all lights, draw in enemies singularly, then systematically throw smoke and eliminate them one by one...as a natural born military man would. One plays the role of Sam Fisher, the familiar face of the Splinter Cell title, a Navy SEAL turned CIA special operations ""splinter agent"", whom along with his team ""Fourth Echeleon"" and of the HQ of the namesake, must save America and the Western World from the terror of terrorism, but not as we traditionally associate it with. A rogue MI6 agent, without spoiling the plot targets important US assets as an attempt to bargain for the withdrawal of all US troops in international territories. Gameplay is fast paced, or slow as you prefer, and the AI is quite receptive to sounds and things that you do, shooting out a bulb nearby an enemy alerts them for instance. Oh and shadows....are your best best best best asset and friend, being in the light, well i'd recommend you shoot first and ask questions later friend.Captain Rob out!			"

												Well, there is alot I could say about this game. It was a great, action packed stealth action game, with an -alright- story, but the real fun comes from something they had discarded from the series titles that preceded Blacklist. Actually letting people choose how to get to the objective, and how they wanted to go through a level- leading to a great campaign mode that as I said, the story was meh, but it felt VERY fun to just drop in and play. However, this does have a drawback- later in the campaign, half the mission you switch to an FPS mode, stealth shooter hybrid... something that just felt wrong the entire time I was playing it. However, they did test the waters a bit with it, and for that they get points. They do lose those points instantly for MAKING AN FPS SECTION IN A ♥♥♥♥ING STEALTH GAME. ♥♥♥♥in' ell.Oh, also, this game should be bought anyway for one reason- SPIES VS MERCS MAKES ITS RETURN! Back in Chaos Theory, the new game mode was added and loved by many fans, but taken out of later games in the series. It returns, and makes a huge splash in my mind as a must have multiplayer game, just for the strategy and action that needs to be taken in each fight and map. The Spies use intellect and cunning to get data and other objectives completed, using the shadows and a small list of gadgets to help them stop the other team- The mercs. Mercs use firepower and teamwork to get the best of those pesky spies, and defend the objectives set out before them. Inside the campaign mode there is co-op selectable and solo missions. Solo missions are campaign only missions, while the co-op takes the form of the lowly side mission, which has the same amount of set up and planning that the campaign missions have, just with a feeling of less impact upon the world in the game, besides a bar that slowly fills up. Campaign missions give you tons of cash to upgrade and acquire much needed gadgets and weapons that will effect not only the firefights, but your complete strategy as well. Money can also be used to buy upgrades to the ""Paladin"", your base of operations that takes the shape of a giant plane, fitted with the best technology the goverment can give. To wrap it all up, Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a great new addition to the series that needed a breath of new life, and with the integrated campaign mode that carries over into all other modes, along with Spies vs Mercs and lots of options for side missions to Co-op or handle alone. I can honestly give this game a very good recommendation with its content for solo play- and lots of stuff to do with other people. If you are thinking of picking this game up for full price- be wary. Some may not see this as a good 60$ game- the price tag it has without discount. Even though the game is great, I recommend waiting for at least a 50% off or so before nabbing this bad boy.			"

												I have played the single player and all the co-op modes and have had a great time in all them. The game is fun to me anyways, but the great part is a majority of the players I've played with were nice, patient, and used good teamwork to beat the missions.   I have not tried the multiplayer portion because honestly I'll probably never play it. As far as graphics, they look really good on all ultra settings and I haven't had any crashes. The only negatives I see is sometimes the cover system is hard to get in and out of at random moments, you can get stuck to where you can't move after duel boosting, and I hate that it requires UPlay. Overall, a great experience so far, and looking forward to putting many more hours on the game.			"

												Definitely the Splinterest Cell. This is by far my favorite game out of the series and I've played all of them since the original. For once, the game largely lets you play the levels you want (with one caveat, there are optional levels where an alarm is instant failure, so you can't go loud on every level). If you want to Ghost through without leaving a trace, that's valid. If you want to kill everything in your path and never be detected, also valid and rewarded. I haven't really tested how the run and gun plays yet, but that mode isn't really for me anyway. Don't let the first mission turn you off (Where you get heard by enemies from 20 feet away while moving crouched). Apparently, you have 0 stealth rating in the first mission, so it feels really hard to sneak up on anyone. That goes away once you move on into the next missions.The game has 11 missions that must be done in order as part of the campaign, but between each of those missions, you can complete any number of side missions that you want, which are every bit as fun if not more fun than the core missions, to me. The side missions I've seen so far take the flavor of 'Kill/knock out everything in the level' or 'plant 3 wiretaps/bugs/etc without setting off any alarms'. In addition to the side missions and campaign missions, there's a healthy number of unlockable upgrades.			"

												Great game, great Stealth,Combat and something in between. I won't start counting down everything I liked because its too much. The stuff I didn't like : The game was crashing towards the end for me on the prison mission at the same time if I took too long. Also the multiplayer, dont know if its only me but I am having trouble finding games, most of the time the game makes me host one and wait hours for people to join.			"

												Movie-quality presentation and immersion combine with frustrating gameplay. This is a game that, for the typical gamer, likely plays out in one of two ways. 1) You tried the stealth approach because it seemed like the best idea, and you failed. 2) You have given up on the stealth approach and now everyone will die. The good news is that for the most part, Blacklist understands that you will just not get people to stick with stealth when it's this stupidly annoying, so you have 3 paths available to you in many cases. Sometimes, though, just like the ""stealth"" missions in Assassin's creed, you are forced to avoid detection, and those can be nightmarish, controller-throwing, descents in to infuriation. And yet, the whole game is so well done that you can almost forgive it for this. Almost. Most likely though, you will play the game with trepidation, hoping that just shooting everyone is an acceptable path through the mission and push forward to enjoy the storyline before it inevitably decides that it's time for a pure-stealth exercise in repetition and futility. Some will say that this is all a deficiancy in my ability to play the game - maybe so - but games should be quite forgiving to the player that wants to enjoy the story and experience, and well, Blacklist just isn't. If you aren't great at pure stealth, then no difficulty setting will save you. So do I recommend this game? Absolutely! It's fantastic - just, practice all your techniques for controlling stress, and remove breakable items from your general vicinity if you aren't the greatest at sneaking around in a game that isn't forgiving.

												If you liked Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, you're bound to like this game!  Much of those gameplay features from the former make their way back into the newest installment of the Splinter Cell franchise.  While it doesn't make sense that Sam Fisher looks and acts like he's in his thirties (when he's actually in his sixties), along with the fact that Michael Ironside doesn't voice the gaming icon this time, the new Fisher makes espionage look bad♥♥♥♥♥  Not only is there a campaign to weed through, but endless waves of a terrorist hunt type game-mode that is addictively fun.  Equally as entertaining are the stealth missions that must be accomplished without letting the enemy know that you are there.  Perhaps the most solid experience of this game comes from the multiplayer.  Chaos Theory's legendary Spies vs. Mercs does a comeback in this game.  Offering the ability to be a spy or a mercenary, you are free to choose your play style.  Want to go full-on Rambo on some stealthy saboteurs?  Be a mercenary!  You are equipped with the ultimate firepower and protection.  Feel like sinking a karambit into those lethargic brutes?  Take on the role as a spy!  Sneak your way across the map using the latest stealth technology to dispatch your enemies.This offers a fresh take on competitive multiplayer and will leave you playing for hours on end.  Upgrade your gadgets and character as you rank up to take on the more veteran players.  This upgrading model is also present in the single-player side of the game... allowing you to become a more powerful Sam Fisher.  Something else worth mentioning... there is a cooperative portion of the game that I haven't yet tried.  It plays through some of the same levels as the single-player missions, only you can do it with a friend.  That's cool!The game has plenty of features to keep you occupied for a good while.  I give this game a 9/10... it loses a point for getting rid of Michael Ironside, and making Sam so young to the point that he can scale cliffsides without difficulty.Besides that, you wouldn't be disappointed if you bought this game.

												I think this game was wrongly called 'Splinter Cell: Blacklist'. I'm sure it fully deserves the title ""Watch_Dogs"". It's all about watching running dogs around you and feeding them with the best lead goodies. The creative group of Ubi developers created a unique feature that will destroy thousands of your nerve cells - dogs plus moving drones. Actually, you don't need to know lots of information about this ""stealth""- action game, just remember the main ""D"" words - DOGGIES, DRONES, DEATH and DUMB soldiers with shields. Oh my god, 11/10!!!P.S. The following review describes co-op missions about the assault on various embassies, the impressions from another sides of game may vary.			"

												Awesome. From somebody that hasn't followed the Splinter Cell franchise I can quite honestly say that this game is just awesome, and the gateway that made me enjoy the stealth category.You earn cash for everything you do, and you can spend your money on suit upgrades (stealth or armour), guns (and gun attachments), gadgets, plane upgrades (your mission hub is on a plane), and different types of goggles. Your cash and upgrades are both tied into the singleplayer campaign and cooperative missions, so all cash and upgrades will be carried over to either. There are plenty of coop missions to play with friends or strangers, and many ways to complete them (replayability).You will be rewarded in three different categories depending on the way you play: Ghost (remaining undetected and only knocking enemies out), Panther (remaining undetected but killing enemies), and Assault (as you can probably guess, going guns blazing), it doesn't matter what you do, you're doing it right.The multiplayer Spies Vs. Mercs is a whole other game in itself, can be played casually or competetively with ranking, and upgrading similar to SP and coop missions. The objective for the Spies is to hack three terminals in the map, and the Mercs job is to put a stop to it.The Spies play in third person perspective, they are nimble, able to scale walls and enter vents, have a selection of vision modes, and have a deadly melee attack (can also use guns but at short range).The Mercs play in first person perspective, they are bulking, only able to vault obstacles, a selection of vision modes based on sound/sudden movement/electricity use, can use assault rifles and shotguns etc at long range (also have a deadly melee attack but can take a while to get used to).The multiplayer is 2 aside, or 4 aside depending on the game mode. The servers aren't as popular as you'd hope but finding a match is not difficult at all.People have had issues with uPlay but try not to let that name put you off, I've personally not had any trouble with it myself (not trying to rub it in to the people that have).If I recall correctly the game can be played with a controller, but I honestly don't see why you would want to as the game feels great to play with kb/m.Paying full price for this game, I'd say don't.Paying 50-75% off? Yes, yes yes yes.			"

Really puts you in the mindset of a splinter cell - outside of hte government but in place for the good of the government. Multiplayer is a little flaky but the singleplayer campaign is ultimate. I enjoyed the coop missions but I do receive a fair bit of lag in them.Good storyline. Kept me involved and interested for more. Players who are fans of the Thief series will enjoy the stealth mechanics.Bottom line: get this game. End of transmission.			"

												Just started playing the campaign in Co-Op and it's awesome. We both had some troubles getting into controls (he uses mouse/keyboard, I'm using XBox360 Gamepad) but after that this game is pure fun.Some Missions must be done non-lethal, other let you do what so want, so you can go full stealth or rampage. The Upgrade system supports your playstyle and let you customize Sam a bit. All in all I give this game 8.5/10 points.(1.5 points down for those beautiful graphics you can't enjoy because a) it's too dark or b) you turned on Nightvision)			"

												I am giving this game a thumbs up not because it is a good game, which I've yet to determine, but because of the hidden DLC that comes with it.  Oh, I'm not talking about UPlay, no no, I'm talking about the hidden 'Gypsy Curse' DLC it comes packaged with.  This special DLC really brought the excitement to life.Think I'm making things up?  Ha, I wish.After running the gauntlet that was UPlay to get it installed and play it, I thought my trials were done, that I'd survived the worst the game had to offer.  What more could it do? I sat back and enjoyed being a badass black ops♥♥♥♥♥kicker.  Life was good.Then my computer started making a weird noise.  Well, these things happen, everything seemed to be working fine.  I loaded into a mission, a pretty tough mission, and I put in the work to succeed.  Just as I'm about to exfiltrate and claim my reward, the Curse strikes.  My computer powers off suddenly.  What?  What could have happened?  Just a power surge, just gotta turn it back on and pick up where I left off.No, wait, the power supply completely blew.  Burnt right out.  Dead.  Kaput.  Executed, if you will.  For the first time in my computer owning life, a part of my computer actually kicked the bucket.Now I have to go out in the middle of the Chinese New Year and try to find a PSU.  Yeah, right.  Well, somehow I manage it, so the next day I'm out a hundred bucks and a day of holiday, but I can get back to playing. Alright!I load back into that mission, and ghost it like a boss.  I turn to head for exfiltration, and the game closes suddenly.  Is it the power supply again?  No, it's the Curse.  This time in the form of a forced Windows update.  No warning, no option to delay, just bam, restart.  What could have been so important?  A security update for a version of Word I don't even use.  Do I dare boot the game a third time?  Do I risk suffering the curse?  Can I afford to?  What might happen next?  ...literally as I was writing that last sentence my virus checker asked if it could restart the computer.  Play the game if you must, dear reader, but beware always...the Gypsy Curse! Also UPlay, which really sucks and added several hours to the set up of the game.			"

												This is the only Splinter Cell I've played on PC - the others I've played on consoles, many years ago.I thoroughly enjoyed this - stealth mechanics work for the most part, gunplay is lovely, graphics are quite nice, levels designed well (Seriously, what is it with Ubisoft and oil facilities? They must love them!) And the storyline isn't all that bad. There are also many weapons with appropriate upgrades alongside several gadgets and customisation features (give me sleeping gas arrows any day). Side missions are fun and long - adding to the storyline of about 10ish hours, maybe 11.There are a few downsides  - there is an FPS mission with an alternate character. Its not bad, just a bit clunky. This has uPlay, but it kept out of my way and never interrupted me.  These are minor downsides - but the game is worth it.And if you refuse to buy it because of uplay, well, you're stupid.			"

												I have played the single player and all the co-op modes and have had a great time in all them. The game is fun to me anyways, but the great part is a majority of the players I've played with were nice, patient, and used good teamwork to beat the missions.   I have not tried the multiplayer portion because honestly I'll probably never play it. As far as graphics, they look really good on all ultra settings and I haven't had any crashes. The only negatives I see is sometimes the cover system is hard to get in and out of at random moments, you can get stuck to where you can't move after duel boosting, and I hate that it requires UPlay. Overall, a great experience so far, and looking forward to putting many more hours on the game.			"

												This review will be detailed, if you would like to see my general thoughts, scroll to the bottom.This review will cover the following:- Singleplayer- Multiplayer- Bugs- CustomizationSo, to kick this off, I'll give you a flashback, back in 2013. Being a huge fan of Splinter Cell Conviction, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Didn't preorder, because I was cautious, but nonetheless excited. Note this however, I first experieced my first hours of this on console, and bought the Deluxe Edition recently on sale for $10. The Xbox version was fine, no bugs that were game-halting. It was fun. So here we are now for the PC version.Singleplayer: This is probably my favorite part of this game. The campaign missions have a good amount of replayability, whith the whole Ghost, Panther, and Assault deal. The campaign is fairly long and the story is interesting. They got a new voice actor for Sam Fisher, which disheartened me, but is not a major setback because the new one does well with keeping the same brisk, badass, get-to-the-point-or-I-will-kill-you tone we have all come to know and love. Overall, the singleplayer is fantastic.Multiplayer: Alright, any bugs that are in the multiplayer will be explained in the bugs section. The multiplayer for Splinter Cell: Blacklist is quite fun. The Spies VS. Mercs mode returns and it's better than ever. You can't help but feel a pang of fear when you hear the slice of a blade into your buddy behind you and you turn around to see nothing but your friend's dead body, or the satisfaction of sucessfully performing such an attack on the mercs. The mercs are locked in first person, and can't see into the dark as well, but make up for it in sheer muscle and lead. Spies are locked in third person, and can see very well between light settings. Spies can climb onto or into almost anything, and while mercs can do a little themselves, they mostly just hop over shest high walls or drop to the floor below. Coop is also quite satisfying. It's hard to get a feeling quite equal to you and your bud tearing down a fortress all in silence.. or in glorious charges into the breach. That's possible too. Overall, the gameplay is fun and diverse.Bugs: Okay, here's the party pooper. This game, like most Ubisoft games, have crippling connectivity issues. The singleplayer has little to no problems in terms of bugging out, but the multiplayer is a breeding ground for them. First things first, some people can't connect to the servers. Period. Even after this entire time of being out, Poobisoft can't get the issue fixed, or probably even consider it. Secondly, It's damn near impossible to connect to friends. There was a thread on Steam where someone posted a fix they had, but it was long and complicated. Some people were able to use third party programs where they were able to connect, like Hamachi. This same bug applies to coop, so a fat lot of good that does for you. Some people have even reported issues where they have had UPlay register them running two instances of the game and will refuse to launch. Game crippling bugs like this have been unattended to, and some people have even tried to petition for their money back. Also, at least for my friend and I, ALT+TAB puts you into windowed mode every time you do it. I have also had several times where the game will say ""Not Responding"", then work moments later, then pop up again. This is usually during launch.Customization: This is a bright spot for Splinter Cell: Blacklist. The customization features many new weapons, all having many smaller customizations that can be added to them, like match point triggers, or hollow point ammunition. I was very pleased with the customization.Hello to those who want a simple, to-the-point review of Splinter Cell: Blacklist and hello to those who actually read the novel above. Well, down to the point. Splinter Cell: Blacklist is overall a decent game. The singleplayer is a good length with an interesting story, the multiplayer is incredibly buggy, and likely will never be fixed by Poobisoft, so don't expect easy playing and connection to your friends. Bugs are rampant in the multiplayer, but are mainly involving connectivity. Surprised? I'm not. The customization is very refreshing from earlier titles,  and is very well done. My score for Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a 6/10. It's fun, but the bugs are game halting and ruin its experience for me. BUY IT ON SALE. It's not worth the full price.			"

												Splinter Cell Blacklist is a stealth game, or it is when it wants to be. At the begining it is really fun and easy going but as the game progresses more annoyances start to arise. In order to take someone out you can start making noise which will get you kill or you can go quiet. If you go quiet you can sneak up on enemies and either kill them or knock them out. But, when sneaking up on enemies they will hear you unless you do it fast. Until you start seeing heavys that is. They have heavy armour and the only way to kill them quietly is to sneak up on the but they will always hear you so you can't stealth kill them. Another annoying thing is that enemies start to wear helmets so you can't one shot them and are forced to sneak up on them. This is usually fine until in almost every level you will be in the middle of enemies all close to one another. The gameplay as I stated can be very annoying but the stroy is pretty solid and should be played through. Lastley the voice of Sam Fisher is different from a deeper darker voice to a higher (yet still manley) voice. It was annoying at first but you get used to it.			"

												Very Intense Game, Very Fun, Etraordinary Story and Large amount of Replayability (With Friends). The Game will keep you interested and the visuals are absolutely fantastic. The Game isn't graphics intensive for the quiality of the graphics, compared to something like Saints Row 4 where it'll lag on high with a GTX 970 and still look like ****. The entire Splinter Cell series has always been very promising. I'd reccomend Blacklist to abnyone looking for a fun time and execellent story.			"

												Despite having it delete all my data. I still love this game to death. I'm actually glad it deleted my stuff. The Campain is so fun and addictive. i forgot how easy i had it with all my gear. I strongly reccomend this game to anyone that is a fan of stealth games. although this is also a FPS as well. In SVM you can be a merc which is first person. or you can be a spy which is a 3P. *update* I now have 100 hours on this game			"

												I am giving this game a thumbs up not because it is a good game, which I've yet to determine, but because of the hidden DLC that comes with it.  Oh, I'm not talking about UPlay, no no, I'm talking about the hidden 'Gypsy Curse' DLC it comes packaged with.  This special DLC really brought the excitement to life.Think I'm making things up?  Ha, I wish.After running the gauntlet that was UPlay to get it installed and play it, I thought my trials were done, that I'd survived the worst the game had to offer.  What more could it do? I sat back and enjoyed being a badass black ops♥♥♥♥♥kicker.  Life was good.Then my computer started making a weird noise.  Well, these things happen, everything seemed to be working fine.  I loaded into a mission, a pretty tough mission, and I put in the work to succeed.  Just as I'm about to exfiltrate and claim my reward, the Curse strikes.  My computer powers off suddenly.  What?  What could have happened?  Just a power surge, just gotta turn it back on and pick up where I left off.No, wait, the power supply completely blew.  Burnt right out.  Dead.  Kaput.  Executed, if you will.  For the first time in my computer owning life, a part of my computer actually kicked the bucket.Now I have to go out in the middle of the Chinese New Year and try to find a PSU.  Yeah, right.  Well, somehow I manage it, so the next day I'm out a hundred bucks and a day of holiday, but I can get back to playing. Alright!I load back into that mission, and ghost it like a boss.  I turn to head for exfiltration, and the game closes suddenly.  Is it the power supply again?  No, it's the Curse.  This time in the form of a forced Windows update.  No warning, no option to delay, just bam, restart.  What could have been so important?  A security update for a version of Word I don't even use.  Do I dare boot the game a third time?  Do I risk suffering the curse?  Can I afford to?  What might happen next?  ...literally as I was writing that last sentence my virus checker asked if it could restart the computer.  Play the game if you must, dear reader, but beware always...the Gypsy Curse! Also UPlay, which really sucks and added several hours to the set up of the game.			"

												This review will be detailed, if you would like to see my general thoughts, scroll to the bottom.This review will cover the following:- Singleplayer- Multiplayer- Bugs- CustomizationSo, to kick this off, I'll give you a flashback, back in 2013. Being a huge fan of Splinter Cell Conviction, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Didn't preorder, because I was cautious, but nonetheless excited. Note this however, I first experieced my first hours of this on console, and bought the Deluxe Edition recently on sale for $10. The Xbox version was fine, no bugs that were game-halting. It was fun. So here we are now for the PC version.Singleplayer: This is probably my favorite part of this game. The campaign missions have a good amount of replayability, whith the whole Ghost, Panther, and Assault deal. The campaign is fairly long and the story is interesting. They got a new voice actor for Sam Fisher, which disheartened me, but is not a major setback because the new one does well with keeping the same brisk, badass, get-to-the-point-or-I-will-kill-you tone we have all come to know and love. Overall, the singleplayer is fantastic.Multiplayer: Alright, any bugs that are in the multiplayer will be explained in the bugs section. The multiplayer for Splinter Cell: Blacklist is quite fun. The Spies VS. Mercs mode returns and it's better than ever. You can't help but feel a pang of fear when you hear the slice of a blade into your buddy behind you and you turn around to see nothing but your friend's dead body, or the satisfaction of sucessfully performing such an attack on the mercs. The mercs are locked in first person, and can't see into the dark as well, but make up for it in sheer muscle and lead. Spies are locked in third person, and can see very well between light settings. Spies can climb onto or into almost anything, and while mercs can do a little themselves, they mostly just hop over shest high walls or drop to the floor below. Coop is also quite satisfying. It's hard to get a feeling quite equal to you and your bud tearing down a fortress all in silence.. or in glorious charges into the breach. That's possible too. Overall, the gameplay is fun and diverse.Bugs: Okay, here's the party pooper. This game, like most Ubisoft games, have crippling connectivity issues. The singleplayer has little to no problems in terms of bugging out, but the multiplayer is a breeding ground for them. First things first, some people can't connect to the servers. Period. Even after this entire time of being out, Poobisoft can't get the issue fixed, or probably even consider it. Secondly, It's damn near impossible to connect to friends. There was a thread on Steam where someone posted a fix they had, but it was long and complicated. Some people were able to use third party programs where they were able to connect, like Hamachi. This same bug applies to coop, so a fat lot of good that does for you. Some people have even reported issues where they have had UPlay register them running two instances of the game and will refuse to launch. Game crippling bugs like this have been unattended to, and some people have even tried to petition for their money back. Also, at least for my friend and I, ALT+TAB puts you into windowed mode every time you do it. I have also had several times where the game will say ""Not Responding"", then work moments later, then pop up again. This is usually during launch.Customization: This is a bright spot for Splinter Cell: Blacklist. The customization features many new weapons, all having many smaller customizations that can be added to them, like match point triggers, or hollow point ammunition. I was very pleased with the customization.Hello to those who want a simple, to-the-point review of Splinter Cell: Blacklist and hello to those who actually read the novel above. Well, down to the point. Splinter Cell: Blacklist is overall a decent game. The singleplayer is a good length with an interesting story, the multiplayer is incredibly buggy, and likely will never be fixed by Poobisoft, so don't expect easy playing and connection to your friends. Bugs are rampant in the multiplayer, but are mainly involving connectivity. Surprised? I'm not. The customization is very refreshing from earlier titles,  and is very well done. My score for Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a 6/10. It's fun, but the bugs are game halting and ruin its experience for me. BUY IT ON SALE. It's not worth the full price.			"

												In short, Blacklist is a solid, enjoyable stealth title that nails the basics and has enough features to justify its price tag.Fans who were unimpressed by Conviction might see this as more of a return to an older style of Splinter Cell. Sure, it has the fluidity of Conviction (and the maligned 'mark and execute' training wheels), but gives more freedom of engagement. In many ways, I feel that Blacklist attempts to cater to all tastes, because you now can choose to play missions loud with all guns blazing ('assault'), strike from the shadows ('panther') or slip past enemies like a ghost ('ghost') ... or some messy combination of the three. Sure, some maps force stealth, and you'll certainly want to pack heavy armour if you intend to keep it noisy; but, crucially, it offers a little something for everyone. Purists might be frustrated by this as dumbing down, but the highest points are still awarded for 'ghost'. I imagine that the game is trying to jettison the brittle nature of some stealth games where a single alert is enough to fail the entire mission. If you want pure stealth, then you are free to play the game in that fashion. However, I will say that this game lacked challenge. The level design is almost too helpful, with a multitude of helpful vents and ledges, strategically placed to avoid encounters. The gameplay is very solid and improves from Conviction. The easy switch between styles and quality level design make it a fluid and enjoyable experience. Attempting to master different styles adds replay value, and there's a great quantity of side missions that can be done cooperatively which is always amusing. My gripes centre on the game being too easy, a rather tenuous multiplayer (see below) and a slight lack of imagination. The story is passable, but the missions are too diverse. Although this makes them interesting as standalones, the whole narrative doesn't fit together so well. I didn't feel as engrossed as Conviction. The multiplayer is an interesting one. It styles itself as an asymmetrical multiplayer pitting mobile, gadget wielding spies against armoured mercs. It's a rough attempt to bring the stealth action into a multiplayer format. Whilst it sounds interesting on paper, I wasn't convinced, and I imagine that it's probably dead now anyway. Nonetheless, the single player is certainly enough to get your money's worth. To sum up, Blacklist is fun and enjoyable to play. It's accessible to all, but stealth purists might find it too easy. The multiplayer is unnecessary, but there is plenty of fun coop action and a reasonable amount of replay value. Overall, I think it does plenty to justify its price and is worth playing for fans of the series (or similar games like Hitman) or those looking for something different.			"

												Greetings soldiers,As a man with real hopes of becoming a Special Forces Officer in the military, this creation of genius by Tom Clancy is a masterpiece of tactical espionage, skill and the recklessness and selflessness that those without name do unto us. From going in ghost style, to being a panther (my favourite) and systematically eliminating enemies such as Iranian commandos (QUDZ force) or renegade american freelancers, this game has it all. The graphics are fantastic for 2013, the gameplay is immersive and the campaign is quite extensive if one seeks to earn all achievements and replay value is high, 9.5/10 would shoot out all lights, draw in enemies singularly, then systematically throw smoke and eliminate them one by one...as a natural born military man would. One plays the role of Sam Fisher, the familiar face of the Splinter Cell title, a Navy SEAL turned CIA special operations ""splinter agent"", whom along with his team ""Fourth Echeleon"" and of the HQ of the namesake, must save America and the Western World from the terror of terrorism, but not as we traditionally associate it with. A rogue MI6 agent, without spoiling the plot targets important US assets as an attempt to bargain for the withdrawal of all US troops in international territories. Gameplay is fast paced, or slow as you prefer, and the AI is quite receptive to sounds and things that you do, shooting out a bulb nearby an enemy alerts them for instance. Oh and shadows....are your best best best best asset and friend, being in the light, well i'd recommend you shoot first and ask questions later friend.Captain Rob out!			"

I'd recommend playing on the highest difficulty as the wallhacks and instakill ability thing you have from the start makes it a bit too easy, but this is a really solid game with surprisingly excellent co-op (despite myriad bugs and some really dreadful enemy wave sections).

												I have played the single player and all the co-op modes and have had a great time in all them. The game is fun to me anyways, but the great part is a majority of the players I've played with were nice, patient, and used good teamwork to beat the missions.   I have not tried the multiplayer portion because honestly I'll probably never play it. As far as graphics, they look really good on all ultra settings and I haven't had any crashes. The only negatives I see is sometimes the cover system is hard to get in and out of at random moments, you can get stuck to where you can't move after duel boosting, and I hate that it requires UPlay. Overall, a great experience so far, and looking forward to putting many more hours on the game.			"

												This game requires uPlay to run. Don't expect to be using your Steam overlay in game or anything like that. I've been playing the Splinter Cell games from the beginning and I have to say, with all the new features they've added to the game, it does make them easier. If you want a real challenge, start with the highest difficulty and enjoy. My biggest gripe with the game is the voice acting. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the new voice performers but I did miss Michael Ironside (Fisher) and  Claudia Besso (Grimsdottir). While the new game is the latest in Sam Fisher's adventures, the new voices, latest additions to the game and the smallest of references to the previous games do give Blacklist a sort of reboot feeling.  It's not a bad thing, in fact I enjoyed being rewarded for my different playstyle choices so I could stealth if I wanted to, or kill everything that moved without having people complain about it. It really is a good game, it's a pity it didn't sell that well.			"

The Multi-Player mode still hot and Playable, it has much so fun more than single-player mode. I can't stop to playing the SvM (Spies vs. Mercs) mode.Using the APP to unlock something was a bad ideal. UbiSoft just locked up few stuff like the Alpha Sonar Goggles (which is really inportant to me), so you have to login and play that boring mobile game to unlock it. Is that anyone bought this game for that? I really hope UbiSoft will never do that again.			"

They not only lacks of anticheat and vote-kick systems but neither allows you to browse the list of servers and players actually playing a game, it is such a lame that Ubisoft never learned the basic features they must provide to the players in order to ensure and enjoyable multiplayer experience. Besides that, cooperative and singleplayer missions are epic, that amkes the whole game purchase worth, but you better have a buddy to play with!!			"

												Like any gamer that played any of the old Splinter Cell games, stealth is the most important and useful weapon in the game. Blacklist allows you to continue using stealth, but it is not the only choice. For those who choose not to use stealth there is an alternative too, Blacklist let's players go guns blazing if they so desire. Overall this game appeals to many different styles of playing. While not a classic Splinter Cell game, it still can still hold its own as a very good stealth game.			"

												Movie-quality presentation and immersion combine with frustrating gameplay. This is a game that, for the typical gamer, likely plays out in one of two ways. 1) You tried the stealth approach because it seemed like the best idea, and you failed. 2) You have given up on the stealth approach and now everyone will die. The good news is that for the most part, Blacklist understands that you will just not get people to stick with stealth when it's this stupidly annoying, so you have 3 paths available to you in many cases. Sometimes, though, just like the ""stealth"" missions in Assassin's creed, you are forced to avoid detection, and those can be nightmarish, controller-throwing, descents in to infuriation. And yet, the whole game is so well done that you can almost forgive it for this. Almost. Most likely though, you will play the game with trepidation, hoping that just shooting everyone is an acceptable path through the mission and push forward to enjoy the storyline before it inevitably decides that it's time for a pure-stealth exercise in repetition and futility. Some will say that this is all a deficiancy in my ability to play the game - maybe so - but games should be quite forgiving to the player that wants to enjoy the story and experience, and well, Blacklist just isn't. If you aren't great at pure stealth, then no difficulty setting will save you. So do I recommend this game? Absolutely! It's fantastic - just, practice all your techniques for controlling stress, and remove breakable items from your general vicinity if you aren't the greatest at sneaking around in a game that isn't forgiving.

												Excellent game. One of my favorites. Would recommend to a friend. Really puts you in the mindset of a splinter cell - outside of hte government but in place for the good of the government. Multiplayer is a little flaky but the singleplayer campaign is ultimate. I enjoyed the coop missions but I do receive a fair bit of lag in them.Good storyline. Kept me involved and interested for more. Players who are fans of the Thief series will enjoy the stealth mechanics.Bottom line: get this game. End of transmission.			"

The stuff I didn't like : The game was crashing towards the end for me on the prison mission at the same time if I took too long. Also the multiplayer, dont know if its only me but I am having trouble finding games, most of the time the game makes me host one and wait hours for people to join.			"

												Stealth, gadgets and options.Game mechanics:The perfect stealth gameplay. I was impressed with this game, most of the time you'll have games where you have the choice to go stealth or go crazy; But rarely are both options actually rewarded equally. Stealth usually tends to be the more benificial one, but not here. Blacklist is designed to reward three diffferent playstyles, assualt, stealth and assassinEach playstyle actually has their own point system and side missions that focus on each skill. It is an extremely well rounded game.Gameplay:So many cool gadgets, gadgets that can actually be gamechanging in ways that are not toi overpowering. Scout out an area with a drone, use a sticky camera to monitor an area or distract gaurds as you sneak past, its just so well designed and fun. Really it was a game that I didn't want to end.10/10 Best PC stealth game I've played. "

												- At beginning the game was randomly crashing, i had to manually modify a setting in the config.ini to 100% solve it- i'm not a fan of multiplayer and coop and i believe a game like Splinter Cell doesn't need it, but we live in the modern age where new generations pretend the multiplayer in every game, even Pac-Man if was just released today so we have to deal with it. So, while the normal coop in ONLY-COOP missions (the ones with Briggs) could be considered a decent, nice experience (you're a lucky guy if you've a friend to play with these) when you meet a mate with some patience (but there is always the factor that when, in next years noone will ever more play Blacklist you'll be unable to play/complete these missions alone, that are very nice indeed) the Splies vs Mercenaries multiplayer is a very bad, sad and frustrating experience for many reasons, one of the main is because you can't use the normal campaign weapons (at least at beginning but i guess also later) another one is because if you enter in a 2 vs 2 and your mate leaves the game continue and you find yourself into a game alone vs 2 players and there is no option to leave it till the whole thing ends, but in short words, is garbage.+ Focusing in the normal game-Campaign-sub missions you can complete in single player, i had a lot of fun playing this game, could be very hard sometime even at lower difficult, but i loved the challenge and managed to survive ^^.My favorite weapon in all Splinter Cell games ( and not only) always has been the Sniper Gun, and once upgraded, you will have one of the best Splinter Cell sniper guns ever here, is just that i wanted to perform different styles of kills otherwise i was motivated to kill everyone with just that weapon :-)In conclusion, i can say this is probably one of the best Splinter Cell games ever released (my all time favorite, for how seems strange, remains the very first one) i recommend it to anyone !My Final Score is 95 /100  "

												I just bought this game on sale a week or two ago. I'm a big fan of the Splinter Cell franchise so I'm a little biased. I really love how the game lets your choose the path you want to take. Go ghost and be undetected without disturbing enemies, silent and deadly or just all out run and gun. I like the variety. Game has plenty of content. Had almost 10 hours of gameplay before even starting the second mission. Plenty of side missions that help build up skill and money. However, the game has a fatal flaw. I'm no tech expert by any means so I'm not sure exactly how it happens but the game will delete your progress. That's right, it will randomly and without warning delete your hours of work. This is a known issue and has been happening since the games release in August of 2013 and I just bought this game a week or two ago so obviously Ubisoft has no interest in fixing the problem since its been over 6 months since the games release. There are work arounds but I can't get them to work for me. Truely depressing since it is a really great game. If your tech savy buy the game if you like the Splinter Cell franchise. If your not, don't even bother tell its fixed and there is no sign Ubisoft even cares about this problem.			"

												Splinter Cell Blacklist is one of the better entries in the long lived spy-saga. It offers great gameplay choices and sneaking is heavily rewarded. On top of that the multiplayer is also confidently crafted. The one thing lacking is the banal story with flat characterization that hinders Splinter Cell Blacklist from reaching any narrative high points. Even though it lacks the subdued intelligence of Chaos Theory, there's still some cracking good sneaking to be had. If you liked any of the previous splinter cells you will enjoy this game, the voice change takes some getting used to but its a splinter cell with the stealth element back!			"

Not A Stand-Out Splinter Cell Game, But a Good Standalone GameThis game features an okay but predictable story line, great graphics and fluid movement. However with the many new additions to this game (they were good additions at least), it resulted in the core splinter cell experience being a bit lacklustre as it ended up feeling like an action game with stealth elements to classify it as a Splinter Cell game.However not comparing this game to any other, this game is a great one with many new features to explore, such as the customisable options for the echelon along with the weapons.

												Pros:- Blacklist features a happy medium between the stealthy gameplay of the early franchise and the more action-oriented SC: Conviction.  You can once again hide your victims (though it often seems unncessary as patrols are much shorter); but you can also make use of the execute feature from Conviction.  Loadouts are highly customizable (suits that emphasize armor vs. stealth, full-on assualt rifles vs. silenced weaponry, etc.), allowing the player to optimize their kit for their preferred playstyle.- Co-op is fairly extensive; if you prefer a slower, yet stealthy playstyle you might be able to get 20-30 hrs. from it.- In-game currency (used to buy gear and upgrades) is relatively easy to come by, so there isn't too much of a grind.Cons:- Requires Uplay.- Blacklist doesn't feature a real menu from which you can select gamemodes, options, etc. from; instead, you find yourself in a spy operations plane of some sort with different ""stations"" corresponding to functions you would expect from a main menu.  This is probably meant to make things more immersive, but it's really just cumbersome.I would recommend picking Blaclist up if you're a fan of the franchise (or giving it a second chance if you were let down by Conviction), especially if you intend to play co-op.

												Playing through on the perfectionist difficulty makes this one of the best stealth games out there. On this difficulty, getting spotted will fail the mission. If you're not so great at sneaking around, you'll still enjoy the less masochistic difficulties. Sneaking around will still be encouraged but the game will let you shoot your way out of those less graceful moments.			"

												In Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist you have the choice between 3 styles. 1st one is a style called GHOST. In this one, you need to operate completly stealth by using undeathly methods and also without beeing seen.2nd one is a style called PANTHER.This style is a mix between Ghost and Assault style. You need to operate stealthy but you use deathly methods.3rd and last one is ASSAULT.This style can also be called as the ""Rambo"" style.  Just kill and destroy everything and forget the stealth methods! (Do NOT use this style if you are a Splinter Cell fan!)I personally preffer the GHOST style because it's similar to the style used back in the first Splinter Cell games.			"

												Whenever you're going to like it (or parts of it) or not depends on a few things. If you can accept, that this is not Chaos Theory, nor Conviction, not even the mix of two and is more like Double Agent (minus the dual objectives idea) done right. Stealth is very simplified, a lot of areas are rather well lit, being in the shadows is not 100% invisibility. At the same time, combat is not as fast and full of traps and environment usage as in Conviction, since most of the locations are desinged to be possible to complete in two ways - stealthy and the open combat style. If you can accept, that Sam Fisher talks and looks much younger, with the new voice actor cosplaying as Commander Shephard fake knockoff and sounding really bad most of the time, and all the interactions between Sam and his daughter sounding like he became a father at 4 years old at most. If you can accept, that despite the possibility of a complete ghost playthrough on *most* of the game (it is *impossible* to complete the entire game like this, since there are forced action sequences, some of which *can* be played in a ghost or at least non-leathal way, though), it is usually a more infuriating and annoying experience, rather than a challenge, due to the very uneven checkpoints, scripted or partially-scripted events and a surprisingly even less reliable ""one button does all"" control system, than the one that was in Conviction. If you can accept, that a few side-missions are coop only and those, which are not tend can be rather frustrating in solo (with full-stealth missions from Grim not having checkpoints at all).If you can accept all of that, ignore the side-mission stuff you don't care about (survival/horde mode in a Splinter Cell game - because it needed one, right?), play the game in a comfortable mix of non-leathal/full stealth/leathal gameplay, as you see fit for the situation, and the game is actually pretty fun. Still one of the worst games in the series, but definitely better than Double Agent (and, in my book, probably slightly better than the first game as well). But we're talking about one of the top stealth series here, so even being average is good. Wouldn't advise buying it at full price, though.			"

												Without a doubt, 'Blacklist' is the best looking 'Splinter Cell' game to date. As a fan of the series' stealth gameplay in the first three games, I am quite pleased with its return in 'Blacklist'. The game plays like 'Chaos Theory', but with a dash of the quick action featured in 'Convction'. Still, as much as I like the Mark & Execute feature, I rarely used it in my playing. The game is best enjoyed if you play it in Ghost (stealth + non-lethal) or Panther (stealth + lethal) style.The story in 'Blacklist' is your standard 'Splinter Cell' fare. It's formulaic, but enough to move the action along, and it seems to be the beginning of a bigger story arc. What really captured my attention in the game were Grim and Korbin's side missions -- because they remind me of what I love most about 'Chaos Theory' -- and the Gone Dark Intel Metagame. The latter plays like a modern version of 'Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?' and it's a welcomed distraction.The monetary system, in which you HAVE to earn money to upgrade weapons and gadgets, is superfluous. (Is the U.S. government in the game so cash-strapped that I have to buy my equipment in small increments?!) Sad to say, Eric Johnson, who took over for Michael Ironside for the role of Sam Fisher, failed to impress me. His voice acting was uneven and lacked the gravitas that Ironside's had. Johnson sounded like he was just imitating Ironside in one moment, and like a young man in the next. Johnson's voice work was disappointing.Overall, 'Blacklist' is a worthy follow-up to 'Chaos Theory', a welcomed return-to-form after polarizing thematic departures in 'Double Agent' and 'Conviction'. and frankly what feels like a soft reboot to the franchise. Despite one or two (maybe three) glaring flaws that are hard to ignore, there are enough good points to 'Blacklist' that make it worth your time.			"

The campaign leaves an open-ended scenario where the Engineers (the antagonists) are still operating throughout the world and 4th Echelon's mission is to find and stop all the 12 nations who are funding the Engineers.Overall, it feels like they copied the Splinter Cell brand but delivered another game instead. Like a sequel meant to milk money from the fans by dumbing down the technology in-game, so they have less to deliver.COULD NOT PLAY ONLINE. NEGATIVE.PROS1. Mission Objective MarkerVery useful. At least you know where you are going.2. ExecuteNot bad. I like the way Executes are carried out. Instant headshots for up to 3 enemies within range. It even works on enemies standing behind you. Doesn't work on those with helmets though.3. KnockoutsI like how stealth KOs drag the terrorist towards your position, so you automatically hide the body. Very realistic.4. Stun Gun/CrossbowInstant KO without the mess of a corpse. I like.5. DogsThis is pretty good. They sniff you out if you are within range and add a new element to the game.6. MixesGrimms First Person perspective mission looked pretty good. Controlling the Paladin's rockets and cannons and aerial sniping  were fun too.7. Tri-copterNot bad. Fun to play with. Replaces the old stick camera. Allows you to see everything with a birds-eye-view in many maps and helps you to get rid of terrorists. Really silly to restrict the mission boundaries though.CONS1. StoryWas okay. It was not exciting. No climax or an interesting development.2. LockpickingRemoved lockpicking from the Splinter Cell. With all the ""best"" weapons/technology in the world, you can't lockpick a door.3. WeaponsI find the purchasing of normal weapons with earned credits extremely silly. You are a top-tier government spy agency and you have to function like a mercenary group?4. TechnologyA step backwards from Splinter Cell : Chaos Theory. You used to be able to listen in on conversations and hack computers from a distance. Now you have to manually walk up to them and press buttons. Your pistol used to be way more advanced too.5. InterrogationThey removed that too. Now holding a terrorist hostage is only for bullet shield purposes.6. EMPThey took the EMP pistol away and used EMP grenades, which have to be purchased.7. Sonar / Night VisionUsed to have thermal imaging to find guards. Now you have Sonar which only works if it pings and there isn't a drone controller blocking. Somehow, even Night Vision is messed up by a drone controller, who can influence the infra-red spectrum of light.8. Last Known PositionIt is extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to see the AI shoot a white after-image of yourself.9. Aiming/ScopeAbsolutely horrible. 4 lines that don't even intersect. This is lazy.10. Aerial KOsWhy do all the aerial KOs have to stomp on the guy below? What happened to neck twisting?11. Stealth MovementsClunky. You can't stealth move smoothly around a crate. If you press Q and stick to the wall, you can't round the corner unless you move the camera and press the Spacebar. While I appreciate hugging the sides, it is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to see that a box is the only thing preventing a terrorist who is standing up from noticing you.12. Weapon Caches / Dead DropsWhat the hell? Who placed the weapon caches under electrical circuits? Dead drops on the edge on wall on the 3rd-storey? It's almost a random drop design. Not to mention that terrorists seem to have all the equipment that 4th Echelon has as well.13. Wall ClimbingLots of wall climbing. Up and down and left and right. So much wall climbing, I thought it was the Prince of Persia and I would need to wall-run.14. LightsEverywhere. No EMP pistol, you have to shoot them or play run-and-slide with the terrorists.15. RailroadingYou either take the hard way or the easy way. Through the front door or the back door. Not much of an open-word concept here. No free exploring since part of the maps have invisible walls.NEUTRAL1. ZiplineI do not understand why you would put a zipline that does nothing cool. It only brings you from the top to the bottom.

												SC: Conviction was the first Splinter Cell title I've tried on the X360, and it's one of the few games I still own on that console. With that in mind, it was only a matter of time before I'd purchase SC: Blacklist, and reviewing the past month, it's the game I've played most ever since the winter holiday sale started. And I've bought about 40 games. If you like the Borne trilogy movies, the Homeland series, or the Metal Gear games, then you must have SC: Blacklist in your collection as well. The storyline is not that different (prevent a group of terrorists in their attacks on US soil; this is the only spoiler I'll give you), but still tense enough to make you want to finish the game in one sitting. Which you probably can't, because you (as the gamer) need water, food, sleep and something like work or education, so don't even try to finish it with an all-nighter.For me, the addictive part that will make me play it today and tomorrow comes from many factors. First, upgrades. You can upgrade pretty much everything. Your outfit (which affects armor, stealth, # mag clips, etc.), your weapons (range, accuracy, silenced, etc.), your gadgets (e.g. sonar vision, tri-rotor, smoke bombs), and even your headquarters (infirmary, workplace, etc.). Second, combat. You can choose to finish the game in three styles; ghost (leave no trace), panther (stealth kills) or assault (head-on Rambo-style), and I've noticed myself trying to get more ghost-points with each passing mission. Instead of taking out the enemy sniper from distance, why not try to knock him out non-lethally from behind? Third, missions. You can follow the storyline, do side-missions, fulfill the daily online challenge or choose to do the online spies vs mercs. Side-missions you can do co-op (online) as well as solo, and upon completion they'll give you cash rewards and equipment unlockables. Fourth, controls. They're again very intuitive, whether you want to peek under a door, open the door, or bash through it. I think that many hardcore gamers would curse their keyboard or controller for on-screen actions that weren't meant to happen. I must admit that I sometimes get enraged, but then realize it was my mistake to take on three heavy guards with a side-arm. (By the way, I use a xbox controller, I don't know how it goes with mouse&keyboard). Fifth, the storyline and characters. Every chapter follows a debrief, the mission itself, and a recap that serves as an introduction for the next mission, with plenty of character interaction and all the military lingo that makes the game all the more immersive. In between these missions, when you're in HQ, you can talk with your crew and call your daughter.I wouldn't possibly know if there'll be a next Splinter Cell and how they'll seek to further improve it. But I'll be one of the first to buy it and I wouldn't need a discount either. In a word; recommended.			"

												Overall I've really enjoyed this game. Great story as well as co-op and multiplayer. Although nothing compares to the Chaos theory multiplayer, this spy v merc was actually decent. Do know that some days you will not be able to find games other than against a group of 4 that play together all the time. Too often teams are uneven in this game, but you get used to it. Other than that, the only thing that bothered me was the new voice of same fisher. It just didn't feel the same. This is my favorite video game series and little changes like that can really bother someone who is really into the franchise.  "

												Splinter Cell has come a long way as a series. I wasn't a huge fan of conviction but blacklist in a way revives the beautiful stealth action Splinter Cell was known for. If that's not your thing, you'll probably enjoy slitting every throat you come across. The close quarters attacks are some of the best I've seen in any game, definitely the most predatorial and awesome (I say that having played Assassin's Creed.) Multiplayers isn't bad either, it brings back Chaos Theory style, nimble spies vs well armed mercs. Pretty well rounded as well. All in all a good title, certainly shouldn't pass it up if you're a fan of Uncle Sam.			"

												Blacklist is a great game where you play as Tom Clancy's son, Sam Fisher, and try to stop the ""Blacklist"", a terrorist group that defies freedom and McDonalds and Americanism. You use your elite whispering skills to attract enemies (""Hey"", ""Come here."") and may choose to use your cool karambit knife or be a pretty nice guy and let them live.Sam Fisher is accompanied by Grim, the woman who always nags you about mission objectives, Briggs, the second hand man who Sam constantly gets mad at, and Charlie, who is like sixteen years old and kinda just is there.8/10 gr8 game m8			"

												I like the way the plot draws from real world themes to tell a thrilling story rather than using the standard trope of rogue Russia or America turning on itself cliches.   Game design is varied and feels far less ""stale"" than Conviction.  Although when Blacklist moves away from the SC template and borrows from COD and Mass Effect its far less satisfactory.   Solid Triple A but could and should have been a lot more.			"

												Absolutely the greatest stealth game in the history of gaming. Coop is superb, so many options and roads to take on how you play your character in singleplayer. I would suspect myself to be upset that i bought this game at full price and it is now half price in the market. But Ubisoft deserve the money i spent on this because it was damn well worth it! DLC's however are rather disapointing. I felt that i was paying for new weapons even though they were much worse than the default weapons that you can unlock for a few thousand dollars. However, the DLC maps are outstandingly made!If Ubisoft does make another i would please recommend them to make it just like this of course with new ideas and story. But i honestly disapointed if the franchise changed back to the conviction gameplay.. :(STEALTH 10/10ASSAULT COMBAT 8/10STORY 9/10CHARACTERS 9/10GAME 10/10Uplay 1/10 :( Sorry Uplay..			"

Not A Stand-Out Splinter Cell Game, But a Good Standalone GameThis game features an okay but predictable story line, great graphics and fluid movement. However with the many new additions to this game (they were good additions at least), it resulted in the core splinter cell experience being a bit lacklustre as it ended up feeling like an action game with stealth elements to classify it as a Splinter Cell game.However not comparing this game to any other, this game is a great one with many new features to explore, such as the customisable options for the echelon along with the weapons.

												I love the Splinter Cell series and this has one of the best gameplay I've seen  than most games. I've spent so much time on this SC in one playthrough than any other because there is just so much to do, and I'm nearly complete. I'd give it 4/5 stars and mostly just criticize for the story. It is 24 esque but I don't identify or really care about any of the characters, espevially Sam Fisher, which is huge let down because that's a major reason why I loved/played the other games. Overall it's a good game, just a little sad it's dehumanized.			"

												It's a great game. I am so glad to see that they tried to go back to the roots of SC series.It's still more action oriented game than the first games of the series, but at least you have a choice to play (well, most of the time) without killing the enemies. But hey! The gun-play of this game is very well done, so why not shoot at the bad guys? Silently. Most of the time (If you have the patience).I really liked the story, the characters and the bad guys. The side missions are very bland. All of them have very simple objectives and most of the time you don't have a room to do things your way. And every story mission had the same ""mission checklists"", I guess the developers were a bit lazy in that aspect.There are a lot of gadgets to choose from to help you in the field. There are a lot of weapons to suit your killing style. Armor pieces - too. I really like that stuff in games. And yeah, you can even upgrade some of it too. So. Lots of options for the players.At certain moments of the game I felt like I was playing Assassin's Creed or Mass Efffect, or even Batman: Arkham Knight. This game has a handful of good little pieces from those games in a good way.Even tho this game feels quite open-worldly, but at the same time it's pretty linear. There are not much room for creativity. But it didn't bother me. actually.Oh! And Sam Fisher has a new voice. The very first second I thought that he is Arnold Schwarzenegger (ahaha), but after a few missions it grew on me and everything was fine.			"

												For all my complaints on the new directon Splinter Cell has going over the last couple games this one feels like a good comprimise between the old and new.  At least this one gives you the option of stealth.  Well for the most part.  Brigg's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sections where they literally turn the game into a first person shooter is just horrible but thats like 2 parts and its really easy to get through them.  This for the most part makes a good comprimise.  Stealth is still a very viable option in the majority of missions.  In fact its very fun trying to get ghost rating on most missions.  Going action isn't such a bad thing either.  Different game mods offer a lot of variety.  Pure stealth missions that can be played alone or coop.  Previously mentioned kill every enemy in an area where stealth is encouraged similar to the one I talked about in Conviction, small maps with waves of enemies to kill are actually really fun to.  There's a whole side story thats all coop missions and I love them.  This is the game that got me into the multiplayer too!  The spies vs mercs gamemode is awesome!  Trying to be stealthy against other players is a true challenge.  I just wish playing as mercs wasn't a first person shooter but I guess gotta give the spies some advantage.  Top it all off with a story that doesn't feel like a stupid excuse to kill people.  The main villian feels fresh in a series where you can barely remember who it is.  I've compared Conviction to 24 but this one feels like the closest thing to a good 24 game I'll get.			"

Its just well....FUN! One of those games you can take really seriously or just enjoy a bit of a soujourn through everynow and then.Either way I believe this game is incredibly underated interms of the opportunities to explore and experiment with different play styles and strategies.BTW almost three years later  I STILL get surprised and delighted as I discover new takedown techniques.

												UPDATE: 5/11/14I have judged this game too quickly. Yes it's crazy hard, and yes I've had to play some missions over and over again...but I'm learning a LOT about the different play modes and getting better after every mission. The story continues to be really engaging and interesting, and while it's kicking my butt, I'm really becoming impressed.Yes there are still some nasty bugs, but man it's intense action!----------------------Beautiful game, action packed, but even on Rookie mode it's often too hard to enjoy.Let me start off by saying this is my first Tom Clancy game. Generally I'm an RPG player, but this game looked so beautiful I wanted to try it. From an artistic standpoint, I wasn't disappointed. From the environments, to the character designs it's really quite well done. Lots of eye candy, especially on ultra graphics settings if your GPU can handle it. The fluid movement of the character and the ability to interact with the environment is top notch. There's great body movement in climbing walls, crouching, ducking under cover, and reacting to events around you. There's also great responsiveness from the environs, as walls, vehicles, rocks, and otherwise are impacted by your actions. In terms of the ""world"" that has been created it's very impressive.One of the major issues I'm having is being forced into certain play styles. I'm not great at stealth, and many of the missions require it which means I've found myself making one tiny little mistake and having to start over again...and again...and again. After the 8th or 9th attempt it just isn't fun anymore. Even on rookie mode I've found several of the missions impossible to complete and have aborted the mission to try something else. I love the different loadout options for weapons and gadgets, and have tried pretty much every permutation of stealth tactics, but all it takes it one little misstep and the whole mission is done for - even if I've made significant progress. This is especially problematic on those side missions which have no checkpoint - so you have to do it perfectly or it restarts from the top.I've also become disappointed at being in a mission and going past a door that I can't do anything about unless I play co-op (or a co-op only mission). Well that's all well and good if you have a friend who has the game and you can schedule gaming time with, but since the majority of the mission is single player, why prevent me from experiencing everything in the game just because I can't coordinate time on someone's calendar to help me out? And just to be well-rounded, I HAVE played two co-op games with a friend that could make the time to join me. The co-op is very well done and takes into account teamwork, but with the same limitations as mentioned before - one little screw up and you're both back at the beginning with none of your progress saved.And then there are the bugs. So many of them. I've been in the middle of a mission and the keyboard just suddenly stops working. The mouse actions work just fine, but I can't get the game to recognize any key I'm pressing on the keyboard. So I just get to sit there and let myself get killed and have to cntrl-alt-delete to kill the game. Over and over this has happened - and it just adds to the frustration of finally making progress on my 10th attempt only to have the game crash. I've seen some posts in the forums that people are having similar lockups every 30 minutes. I haven't timed mine, but it has happened with every single instance of long-term gaming.Beautiful game and with so much potential - but the forums are full of issues with buggy gameplay (and I should probably mention that awful bug with full screen and windowed mode - don't touch ANY keys when the game is starting if you want to stay in full screen - what the heck is that about). I'll keep trying - but I fear I'm missing out on half the game because it's simply too hard or too buggy to complete a simple mission.			"

												This game is quite old and I am very late for providing people with the review.However the game itself is quite good and I still enjoy it everytime.The Single Player Campaign is incredible and takes on the mantle on Splinter Cell games and the stealth factor is quite beautiful. Like many choices you've seen in other Splinter Cells before , this game offers them extensively. The previous game ""Conviction"" was my first Splinter Cell and my first Tom Clancy's , and I am happy to say that I enjoyed this game as well I enjoyed the last one. Upgradeable Paladin (Aeroplane) and extensive loadout customization also allows you to play the game in a Hardcore (non-stealth) style as well. However I like Stealth , the mechanics could be improved and the hostile and passive hostile AI definitely needs more upgrading. The Co-Op missions are great as well , it's like jelly with peanut butter. It's delicious without it , but even better with ItSuggestion : Add a Radio Operator to ask the Hostiles check in every minute , also add features like Rain and Dust Storms to hamper line of Sight.Still what I missed from the Last game was the other splinter cell operators and invisible laser detectos.The PvP or SvM mode is great too , but I am underqualified to comment over that as I rarely played that part.A good Story worthy of Tom Clancy'sA good Stealth game worthy of the Splinter Cells			"

Рекомендую сразу проходить игру на уровне ""Офицер"", от этого она раскрывает весь свой потенциал и играть в неё становится в разы интереснее. Местами немного однообразна, но это не делает Splinter Cell плохой игрой, так что фанатам серии рекомендую!			"

												After Double Agent and Conviction, I didn't have much hope for this game but I can safely say that it is surprisingly, a good game. The game doesn't force you to play stealth anymore except for acouple of missions. But if like me, you enjoy sneaking by without leaving a trace, you'll definitely enjoy the game. It's oddly satisfying to sneak through the entire level without disturbing anything and they definitely give you enough tools to do so. Level design encourages you to explore for alternate routes to evade enemies. Recommend finishing Grim's side mission ASAP for anyone that wants to play stealth to unlock body armour with a very nice stealth bonus.Didn't really touch the multiplayer, but all the side missions can be played co-op a nd there is also spy vs merc mode.No Michael Ironside but his replacement does a pretty good job as Sam Fisher. I eventually got used to it acouple of hours in.			"

												I loved the first three Splinter Cell games. The first Splinter Cell was billed as a Metal Gear Solid killer. As stealth games, both Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell both rewarded patient players, although Splinter Cell had a storyline far more grounded in reality.The fourth Splinter Cell, Double Agent, went for something a little different. The fifth game, Conviction, went for something completely different, and Blacklist followed. I think that Conviction and Blacklist have turned the Splinter Cell games into a far more trigger happy series, and pumped in the action move cliches. Not that there's anything particularly wrong with that, the Syphon Filter games on the PSX paid lip-service to stealth while throwing action movie cliches at you all the time. And I loved those games.So while I prefer the original games, I enjoyed my quick run through Blacklist, but I'm done with the main story, and probably won't play through any of the side stuff. The only major flaw is that Michael Ironside no longer voices Sam Fisher. Blacklist is good, but not full price good, so wait for a crazy special or price drop.  "

												After 14 minutes of trying to make an account and get Uplay to work, it's locked me out of my account due to too many log in attempts.HOW!? The account didn't even exist before now!The support section gave me a phone number to call which told me to hang up and use their 24/7 online chat which is down.Somehow Uplay is worse then GFWL.Fustrations with Uplay aside this is a mostly solid action game.The space bar is really contextual and has occasionally sent Sam out the window next to the laptop I wanted to hack. Gun play is solid. Most upgrades, such as gloves and goggles, are linear and missed a good chance for real customization. The game has the Ratchet and Clank problem where everything is expensive, but your showered in funds anyways.The biggest adjustment in the game is getting use to contextually wall climbing. It's funny how this is the company that popularized open world traversal.The first few levels are a pain, but after that open up to allow for creativity. There are side missions for stealth, kill everyone, and wave biased survival that can all be played co-op. There are even co-op only routes and missions, which I can see bugging anyone who didn't get this game with a friend.The biggest complaint I have (beyond Uplay) is the dirty lens effect. There is some kind of filter over the game that adds oil and dirt marks to the screen whenever a light is vaguely facing you. It's distracting and doesn't add anything to the game or atmosphere.Over all solid military stealth shooter. Not as bogged down as MGS.			"

												The newest Tom Clancy game once again puts you into the shoes of Tom Clancy as he wears his new night vision goggles to see in the dark. In Ghost Protocol, his latest outing, you will shoot the bad guys with lots of guns, and you are also very stealthy. This game is almost as grood as the latest COD fishing game but there's much less fish, even though Same Fishing makes a return as the dude with the 3 eyes. It has a lot of graphcis so make sure to have good pc gaming.

												A solid choice for someone looking for a stealth game. My playtime is mostly me taking my time and being sneaky. Don't fret though, this game also allows for missions to go loud, so you can go in guns blazing and rack up the bodies if that suits your style. The story was good, characters are great. Some of the interactions between them made me have a laugh.The biggest gripe I have with Blacklist are the co-op exclusive missions. Trying to find a teammate online is nearly impossible, and there are not many people on my friends list that own this game. If you do end up purchasing this game, and are in need of a partner, I'd be up for it. After I re-install the game first.			"

												As always, the makers of the Splinter Cell series hit it on the mark again with Blacklist.  Sam has come back, not only to save the U.S. but possibly the world.  The gameplay was smooth and looks amazing on high in pc's.  Despite the fact that the gameplay is good, keyboard and mouse was too difficult for me so I recommend a controller b/c even changing the keys around still left it hard to handle.  My only other beef was that the voice actor for Sam Fischer wasn't the same as all the previous games.  A fun new addition to the Splinter Cell game was that there's a decent amount of side missions via the 4 other ""main"" characters that hold conversations with Sam, including Grim.  To be honest, I have not tried the online play for the story or the nice remake of Spies v. Mercs, but I've been told it holds itself up well and makes for good replay value.			"

The game is launched through Uplay , which if you don't know is a Ubisoft launcher like Steam. The multiplayer has 2 sides - one of which are ""The Spies"" and the other is ""The Mercs"". The spies have all kinds of stuff featuring from camouflage to clothing (for armor,speed and stealth) to guns and even gadgets. The Mercs must use Armor and Guns to pervent the spies from hacking terminals. And the story mode is just ... breathtaking! YOU SHOULD GIVE THIS GAME A TRY , RIGHT NOW!

												After 14 minutes of trying to make an account and get Uplay to work, it's locked me out of my account due to too many log in attempts.HOW!? The account didn't even exist before now!The support section gave me a phone number to call which told me to hang up and use their 24/7 online chat which is down.Somehow Uplay is worse then GFWL.Fustrations with Uplay aside this is a mostly solid action game.The space bar is really contextual and has occasionally sent Sam out the window next to the laptop I wanted to hack. Gun play is solid. Most upgrades, such as gloves and goggles, are linear and missed a good chance for real customization. The game has the Ratchet and Clank problem where everything is expensive, but your showered in funds anyways.The biggest adjustment in the game is getting use to contextually wall climbing. It's funny how this is the company that popularized open world traversal.The first few levels are a pain, but after that open up to allow for creativity. There are side missions for stealth, kill everyone, and wave biased survival that can all be played co-op. There are even co-op only routes and missions, which I can see bugging anyone who didn't get this game with a friend.The biggest complaint I have (beyond Uplay) is the dirty lens effect. There is some kind of filter over the game that adds oil and dirt marks to the screen whenever a light is vaguely facing you. It's distracting and doesn't add anything to the game or atmosphere.Over all solid military stealth shooter. Not as bogged down as MGS.			"

												Great, third-person; action: Co-Op/Singleplayer shooter-game.A modern (linear) game, so it looks apart and plays very, very smooth. Awesome for what it is and it is action packed and hectic. In a positive, yet unforgiving way.Sort of like a 'zombie horde shooter' but set in a modern (military) universe;minus the zombies. Plus missions.the Missions are played out through the 'Paladin' sort of a (aeroplane) base that equally functions as the games ''main menu'', where from: the game unfolds. This is quite an unique concept in gaming, generally as far as shooters are concerned, that gives a strategic almost sort of like 'real-time' tactical layer where one can play around with choice that is presented and available to use (various missions, equipment modifications).I really like this games gameplay and universe. In short; I like: everything about it...Especially the execution.			"

												This is the best game in the whole series. I was totally surprised by how awesome it actually is. You can play the game with two styles - lethal, non-lethal and mixed. During my 7-hour playthrough i have killed like 5 to 6 people, because it is way lot entertaining to play as a ""ghost"" - evading/koncking out the enemies and capturing the main targets. This game is one of the best stealth games out there - so buy it!10/10			"

												A solid choice for someone looking for a stealth game. My playtime is mostly me taking my time and being sneaky. Don't fret though, this game also allows for missions to go loud, so you can go in guns blazing and rack up the bodies if that suits your style. The story was good, characters are great. Some of the interactions between them made me have a laugh.The biggest gripe I have with Blacklist are the co-op exclusive missions. Trying to find a teammate online is nearly impossible, and there are not many people on my friends list that own this game. If you do end up purchasing this game, and are in need of a partner, I'd be up for it. After I re-install the game first.			"

Fun campaign, fun missiosn to do with a friend and the online is not to bad either. Pick it up! Especially if it is on sale on steam! This is more stealthy SP gameplay and it really does give you alot more options as to what you wanna do compared to the last SC game!Not perfect, but a HUGE step in teh right direction for a series that looked like it was falling hard.

												Let's see ... 18hrs, and most of them are CO-OP missions, and played only 1 story mission. (for archievement)I'm having a blast with it so far with my friend. I won't go into details, but more on the thought. Here's my opinion;::: Game-Related :::The game itself is great, one of the best stealth action I played so far. It is a little more fast-paced compared to older games in the same series. Gameplay is fast, well, if you are going for Perfectionist. (the hardest difficulty)The game brings back execute system (with some improvement), where you tag enemies, and down all of the tagged within your reach using one button. It can be a very deadly aresenal together with the Sonar Vision (x-ray). It is a bit overpowered, but still, it is nice addition to have. However, playing on Perfectionist disabled both Tagged-Execution, and Sonar. This is where the fun is!You have several equipments your disposal, which affect your playstyle. How you play, is up to you, but in the end, it will put you into 3 groups, Ghost (non-lethal, stealth), Panther (lethal, stealth), and Assault (go all loud). I found that each style balanced quite well, so it depends on your preference.AI is nice, although it not that smart, but it is challenging enough to keep the game in its pace. You cannot sit in the shadow, looking into enemy's eye at almost arm-length. You can be spot if you cross its LOS.I haven't go deep into story (at all), but it seems okay, simple plot, but interesting. I am into CO-OP more, which is very good actually. The CO-OP content may seems small, but there is more than it seems, I am still playing it after 18hrs :DSpies Vs Mercs multiplayer looks interesting too, however, there is no anti-hack, and you will find hackers in public match, a lot. I tried it for likes 3-4 different matches. All of them have at least 1 obvious hacker, well, you know, speed hack, and wall-clipping hack, which is quite nasty. There are several other hacks available too (from what I found when reading around forums), likes wallhack, god mode, and etc.Apart from the (great) game itself, there is a critical flaw, Uplay.::: Uplay :::I have to say that Uplay has improved a lot compared to the time of its introduction. It looks really nice, comparing Uplay to Steam. However, Steam is more stable imo. Uplay has improved, and became more stable to let you enjoy your game, still, it acts weird on me several times, likes cannot login, cannot find server, logged in, but appeared offline in-game and etc. It is not really bad, but it is more of the annoyance in its current stage.Though, I can say that it is good when it is working. I like its UI more than Steam's :D::: Overall :::Very good game, grab a friend, get deluxe editions (for completed DLC package). Although, you will need some motivation to fiddle with Uplay along the way. I recommended this game for co-op experience! It is worth my purchase.			"

												Renowned stealth spy Sam Fisher is back with a different voice. Gone is the brusque voice played by actor Michael Ironside, in is Eric Johnson. Sam’s voice is still credible and is now smoother than it used to be, but not as great as in previous Splinter Cell iterations.As Sam Fisher, you still work for the 4th Echelon, but this time you receive missions from a plane based in Greenland called The Paladin. The Paladin is the command center where you meet up with Anna Grimsdottir and the plot plays much like a political thriller. The story focuses on a group of terrorists trying to kill a series of targets in the United States. There’s quite a bit of tension in the plot and some of it is between Sam and his colleagues. Charlie Cole is an expert hacker who can annoy other employees in The Paladin. The story isn’t so much about Sam, but it is more about information warfare. In this game information is power.The screens in the command center are all digital; there are campaign missions as well as side missions. There are several new gadgets in this game that are very interesting and very useful for both the campaign and side missions. You get to choose your gadgets on The Paladin before you embark on any campaign or side mission. The availability of the gadgets gives you a chance to experiment with them against the various hostiles you will encounter in various countries of the world. One of the most interesting gadgets is the Tri-Rotor, a drone that you can use to scope out a building you are trying to infiltrate. The drone can give you a fairly good idea where the hostiles are located so that you can stealthily get inside a building without being spotted.Old Splinter Cell gameplay mechanics have returned such as the cover system. You can take cover behind a wall, barricade, or box. You can knock out hostiles by sneaking up behind them like in previous iterations of the Splinter Cell franchise. A new mechanic that is introduced to this game called mark and execute. It is an ability to mark nearby hostiles, then automatically killing them with headshots in slow motion at the press of a button. It feels like an action hero move.The missions take place in a variety of countries such as Iran, Paraguay, Mexico, United Kingdom, Guantanamo Bay, and Philadelphia, USA. The best mission designs consist of ventilation shafts, rooftops, and cubicles of offices. The A.I. of the guards is for the most part very realistic and increase suspense as they get closer to your hiding location. They will react realistically when they see an unconscious or dead colleague. Seeing an unconscious or dead colleague forces them to change their patrol patterns. A guard also will wonder why a door is now open when it was previously closed. If Sam is spotted by a hostile(s) a shadow is left in the last location where he was spotted.The side missions are fun, although they turn into trial and error missions. There are no save points, so you will have to go through the mission from start to finish without making critical mistakes. These missions are assigned by Sam’s colleagues such as Grimsdottir, Cole, or Briggs. They can be played in single player or co-op. The side missions are structured so that you would need a co-op player alongside you in order to climb high walls or fences. Many of these missions require stealth, so being spotted means the end of a mission. Side missions may require you to hack into phones, computers, and other devices so that the 4th Echelon can secretly acquire intel from the terrorists. There is enough drama and suspense to justify playing side missions.Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a gripping thriller of a game that reminds of a political movie thriller centered on spying. The campaign missions are suspenseful and the side missions add replayability to the game if you can get by the frustrations of trial and error. I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in spying, stealth, and drama.			"

												Well, this is my Commentary on the whole product. The whole product is more, then just the gameplay, but i will start with the gameplay. I have to say, that the gameplay is really good. Everyone, who did no-kills runs in the previous games, can do so in this one. You can do open, deadly runs; silent, deadly runs and no-kill, silent runs. The game acknowledges this three style and i find the game to be a bit easier on no-kill, silent runs. If you like Splinter Cell, than this is a good game to play, whoever there is one big problem:30min crashes.Every 30min the game crashes for no reason. It is a popular problem and i tried many of the popular solitions, but they did not work. So you have only 30min until the game crashes. This is a bit forgiving in campaign missions, because you have a lot of checkpoints, but it makes the extra mission increadible frustrating or impossible. Theses mission do not have permant checkpoints. If the game crashes the whole progress is lost and the multiplayer becomes inaccessible, if you ever get a connection to Ubisoft servers. The game came out in august 2013 and this bug is not yet fixed and there is no garanteed way to know if you will be affected. This is unexcusable.My second problem comes with ""Shadownet"" or Ubisofts fancy way to make a central server unavoidable. Do you remember, how you could or could not connect to specific games-server back then? If you could not connect to a specific server, you choose another server and the problem was gone. You can't do this with Shadownet. If you can't connect to Shadownet, you can't play the multiplayer, because dedicated servers are the devil.It is easy to understand, that i can not recommend a game, where the multiplayer does not work as good as from games from over 10 years ago (settlers 2, diablo 2, counterstrik 1.6) and you have a high chance to be plagued by a crash bug.Do not buy this game at anything more than ~5-6€ and it is best, if you got this 5-6€ for free. Play Dota2, CSGO, etc and get drops in form of items or cards. Sell this drops and buy SplinterCell with the drop money. This is probably the best way to enjoy this game.This is sad, because the gameplay is good, but i can not support ♥♥♥♥♥♥, lazy and idle developers and publishers with a general recommendation.			"

												It's 2015 and Splinter Cell Service still not avaible. I went to USA, finished University, bought a new gaming rig, and nothing. This is starting to worry me. Can someone check on the guy responsible for the service? I think something bad might have happened to him. Sending my prayers. Please Ubisoft, shut down Uplay and let Steam take care of multiplayer?			"

												Don't buy this if your a PC master race type.  This is your typical quicktime jammed console game that prompts you every step of the way, they were too cheap to do a decent port to PC, you have to use a gamepad to control it, no mouse look and wasd.  Yuk. "

												Renowned stealth spy Sam Fisher is back with a different voice. Gone is the brusque voice played by actor Michael Ironside, in is Eric Johnson. Sam’s voice is still credible and is now smoother than it used to be, but not as great as in previous Splinter Cell iterations.As Sam Fisher, you still work for the 4th Echelon, but this time you receive missions from a plane based in Greenland called The Paladin. The Paladin is the command center where you meet up with Anna Grimsdottir and the plot plays much like a political thriller. The story focuses on a group of terrorists trying to kill a series of targets in the United States. There’s quite a bit of tension in the plot and some of it is between Sam and his colleagues. Charlie Cole is an expert hacker who can annoy other employees in The Paladin. The story isn’t so much about Sam, but it is more about information warfare. In this game information is power.The screens in the command center are all digital; there are campaign missions as well as side missions. There are several new gadgets in this game that are very interesting and very useful for both the campaign and side missions. You get to choose your gadgets on The Paladin before you embark on any campaign or side mission. The availability of the gadgets gives you a chance to experiment with them against the various hostiles you will encounter in various countries of the world. One of the most interesting gadgets is the Tri-Rotor, a drone that you can use to scope out a building you are trying to infiltrate. The drone can give you a fairly good idea where the hostiles are located so that you can stealthily get inside a building without being spotted.Old Splinter Cell gameplay mechanics have returned such as the cover system. You can take cover behind a wall, barricade, or box. You can knock out hostiles by sneaking up behind them like in previous iterations of the Splinter Cell franchise. A new mechanic that is introduced to this game called mark and execute. It is an ability to mark nearby hostiles, then automatically killing them with headshots in slow motion at the press of a button. It feels like an action hero move.The missions take place in a variety of countries such as Iran, Paraguay, Mexico, United Kingdom, Guantanamo Bay, and Philadelphia, USA. The best mission designs consist of ventilation shafts, rooftops, and cubicles of offices. The A.I. of the guards is for the most part very realistic and increase suspense as they get closer to your hiding location. They will react realistically when they see an unconscious or dead colleague. Seeing an unconscious or dead colleague forces them to change their patrol patterns. A guard also will wonder why a door is now open when it was previously closed. If Sam is spotted by a hostile(s) a shadow is left in the last location where he was spotted.The side missions are fun, although they turn into trial and error missions. There are no save points, so you will have to go through the mission from start to finish without making critical mistakes. These missions are assigned by Sam’s colleagues such as Grimsdottir, Cole, or Briggs. They can be played in single player or co-op. The side missions are structured so that you would need a co-op player alongside you in order to climb high walls or fences. Many of these missions require stealth, so being spotted means the end of a mission. Side missions may require you to hack into phones, computers, and other devices so that the 4th Echelon can secretly acquire intel from the terrorists. There is enough drama and suspense to justify playing side missions.Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a gripping thriller of a game that reminds of a political movie thriller centered on spying. The campaign missions are suspenseful and the side missions add replayability to the game if you can get by the frustrations of trial and error. I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in spying, stealth, and drama.			"

												To start off let me say this......This...is a DAMN good game. Now let me elaborate on that statement. Splinter Cell: Blacklist has taken Splinter Cell back to much needed stealth, back to its roots you could say. However, even by doing this they make it a new, refreshing feel to it, not just some reskin of Chaos Theory. With the games new 3 way level design 1.(kill all, be loud) 2.(Kill all, remain silent) and 3.(knock out, remain silent) 3 being my personal favorite. With this new system each and every level has so many different and unique design and ways of turning out, which makes for amazing adventure. This game is good, but it has its flaws here and there. A few things in this game don`t really add up when you start to think of them. One thing is that going by the games official wiki and information found in the previous games, ""Sam Fisher was born on 17th April, 1957"" and assuming that Blacklist takes place in 2013-2014 Sam would be around 56 years old. Now don`t get me wrong, grandpas can kick♥♥♥♥♥ just look at Metal Gear, but thats a story for another day. The reason I brought this up is because in Blacklist Ubisoft replaced Sam Fisher`s actor from Michael Ironside who had played Sam in all previous games, to Eric Johnson, claiming it was for ""peformance capture"". Well Ironside`s Fisher sounded like a man who could be in his 50`s, Johnson`s Fisher on the other hand sounds like an angry 20 year old. Seeing how they used Johnson for Capture this Sam also looks much like Johnson himself. which looks like Sam might have looked like...in his 20 - 30`s. All of this is really just more of a personal complaint and this may not effect your gameplay experiance at all however. Since I am talking about negatives I must say how certain weapons/tools can be almost overpowering at times, for example you can come across a crossbow which if aimed correctly can fire to the near end of a map and on hit the arrow releases a sleeping gas which can take out almost any guard in range of it, one time when I alerted them the guards crowded up in a big bunch, there were at least 5 - 7 of them and ONE shot with a gas arrow and they are ALL down. This as well is just a minor complaint on what I think is still a VERY good game and if on sale you should buy for sure!8.5/10 ign			"

												Splinter Cell, a game that has been around for the past 14 years or so. It is one of those games you either love or hate. So if you are into the stealth and infiltration type of games (like Metal Gear Solid) or a militarised American James Bond, then this is definitely a game for you. We continue the story of Sam Fisher from his kick♥♥♥♥♥new base of operations and his wide arsenal of gadgets and upgrades. You do what Sam Fisher does best, kill bad guys and leave without a trace (most of the time) . However, I would not recommend this game for people who do not like lone wolf style games.

												They tried to make a new splinter cell. And they failed. This game is buggy, and stupid in many ways. Rooms with moving lasers like some terrible movie and forced shoot outs this game is nothing like the old ones. However. If you like me love the old splinter cell and just want something that resembles just a little, this might be for you. I spent a long time swearing over this game. Changing the difficulty to easy during each long forced shoot out, only wishing they wouldve given me a ""skip"" option. But occasionally, I actually felt like the old Sam Fischer (whenever he would STFU). Some levels you can pass completely without interfering with anyone at all, which made quite happy, and made me feel I got my moneys worth. This game is for the people who want to sneak but wont freak out when they suddenly gets stuck in first person mode and MUST kill everyone on the whole level. Get it on sale. Its a♥♥♥♥♥♥game like almost all other games nowadays. But maybe half of it wasnt TOO bad. Id say its like a mix of the worst missions on Pandora Tomorrow (which is the worst of the first three and only  real Splinter Cells) and of some new Call of Duty XX third COD of the year. Luckily you get more sneaking than shooting if you try really hard			"

I never finished it, and my PS3 needs  a new (something expensive im sure) so I bought the deluxe edition again for $40. It is so much better on PC I am glad I have spent $100 on this game total now, Worth every penny, the gameplay is vicious and uncanny. The checkpoint system in this is brilliant, it adds perfect tension to every moment, and really makes you slow down and think. Since the first 3D stealth game on PS1, Tenchu stealth assassins, I have loved this genre. As it stands this is the pinncle of stealth espionage, and a timless gaming experience.			"

												Superb stealth game, far more variety in gameplay via gadgets than say MGS :V. Nothing new there, Metal Gear has always been known for the story, Splinter Cell for the fluid gameplay.With this title I was afraid they would try to go down the Metal Gear route, putting in way too many cutscenes. This didn't happen so breathe. The story is solid and has its own charm which is a welcome break from all the angsty emo storylines infecting gaming atm.SC:Blacklist still has that slick stealth gameplay. I still haven't played a game/Series that does it better. Going full stealth with Tri-Rotor (drone), Sleeping gas, Proximity mines, EMP grenades/Stun gun?Assault? A hybrid? Not only can you but the game provides a variety of weapons/gadgets to supplement your playstyle.There is also a Multiplayer available but haven't even touched that yet. Game has a solid 30+ hours of content just in  the Single Player campaign. A major hit for me and worth picking up if you love stealth games. A sale is just the icing on the cake in this case.			"

Port forwarding didn't work.  In multiplayer they throw you right in with very little explanation. I thought training ground was AI and I raged like hell after realizing I was playing with real people and was burdening them to the point we almost lost. Single player is ok. Money earned is shared between multi-player and single-player are the same so it's spread thin with all the customization choices.Only get on sale.Also I forgot to mention this game keeps switching itself to windowed mode. It even starts in windowed mode. Jesus christ.			"

												I do not recommend this game, its a walking cliche recyling mechanics and story telling elements you have seen time and time again, the gameplay is clunky the combat is unrewarding, the cover system is irradic and dull, and for some reason this guy with however many years of special ops training can not fire a gun with any accuracy beyond 5 feet at 10 feet the bullets do severely reduced damage taking more than one bullet to an unarmored head for a kill.  I resent/lament/ and rue the money spent on this game.			"

												I haven't played this much but I bought the game to play with my brother online.  The graphics are good - and the gameplay is similar to most SC games.  No suprises there.  However, one only has to read the forums to realise why I'm not recommending this game.  Like so many UbiSoft games - the ""play online with friends"" part of the game NEVER works.  I can join in with a stranger to play co-op but I can't add any of my friends.  UbiSoft sends out a help sheet which basically tells you to change your firewall settings and your port settings - which is completely unnecessary.  It doesn't work even after all that is done.  It is a common problem with UbiSoft Games and they never seem to fix the problem correctly.  If they do not fix it soon, I will be asking for a refund as it is not even half a game and they should never have released it without it working properly.  If you want a good FPS (or third-person, as the case may be) then this game may be okay for you.  But if you're looking for a game to play with your friends, avoid SC: Blacklist as it will just leave you frustrated and annoyed that you wasted so much money.			"

												If you only plan on playing the single player or co-op, then this game might be an OK purchase, particularly when it's on sale.However, do you know WHY it was put on sale so quickly even though it was released barely a quarter ago? Because it's gone FUBAR, particularly the online section. There are no DEDICATED servers, just [poorly implemented] lobbies that will quickly get to you. I haven't played since they ""fixed"" the host leaving/lobby changing by removing the option to exit on-going games. If you join a game, you better commit. Oh, by the way, did I mention the blatant cheating in more than 50% of the servers? During the first 2 weeks of release, I played nothing but multiplayer, which was fine. Now, I took a 7 - 10 day break, suddenly, there's a giant wave of 55+ with the best suits. ""Wow! A lot of people must really love this game!"" Unfortunately, that's only partially true. Play a few games and I guarantee you will find a speed/aim/wall hacker who gives 0 cares about getting caught. Worst thing is, there isn't even an in-game reporting system, or at least one that's intuitive to find. Th publisher clearly are OK with leaving the MP to burn as there's been NOTHING done to punish or even the curb the amount of [actual] hacking.Do yourself a favor and pass on this if you're looking for good competitive multiplayer.

												Something was changed in Splinter Cell: Blacklist, and what's left is a frustrating shade of what it once was. I'll get my first niggle out of the way first: no Quicksave function. Die, get detected, anything that compromises the mission and you're back to the beginning in most cases. I can't overstate the sheer frustration this causes for me. I like perfect, stealthy run throughs - I derive my enjoyment from seeing how a situation went wrong and going back to a 'just prior' save to try a different tactic. I don't want to be bumped right back to the beginning, to hear the same conversations, to trudge through the same hallways just to get to where I was. It's limiting and non-sensical to ditch a quicksave function in a stealth game. Next up, the controls. No longer can you control the speed at which Sam moves with the mousewheel. Keyboard controls (although admittedly they can be mapped), do not feel intuitive. Sam feels clunky, a little on rails. The contextual actions he performs are jarring, sometimes unwelcome; mean to open that door instead of head into cover? It's 50/50 what will happen. I wanted to leapfrog a railing by a door, and instead booted it open in front of a small army all curious as to who this suicidal maniac was. It feels clumsy, and in a Splinter Cell game clumsy is something that will deal break everything. So what about combat? Admittedly, I'm a stealth nut, I avoid it. But even I get bummed out when, after not being seen across the map in perfect shadow, the body I drag back to the same (seemingly hidden) location is located as if it had flashing neon lights on it. In fact, I *do* have flashing neon lights on me and I wasn't spotted in the same location....but the body was. It's that kind of lazy gameplay that kills this for me. I love Splinter Cell. Adore it even. But something has been removed here and what's left doesn't feel like a Splinter Cell game. It doesn't have the same polish, the same sleekness or the same atmosphere.....hell, it doesn't have the same soul. I can see what Ubisoft have tried to do, and for the life of me I can't work out why it hasn't worked, but it hasn't. I can't figure out how this game got good reviews from fans of the genre, so the possibility exists that this is just my problem and not the game. But somehow I trust my gut and this game simply has not gripped me yet. I hope it does.			"

												Given what a letdown Double Agent and Conviction were, I wasn't expecting anything special when I played the game. Yet despite using the same game engine as Conviction, the series finally returns to its stealth roots and delivers an amazing stealth game on par with Chaos Theory.One of the game's main strengths is in its map design. Each map is its own small, self-contained open world environment filled with hidden passageways and alternate routes. These secret paths are so common that you'll go out of your way to find them, and it's really rewarding to find, for example, an intricate set of pipes and ledges you can climb to pass by 8+ guards unnoticed.The other main draw is the game's sheer level of customizability. Each mission rewards you with cash that can be used to upgrade your armor, weapons and gadgets. Unlike previous games, you can now carry up to 8 gadgets, including a user operated drone and an ultra powerful crossbow (stun gun variant) with 4 different firing modes. In fact, you're supplied with so many gadgets that you can't even go through all of them in a single mission (assuming one used per guard).In addition, each mission provides a ranking system for 3 different playstyles: Ghost, Panther and Assault. A Ghost style is classic stealth, Assault style means getting detected and duking it out in combat, and Panther is somewhere in between. This mechanic alone is great for replayability since you have a reason to beat any given mission at least 3 times, each time being such a vastly different experience it's almost like playing a new level. For instance, you can beat a level without so much as knocking out a single guard, then play that level again making liberal use of frag grenades, incendiary grenades, proximity mines and sniper rifle shots.Even the missions themselves have much needed variety compared to previous titles. While there is the standard fare campaign, there's also about an equal amount of Grim missions  where your objective is to either neutralize X hostiles, hack 3 terminals or even fight off waves of enemies, and the missions themselves vary in how well suited they are to a particular playstyle.Probably my biggest complaint is the storyline. Given you can beat missions in more or less any order you want, it has the effect of making the plot feel disjointed and confusing. Then there's just something about the dialogue and voice acting that comes across as silly, as if you're watching a Spy Kids movie with adults. It got to the point where I would actually skip cutscenes I hadn't seen before. If you play games for story, you should probably look elsewhere.My other minor complaint is the lack of online activity, but that's forgivable given the game is already 4 years old.			"

												This game is fantastic and one of the best, if not the best, splinter cell.  The game is sharp, beautiful, well acted and an overall joy to play.  You can be completely stealthy or go in guns blazing (good luck with that approach though).  It's fantastic to play, and the story is amazing.  If you appreciate saving the world from terrorist scum, this game is for you.  God Bless America.			"

												Behind the new coat of paint and a new Sam Fisher, Blacklist represents a return to form for the series. It doesn’t revolutionize Splinter Cell, but it manages a sharp trifecta of achievements — it’s open to new players, accessible to players from the series' major departure installment and a welcome invitation back to series regulars who missed the stealth focus that peaked with Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. Blacklist refines what came before and makes for a great new beginning for the series.			"

												For a precision stealth game to be good, it must be consistant.  Enemies must behave realistically, but predictably on repeat runthroughs.  A tactic that works once on a section of a level must be repeatable.  This is where Blacklist fell apart for me.  I'd have a great strategy for getting through a level, and I'd be figuring the last part of it out when all of a sudden the patrol routes for the first 3/4 of the level change, and my tactics for getting to that final part are ineffective.  This would be a great feature if you wanted to play ""remixes"" of the levels and be forced to try new approaches, but it quickly becomes frustrating when you're close to finishing a level only to have it change on your next attempt.Aside from that, the story seems generic and boring, the enemies are hypersensitive, and it's more tedious than exciting most of the time.  Wouldn't hurt to try it if you see it cheap, otherwise check out Mark of The Ninja or Dishonored for a rewarding stealth experience.			"

												Didn't even finish this game because it couldn't hold my attention for more than an hour at a time and I just gave up on it after a while due to the bugs. These bugs are mainly the crashing, and framerate issues I had with the game. I was getting the same frame rate on ultra as I was getting on medium and low settings, and it just seemed like a lazy console port. (Atleast when I played it, some of these bugs could be fixed by now)  That being said, you should consider playing it on console.  (And my game save was deleted when the game updated) The story was kinda boring even after 6 hours of play, and I honestly couldn't tell you what it is about anymore. All I remeber is flying around in a big jet all the time. Also, the new Sam Fisher actor sucks and that also took away from the experience, and I felt like I wasn't playing Splinter Cell anymore.  There were a few badass moments and new mechanics in the game that are just like Conviction, but that stuff is hardley worth mentioning. The multiplayer was fun to play Spies VS Mercs again for a few hours with friends, but thats about it for multiplayer.I guess I could still recomend this game to a big Splinter Cell fan, but if your first Splinter Cell game don't get this one.5.5/10			"

												I am a hardcore fan of the original trilogy of Splinter Cell games - Splinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow, and Chaos Theory. After  Ubisoft deviated from the source material for a few years, I'm happy to say Blacklist feels the most like the originals.The game drops you straight into the fray and gameplay can be confusing until you know what you're doing. Once you do have a hang of things though, it is incredibly fun. I play with my friends as often as I can because, while the campaign is a good time (if you pay attention (the plot is a bit complex)), the coop is the most fun. I've never really cared for the multiplayer, but it is fun. It combines elements from the originals and Conviction and lets you choose how you want to play. Very worth the money.			"

												Yes it does have uPLay, but it's also a great game!

(I recomend the clasic spies vs mercs mode, it's a blast!). I played all SC games, and I have to say that this one does justice to the franchise (I know it's hard to get used to the new voice of Sam Fisher). Everyone can play the way they want to. You want to turn this steatlh game into a action TPS? No problem, put on better armor, crank up the guns and shoot away. Wanna play it in a more clasic SC style, being like a ghost? Oooh you should definitely try the perfectionist difficulty, it will require a lot of skill, but it's worth it. Get this game now! I didn't had any problems with uPLay, so there is no reason not to get it! Cheers!			"

												Rather than stripping out quality stealth content for the sake of including action sequences or big set pieces, this game simply puts the icing on top of the cake, as it should be. There is a lot of game to be had here. A satisfyingly lengthy campaign, a breadth of side missions that encourage different styles of play, and rather robust multiplayer options, both competitive in the form of the beloved Spies vs. Mercs and cooperative versions of every side mission. The campaign itself and the story it tells is something between a summer blockbuster and an engaging espionage thriller. And this dichotomy overall strains the story and spreads it rather thin. At times, there are even attempts at commentary on the state of the United States role in international conflict and the moral justification of our trial-less imprisonment of those in Guantanamo Bay. But this is juxtaposed right next to cringe inducing Hollywood hacking and a rather tired and cliche cast of characters. Charlie is the embodiment of all the stereotypical hacker tropes, messy clothes, awkward jokes, and all. Briggs is the up-and-comer eager to prove himself, torn between his former career in the CIA and his new, rather above—the-law position in Sam’s Crew. Grimm is a ball-busting, hard-nosed provider of intel who shares a rather strange amoutn of sexual tension with Sam considering she spent the last game lying, betraying, and shooting him. She’s also been made to look much less homely than before. But I guess that’s the creative license afforded by the rather confusing gulf between sequel and reboot which this game occupies. Sam himself is what really makes this game feel like a reboot. There’s acknowledgement of past events of earlier games, and his daughter Sarah continues to grow, but Sam looks and sounds much younger than before. The closest comparison I can think of is when they replace James Bond. The history is there, the cast is there, some of the same players are there, but the tone and the central character is dramatically different. But I assure you I am not comparing this new Sam to Daniel Craig’s invigorating take on 007. Fischer is frankly a rather shallow character this time around. Full of youth and vigor and almost none of the cynicism or dry humor of his previous incarnations. I can understand why this is game where Michael Ironsides finally gave up on the series. Whereas he once described Fischer’s character as “a tool that had been used one too many times,” this interpretation of Fischer is a tool that is very much in working order and gung-ho ready to go do whatever is necessary for the Stars and Stripes. There is occasional friction between him and the crew around him, and even some with the higher ups in the government, but Sam’s attitude and “been there, done that” sort of look on life from earlier entries is altogether gone. And it’s certainly missed.But playing action games for quality storytelling and compelling characterization is like watching wrestling for storytelling and characterization. You’ll occasionally be thrown a bone, but you’re missing the point. Splinter Cell is at it’s best between the cutscenes and that stays true here. And, largely, this is a very old-school feeling stealth game. while there is still the mark and execute “press Y to kill everyone” feature introduced in Conviction, it seemed much harder to reliably use in my Realistic difficulty playthrough. Many enemies wear helmets and a single shot to the head will do little more than♥♥♥♥♥♥them off and make your presence known. So hand-to-hand takedowns or Sam’s plethora of gadgets are generally better options than gunfire. And that’s if you choose to engage them at all. For the first time outside of a Hitman game that I can recall, the game actively rewards the player for leaving enemies alone altogether. For every checkpoint you reach, you’ll be rewarded with points for every enemy you left entirely undisturbed. And it really motivates stealthy players to do their best to get by undetected and unnoticed. I found myself feeling guilty if I couldn’t find a  way to ghost through a section. This active rewarding of a ghostly play style is a lesson and a tactic that absolutely needs to be adopted by more stealth games (I’m looking at you, Thief 2014.)But whether you choose to avoid, attack from the shadows, or altogether mow down those that oppose you, the game does a good job of  giving you feedback on your performance. Everything you do in a level feeds into one of three gameplay categories: Ghost, Panther, and Assault. At the end of every level you’ll be given a cash total for your performance in all three categories. And if you max out a certain category, you’ll be given even greater rewards for it. So while realistically speaking you’ll have a mixture of all three at the end of every mission, you’ll want to try and really focus on one playstyle in order to maximize your monetary gains. And those gains are used to upgrade your guns, your stealth suit, or your various support functions your crew offers from the plane. This game really just gets it right where it matters. There are indeed a few minor annoyances I had which could be a major thorn in the side of other players, though. There is a whole section where you play as Briggs, the other operative on the plane, that plays out as a first person shooter. You can still ghost your way through, but the game really encourages you in this section to play it like Call of Duty. It really stuck out to me. There are also a few other sections where the non-combat routes are decidedly less emphasized than the direct approach.			"

												Splinter Cell Blacklist Combines all the best qualities from Conviction and all the predecessors and put together part by part into one high quality piece of art. This magnificent piece of art deserves more attention The Graphics of this game are very clear and crisp ; all the clear elements are present and Outstanding. This game runs solidly stable when running at 60 fps which can be hard to find. The Game play is fun and since it is Splinter cell I believe its mostly stealth and espionage which makes it rather exciting moving like a ghost. My Favourite part of this game is Co op : when my friend and I play, it can be rather amusing and satisfying when we take the guards out at the same time. The only NEGATIVE thing i have in mind about this game is that every time I run it; this game ends up going into windowed mode no matter how many times I save my configurations. One thing that did bother me slightly as well is the fact that Sam Fishers' voice has changed.	I believe my money is well spent and I chose to get this game on Steam rather than UPLAY even though I got it for free from the NVIDIA bundle. If you have ever played splinter cell before than this game is definitely for you. If you enjoy shooters and action and would like to try something out I would highly recommend this game. "

												YESSSSSSS.  Im just glad I finnally found one that I could use with the Xbox 360 controller (wireless).  It's even better than the first original game.I love the difficulty, because it's really hard to find an action game that I cant beat, and even on the lightest difficulty you can be eradicated on this game if you dont utilize both the mental and physical aspects of being succesful in completing stages.Cant wait to play co-op with a buddy, and Im will patiently wait to see how this game improves....My advice (not pertaining to other titles; only blacklist) keep the game in this format and just focus on graphics, additional in-game new features such as new take down moves, weapons or stealth moves while added to the mission layout with more levelsLook I just made it that much easier for all software engineers involve...I rate this game also a 10 out of 10System.out.print(""Its everything I wanted and feels like a Metal Gear Solid, Splinter Cell hy-brid"") "

												Having played a sufficent ammount to reveiw this game, (a mistake I made with stalker clear sky) I can safetly say that it is awesome! I should probably say that this reveiw is only about the campagin, not co-op or ""Spies vs. Mercs"" (Multiplayer). I have played a few stealth games, such as far cry 3, and the Arkham Games (i hope i'm spelling that right), but I am not a super stealth master. That being said this game is hard as F***ing nails. The AI is smart, you arent a bullet spounge and ammo is scarce. There are quite a few gadgets and toys you can unlock to f*** with your enemies, such as the noise maker, the smoke bomb, the tri-rotor, and my favorite, the sticky camera. There are a few problems with the game, the main one being the cover system. In my opinion it sucks total♥♥♥♥♥and has made me rage quit more than once. The default keys are q to enter cover and space to jump out. The problem is that it seems to always think you are pressing space when you are pressing q. There are a few minor bugs, but it was mostly bug free. The game play is brutal and satisfying if you go down the assassin route, and tense and slow if you go down the ghost route (you dont kill anyone and don't alert gaurds). I really don't like going down the tank route because its just sorta boring if you do cause you don't have action game ammo or health, so it seems a bit pointless and unfair. Overall I would give this game and 8.5/10. A great game with a few minor issues that sometimes affect gameplay, and a pointless play style.			"

												This game is fantastic and one of the best, if not the best, splinter cell.  The game is sharp, beautiful, well acted and an overall joy to play.  You can be completely stealthy or go in guns blazing (good luck with that approach though).  It's fantastic to play, and the story is amazing.  If you appreciate saving the world from terrorist scum, this game is for you.  God Bless America.			"

												Given what a letdown Double Agent and Conviction were, I wasn't expecting anything special when I played the game. Yet despite using the same game engine as Conviction, the series finally returns to its stealth roots and delivers an amazing stealth game on par with Chaos Theory.One of the game's main strengths is in its map design. Each map is its own small, self-contained open world environment filled with hidden passageways and alternate routes. These secret paths are so common that you'll go out of your way to find them, and it's really rewarding to find, for example, an intricate set of pipes and ledges you can climb to pass by 8+ guards unnoticed.The other main draw is the game's sheer level of customizability. Each mission rewards you with cash that can be used to upgrade your armor, weapons and gadgets. Unlike previous games, you can now carry up to 8 gadgets, including a user operated drone and an ultra powerful crossbow (stun gun variant) with 4 different firing modes. In fact, you're supplied with so many gadgets that you can't even go through all of them in a single mission (assuming one used per guard).In addition, each mission provides a ranking system for 3 different playstyles: Ghost, Panther and Assault. A Ghost style is classic stealth, Assault style means getting detected and duking it out in combat, and Panther is somewhere in between. This mechanic alone is great for replayability since you have a reason to beat any given mission at least 3 times, each time being such a vastly different experience it's almost like playing a new level. For instance, you can beat a level without so much as knocking out a single guard, then play that level again making liberal use of frag grenades, incendiary grenades, proximity mines and sniper rifle shots.Even the missions themselves have much needed variety compared to previous titles. While there is the standard fare campaign, there's also about an equal amount of Grim missions  where your objective is to either neutralize X hostiles, hack 3 terminals or even fight off waves of enemies, and the missions themselves vary in how well suited they are to a particular playstyle.Probably my biggest complaint is the storyline. Given you can beat missions in more or less any order you want, it has the effect of making the plot feel disjointed and confusing. Then there's just something about the dialogue and voice acting that comes across as silly, as if you're watching a Spy Kids movie with adults. It got to the point where I would actually skip cutscenes I hadn't seen before. If you play games for story, you should probably look elsewhere.My other minor complaint is the lack of online activity, but that's forgivable given the game is already 4 years old.			"

												Blacklist is, in essence, an improved Conviction, with a touch of Chaos Theory, and a much simpler version of MGS Peace Walker's Mother Base system thrown in a blender. All of that with the multiplayer Spies Vs Mercs mode that debuted in Pandora Tomorrow. In campaign, you will do all of your prep aboard the Palidin, a large plane that serves as your headquarters and where you access missions and upgrades. You can upgrade weapons, your suit, gadgets, goggles, and even the plane itself with currency you earn by playing the game. Players that hated how conviction focused more on combat than stealth will rejoice that, much like in the early games, you can complete most missions without killing, or even interacting with enemies at all. In fact, the game has a scoring system that values stealth above combat. Also, the night vision goggles are back, with the sonar mode available as an upgrade (I hated using the Sonar in coviction, but I think it works much better here, especially after a few upgrades). Also, the game handles being in shadows (which caused you to play most of Conviction in black and white) in a simple and elegant way. The lights on your suit simply flare up, telling you that you are more hidden. If you liked Coviction, you will like this one too. If you are a hardcore fan of the gameplay in Chaos theory, I would say you should seriously consider blacklist. In my opinion, it is one of the best stealth-action games I've played.			"

												A German commercial on TV said that this is the best Splinter Cell game released so far - I can only agree. It's the hardest Splinter Cell existing so far: Guard dogs already in Level 1, armored enemies in Level 2, special enemies with goggles which can see you in the darkness, snipers from far distance who have the same goggles, cameras and armored enemies with an extra shield, explosive mines on the ground and lasers will be found in the upcoming levels. There are a lot of new weapons, upgrades for your body + weapons. The animation is very well done. The characters look so real, Ubisoft did a great job here. Their face expressions are awesome. You don't even play as Sam Fisher all the time in story mode - you will play as his comrade Briggs as well, who has a completely different playstyle. This game will never get boring!The only stuff which is not so nice is of course that UPlay stuff and that I always had to change the video settings to maximum when I started the game, it didn't save all the time. But all in all, a must-have for every stealth game lover and Splinter Cell fan!			"

												Best splinter cell game of the series, I heard some people say it was a bad storyline, but maybe I am more easily impressed than others, because I thought the storyline was relevant and kept me very interested. Best gameplay so far of all the splinter cell games, and I like the whole command post being in an Aeroplane, that you can walk around in and talk, gives that whole Mass Effect feel to it, and I am a big fan of Mass Effect. The gamneplay variety is split into three groups: Ghost, Panther and Combat. Ghost is remaining undetected and knocking out if you have to. Panther is stealth kills, and combat is pure and simple, kill enemies loud and fast. By far one of my favourite stealth/action games to this date. I highly recommend if you are a fan of action games.			"

												One of the newer games that I actually enjoyed. While I was disappointed by Conviction and its amount of forced action, I was pleasantly surprised with Blacklist, it kind of felt like I was playing Chaos Theory again. I fancy games with upgrade systems and well shoot this game has one, weapons, weapon upgrades, fancy different colored lights, cool suits. You can play the game any way you want, run in and blast people, stealthily kill people, or even just completely avoid everyone maybe knocking some guys out on the way. Theres quite a few missions you can play cooperatively with a friend or so, as well as there being the reintroduction of the SvM game mode, where Spies have to hack terminals while Mercenaries have to take them out and defend them. Of course its not as glorious as Chaos Theory's was but this game has its own cool things about it. I still prefer the maps and the progression through said maps in Chaos Theory, where as each terminal would unlock the next area and the Spy team would win by hacking all of the terminals. The campaign in this game is actually fun to play through and very interesting, though I do miss Michael Ironside voicing Sam Fisher. Definitely a step up from the unplayable Double Agent and the more actiony Conviction.			"

												As a generic, cover-based third-person shooter, it's an average game. Think ""Uncharted"" or ""The Last of Us"", except all the exploration, environmental puzzle solving, and character development is stripped out, leaving only the combat.The single-player experience is a series of combat arenas littered with waist-high walls. Each zone punctuated with a resupply cache at every checkpoint. It feels like a compilation of maps meant for the co-op mode of Conviction and it shows. Aside from the story missions, there are several game modes for the missions (no detection, clear the room, and clear the room for X waves).It's arguable that replayability is built in to the maps due to the score attack mechanism which grades you on your performance in non-lethal (Batman), silent lethal (Solid Snake), and noisy (Michael Bay) playstyles. Why a secret agent -- with a history in covert wetwork -- would be rewarded or even commended for kicking down doors and emptying an auto-shotty into a warehouse full of armored goons is beyond me.Once again, the concept of darkness is binary, as it was since Double Agent (PC/360). Due to the large number of enemies with night vision goggles and flashlights or the environments which are lit with dozens of light sources per square foot (many of which are ambient or otherwise indestructable), using shadows -- the original hallmark of the Splinter Cell series -- is pretty much useless, anyway.Stealth is no longer about stalking your prey, waiting for the perfect time to strike from the shadows. Instead, ""stealth"" has devolved to camping at a corner, dangling from an overhead ledge, or just sprinting up behind an enemy (provided you've specced your equipment for maximum stealth) and mashing the kill button. Speaking of overhead ledges, senior citizen Sam Fisher is more nimble and spry than ever before, able to scale the 10-foot high walls of an office building with the ease of a young assassin Ezio Auditore.Haven't bothered with the competitive multiplayer mode, so I can't comment on it.Much like Conviction, this is Splinter Cell in name only. If you must buy, wait for a deep discount. Better yet, just buy an Assassin's Creed title as that's pretty much the direction that this franchise is headed.			"

												Game : Splinter Cell BlacklistScore : 7/10Summary :Overal Splintercell Blacklist brings back the old feeling Chaos Theory used to have, It's a game where the developers acctualy did their best to bring back that good old feeling of trying to stealth past enemies without being deteced, something that Double Agent lacked in my oppinion. The singleplayer is a nice storyline with a nice extra added feature to upgrade your plane, upgrading this said plane will give you advantages on the battlefield, from better radar to better goggles.Considering i have played every Splinter cell series ever released on PC i think i know what i'm talking about by saying this is probably the best Splinter Cell they have released since Chaos Theory.When it comes to Multiplayer they worked hard to try and get that old feeling back that Chaos Theory used to have, unfortunately i still feels a bit chunky sometimes however i have over 100+ hours in on Multiplayer, i have to say tho, i played it without a proper team, if you have friends that want to play it aswell i can easily imagine you hit the 200+ hours.The Coop is pretty good aswell, although i suggest playing that with a friend aswell on LAN or Teamspeak, it makes the experience so much better!All in all this game surpasses Double Agent and Conviction by far, they really got the old Splinter Cell feeling back and i for one can not wait until they start working/releasing the next one!Good things about Splinter cell Blacklist - A nice new feature to upgrade your plane to make things a bit easyer in Campaign Mode- They smoothened out the upgrading/buying of new gear- Good gameplay, after 5/10 minutes of playing i got the feeling back and it felt like i never left- Versus/Multiplayer is a HUGE step forward and getting close to what Chaos Theory used to be- No significant gamebreaking bugsBad- The launch was a bit bad with Multiplayer not really working although all issues are resolved for me- At the start of Versus you feel overwhelmed by not knowing all the controls- I understand some things change, but i don't like the new voice of Sam Fisher :'( nor that he looks younger!- I hope they release some patches with new maps somethimes ( NOT DLC the game on itself is expensive enough ) All in all Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist is a nice addition to the Splinter Cell franshise, if you liked Chaos Theory i suggest you buy this one as well.-Please note this review is written on the base of my oppinion.

												If your a fan of the stealth action genre, you should pick this up. You can also mix playstyles together if your not into stealth combat like going guns blazing and using gadgets. The  games story feels more like a splinter cell game than conviction did and there is also plenty to do after you beat the game with a good amount of side missions to keep the action going. Multiplayer is pretty addictive with 2 vs 2  spies vs mercs and 4 vs 4 mixed teams deathmatch. This game is packed with action, I recommend it to anyone who loves stealth games with a blend of good balanced Multiplayer.			"

												I would not buy, I got it on sale and I still feel cheated. I gave Ubisoft another chance since I was feeling like playing a good Splinter Cell game and my friends had said good things about this game but now I am really wishing that Steam had a 12 hour return policy or something.I played this game for 4 hours or so right after installing it and granted that is not alot of time, but after having to replay the the first mission 3 times before I found out that the game ONLY saves if you have Uplay in Online mode and even then ONLY of you have cloud sync enabled, and after playing through the campaign for a few of the main missions, the first stage of all the side missions and giving the MP a go, I was dissappointed by the fact it is not really a stealth game.It is just another third person shooter commando game with cover based stealth elements added to appease fans of the series, yet Ubisoft fails to understand why we want those elements in the game at all. The Paladin base plane is a cool, if clumsily implemented, addition and I was hoping I would be able to go around interacting with the crew but business-woman-Rebecca, black-Sean and Bug Eyes don't serve any purpose other than to be menus that you have to click through in order to upgrade the plane or buy equipment. The one opportunity that I found for character development was a phone that you can call your daughter on after each mission and that results in awkwardly short conversations about what is going on usually followed by a ""keep your chin up kiddo"" remark before Sam hangs up the phone.If you are expecting something similar at all to the first 3 games (the good ones imo and I would go buy them again right now if they weren't still charging 7 dollars for 12 year old technology) you are going to be dissappointed. This one forces you, at regular intervals to go on shooting rampages, there are entire side missions focused around having shootouts in the streets (although you can stealth your way through those too, but that always consists of looping around behind them and using cover based neck chops), and it just feels like the game expects you go around neck chopping everyone you see and shooting people up with your Hitman Absolution style jedi powers with all the little gadgets you get ranging from situational to completely useless. I mean, I thought the whole purpose of the Splinter Cell program was to bring an experienced older guy, Sam Fischer, back into combat scenarios that he was too old to be in by using revolutionary stealth tactics and superior technology but that doesn't seem to matter anymore. Sam looks, acts and sounds 10 years younger in this game than he ever did and the new voice acting makes sure you can never escape that, plus he just looks angry all the time.As a side note, on top of everything else there are so many recycled features in this game, that by the time I had been playing for a couple hours it actually felt like I was playing Assassins Creed 3 with a Splinter Cell reskin. I ended up uninstalling this game, feeling like I wasted my money and that one of my favorite series' has finally admitted it will never return to it's roots.			"

												Thomas Clancy's Rainbow Cell Recon Splinter Squad Ghost Assault 4 was a very enjoyable game. The 64 byte graphics and Ge-force physics along with the Nvidia Shield game engine puts this 2nd person shooter game way ahead of current standards. And can amazingly be play accross all platforms including Windows 93 (and Windows Phone),  Mac OS X 12, ios8.8, Android Jelly Kat Pie, and of course the very popular PalmOS. This game is truely remarkable with next generation consoles even lets you input your commands with Commander Mode similar to Command Prompt on Cortana. All of this integration leads to a seamless gameplay that makes great use of your Facebook Inc.'s Ocular Rift Beta VR headset. The game characters are brought to life by great voice actors such as Steve Ballmer, Snoop Dogg, and Siri. Overall a great page-turner that keeps you excited until the end, when it finishes.

												Cool gameplay. Cool music. Cool skin-tight latex body suits that demonstrate the effectiveness of P90X.  However, the lack of Michael Ironside's voice and performance prevents Blacklist from reaching maxmium coolness. A weathered man, a father, a war vet, I imagine Sam Fisher is pushing 55, yet in this rendtion of the Splinter Cell series, he is voiced by a pubescent child who is prone to lashing out at his inner party. It's as if they're making some lackadaisical attempt to turn Sam Fisher into a young and hip action icon that is possessed by teen angst, opposed to the sardonically dark humour that we've grown accustomed to over the years. I don't mind if they're trying to reinvent the protagonist of Splinter Cell in order to appeal to a younger generation, but if that's the case, put Sam Fisher to rest and don't sully his image more than you already have. Introduce a new Splinter Cell--this reverse aging thing is just too weird for me.Also, Fisher, arguably one of the most skillful agents of espionage of all time, lacks the ability to take cover in a standing position, which I found odd.

												Personally, I'm not really someone who likes stealth games, but I really enjoy playing stealthy in Blacklist. There is such a wide variety of equipment, weapons, goggles and gear, as well as upgrades to your plane that can allow you to see enemies on the mini map and get access to restricted weapons, that you can get that makes progression in the game very enjoyable and smooth. You also have the choice in most missions to ether try to stealth through or go loud and kill all of the things. This is an absolutely superb game that is great for anyone who likes third person games, weather you like stealth or if you like action and has kept me entertained for hours at a time.			"

												I really enjoyed the mix between chaos theory like stealth, mixed with a little of convictions multi-kill mechanics. Also I think that they borrowed a little from the assassin's creed series by making it possible to scale all sorts of buildings. I was however disappointed with the use of drones/RC cars. They felt like a really  easy way to scout, and kill, your enemies. However where this game truly shines is its multiplayer. The classic version of spy vs mercenary returns, but this time with a few changes. You can completely customize your spy/merc for the situation at hand. Say you want to use a heavy weapon like a LMG, or a AK47, or if you want your own flying drone of death you can do that. But you leave yourself open. It reminds me much of the chaos theory's spy VS mercenary mode but with a newer more balanced action side added. Overall I would highly reccomend this game to anyone, especially  those who loved the original splinter cell series.			"

												Game was pretty fun, and had a good co-op. Well worth the $7.Unfortunately it does not list that it requires Uplay on the Steam store page. It won't even tell you that it's installing Uplay. When you launch the game the first time, a black command prompt opens like you've opened a .bat file and Uplay silently installs itself. Then a big Uplay splash comes across and ""updates"" the game, and requires you to create a Uplay account. Then you can open Uplay and launch the game.To simplify that: Launch game through Steam > Opens .bat file > Opens Uplay > Launches game.And if you play co-op you have to find all your friends on Uplay too!

												I am a hardcore fan of the original trilogy of Splinter Cell games - Splinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow, and Chaos Theory. After  Ubisoft deviated from the source material for a few years, I'm happy to say Blacklist feels the most like the originals.The game drops you straight into the fray and gameplay can be confusing until you know what you're doing. Once you do have a hang of things though, it is incredibly fun. I play with my friends as often as I can because, while the campaign is a good time (if you pay attention (the plot is a bit complex)), the coop is the most fun. I've never really cared for the multiplayer, but it is fun. It combines elements from the originals and Conviction and lets you choose how you want to play. Very worth the money.			"

												Yes it does have uPLay, but it's also a great game! I bought it during the steam sale because I had a blast playing this on my old xbox 360 and I remember putting hours into the multiplayer section of the game (I only stopped because I didn't wanted to pay for a live subscription anymore), now I can play it online for free everyday! (I recomend the clasic spies vs mercs mode, it's a blast!). I played all SC games, and I have to say that this one does justice to the franchise (I know it's hard to get used to the new voice of Sam Fisher). Everyone can play the way they want to. You want to turn this steatlh game into a action TPS? No problem, put on better armor, crank up the guns and shoot away. Wanna play it in a more clasic SC style, being like a ghost? Oooh you should definitely try the perfectionist difficulty, it will require a lot of skill, but it's worth it. Get this game now! I didn't had any problems with uPLay, so there is no reason not to get it! Cheers!			"

												Yikes! So imagine a Splinter Cell that is really cool, has the right atmosphere and visuals, and has a working and easy to-get-into co-op. Imagine the glory that could be! This isn't that game. Blacklist doesn't seem to have a working co-op, singleplayer mode is meh, and it needs U-play, everything else about this game is non-defining to the genre. Do I need to say more? Oh, and the voice actor for Sam Fisher is swapped from Micheal *Awesome* Ironside to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ McStrongbeef.			"

												Great, fun and well designed. Blacklist doesn't look like much on the outside but once played, the experience you get is a near flawless one that gives you delightful fun and fulfilment. Taking the new gameplay mechanics from Conviction while also bringing back the stealth aspects most notable in past games, Blacklist manages a good balance between this combination that ultimately proves successful. This time, you're given the freedom on how to truly play, with a ranking system that judges your performance based on three playstyles: Assault (shoot and kill, screw alarms), Panther (get detected but still go silent) and Ghost (total stealth, nobody knows you were ever there). Ghost, of course, gives the most points, thus being a good incentive to follow but albeit a challenging one. The game however, often assumes the path of Panther as its default, which can be quite an annoyance; seeing some scenarios play out like soldiers charging out of doors in search for you even when your existence shouldn't even be known if Pure Ghost is played. Makes no sense, but nevertheless, the player is forced to go along with it either way.Customization is vast: you're allowed to choose each piece of apparel on you, ranging from boots to even the color of the lights. There's also large assortment of gadgets to choose from, ranging from the silent to the loud. Lethal weapons like sniper rifles may be more advantaged over others but this advantage is held back by the points system that awards no-kills over kills.  It may sound discouraging, but you will eventually find the game flooding you with so much money anyway. Levels are smartly laid out and designed with a focus on non-linearity to give for multiple entryways, shortcuts and routes that different players will take. Settings and environments are never always the same, allowing for more variety and change in scenery. The first half of the game takes place largely in the Middle East though, a fine differiation from Convictions cramped building maps.The story follows Sam Fisher finally taking up the reign as a official covert operative once more, now in a newly formed Fourth Echelon tasked to take down the bad guys who are some bunch of generic terorrists... obviously.The premise is typical of the esponiage genre but fitting in bringing back nostalgia and comfort in the good ol' days of Chaos Theory.  Sam Fisher is no longer voiced by the familiar Michael Ironside, which makes him sounding a little softer in tone. But seriously, who cares about how these characters talk?The plot is a rather straightfoward one, from start to end, but proves sastisfying enough but with an ending that might leave scratching your head. One new feature in the game is the complete lack of a proper main menu. Instead, your flying ship, the Paladin, is the main menu. It's the place where you get to run about silly and free, and customize your s**** , select missions and stuff. An innovative move, clearly taken in inpsiration from Bioware's Mass Effect series.Overall, Blacklist still truimphs as a true SC game, once again bringing back the glory and origins of the franchise.  It can definitely be regarded to me as one of the, if not, the most refined stealth game of the 7th generation.4.5/5 "

												Overall I enjoyed my time playing the game. However as a Splinter Cell fan since day one I felt let down. The voice actor change probably left the biggest dissapointment for me, especially knowing Michael Ironside supposedly coached the new actor. Somehow every game as Sam gets older, he gets buffer and more agile. I wished at this point they did a batman beyond thing and just had a new splinter cell be the main character, like briggs. As with conviction, parts of the story are impossible to do 100% stealth although I tried very much on perfectionist to hand to hand kill only without getting detected. The story itself isn't bad but doesn't leave a sense of urgency for what's actually happening. Most of that is done through calling your daughter which feels weird considering both actors sound to be the same age. They nicely took from Conviction though and improved upon its faults gameplay wise and took on a more Double Agent (next gen version) style of knowing if you are hidden or not, basically no more color desaturation.Co-op itself was very fun for the most part. The briggs missions started and ended fun but some missions seemed near impossible to stealth or literally were impossible to stealth, especially with the highly annoying re-addition of dogs since I believe Pandorra Tomorrow. The briggs missions also were the only story based co-op missions. The 3 others were very much like deniable ops from conviction. Charlie missions are wave based and after doing one for the full 20 rounds with loud weapons, my friend and me decided we did not enjoy them whatsoever. Kobin missions did give the more classic splinter cell vibe and can be compared to hunter missions in conviction. Grimm missions were also quite fun as they were similar to infiltration from conviction with a mix of added objectives.Multiplayer is back in its true form. I've not actaully touched on mutiplayer in the PC version too much but I did play it considerably on console. At this point if you are just getting into the game, you may want to play with only friends or else you will find yourself unable to do much as the learning curve has always been high with SvM. I found that the new SvM blacklist mode to be the best of them all giving you 4 mercs vs 4 spys and having to try and hack 3 terminals. Unlike Double Agent, you dont actually need to maintain presence at the terminal, just in the region. There is a throwback mode to Chaos Theory/Pandora Tomorrow which is 2v2 Classic. I didn't actually enjoy it too much considering how much I played Chaos Thoery SvM. There's nothing wrong with it, it plays quite well but I found myself liking the 4v4 mode with new stuff more. There are also other modes which combine spies and mercs on one team however they just don't feel that much fun to play even though I liked the old gen SvS in Double Agent. The addition of loadouts added a much new feel to SvM. I personally liked it because it gives you more ways to counter the opposition. If you dont like that though, the Classic mode will be perfect as it limits loadouts.Overall I do recommend this game because it is fun and well put together, but at this point its only worth getting if you desperately want the story or have a friend to play co-op with. If you've never played a Splinter Cell game before, then I think it is a great game to get into as there isn't really any expectations. Getting it for multiplayer is questionable as the community is small and learning curve high with most people playing max level now.			"

Posted: July 16, 2014
												9.0/10Splinter Cell Blacklist is a very good game even for people who have never played a single other splinter cell game like me which is REALLY good. In Splinter Cell Blacklist you play as Sam Fisher an off the books man (because it never specifies which database he works for like CIA or FBI) who is assigned the leader of the 4th Echelon. The 4th Echelon is a big plane with everything you need on the ground but in their too. In the 4th Echelon you can explore the plane which is actually pretty small all things considered but you can still talk with your crew after every mission and they will have a different thing so say before that mission, but they will keep saying the same thing over and over after the mission if you click on them over and over (if that makes sense). So now onto the crew, you have Anna Grimsdottir who plans out before the mission, then you have Charlie a computer tech genius and can make very useful stuff for your missions, Briggs is another part of the team and here's his background. Briggs has just transfered from CIA and is Sam's partner so to speak although you play him in one mission in first person. WARNING DO NOT READ NEXT PART IF HAVE NOT STARTED OR FINISHED SPLINTER CELL BLACKLIST  You also play him in the last mission but you never know until the end of the mission  . Last but not least you have Kobin a man who faked killing Sam Fisher's daughter (which Sam still holds a grudge about) but is the only connection they have to ""The Engineers"" and they are the antagonist of the game but the main antagonist is  Majid Sadiq  . One more thing before I list the Pros and Cons of this game Splinter Cell Blacklist is a very stealthy game and test your stealthness and logic of sneaking around and knocking out or killing people very well. P.S. Splinter Cell Blacklist also has a multiplayer where each one of the crew members has a mission for you and the missions make you feel like you're not even in multiplayer but almost like they are one of the campaign missions. P.P.S. You also can do parkour and find hidden paths to use to your advantage to have a very stealthy aspect and make you feel like you are actually doing stealth.Pros:1. When you are on the 4th Echelon you can upgrade the plane to unlock weapons, heal faster in solo and co-op play2. The graphics are astounding for such a stealthy game. 3. Some missions are in day and some are in night which gives you a reason to say stealth is not only achieved at night but also in day.4. There is parkour in this game where stealth can be useful and you can knock out people that come to close to the edge.5. When you go behind someone or are crouched around a corner waiting for them to come near you you can knock out, kill (which you can do at anytime if you don't want to knock out people), you can use them as a human shield if you are in danger.6.You can capture High Value Targets and then get money which you can use to upgrade your suit, weapons, gadgets that Charlie made, or even upgrade the plane.7. You can upgrade your goggles to be much better than the prievious set of goggles you had and you can even get sonar vison to see enemy through walls whom you can then mark them if you want to do an execution ( In this game that means if commit an execution that means you will point your gun at them it turns into slow motion and you shoot them in the head and don't even need to press a single button while it happens).8. When you knock out or kill someone you can then pickup their body and hide them in a dumpster, hide them in the bathroom and close the door, throw them over a ledge, throw them off a roof, or just leave the bodies there if you're in a rush.9. Before every mission you will go into your loadout screen and Charlie will recommend that gadgets to use in that mission which is some VERY valuable information to have to be properly prepared. (Note you don't have to use those gadgets it's just recommended fo that mission).10. This may not seem important but you can also round corners, climb over ledges or bosxes or the cover your using to hide from enemies.11. If you get caught and hopefully don't die you can hide in the shadows and the enemies will know there's an intruder but not know his exact location.12. When you get caught a white silouhuette will show where the enemy saw you and you can use this to your advantage and maybe leave a ""present"" for them there as a ""suprise"".13. In pretty much every mission there is a point where two enemies will be talking to eachother and what you can do is A.Execute them B.Knock them out with sleeping gas or a proximity shocker (basically a mine but if someone get's close to it they get electricuted and knocks them out) or C.Just save them for later.14. If you knock someone out it actually gives you a bonus since it's harder to knock them out instead of just utting a bullet in their braincase.15. There are 3 ways you can do a mission Ghost: You do a mission with no one dying and everyone knocked out and not a single enemy detects you. Panther: You do a mission where you get caught but then don't get caught again and kill alot of your enemies like a panther, get it? and Combat where you get detected and dont stealth and kill or knockout everyone. P.S. For Panther you can also knock out people but i wanted to you to picture how a panther stealths but kills its prey while not getting seen alot.16. If you join someone else's multiplayer game you can play as Briggs in third person and not just Sam Fisher.Now for the CONS:1. The inside of the 4th Echelon is very small with not alot of exploration becuase if you look from it from the outside it looks HUGE.2. If you want to play with your friends on steam you MUST have their Uplay account on your Uplay friendslist since the game runs on Uplay.3. The first mission you play as Briggs you can only kill people not knock them out, it's in first person so it's much harder to stealth (although you can but doesn't really feel like it) and if you throw say a proximity shocker you don't know where it's going to land since you don't see the arc as you do when you play as Sam Fisher in THIRD-person.4. Although there is a laser sight mod for the gun that you can buy and a holosight you CANNOT acutually aim down the sights of your piston which can seem a little frustrating at times since you can with your silenced submachine gun if you get the ACOG sight or another sight for it.5. There is only 3 different type of enemies: The unarmored ones , Armored ones, and drone operators  who have a little drone with a big red light slowly go around trying to detect enemies (aka you the player) and if you shoot them once they're knocked out and the drone operator puts out another drone or 2 shots and they explode, Drone Operators also jam your vison until they are A.Knocked Out or B.Killed P.S. Sorry about forgetting to tell you the plot so The Engineers who are the antagonist made a publice announcement to bring all of America's soldier's because their leader  Majid Sadiq  believes that the American troops in 153 countries are in countries that they don't belong. So Sam Fisher is assigned to the 4th Echelon (the plane) and a crew to stop the blacklist because if America doesn't bring back their soldiers alot of people will die each day. Which is why you must stop The Engineers and the Blacklist so you know not a big deal  I'm being sarcastic  .So I hope you found this review helpful and thank you for reading this before buying just to get some background information. See ya later! :) "

												I recommend this simply because it is Splinter Cell after all with a few ""but""s.(Confession due: I left out _all_ other parts inbetween the original and this....)So. The character of Sam changed to something I don't really like. The gameplay is almost the same, the story is, well, your usual ""terrorist super genious wants NWO""... Graphics are good, game runs smooth, no crashes... I played it after Max Payne 3 and it was hard to get into (the last boyscout character was miles better than this über soldier one).Anyway, not as stealthy as I thought it to be, not as long as I hoped for and the story is very ""mainstream"".

												I've been a fan of the Splinter Cell series since the original game way back in the day.  The Splinter Cell series has always been quite clunky.  This game really fixed that.  The movement is all very fluent and smooth.  I tried revisiting older Splinter Cell games a few months ago and found them to be unplayable due to the mechanics, but Blacklist still stands as one of my favorite titles and a game I still love coming back to despite beating every mission several times on console, and now on PC.

												Thomas Clancy's Rainbow Cell Recon Splinter Squad Ghost Assault 4 was a very enjoyable game. The 64 byte graphics and Ge-force physics along with the Nvidia Shield game engine puts this 2nd person shooter game way ahead of current standards. And can amazingly be play accross all platforms including Windows 93 (and Windows Phone),  Mac OS X 12, ios8.8, Android Jelly Kat Pie, and of course the very popular PalmOS. This game is truely remarkable with next generation consoles even lets you input your commands with Commander Mode similar to Command Prompt on Cortana. All of this integration leads to a seamless gameplay that makes great use of your Facebook Inc.'s Ocular Rift Beta VR headset. The game characters are brought to life by great voice actors such as Steve Ballmer, Snoop Dogg, and Siri. Overall a great page-turner that keeps you excited until the end, when it finishes.

												Cool gameplay. Cool music. Cool skin-tight latex body suits that demonstrate the effectiveness of P90X.  However, the lack of Michael Ironside's voice and performance prevents Blacklist from reaching maxmium coolness. A weathered man, a father, a war vet, I imagine Sam Fisher is pushing 55, yet in this rendtion of the Splinter Cell series, he is voiced by a pubescent child who is prone to lashing out at his inner party. It's as if they're making some lackadaisical attempt to turn Sam Fisher into a young and hip action icon that is possessed by teen angst, opposed to the sardonically dark humour that we've grown accustomed to over the years. I don't mind if they're trying to reinvent the protagonist of Splinter Cell in order to appeal to a younger generation, but if that's the case, put Sam Fisher to rest and don't sully his image more than you already have. Introduce a new Splinter Cell--this reverse aging thing is just too weird for me.Also, Fisher, arguably one of the most skillful agents of espionage of all time, lacks the ability to take cover in a standing position, which I found odd.

												Personally, I'm not really someone who likes stealth games, but I really enjoy playing stealthy in Blacklist. There is such a wide variety of equipment, weapons, goggles and gear, as well as upgrades to your plane that can allow you to see enemies on the mini map and get access to restricted weapons, that you can get that makes progression in the game very enjoyable and smooth. You also have the choice in most missions to ether try to stealth through or go loud and kill all of the things. This is an absolutely superb game that is great for anyone who likes third person games, weather you like stealth or if you like action and has kept me entertained for hours at a time.			"

												I really enjoyed the mix between chaos theory like stealth, mixed with a little of convictions multi-kill mechanics. Also I think that they borrowed a little from the assassin's creed series by making it possible to scale all sorts of buildings. I was however disappointed with the use of drones/RC cars. They felt like a really  easy way to scout, and kill, your enemies. However where this game truly shines is its multiplayer. The classic version of spy vs mercenary returns, but this time with a few changes. You can completely customize your spy/merc for the situation at hand. Say you want to use a heavy weapon like a LMG, or a AK47, or if you want your own flying drone of death you can do that. But you leave yourself open. It reminds me much of the chaos theory's spy VS mercenary mode but with a newer more balanced action side added. Overall I would highly reccomend this game to anyone, especially  those who loved the original splinter cell series.			"

												Game was pretty fun, and had a good co-op. Well worth the $7.Unfortunately it does not list that it requires Uplay on the Steam store page. It won't even tell you that it's installing Uplay. When you launch the game the first time, a black command prompt opens like you've opened a .bat file and Uplay silently installs itself. Then a big Uplay splash comes across and ""updates"" the game, and requires you to create a Uplay account. Then you can open Uplay and launch the game.To simplify that: Launch game through Steam > Opens .bat file > Opens Uplay > Launches game.And if you play co-op you have to find all your friends on Uplay too!

												Quick review:The game is really amazing if you like stealth games such as hitman or the rest of the series. I recommend lots of tom clancy games such as the splinter cell, ghost recon and rainbow six series if you like tactical/stealth shooters. Of corse each series is much different from the other but each has suspensful gameplay. I have not yet tested co op but will soon and so far solo missions have been great fun. You have 3 options on how to play the game, either going ""ghost"" and never use lethal force (which i prefer and is also the hardest), ""panther"" which is keeping all your kills silent and never being seen, or ""assault"" which is go loud, breach n clear, shoot em up style gameplay. Graphics are great as well as sound, missions arent dragged out and theres a lot of missions. I definitely recommend this game if youre interested, especially if its on sale! :D			"

												This isn't a bad game, per se, but it is terribly disappointing to me.  Conviction, its predecessor, was absolutely amazing and I therefore had very high hopes for Blacklist.  Where Conviction had a complete single-player campaign along with a variety of co-op missions that could be played solo, Blacklist has a whole bunch of co-op stuff mixed into the solo campaign;  I despise being unable to complete missions, unlock gear, etc in the solo campaign without doing online stuff.  The levels inside the campaign also feature a lot of co-op only stuff - doors, passages, and more that can't be done in a solo game.  Worse still, some of the unlocks require playing an iPhone/Android game and synching it with your Uplay account.  Honestly, doesn't UBI already have enough of my information without resorting to installing spyware on my phone?In terms of actual gameplay, the game again suffers compared with its predecessor.  Nearly every enemy on every map in every difficulty is wearing a magic helmet that can somehow prevent all damage from a supersonic 7.62.  Seriously, you pop them in the head and they just turn around to see how shot them.  It absolutely ruins the mark & execute mechanic (armored targets don't die to the execution), and takes a huge amount of fun out of the game for me.  It simply should not be safer to enter melee combat with an enemy than to cap his head with a firearm.  I suspect the developers were trying to appease the crowd that whined about Conviction being too easy and ended up producing something that appeals to neither camp.  I'll possibly continue playing long enough to finish the game, especially if I find a co-op partner, but I'm really disappointed in the game and the direction of the franchise in general.			"

The amount of customization options adds a ridiculous amount of tactics to approach any situation the way you want.Highly recommended for fans of Splinter Cell and of the tactical stealth third-person shooter.9.5/10			"

												In my opinion, this is one of THE BEST splinter cell games out there, if not actually taking the crown. What I didn't really like about the others (cept for conviction), was the restrictions, I mean, what IF I wanted to be a gung ho kind of spy? You know, like that orc assasin in oblivion xDAll the other splinter cell games force you to be stealthy (nothing wrong with that, it's the game genre after all), but blacklist allows you to choose what you want (conviction too, a little bit). IMO in reality a spy would rather drop somebody before even giving that somebody a chance to even think about spotting him xD, so killing in a stealth game isn't really something out of character.The thing is you aren't FORCED to play any particular way in blacklist (like chaos theory). To be honest, blacklist, if played full stealth (no knockouts) is EVEN MORE stealth based than chaos theory (standing in shadows 1m away from somebody and they not noticing you isn't really stealth).When you can get by an army of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in broad daylight on perfectionist and not even be spotted once, I think that says a whole lot more about stealth than chaos theory where you just stick (mostly) to shadows... Don't get me wrong, I freaking love chaos theory xDAs I said, blacklist doesn't force you to be stealthy, if you just wanna see Fisher in badass action, let him kill everybody, I mean, I sometimes like to go around sneaking on people and then all of a sudden SHOTGUN TO THE FACE!!! xDBlacklist is also harder for pure stealth, I mean, I did 100% in chaos theory on hardest difficulty without saving and loading, couldn't do it in blacklist though... (well tbh the train bug can be excused xD).The pistol thingy in chaos theory and double agent (forgot it's name lol) made you OP in artificially illuminated areas, IMO. No such thing in blacklist.Overall if you're REALLY unbiased while criticising, you'll get that the stealth in this one FAR outclasses any other splinter cell game, if you're going for stealth, that is ;)Graphics whise, I really can't tell, I'm not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, I usually run most of my games on the lowest to get as much FPS out of them as I can, even if I can run them at max xDSounds are amazing, but I REALLY MISS IRONSIDE!!! If I had the money, I'd pay im a few million $$$ to dub Fisher in this game xD			"

												Okay, so the Single-Player campaign is pretty fun, and challenging if you wanna execute every mission  perfectly. The story is a bit bland and generic, but it offers the missions prertty clearly. But this game still has major flaws. Firstly, Uplay is absolutely horrible, and useless, multi-player doesen't work with half the players, the game just randomly crashes to desktop without any warning and such. Ubisoft, get your♥♥♥♥♥♥ together, you already have enough money, stop milking it out.			"

												Ubisoft are brilliant at running beloved franchises into the ground and they did exactly that with Splinter Cell. Everything after Chaos Theory is best forgotten, preferably using large quantities of alcohol.Yes, Blacklist still has Conviction’s shooty-shooty bang-bang gameplay, but it’s fun shooty-shooty bang-bang gameplay and it works nicely alongside the newly returned sneaky-sneaky knife-knife gameplay.Throw in Spies vs Mercs and a brilliant co-op mode and this game almost deserves the Splinter Cell name. Almost.			"

												I just finished the main story line and I was a bit disappointed. It is fairly short and I finished it in around 7 hours of Gameplay. The gameplay itself is ok, giving you a lot of ways to go through a certain area, and it will reward you depending on your play style. There are also coop mission and online content, but I have not tried those out.However, this is such a horrible port. I have a very decent rig, and usually got 60+ frames during gameplay and 100+ fps during cinematics. However, every now and then the FPS will drop to 10 or less during gameplay as well as cinematics. It stutters horribly for a few seconds, then normalises again. Also, I have had at least a dozen freezes or crashes during my gameplay and I have tried several solutions, from altering the .ini file to reducing graphics etc. These changes helped a bit, but did not completely clear the problem for me.Overall, I would reluctantly recommend this game. It's definitely not a master piece and it's buggy, but it did provide me some decent gameplay while it lastet. I got it during a sale, and I would recommend you do the same.			"

												Fantastic level design, polished stealth and fun gadgets make for a great experience. The only weak point to the game in my honest opinion is the storyline which could have been way better.The game also has a series of coop missions which happen to be rather lengthy, require a lot of coordination and skill. You can choose between 3 different playstyles depending on what suits you best.Multiplayer packs a good bit of fun with its returning gamemode from Chaos Theory: Spies Vs Mercs in which spies playing in 3rd person have to hack terminals in order to win while 1st person mercs loaded with heavy gear have to prevent them from doing so.

												I've been a fan of the Splinter Cell series since the original game way back in the day.  The Splinter Cell series has always been quite clunky.  This game really fixed that.  The movement is all very fluent and smooth.  I tried revisiting older Splinter Cell games a few months ago and found them to be unplayable due to the mechanics, but Blacklist still stands as one of my favorite titles and a game I still love coming back to despite beating every mission several times on console, and now on PC.

Graphics are good, game runs smooth, no crashes... I played it after Max Payne 3 and it was hard to get into (the last boyscout character was miles better than this über soldier one).Anyway, not as stealthy as I thought it to be, not as long as I hoped for and the story is very ""mainstream"".

												For a game that was released on August 20, 2013 this is still a very enjoyable ride. The voice acting deserves credit, all characters in the game provide genuine performances. Their personalities can easily be seen, i still think Briggs is a tool! The sound and graphics are top notch and all work together flawlessly to provide a very satisfying gaming experience, i was kept hooked enough to keep coming back to complete the single player campaign. The main antagonist was portrayed quite well, although it would have been great to see his real personality earlier in the game instead of only in the final segments. The controls should be noted, sometimes Sam handles a little wonky, and there can be delays between animations which mess up your timing. I played the entire SP campaign with a controller and found no significant issues with it.All in all a very enjoyable experience from start to finish. If you haven't played this game you are really missing out!			"

												I just finished the main story line and I was a bit disappointed. It is fairly short and I finished it in around 7 hours of Gameplay. The gameplay itself is ok, giving you a lot of ways to go through a certain area, and it will reward you depending on your play style. There are also coop mission and online content, but I have not tried those out.However, this is such a horrible port. I have a very decent rig, and usually got 60+ frames during gameplay and 100+ fps during cinematics. However, every now and then the FPS will drop to 10 or less during gameplay as well as cinematics. It stutters horribly for a few seconds, then normalises again. Also, I have had at least a dozen freezes or crashes during my gameplay and I have tried several solutions, from altering the .ini file to reducing graphics etc. These changes helped a bit, but did not completely clear the problem for me.Overall, I would reluctantly recommend this game. It's definitely not a master piece and it's buggy, but it did provide me some decent gameplay while it lastet. I got it during a sale, and I would recommend you do the same.			"

												As much as I don't like UPlay, this game is actually so good that it would be a sin if I didn't change this review to positive.Disadvantages:- UPlay- game always starts windowed with resolution 1645x926- non-primary screens are blacked out when game is running- when minimising the game it switches back to default display mode and resolution (see above)Advantages:- interesting storyline- good graphics- a lot of upgrades for a plane (headquarters)- large choice of weapons, armors and equipment- a lot of upgrades for weapons- a lot of customisation for equipment- a lot of in-game challenges (plus also daily and weekly challenges) which give extra money to spend on upgrades- intuitive controls and interface- various game types (classic sneaking, defence with enemies coming in waves etc.)			"

Everything should be simple just use a main menu instead of getting all fancy and crap. Yes the plane upgrades area good idea but it needs to be more thourghtout.Secondly for the PC version is seems that joinig online games with Random people is ok at best, If your at home using your own internet and you have the time to be fiddleing with ports and crap like that then eventually you will get it working so that you can actually host and get friends to join. Otherwise for people using a internet like me (At a University Halls) the you have very little chances of playing with the people you wish to. Lastly not least should you find urself in a boring one vs one match you cannot leave unless im being silly but it seems i have to close the whole game down  and reopen which opens the uplay launcher then loads the game and its a real waste of time.If I was you dont play Uplay games for PC they have a consistancy of letting you down Generation after Generation			"

												Good potential, spoiled by simplistic controls (as its just a console port). So many times hitting Q to enter cover would make him jump over the cover (which should be triggered by space), even when not sprinting.  Sprinting would often result in unintentionally jumping over things or climbing if you ran just a little to close to a wall or obstacle, totally spoilt the immersion of the game.Storyline missions where very easy (but quite fun overall), 4E missions where much harder and some where very frustrating (mostly cos of control issues).About half way through playing I had a power cut during play, resulted in Uplay losing all my progress, took me right back to the start, thankfully I was able to use windows restore to get back to the previous days save, but still had to redo a couple missions.Overall I'd give it a 4 out of 10 and would not recomend it.

												I´ve been playing Splinter Cell Blacklist for about 50 hours now, and I must say, despite the fact that I had to get used to a couple of things (such as controls and Sam Fisher´s ultra-young voice compared to Conviction), it actually turns out to be a pretty epic game, better than Conviction, once you get into it... And if you just imagine it is a prequel to Conviction, occuring 10 years before Splinter Cell Conviction, the story line (Sam Fisher´s age) actually makes sense too :)I definitely recommend the game, if you like a good old SC stealth game. It really does bring the old stealth game play back!			"

I played through the game to the end and then went back to try and get the Gold Stars. I learned that even knowing what was coming did not in this game take anything away from the fun of trying, knowing is not the same as being able to do. The game has challenging single player mode objectives and I am sure the multiplay is pretty good if your into that.			"

												The story couldn't be anymore american. The game starts with an attack on the USA and you are Sam Fisher, the greatest patriotic spy the game industry has to offer and your goal is to rescue 'MURICA. Sam's black sidekick follows him around and helps him out whereever he can and yet Sam doesn't like him. Remember Sam's daughter whom you had to safe in S.C. Conviction? Well now you communicate with her trough your phone on your so called Paladin, a big♥♥♥♥♥Plane full of  	unnecessary scripted actions you have to make every few seconds. The game offers you a huge amount of useless gadgets. The only time I used a little RC helicopter was when the game forced me to do it. You also get a variety of grenades and other nonsense, even a rifle and yet the only thing you need is your pistol. Well actually you don't even really need that. And while you used the ""Execute Mode"" in Conviction quite often for reasons, you probably won't use it here at all. How's the stealth? It's Ubisofty. If you tried any of Ubisoft's past titles which included any sort of stealth (Far Cry 3, AC for example) then you might know what I'm talking about. It feels unrealistic and therefor way too easy. I won't say anything regarding the multiplayer since it's pretty much dead already.  "

Wheter this is a technical error or script error, I have no idea.- Grim doesn't give you lapdance. And finally, the bain of this game's existence: Sam Fisher is not voiced by Micheal Ironside. Apart from that, 8/8 would save America again.			"

												This game requires UPlay to play - Steam only launches the game through Uplay. This is listed only at the very bottom of the game's store page (currently 5 times in small print). Beyond this, the game features an awful menu/user interface which is so entirely impossible to navigate its poor design could only be intentional. I would say, however, that if a person were to be interested in design of any sort, this would be worth buying as an example of what not to do. I might review the game play if I could figure out how to find it.			"

I read a lot of things like this with uplay, and it happened with Far cry 3... I've never finished far cry and I will never finish splineter cell blacklist...end of the story			"

												This game is extremely misleading. I expected a list of black people to invite to a party. Instead i get a game with stealth tactics. Also i didnt get any splinters playing this game. was i supposed to play it on a wooden deck? i dont get it. anyway this game does have some good things. I had a lot of fun sneaking around like a sneaky slithering p*nis snake and then molesting I MEAN assassinating people. Also shooting people in the d*ck when they least expect it is pretty fun too, they're all like ""OMFG SOMEONE SHOT MY D*CK OFF MAN OOOOOOAOAOAAHWHWWH JASUS CHREEST"" and then die from d*ck blood loss. and when someone notices that someone got shot in the d*ck then it gets spicy like a taco bell sheet. thats when i pull out my full auto ak47 and im like "" BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM IMA GET ALL YO D*CKS!!!"" then everyone drops from d*ck blood loss. Sometimes there are juggernauts and those can be tricky. The tricks to get these tricky d*ckies is to either stick a sticky d*ck bomb right on their d*cks or shoot them in the d*ck with a grenade launcher. I suppose you could just stick a knife in his a*shole but i mean whats the fun in that? exactly, NO EXPLOSIONS. (this review was written entirely for comedy purposes)			"

												*** Another Uplay DRM Garbage. This review is about Uplay (Yes, ONCE AGAIN, UPLAY), not the game. If you want to read the review of the game, then look somewhere else ***Yes, look at my playing time. I did not really play a lot, did I? Well, that's because UPLAY DOES NOT LET ME PLAY. You can check out my old review which is about the Uplay on Far Cry 3, and well, I played FC3 on PS3 and the game is decent. But UPLAY IS JUST GARBAGE. I mean, what the hell is going on here? I HAVE, THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM THAT I HAD ON FAR CRY 3'S UPLAY, WHEN I AM USING A TOTALLY DIFFERENT MACHINE NOW. I mean, I just want to know. Does Uplay even work? Is it even MEANT to work in any way?Blacklist was on sale, and glad I did not pay more than 20 bucks for this piece of donkey trash, even though this game is NOT EVEN worth 10 cents all because of Uplay.Now, I think it would be so much better if you just grab the PS3 version, because frankly, I have no clue as to what is causing this stupid mess. I have nothing more to say, Uplay sucks, and it sucks forever. Uplay gets - (Minus) 100 out of 10, meaning Total Garbage.But how is the game, Splinter Cell Blacklist? I WISH I COULD TELL YOU.Ubisoft sucks.			"

												I'm not of the sneaking game group of people, but I enjoy it on ocassion.  Those who like full on sneak games will probably be dissapointed in this game but I like that it gives you the option to do either sneak or run and gun, (although RnG is a bit harder to succeed at) this game is best somewhere in the middle, which is a third optional playtype.overall it's an improvement over the last game, particularly how you can go back and replay older story missions with gear you've unlocked.The multiplayer is a fascinating combination of first person versus third person combat, heavy gunners with armor are in first person, which is fitting, and sneaky low armored stealth guys in third, which is also fitting.  SNeaky sem like they have the advantage but the first person guys can take them out easier if the third person guys dont get the drop on them quick enough.Overall I like this game, there's a lot of fun to be had.  So why am I giving it a negative review?Because if someone uses hacks in multiplayer you're ♥♥♥♥ed.There is NO vote kick. NO report. NO leave match option either! So if your game bugs out or someone is, using an item in their grenade slot that instant kills the entire enemy team repetively the moment the spawn back in you are literally stuck watching yourself be helpless to the hacker with no way to get rid of them or to even escape them without alt-F4ing/end programing or reseting your computer.Literally nothing you can do about it.  How could Ubisoft over look such a thing?  And yes, that was literally what happened to me and despite loving this game I immdiatly quit out, discovered there's literally nothing you can do, and just uninstalled it right away and have not been back since.A brother of a friend got glitched into an object and couldn't quit out.So if you only play single player, or can avoid hackers, it's a fun game worth a few play through.  But, hackers ruined it, ♥♥♥♥ it.			"

Coop & Multiplayer is not working as well as it should thanks to UPlay issuesUplay by it self getting more and more confusing with every updateThe In-Game menu looks / is extremly unstructured, and sometimes resets setting for no reason - like resolution, window mode, mouse & audio - settings ...The gameplay by itself is about the same like in conviction just with even more shooting and less hiding.Weirdly though - in many singleplayer maps - you get the most points for just ignoring all enemies and running to the exfiltration point without disturbing anyone.For every one who likes Splinter Cell the old fashion way .... maybe think twice			"

												It could have been much better.The controls feel like you're playing the first Resident Evil at times, it's dreadful and concerns me considering the year this game was made and that people were actually payed to do this.The different ways you could go through the missions are the only redeeming factor in this game, the gunplay is atrocious and your camera will frequently lock in combat which is in the end what finally caused this game to be dropped into a category of pure♥♥♥♥♥♥Also can you at least try and make a game where every option isn't the same button? Keyboards have a lot of different keys and you don't need to make spacebar the same ♥♥♥♥ing button to both open the door and also PEEK UNDER IT. There are many more aspects where this will do nothing but ♥♥♥♥ you but I don't want to be here writing for the next few hours. When the game starts to get fast paced and intense you will find yourself dealing with a someone who must have a serious nerve disorder because trying to make fluid movements with your weapon to aim at different enemies is nothing short of impossible and even if you turn off aim assist, there is still some clearly built into the game and it will still drag your aim. The idea of recoil in this game is that you're not able to control it and you're also not allowed to move the gun at all once you fire, it doesn't rise or it doesnt fall, the accuracy just drops the more you fire, taking out multiple enemies that are coming towards you if it ever comes to it is semi impossible if there are any dogs, you simply cannot kill  them all fast enough unless you abuse pathing to make them funnel directly into you.I really would only suggest this if you can deal with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t			"

They have been caught downgrading graphics so there is no difference between the PC and underpowered console versions which makes me think this is another victim of crappy ubisoft politics.

												One of the most brilliant stealthy games I've ever played. Great graphics and cool martial arts the coop and multiplayer have great concept. But they require extremely stable network condition. Uplay is not easy to deal with. That may explain why there are such a few players remaining nowadays. I hope SC series won't die. Come back soon, please.			"

												Splinter Cell is ruined. The style is totally bubbly and Conviction-like. The game is WAY too action based. This game reminds me nothing of Chaos Theory. The SvM is totally dumbed down and action based.Ubisoft also refuses to patch this game. It's rampant with issues... "

												If Ubisoft had kept good old Michael Ironside as Sam Fisher, I would've enjoyed the parts when the character opens his mouth and makes a sound. Really, the new voice is way too young to be Fisher. At least Hideo Kojima knows what he's doing when trying to find replacement voice actors to Metal Gear series.I recommend this newest installment of the Splinter Cell series only to people new to the series, not to true-fans.

												I used to like the stealth element in this game but now it feels like a chore. There is no freedom in a ""stealth mission"" so what if I want to knock someone out in the balls just to further my mission? I don't care about the cutscene, the game play is more important. The freedom parts I enjoy, just toying with my prey having fun with their dead bodies throwing them down stairs etc.It's a good engine and works fluently but the co-op under delivers in every way since chaos theory, that is the bench mark for this game.And who ever made the first person mode in splinter cell I hope you are reading this because I would happily read a beano book and curl a monster turd over your head whilst I read it.

												Like a modern stealth game, it implements elements like the Money/Shop/Loadout system from other stealth games like Sniper Elite 3, Hitman: Blood Money, and surely more. This is a great one to pick up for $30.00 or cheaper, as it has a great campaign, Co-op missions (which you can do solo if you want to), and Multiplayer. Uplay does help with it's ""Rewards"". Either way, great to pick up... at least until Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain comes out.			"

There is a point at which people feel that its starting to feel like cod, but the intense gun fights between spy and merc is priceless.  Its just getting used to the new concept of tactical gameplay with smgs. I would recommend this game but only on ps3, not  pc or xbox 360, I played on pc and realized its not the same hit system with guns and heard that multiplayer on xbox is dead. Overall its a great game to play on ps3, have spent over 2000 hours on it.			"

												i would recommend if controls worked. some times when you try to use cover you jump over it instead, obviously blowing your cover at the worst times. some pipes you can drop down from while others leave you stranded on them and forced to backtrack to where you initally grabbed the pipe (unless an enemy is under you then you can drop on them) and some ledges you climb up automatically while others you hang off the ledge and are given the option after that to climb up and over, another part that will blow your cover at the worst times. it ruins the whole experience by constantly annoying and frustrating you throughout the game, because cover is a huge part of the play mechanic, as well as climbing.

YOU WILL CONSTANTLY END UP IN ♥♥♥♥♥♥ SITUATIONS BECAUSE YOU ACCIDENTALLY KICKED A DOOR OR JUMPED OVER COVER WHEN YOU WERE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. Seriously though, it's kinda comparable to free running in Assasin's Creed. The game attempts to be smooth and seemless with context sensitve actions but a good part of the time you just end up doing something you didn't want to do. Other than that the game is loads of fun, a good call back to the classic splinter cell titles. Just don't expect to be able to do things quickly in a panic situation, the controlls are just going to betray you. Take things slow and avoid those situations entirely and you'll like this game more.			"

												While there is fun to be had in Splinter Cell Blacklist the controls end up causing more frustration than fun and with no alternate control schemes you are forced to play the game the way the designers want you to play and not the way most comfortable for you.There are seperate buttons for climbing up, climbing down, and sticking to and off of cover.  Getting used to these is fine but in the heat of the moment when a guard comes up behind you and all you want to do is pull away from a wall or quickly drop from a ledge your going to panic and your perfect run will be ruined.  Ideally a context sensitive ""use button"" or smarter ""sticky"" cover system would have done wonders.Not to mention people who have never played a Splinter Cell game before will find even the Rookie difficulty hair pullingly insane.  The game is designed to lock out the most usefull tools that could help Rookie players until you can earn them much later in the game.  Things like expanded radar, improved sonar vision, and enemy facing on the radar would have made the earlier experience for new players a much smoother ride.One of the most attrocious features the developers overlooked for the PC version of the game is the ability to save when you want.  This is something PC stealth gamers have enjoyed for years but in this modern age of autosaves and checkpoints it is nowhere to be found in this game.  Enjoy doing side missions where you have to kill 35 enemies and bust on the last one, or where you have to complete multiple objectives without being spotted once and blow it right at the end.  It's just too risky to save before trying out a really fun and neat looking manuever so its best just to play it safe and boring.If you can get past the unwieldy controls and the lack of a save feature this is a well made content rich game.  For new players you'll have to put up with a lot of frustration and replaying extremely long stretches of gameplay over and over and over again.			"

												The Splinter Cell series of games just keeps getting better. I know everyone was a little salty at Ubisoft for playing down the stealth aspects of the game in Conviction. Well, rest easy. Stealth is back, and in a big way, in Blacklist. In the old games, if you were in the shadows, the enemy could walk right up to you and wouldn't even notice you were there. Not anymore....the shadows just make you tougher to see. I like how the gadgets are back too. Even though Michael Ironside is the only TRUE voice for Sam Fisher, the new voice isn't too bad. I highly recommend you get your hands on this one when you can.....it's worth it!			"

												Really good game but did not fail to crash every single time I was on a level or in a game. Tried to play the same mission with my friend too many times and whenever we were close to the end it froze and threw us out, maybe if the game was actually tested and problems were fixed then yeah its good but for me, just £20 to watch my screen freeze over and over again, expected a lot better than this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												First off, the single player game is great. It's everything you'd want in Splinter Cell. However, multiplayer has been hacked to the point of it being impossible to play a match without someone cheating their way to the top. Until something is done about this the online mode is worse than worthless. With Ubisoft's track record I'm not holding my breath for anything to be fixed. Such a shame, Spies vs Mercs really was something amazing...			"

												The Splinter Cell series of games just keeps getting better. I know everyone was a little salty at Ubisoft for playing down the stealth aspects of the game in Conviction. Well, rest easy. Stealth is back, and in a big way, in Blacklist. In the old games, if you were in the shadows, the enemy could walk right up to you and wouldn't even notice you were there. Not anymore....the shadows just make you tougher to see. I like how the gadgets are back too. Even though Michael Ironside is the only TRUE voice for Sam Fisher, the new voice isn't too bad. I highly recommend you get your hands on this one when you can.....it's worth it!			"

												I love how Mr. Fisher magically changes his appearance from one game to the other and that there's no consistency what so ever in the character. But.. it's just a Tom Clancy 'Murica kind of game and I'm playing them for the stealth gameplay, so... I'll forgive that. I don't forgive them(UBISOFT) for having disabled the Steam overlay and taking screenshots. What's the point fellas? I'm not gonna switch exclusively to your DRM platform because of that. You're just making an♥♥♥♥♥out of yourselves with that.Otherwise a similar terrible console porting going on here like in the last game. Although I must admit there are a lot more options to fiddle around with and the performance is bearable at high to ultra settings. There's mouse lag, the usual obstacles in your way to change FOV and problems with RadeonPro although that is not neccessarily their fault.I just hope the gameplay will be as good as the reviews said. I might add some thoughts after I played through the game. First impression is mediocre though and I had to get that off my chest because disabling the platform I am used to is not the way to win me over Mr. UbiSoft.Addendum: It is possible to use the overlay and make screenshots after ALT-Tabbing and going back in...

												Haven't actualy played much of this game yet but I forgot that Michael Ironside isn't Sam Fisher in this one so that's a drag. rip drunk michael ironside now sam is a 28 year old with kinda grey hair :'(((((Edit:Now I've actually played a lot I can say that it is a good game - slap it on top difficulty, go full non lethal stealth and it actually feels like Splinter Cell, a vast improvement over the abysmal Splinter Cell: Conviction. Ultimately unsatisfying though. They went back in the right direction but in the end I still couldn't recommend it to fans of the original three games.Chaos Theory is available on steam and people seem to think it is a good port, so get that instead and enjoy one of the best stealth games ever made. I still vividly remember most of its missions despite not having played it in years, whereas everything in blacklist will quickly fade from my mind.			"

I had faith in Blacklist and I desire another Splintercell. But first, lets talk about Blacklist...The Blacklist campaign is basically Sam Fisher working for 4th Echelon (founded by the President) and are working towards taking down the so called Engineers - a terrorist group who launch attacks on American every seven days. As you may have guessed, Sam and a few new other people (Charlie - the technology dude, Briggs - the best agent that came from some random place I can't remember - Helpful right?) are trying to stop these attacks and stop America from basically being destroyed...The graphics are amazing, especially on high settings. The SMI intergration with the game is amazing and I really like how you can actively choose whether to do Campaign, COOP, or these other missions which I can't remember, so this review is gonna be SO helpful... But there is one thing I missed sorely in this game - The interrorgation scenes. In Conviction, you could either smash a terrorist head into a toilet, burn their face on a stove or just punch them loads of times. Either way, you somehow beat the answers out of them. But does Blacklist have that? No. :( You just get the choice whether to kill or spare.  The gadgets are fun and exciting to use. But you have to buy the game to know what I mean...I may not have covered all aspects of the game, but I believe these are the most important. There is so much more to discover in this game and I hope one day, you will be the one discovering...No rating. Because this game is too good. :)			"

												My first Splinter cell  was Conviction,and it was perfect for me from story to gameplay,so I actually compared Blacklist with Conviction.STORY: I think both Stories were good Conviction showed Sam Fisher as a person who has no hope for future and just want to find those who killed his daughter,and Blacklist is like a action movie with a lot of unexpected scenes.However I think Blacklist wanted to show Sam Fisher as a patriot person as you will see in some scenes in game,and I think they were successful.GAMEPLAY: Blacklist is better.It's like a remastered version of Conviction's gameplay,with full of new options,gadgets and guns.Exactly like Conviction you can finish your mission with a lot of actions or stealthy,but finish your mission in action mode is a little bit harder in Blacklist even in Normal difficulty.SOUNDS: I didn't see any special dialogue between characters or maybe I forgot it,however it had some mistakes like some soldiers speak Persian (Farsi) altought accent was good,but radio was playing Arabic music instead of a Persian music,however it is so respectable for me that sometimes Ubisoft mentions Persian language or other things in this game ,or other games like Prince of Persia.I recommend this game if you are looking for a stealthy game without any obvious bug or something.Overall: 9.10			"

												Well where to start? At the beginning of course.The game drops you right into the first mission - the tutorial/Exposé of the story - with no menu before hand. That's fine if you like auto-detected settings and default key binds, but not everyone does and I'd certainly like a real main menu for the game (all interaction is done via the Ingame Worldmap or interaction with characters on board the Paladin Airplane).But those are minor points.The introduction into the story feels like the game wants to be a movie but isn't. It is a very hollywood-esque story and as such feels a little bland. While the missions are (so far) quite fun and varied, they are by no means especially creative or challenging. You either get it right or you have to restart and getting it right is more often than not a choice between killing everything in your way or waiting until the next opponent has his back turned.The enemies or scenarios don't offer much challenge either for the most part. The worst thing that can happen are armoured opponents or dogs (or both) in combination with ""Don't get spotted and don't trigger any alarm"" objectives.There is also no lack of gadgets and while having a large selection of stuff is nice (although half the gadgets are essentially the same as the bolts for the crossbow) having too much of everything is not. Even using your gadgets very liberally for takedowns (rather than sneaking around and doing the hand-to-hand stuff) you will rarely be in a situation where you think ""Damn I wish I had more XY to take out those guys"". You will have enough.Multiple routes are present in almost every mission/situation so there is no lack of choice there, however some lend themselves more to a certain playstyle than others.I like the customization the singleplayer offers, though again a bit more creativity would be fun - giving the suits for example extra abilities or special gadgets - rather than having simple liniear upgrades.Customization in Multiplayer is another matter entirely. If you play this game online PvP rather than COOP, play the Classic mode. The classic mode with its default profiles is fun and challenging and the maps are far more entertaining 2v2. The 4v4 Blacklist modes are a cluster♥♥♥♥ of epic proportions.It is still very much the best Splinter Cell Game since Chaos Theory as far as I'm concerned.Update: As the game goes on, it goes out of its way to get you to shoot stuff. For every ""Don't get spotted"" Objective there is one ""Neutralize all the Hostiles"" and added to that you get situations forced upon you during which stealth is no longer really an option. The COOP in particular is filled with lethal situations that don't really work in a stealth game.			"

												My first Splinter cell  was Conviction,and it was perfect for me from story to gameplay,so I actually compared Blacklist with Conviction.STORY: I think both Stories were good Conviction showed Sam Fisher as a person who has no hope for future and just want to find those who killed his daughter,and Blacklist is like a action movie with a lot of unexpected scenes.However I think Blacklist wanted to show Sam Fisher as a patriot person as you will see in some scenes in game,and I think they were successful.GAMEPLAY: Blacklist is better.It's like a remastered version of Conviction's gameplay,with full of new options,gadgets and guns.Exactly like Conviction you can finish your mission with a lot of actions or stealthy,but finish your mission in action mode is a little bit harder in Blacklist even in Normal difficulty.SOUNDS: I didn't see any special dialogue between characters or maybe I forgot it,however it had some mistakes like some soldiers speak Persian (Farsi) altought accent was good,but radio was playing Arabic music instead of a Persian music,however it is so respectable for me that sometimes Ubisoft mentions Persian language or other things in this game ,or other games like Prince of Persia.I recommend this game if you are looking for a stealthy game without any obvious bug or something.Overall: 9.10			"

												'It's okay.'Ubisoft's pattented clunky-control system aside, this is a good call back to the original set of splinter cell games, allowing sam to ♥♥♥♥♥♥around with his old set of gadgets in some fresh new maps and an 'amazing' storyline. It feels slightly cliche, along the idea of Battlefield 3's campaign etc.The 'new' voice actor for Sam delivers his lines with much gusto, as the motion-capture-and-face-recorded takes do marvelously to bring out Fisher's features. The voice acting is less Michael Ironside's tough guy act, more 'Big Boss' No-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t attitude.


YouTube™ Video: Splinter Cell Blacklist - Michael Ironside & Eric Johnson [UK]

			Official website: http://splintercell.com Facebook page: http://splintercell.com/facebook Splinter Cell Blacklist will be released in Spring 2013 on Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and PC.		

This game adds a 'unique' customisation system in the sense of Vegas' RPG style credit system, earn cash by doing specific tasks and spend it on new weapons, gadgets, suits and perks. If you hate this kind of stuff, you can always cheat (or be forced to cheat) by buying the deluxe edition, which adds nothing new to the game aside from unlocking some mid-tier weaponry and 'exclusive' mid tier gadgets/armour, which you unlock better equivalents of further through the game, anyway.Basically, the game allows you to play in multiple styles, designated by 3 categories, Ghost, Panther and Assault. The more you play of one style, the more points you will gather, yet only Ghost gives you the optimal amount of payout to earn money for new EQ, slightly forcing your hand. Ghost style means mostly sneaking around hostiles and completing objectives without being spotted, and taking out hostiles non-lethally, while panther allows more freedom of movement with eliminating hostiles in a covert fashion. Assault means going out guns blazing, netting you the lowest amount of points and the hardest time in the game unless you're one of those meth-amped up CoD kids that really doesn't understand the basic principle of 'stealth video games'.Each mission has a set few side objectives, those being: Neutralizing/capturing a specific enemy, collecting a hidden data drive and/or hacking into a random laptop. These objectives are always in the same spot in their respective maps, and not at all randomly generated, not leaving much surprise.Speaking of random generation, although many youtubers mention that the AI seems to be 'almost completely random', they are not. Every time a mission is loaded, the AI will choose a specific preset which the AI will follow to the letter, every single time. The AI will only react randomly if they are engaged or distracted. This means it's an easy speed run game as every movement can be pretty much perfected with zero effort with this game's lenient stealth system.I say lenient as I am one of the older SC series players, light had a much greater effect on stealth and there were several speeds to maneuver under, this game throws all of that out of the door for a simple 'dark' and 'light' system, where it shows you if the surrounding area is 'dark enough' to give you bonus stealth points (e.g., harder to see depending on your suit's stealth rating). The AI does not have a limited vision cone and WILL spot you halfway across the map hiding behind a box if it's bright and shiny out, yet being in the dark doesn't make you completely invisible either. Mostly only if you try to stay still, or move as fluently as possible will you be able to evade vision completely. Moving with not enough forethought will most likely get you spotted and killed.Difficulty ranges from walking around like a big tank on easier modes, to being killed nearly immediately once spotted. Gear can be rigged to be combat oriented, allowing more ammunition capacity and total hits absorbed, or stealth oriented, making you incredibly fragile, but very versatile and hard to spot. It's possible to balance the two out as well, to go for the panther style and engage targets covertly and lethaly from various ranges, or evade sight.The AI itself was, at the time, already outdated. Smart enough to be able to find cover, they will most likely rush your last known location guns blazing. Imagine this, when you walk out of sight, as in the previous few ♥♥♥♥♥♥ SC installments, a ghost pattern of your last known location is left behind. The enemy will actively fire at this position, supposedly to blanket covering fire for other units to flank your position. This works quite well in open terrain, but not so much in closed off corridors. Most levels are 'open' and less liniear (to today's cookie cutter shooter game standards, at least), however when there ARE closed off corridors, enemies will start to move up with each other in a straight conga-line, opening fire on your ghost while one by one passing through it, turning to face it and continuing to fire. At least the AI doesn't appear to have friendly fire, so that's great.The AI chatter is a different thing, spoken in many languages, sometimes by just one/two voice actors per 'region'. Voice acting is of great quality. They'll switch to English if the player is within cognitive distance. I've not heard the same lines of dialogue, perhaps if one were to reload a level multiple times they will.As said before, weapons can be customized, but aside from aesthetics and stat-wise, only the scopes and laser sight will truly affect gameplay, as they allow either easier shot acquisition or first person aiming, with a really glitchy broken laggy sensitivity scope, just like Ubisoft does best. Q&A? What's that?Unfortunately, there's also broken addon ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like a cellphone app that ubisoft dropped years ago and hasn't updated since, that lets you unlock mid-tier gear for the beginning of the game. As the app doesn't work, this is impossible to achieve. So yeah, no 100% completion for anyone. Because Ubisoft doesn't give a rats♥♥♥♥♥about you.Multiplayer is back as usual, with a similair feel to it as Chaos theory had, lets all pretend like the previous 4(5?6?) SC's didn't happen. You can unlock new♥♥♥♥♥♥by getting tokens, I couldn't be arsed, there's probably some meta out there somewhere and I wouldn't be surprised if tokens are secretly some purchasable microtransaction in-game currency.Unfortunately, the 'freedom of movement' of the first 3 splinter cells is vaguely present, half the obstacles that you would be able to climb in, for example, Chaos theory, cannot even be scaled in this one, often leaving you slamming face first into walls and obstacles in the middle of an enemy patrol. It's also no longer possible to jump (on/)off ledges, buildings etc.The controls feel sticky sometimes, where pressing the climb button will send Sam flying off to a nearby ledge instead of over a fence you're trying to climb, of course halting progress to a dead drop and often causing me to get spotted.Adding to that is the sprint button's double functionality as a 'terrain cancelling' move, kind of like in Assassin's Creed's style freerunning, unfortunately this also automatically drops you off of ledges, so trying to climb ontop of something in a hurry is better done bashing the climb button rather than holding sprint, as it may send you sailing off of rooftops in a heartbeat. Not that you can actually kill yourself by falls in this game, as any sort of freedom is stripped away from you, only being able to climb up or off of ledges, pipes, scaffoldings, ladders etc. where the game deems fit. No more Chaos Theory style aerial knockdowns from the top of a rooftop, no sirree, players nowaday need to hands held at all times and can make no decisions for themselves.That's all I can think of right now, I'd suggest getting this game if one of your friends has it just to enjoy the COOP, otherwise, wait for the next sale, if ever.

												Yes, Michael Ironside is no longer voicing Sam Fisher. I liked him, but the new voice actor does just fine and I forgot about the difference almost immediately because the game is so enjoyable. Ever feel like Splinter Cell games are just a set of missions one after the other with one page of text and some voice acting in between? This game revolutionizes Splinter Cell by having your team available to walk up to in between missions and talk to them about the last mission or current state of affairs. Not only that, but each team member has four ""side missions"" you can play either solo or in co op! The side missions are NOT rehashes of the single player campaign like most games tend to do. These are missions of four types (full stealth enemy elimination, waves of baddies, full stealth target acquisition, and missions akin to the single player campaign. You can upgrade your base of operations to get new guns, ability to spot hidden stuff at a distance to guarantee you won't need a damned walkthrough to 100% everything, faster health regen, etc. I never even -touched- the competitive multiplayer part of the game (spies vs mercs), but I hear it's good. That's just not my thing. Anyway, I got the game for $34.99 (Deluxe, I think) and am completely pleased with my purchase. I've bought games for under $2.00 and felt like I wasted money, so this should be some sign of my level of satisfaction! Great game.			"

												HIGLY RECOMMENDED.It's amazing to see what a load of great games are coming lately.Sure, I am a fan of Splinter Cell series but, this doesn't count to indentify this release as a great game, in every sense.I am noticing lately that most of games I am loving are being moved by Unreal engine and, once again Ubisoft's Canada and Shangai people are  delivering a master piece.Respect of previous releases, this Splinter Cell sets appart. Not so linear as the previous ones and, more based in small missions, that together form an story but, with way less depth than in previous ones. But, action has been clearly enhanced and, the game has now some kind of RPG mix, allowing you to evolute your suit and weapons, as well as the headquarter technology to help you in future missions.Each mission gives you points, depending on several characteristics, and those points are used to improve your gear and gadgets, what is an interesting approach.Movements of Sam are perfect, very fluid and realistic.New interesting Multiplayer games, with some surprise challenges in the ShadowNet (some kind of aleatory or special missions).MASTER PIECEA MUST-HAVE, MUST-PLAY GAME			"

												It's like the splinter cells of yester year, but a little dumbed down from the previous games. Personally I thought Conviction was the last one, which made that game leaps and bounds more important to me in terms of story. So tacking on another adventure, with a completely different voice actor feels like heresy in a way. But if you don't care about that, it's a pretty good stealth game, with equally as fun mechanics for taking down a lot of guys quickly and quietly. Only big problem I have design wise were the first person segements, which weren't really needed, and proved to be a very jarring change of pace.Side note, I never got to finish this game because Uplay completely jacked up and is asking for a code, which is no longer active. And the reason it's no longer active is because I used it to play the game in the first place! Oh Uplay.			"

												Despite being one of my all-time favourite franchises, Splinter Cell has always been a series of ups and downs. With highs like Chaos Theory and lows like Double Agent, I honestly don't know what to expect anymore. While Conviction was by all means a respectable game, it set the series in a new direction while abandoning some of the trademark stealth aspects. In an odd twist of fate, the series changed hands and the brand new Ubisoft Toronto managed the impossible: to create a truly remarkable Splinter Cell title.I can probably write paragraphs about Splinter Cell: Blacklist and why it is such a remarkable game. It is easy to ignore the jingoist mess that is the main story and instead focus on the remarkable level design, location diversity and a truly elegant approach to stealth games. While Ubisoft has a nasty habit of producing bloated sequels with unnecessary features, Blacklist is the exception to the rule. It is a lean, clever, deep and rewarding game that I highly recommend to fans of the franchise and newcomers alike.			"

												Fantastic addition to the Splinter Cell series. People may complain about it being too action based but they're wrong. Went through 90% of the game without killing anyone. Only killed because I'm not that good and a couple accidents by not switching to non-lethal. Regardless it's got an amazing single-player with a lot of challenge, beat it on realistic but haven't tried perfectionist yet. Multiplayer is the big down-side if you don't have time. Matches are small so when one person leaves it kinda breaks the rest of the match(es) until someone else joins.			"

												One of the best Tactical Espionage Movie like games of all times. Beat the game, then play it again on higher difficulty.You have gadgets, motion captured animations, great dialogues, great story, great scenarios, amazing gameplay, awesome graphics.I hate Uplay but i like this game.

												Solid game. Very solid.After Conviction I had lost a lot of hope in the series, considering I was a huge fan of the old Splinter Cell mechanics and gameplay, but this time my hope had been restored. Splinter Cell Blacklist had a very immersive story with realism and suspense. SC returns to its extremely stealthy roots and delivers a punch I at least didn't see coming after Conviction. Also I hit a guy and dragged him under the map. 11/10			"

												Ubisoft makes one of the best games out there, which are always half-finished at 50% & patched till 55%. And then well thats it, they dont give a damn anymore, they'l just move on to make another game while the previous game is not even finished or working properly. The amount of hackers online in Blacklist MP is also annoying, I highly recommend you do not buy this game, its just like any other Ubisoft game, half finished & broken. They are fixing Unity while all their previous titles are half dead. Whats the point			"

												I'm not much of a Splinter Cell fan and instead I've always prefered Metal Gear Solid series but even as a die hard MGS fan I have to say that Chaos Theory was one of the best stealth games ever made. Pure gold.SC Conviction felt like a mess and I never played it much but Blacklist looked promising so why not grab it from a sale?Here's a few things why not:Basically the cover system alone is enough for me to give this game a negative rating. You can get trough the ultimate tunnel run maps by going into cover in the beginning and then just smashing space so Fisherman runs from cover to cover on himself.In Chaos Theory you faced maps that had more enemies than you had bullets in total, in Blacklist you'll get resupplied a couple of times per map on a checkpoint.Executions, introduced in Conviction, are still here. On easier difficulties you can just mark the enemies and press a button and Fishy takes them all out.Multiplayer is just so amazingly screwed up that it's hard to describe. You maybe able to get in a game if you're lucky and willing to play with a complete Re-Tard random but don't even think about playing with your friends or anything. The invite system doesn't work and gives different excuses why you can't join the same game.All in all this could be a good game under a different name. Maybe I'm just an idiot but I can't enjoy playing a game like this when it's branded to be Splinter Cell, a flag bearer of PC stealth games, because it is not a Splinter Cell, it doesn't feel like a Splinter Cell in any point.

												Splinter Cell over the years has been a wonderful Franchise to play. Yet, this version on steam is absoutly horrific. You are faced with severe lag that can be be reduced down after fiddling with controls. However, some still remains that can not go away so if you basically make one mislick on keyboard your as good as dead. Maybe this game would be more easier to play had splinter cell decided not to go with uplay. After all Driver San Francisco which game first on uplay ran so WELL (it didn't, so many problems). Perhaps, throughout time there will be enough good patch updates to fix blacklist and make it more play friendly, but for now i would have to give them a 2 star rating out of 5.			"

												i bought this game because i have been with the series from the very beginning, and because the game play is very enjoyable and well put togetherbut i want to make it clear that i IN NO WAY support the recasting of sam's voice actornew guy had some good lines that made me crack a smile or whatever but because of the new voice i couldn't help seeing him as 'standard movie action hero guy' instead of the dark humored, cold-hearted agent of efficiency (and occasional sass) that we all know and love. gameplay-wise it was fine, but it was lacking in the key characterization that made these games stand out so much from others in the espionage genre. i understand that apparently it's easier to do it with the full actor and motion capture instead of a voice actor and animation lip synching but it's not worth the saved time/money to lose such an important part of the SC universe.gameplay: 8/10VO: i'll give you a mulligan.

You are most rewarded for stealth, but you can run and gun if you want.  You can upgrade your weapons and gear to fit your playstyle.  The campaign is about 10 hrs, but can be much more or less depending on how you play.  It has good checkpoints, and all around was fun.  I felt like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ and could be stealthy without a ton of waiting and doing nothing.  It has a bunch of other missions outside of the main campaign, plus multiplayer.  The plot was decent.

YouTube™ Video: Splinter Cell Blacklist review - The best game in the series so far? 

			Views: 14,183		

			http://cramgaming.com - A review of Splinter Cell Blacklist using the Xbox 360 version.		

To conclude, Splinter Cell Blacklist offers a full package that dances with several styles to create an encompassing game that covers all bases with ease. The story is interesting, the characters well realized, and the gameplay of a high caliber as expected from game number six in the series. With single player, co-op and multiplayer, there's enough to sink ones teeth into for quite some time, and so the question remains, is Blacklist worth a purchase, and more importantly, better than Conviction? The answer is obviously yes on both counts, making Blacklist not a massive leap forwards in terms of new features, but perhaps the most slick and accomplished game of the series to date.Score 9/10 - Review by Robert Cram			"

												A horrendous addition to the Splinter Cell franchise. With cheating AI, a ridiculous camera that is FAR too close to the player character, and a non-responsive control scheme to boot. It's pretty awful. I have a gut feeling that the changes incorporated in Blacklist were introduced with Call of Duty's playerbase in mind, with a control schemes almost mimicking the popular FPS series and easier gunplay. The character feels clumsy and the map designs are very restricting, the AI can also see you behind walls.Also this game did Sam Fisher a huge disservice by swapping his voice actor for somebody so OBVIOUSLY younger than Michael Ironside. The character just sounds like some out of place angry frat boy instead of a tired war veteran and this could have been so easily fixed by writing off Sam Fisher as retired, and simply getting a different character to take over. As I'm pretty sure a stealth agency doesn't only have one agent. The voice acting sounds particularly bad when Sam talks to his daughter where he sounds about the same age as her, and insanely creepy.The other thing this game does really bad is the transition between missions, Sam Fisher walks broodingly on his super spy plane to talk to his fellow operatives and he takes forever getting there. However, it's a fantastic time to realize that the camera is obscenely close to his back.			"

												If I could sum this game up in one word it would be: Frustrating.I have literally restarted two different missions at least two dozen times.  I spent over three hours doing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ side mission.  Why?  Because the game designers have decided that instead of going with a smarter AI approach, they're instead going to make enemy mobs that are 100% impervious to any gadget attacks in the game. Oh and with a gas mask, helmet and 200 lbs of armor on, they can also magically hear you sneaking up behind them for a stealth kill.  I have 100% stealth armor, the navy camo upgrade for night missions and I've carefully shot out every light within a 10 mile radius.  None of this matters as you approach him from the rear while he stares pensively over the railing of a ship.  He can hear a feather fall onto a cloud from 10 miles away inside his gas mask.  Which is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  I spent the better part of a decade in the Army and I've worn gas masks more than David Caruso wears sunglasses.  You couldn't hear a Harley Davidson driving through a jet engine with one of those things strapped to your face.They can't be electrocuted, they can't be gassed, they can't be snuck up on and God help you if you decide to shoot them because it will take more ammo than was used in the entire siege of Stalingrad just to knock their helmet off.Also, the game now forces you to go 100% down one of three paths for each mission.  Personally I like to use the entire toolbox of gear that I bring on Sam Fisher when doing missions.  However, this is penalized as some gadgets will automatically incur a Ghost kill while you're trying to go 100% panther route.  Don't like it?  Can't use that gadget, then.Oh right, the Sniper Rifles.  This one kills me.  No literally, my sides are splitting open as I slap my knee and guffaw at how idiotic this is.  Sniper Rifles are about as powerful as a large handgun.  The only bonus they have over other guns is range and control.  In the real world, if you built a military grade sniper rifle that couldn't penetrate a helmet at 100 yards, then you'd scrap the design and go back to the drawing board.Not only do Sniper Rifles not penetrate helmets, it takes 2 shots or more just to knock the helmet off.  This is pure garbage and designed to further frustrate the player.  It's almost as if the devs have taken extreme pains to ensure that you have to tediously crawl through every mission choking out everyone with a helmet.Lastly, Sam Fisher must have Parkinson's disease because he can't hold a pistol or assault rifle steady to save his life.  If I ever had a soldier on a firing lane that wobbled that much while holding a rifle, I'd rod him off the range and administer a breathalizer test.  Yet again, the developers making the game artificially difficult for no reason.  I mean I get that Sam Fisher is in his 50's at this point, but hell my 55 year old mother can drill out the center silhouette of a target at 10 meters with her stock Glock 17.  I'd think Sam Fisher, one of the most experienced field operatives in the world, could hold a heavily modified special forces pistol rock-♥♥♥♥ing-solid-on-target for at least the first 10 seconds he's aiming it.It's more than just this, there's a good half dozen other things that just irritate the crap out of me about this game such as the climbing and movement models still being tied to extremely specific pieces of architecture.  How long has Assassin's Creed been out now and Spinter Cell is still sticking to the early years of mobility limitations in game engines?Sigh, so so much wrong with this game.  Not even sure I have the patience to put up with it much longer.			"

												Splinter Cell over the years has been a wonderful Franchise to play. Yet, this version on steam is absoutly horrific. You are faced with severe lag that can be be reduced down after fiddling with controls. However, some still remains that can not go away so if you basically make one mislick on keyboard your as good as dead. Maybe this game would be more easier to play had splinter cell decided not to go with uplay. After all Driver San Francisco which game first on uplay ran so WELL (it didn't, so many problems). Perhaps, throughout time there will be enough good patch updates to fix blacklist and make it more play friendly, but for now i would have to give them a 2 star rating out of 5.			"

												i bought this game because i have been with the series from the very beginning, and because the game play is very enjoyable and well put togetherbut i want to make it clear that i IN NO WAY support the recasting of sam's voice actornew guy had some good lines that made me crack a smile or whatever but because of the new voice i couldn't help seeing him as 'standard movie action hero guy' instead of the dark humored, cold-hearted agent of efficiency (and occasional sass) that we all know and love. gameplay-wise it was fine, but it was lacking in the key characterization that made these games stand out so much from others in the espionage genre. i understand that apparently it's easier to do it with the full actor and motion capture instead of a voice actor and animation lip synching but it's not worth the saved time/money to lose such an important part of the SC universe.gameplay: 8/10VO: i'll give you a mulligan. DON'T DO IT AGAINP.S. - people need to stop whining about having to run it from Uplay. Uplay has been around since Assassin's Creed II and i've never had any problems with it.			"

												스플린터셀 블랙리스트는 내게 있어 가장 재미있게 했던 게임중 하나다.내가 스플린터셀을 좋아하는 이유는 두가지가 있어서였는데.하나는 마이클 아이언사이드의 매력적인 목소리였고,또 하나는 정확히 내가 생각해온 잠입 액션이었기 때문이다. 아쉽게도 내가 좋아하던  마이클 아이언사이드는 이번 작품에서 성우를 맡지는 않았지만 그래도 괜찮다.스플린터셀 컨빅션과 블랙리스트는 마치 영화 한편을 방불케하는 속도로 적을 제압하며 그 재미는 충분히 보장할 정도로 잘 만들어졌다.물론 컨빅션 이전작들을 즐겼던 올드 유저 팬들에게는 아주 미안한 이야기이다.그 작품을 모두 즐겨본 나로써도 느끼지 않는 바는 아니다.약간은 느릿한 한걸음 한걸음이 캐릭터와 동화되는 느낌은 아직도 잊을 수 없다.그렇지만 이 게임을 보라.완벽하게 만들어진 마크 앤 엑스큐트 시스템과 불빛의 상호작용. 높은 난이도를 자랑하는 AI. 게다가 출전하기 전에 장비까지 스스로 정할 수 있다.게임은 3가지 스타일로 나뉘며 그 어느것이라도 당신이 정할 수 있다.적을 기절만 시키거나 사살하거나.혹은 둘다 하거나!게이머는 샘피셔라는 캐릭터로 미국을 지키는 잠입, 암살을 계속한다.그에게 부여된 다섯번째 자유를 행사함으로써 자국과 타국을 지키는 영웅적인 행보를 계속한다.스토리는 故톰 클랜시의 작품인데 앞으로도 이 스플린터셀 시리즈가 계속해서 나올지 혹은 아닐지는 모르는 일이다. 하지만 이 대단한 작품이 계속해서 나오지 않는다면 필자는 매우 실망할 것이다.매년 발매되는 어쌔신 크리드의 작품처럼 나온다면 좋을 일이지만.. 한 해마다 발매는 무리더라도 몇년마다 한번씩 얼굴을 찾는 시집간 딸내미처럼 불쑥 찾아와 집안의 분위기를 살려준다면 더 바랄 것이 없을 것이다.

												The best game in the splinter cell franchise, in my opinion. Good story, cool dialogue, nice graphics, and smooth gameplay. A clear 8/10 for me.Like the previous installment, ""Splinter cell: Conviction"", you're a lot more mobile than you are in the first three games. You're also free to choose how you want to deal with enemy units. Not only do you have a variety of weapons and ways to dispose of your enemies; you can also use multiple non-lethal methods - like sleep gas, stun gun (like the sticky shocker in Chaos Theory), proximity shocker, and a couple of items to distract your foes. You can also avoid most enemies entirely, which really pays off at the end of the mission.It may be hard to believe, but the reward system in the game is also pretty well integrated. It's very RPG-like. You get money to buy items and upgrades at the end of each mission (depending on your performance), as well as by picking up dead drops and hacking PCs you find. You'll be able to upgrade Sam's gear in several ways by buying different clothes (boots, gloves, torso, etc), as well as by buying different weapons and weapon upgrades (of which there are many).

												Despite being one of my all-time favourite franchises, Splinter Cell has always been a series of ups and downs. With highs like Chaos Theory and lows like Double Agent, I honestly don't know what to expect anymore. While Conviction was by all means a respectable game, it set the series in a new direction while abandoning some of the trademark stealth aspects. In an odd twist of fate, the series changed hands and the brand new Ubisoft Toronto managed the impossible: to create a truly remarkable Splinter Cell title.I can probably write paragraphs about Splinter Cell: Blacklist and why it is such a remarkable game. It is easy to ignore the jingoist mess that is the main story and instead focus on the remarkable level design, location diversity and a truly elegant approach to stealth games. While Ubisoft has a nasty habit of producing bloated sequels with unnecessary features, Blacklist is the exception to the rule. It is a lean, clever, deep and rewarding game that I highly recommend to fans of the franchise and newcomers alike.			"

NO. i wont even try to fix the game this time, im so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. I could write a review from the intro and it would be like this - ""It Sucked"". My sensitivity was all wrong it wasnt fullscreen etc, could i change it ? no... because you need to play a ***** mission to get to a main menu.			"

												A return to classic Splinter Cell after 2010's Conviction, Blacklist cranks everything up a notch. Better customization, graphics, gameplay and action make this entry one of the best stealth games I have ever played.Sure the story isn't excellent, and one character in particular is annoying pretty much whenever he opens his mouth, but there are some really great moments that along with the quality gameplay make it quite a lot of fun. And now with the options of different 'playstyles' you get rewarded however you want to play.			"

												Everytime i see Ubisoft i know I'm taking a huge risk. I swore not to purchase another one of theyr products but this game looked so good on the outside and i decided to buy it. Ofcourse i was wrong again. Robotic, limited, monotone gameplay. Not rewarding at all. Ofcourse i've encountered multiplayer bugs too, one of them made my respawn timer go nuts, taking up to 2 minutes to respawn, and the Ubisoft Support Center didnt even bother to answer at my ticket. Worst company ever. Probably the worst purchase i've made. Not recomended at all!			"

												The highlights of Splinter Cell: Blacklist are found in the multiplayer offerings. The campaign, while still providing a decently fun experience, ultimately suffers from a poor narrative and characterizations the make that portion of the game feel much more restricted in what it could have offered. Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a definite step up from its predecessor but it is still ways away from capturing the magic of what came before.			"

												Absolutely useless, for a recent game it just doesn't work, I have tried  to get some form of support through Uplay. Steam do not support the game from their own perspective and you are directed to Ubisoft - I have left 2 complaints and/or requests for support, and I might as well stick my head in a bucket of water, as they haven't acknowledged, or responded in a week.I have again tried to play this game, it just doesn't work FULL STOP (certainly not on a Windows platform -Windows 8 Profesional 64bit, and a 7990 video card coupled to an SSD, with 32Gb system RAM) - I have had to endure a constant barrage of AVI files or game movies, the save icon doesn't work, nor does the 'skip A' button - it seems this is only suited to either a PS3 or 4, or an Xbox One - Thats fine but don't sell/market the game under a Game for Windows banner.I really hope the game console groups are enjoying the game, but for anyone considering this as a Windows Platform Game. FORGET IT save your money, and spend in on another product, 'SPLINTER CELL - BLACKLIST' absolutely useless.....			"

												Great game, Splinter Cell just gets better and better every time. Remember playing Splinter Cell when it came out on Xbox and enjoyed the lighting and graphics back in the day. Now the game has gone to where original was stealth and stay in the dark to where you can do both. Conviction was a good game but this one is so much better as far as game play goes.			"

												Both the co-op/multiplayer and single player are a lot of fun. I like how you have the choice(most of the time) on how to approach a level- you can shoot everyone in a subtle manner, sneak past everyone,  kill them/knock them out silently. It definitely appeals to different styles while maintaining the stealth aspect. I recommend it.			"

												The best game in the splinter cell franchise, in my opinion. Good story, cool dialogue, nice graphics, and smooth gameplay. A clear 8/10 for me.Like the previous installment, ""Splinter cell: Conviction"", you're a lot more mobile than you are in the first three games. You're also free to choose how you want to deal with enemy units. Not only do you have a variety of weapons and ways to dispose of your enemies; you can also use multiple non-lethal methods - like sleep gas, stun gun (like the sticky shocker in Chaos Theory), proximity shocker, and a couple of items to distract your foes. You can also avoid most enemies entirely, which really pays off at the end of the mission.It may be hard to believe, but the reward system in the game is also pretty well integrated. It's very RPG-like. You get money to buy items and upgrades at the end of each mission (depending on your performance), as well as by picking up dead drops and hacking PCs you find. You'll be able to upgrade Sam's gear in several ways by buying different clothes (boots, gloves, torso, etc), as well as by buying different weapons and weapon upgrades (of which there are many).

""Key Bindings"" menu states that everything is the same as by default and all the key settings look fine there.But for example:- All [SPACE] actions (climbing, next cover etc) are replaces by [0] and even some [E] actions with the same [0] - I am unable to mark enemies. When I press [ALT] nothing happens (difficulty is set to Normal, so M&E options was working before!)- I can shoot only one bullet and afterwards it seems like left mouse button just stops working.Anyone has any idea what the heck is happening with my controls?

												Regardless of how lod this game is, it is so much fun! I think that the main storyline is ok, but the side missions are where the fun really starts. I like to do things such as challenge myself durring these side missions, like force myself to only use one weapon type, or forcing myself to restart if I get detected. You might not think much of the multiplayer in a game like this, but I would say the multiplayer is one of the best parts of the game (Spies vs. Mercs). Spies vs. Mercs is a game where the spies are in 3rd person, and they use stealth to try and capture objectives. Mercs play in 1st person and try to defend the points using brute force. I also find it so much fun to play the game in the classic mode, whice means that there are two players on each team and no customization of classes. This might not sound like fun, but in classic mode, the map's brightness and light levels go down so much, you need to have a flashlight or night vision goggles to see on the map. This makes the game so much more interesting because it gives the game kind of a horror game type feel. Keep in mind that the mercs play in 1st person, so when they get taken down out of nowhere by the spies, it is terryfing.Great game! I would rate this 9/10.			"

												Extremely well done stealth action game, played through once with a ""ghost run"", loved every minute of it. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys sticking to shadows and methodically picking off enemies one by one, or leaving them alone entirely and just not being detected at all, and if that's not your cup of tea, you're more than free to play through it like a 3rd person cover shooter.

												I bought this game purely for co-op, only to realize that co-op was a pain to get to work. After about 2 hours we finally got it to work. It's a hit or miss to get into Co-op. I had to restart the game over and over until I got the ""Press Shift F2"" for the overlay. Without the overlay showing up in the top right corner when you start the game, you will not be able to join co-op games. (Dont use the client invitation because you will only see a decline option).Do not buy this game at full price if you're buying for co-op only. There are only a few side missions you can do with your friends and it's not worth $30.00. I did however enjoy the game. The graphics were very nice (even though there were a lot of glitches), and the audio and voice acting was good. Uplay is the devil.			"

U can connect to random guy, but if u create a lobby and invite your friend it will just say ""Cannot connect, try later""A lot of players have issue with connect to friend's lobby, but ubi support just says ""CHECK YOUR PORTS, YOU NEED TO DO A FORWARDING, CHECK, CHECK, CHECK"" like robots.

												The interface in this game is horrendous. You are forced to watch an FMV just to skip an introduction mission to get into a confusing modal interface. Once I finally realized the noise on the top left corner of the screen was an actual button I managed to get into the online game mode. Finally, I had to send a message via a carrier pidgeon to tell my friend to shut off the game. Then he was able to recieve an invite to play co-op. Luckily he was unable to connect to my session so I just gave up on this instead of suffering through it.			"

												This game is like playing hitman absolution game with purist difficulty without disguise.So if you like stealth game, this is a must play game.Pros:- Cool gadget- Easy to play with joystick- I love seeing mission briefing and how Sam killing joke with his serious face :D- Cool upgrades- Everytime i die and re-play. enemies have different route and behaviour. NICE FEATUREScons:- Stage mission too long, it's divided by too 2 - 5 parts i think. This make don't want to re-play game because i only want to play on specific part of the stage. Not really a minus point, but will be really great if allow us to choose which part we want to play.summary: AWESOME.I would love to have this game next series.			"

												Regardless of how lod this game is, it is so much fun! I think that the main storyline is ok, but the side missions are where the fun really starts. I like to do things such as challenge myself durring these side missions, like force myself to only use one weapon type, or forcing myself to restart if I get detected. You might not think much of the multiplayer in a game like this, but I would say the multiplayer is one of the best parts of the game (Spies vs. Mercs). Spies vs. Mercs is a game where the spies are in 3rd person, and they use stealth to try and capture objectives. Mercs play in 1st person and try to defend the points using brute force. I also find it so much fun to play the game in the classic mode, whice means that there are two players on each team and no customization of classes. This might not sound like fun, but in classic mode, the map's brightness and light levels go down so much, you need to have a flashlight or night vision goggles to see on the map. This makes the game so much more interesting because it gives the game kind of a horror game type feel. Keep in mind that the mercs play in 1st person, so when they get taken down out of nowhere by the spies, it is terryfing.Great game! I would rate this 9/10.			"

												This gem is among Ubisofts good games, before someone or a few important people became pill-popping alcoholics and started making abysmal business descisions. As someone foreign to this series I will tell you beforehand, I quite well enjoy this. Supposedly the previous games were almost entirely based on stealth where this one allows you, in most circumstances, to go loud.Multiplayer's a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get into but once you get used to it, you'll do just fine or at least well enough and for those wanting to do some coop, this game has plenty of side missions. It certainly isn't the best game ever but it may perhaps be one of if not the best games Ubisoft's put out recently, only nudged down into second place by AC: Black Flag. My only problem with this game is with how quickly the alarm sounds when someone notices you and everything about dogs.			"

Also, everytime I switch out of the game (which is often, I have 2 monitors), it reverts back to 1600x900 windowed mode. Which means everytime I have to go back into video settings and reselect ""Fullscreen and 1980x1080"" again. That is tedious as hell. This is inexcusable for a game that was released last year, I don't ever want to play it anymore.I don't think I'll be buying another Ubisoft game on PC.			"

												Apart from Thi4f, Splinter Cell Blacklist has been the biggest disappointment in gaming for me this year. In my view, Splinter Cell is about sneaking behind enemy lines, completing your mission without being seen, using cool gadgets and saving the world with a hero who feels authentic and badass at the same time. At first glance Blacklist has all of that - apart from the good old Sam Fisher, who was replaced by a new model and voice actor, for reasons I cannot understand. The game looks alright, the story is interesting and the new gameplay features are worth a try. But theres one thing, which completely blows this iteration in a beloved series apart: The checkpoint system. I play Splinter Cell by planing every move, trying out different approaches and saving everytime a plan worked. This is not possible anymore. After trying the same level on hard for ten times, Splinter Cell is over for me. RIP Sam.			"

												Splinter Cell Blacklist is a game with unfulfilled potential, which is even worse then a game that is outright bad. The whole dumbed down approach to the game reeks of console port and the only thing decent about it are the graphics and audio, which is on par with other games but nothing to write home about. The frame rate is a stable 30 on my system, regardless if anything is actually going on or not.Controls are wonky and sluggish, removing all precision from a game that is supposed to be a stealth game. In actuality though, it handles more like a shooter with cover tacked on to it and some stealth elements added in as an afterthought. Splinter Cell Blacklist is very far removed from the original Splinter Cell, and for fans of stealth games it has very little to offer. To add insult to injury, they have also tied this game to uplay, meaning if you do not agree to having additional software running on your machine, then you can't play this at all, which frankly is probably just as well. Naturally, you will have to make an account for uplay as well for no gameplay-reason whatsoever. 3/10, could be improved by better quality assurance from ubisoft and skipping the completely unnecessary uplay disservice.

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY ONLINE AND UBISOFT WONT FIX THE ISSUE.CONTROLS AND MOVEMENT  WERE 100 TIMES BETTER IN CONVICTION,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!! Edit:In order to play online I had to use another Uplay account which would be frustrating for those of us who played other Ubisoft games.Now then,the online portion is not too bad,for veterans the classic mode is a welcome gametype.The mercenary vision modes are pretty much gone,have been substituted by passive upgrades to your helmet and you can only have one at a time I beleive.Unless I am crazy there is also no flashlight in blacklist mode for mercs either.You can get melee kills on mercs from all sides rather than just from behind,something Im torn about but with the gameplay changes it makes more sense.What I think is really dumb is how they made the AK47 the most powerful rifle in the game even though the SA58 shoots a bigger bullet.You can also use SMGs and pistols as a spy but they are best used as a distraction depending on the amount of armor the Merc has.The moving between cover system is also gone for the spies in multiplayer. I think they did a better job with tailoring single player to the new pacing they set for the game.There are some action sequences that seem like a direct confrontation is inevitable but you can still take them out with stealth if you are careful.While Ironside is gone I wish they at least got a older sounding voice actor for Sam.This game just took what they did with Conviction and made it all better with the exception of the context sensitive controls.Still it fails to reach the bar Chaos Theory has set and I doubt any other Splinter Cell they make will ever do that again.I would not recommend this for those who loved splinter cell before conviction unless you got it on sale like I did.

												One of the best single player experiences I have ever played. On the other hand, I have not had a chance to play a SINGLE Multiplayer Co-op or PVP due to the incompatibilities with my PC. The problem relied on it being a terrible console port with a terrible company Ubisoft that did not care about it. There were NUMEROUS users who had the same issues as me, it wasn't just a select few. If you're up for an awesome Single player experience, this game is great. Don't expect the multiplayer to work, and if it does expect a very low population or hackers.			"

												For the love of gaming, avoid this rubbish. Just like all the other negative reviews, Uplay makes the game next to unplayable. I was getting constant crashes and getting kicked back to desktop. Each time I would have to reload it up and after about another 10-15 minutes, it would do it again, losing my saves. This is something that would put you off in the first place, that's before you've heard about the campaign.As for the game including the campaign, it’s a meh. If you've played Hitman or something like Sniper Elite, you've done it all before. The AI is horrible, you can walk right past them and they won't notice anything unless you stand right in front of them, I mean like, on their toes. The character models look hideous and as if they've been squashed vertically and look very out of place in regard to the environments (which look disgusting and dated anyway). The campaign is crap. Go here, get him, go there, kill him. Just armature stuff.I got this on sale for £4.99 with all the DLC, and I've asked for a refund. What does that tell you? Seriously, avoid this crap. "

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY ONLINE AND UBISOFT WONT FIX THE ISSUE.CONTROLS AND MOVEMENT  WERE 100 TIMES BETTER IN CONVICTION,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!! Edit:In order to play online I had to use another Uplay account which would be frustrating for those of us who played other Ubisoft games.Now then,the online portion is not too bad,for veterans the classic mode is a welcome gametype.The mercenary vision modes are pretty much gone,have been substituted by passive upgrades to your helmet and you can only have one at a time I beleive.Unless I am crazy there is also no flashlight in blacklist mode for mercs either.You can get melee kills on mercs from all sides rather than just from behind,something Im torn about but with the gameplay changes it makes more sense.What I think is really dumb is how they made the AK47 the most powerful rifle in the game even though the SA58 shoots a bigger bullet.You can also use SMGs and pistols as a spy but they are best used as a distraction depending on the amount of armor the Merc has.The moving between cover system is also gone for the spies in multiplayer. I think they did a better job with tailoring single player to the new pacing they set for the game.There are some action sequences that seem like a direct confrontation is inevitable but you can still take them out with stealth if you are careful.While Ironside is gone I wish they at least got a older sounding voice actor for Sam.This game just took what they did with Conviction and made it all better with the exception of the context sensitive controls.Still it fails to reach the bar Chaos Theory has set and I doubt any other Splinter Cell they make will ever do that again.I would not recommend this for those who loved splinter cell before conviction unless you got it on sale like I did.

Not everyone wants to play with a screeching 12 year old on the internet)-Story was boring-Character were, with the exception of Cobin, annoying as balls and lifeless-Uplay (just, stop, just stop already) -Panther playstyle?

It won't let you play the game you bought unless you have an active account, doesn't give you the option of where it installs itself, and probably phones home with private information.  I'm really sorry I bought this game now, and I for certain won't be so trusting of steam and certainly won't be making as many purchases since I'll need to read, research and investigate all the games from them in order to not get bent over again.

Those should be fixed.- Where is main menu? Come on....- I didn't like how my character just jumps over a ramp while I'm running around. It caused me a lot of deaths and irritated me a lot. They should've just made that part be done by space: Jump.- They should've made late game guns like black market guns better than honey-badger. Seriously, why unlock it if it's not even better than honey badger or not even that stronger than it? The only Paladin upgrade that was useful was healing speed increase. Oh and radar upgrade too.

The single player is fun, the acting and story is great, the graphics look incredible, the coop is challenging and there's plenty to do. And the competitive multiplayer is easily my favorite part. This SpyVmerc mode has never been better. Everything is balanced and the game plays really well. It's highly recommended you purchase and use an ""Xbox360 Controller for Windows"" as it is clearly a console port like most games. The controls are just easier with a controller and makes for a more polished and solid experience than trying to tackle the keyboard/mouse stuff.			"

But more simplified.+Interesting story+New actor may be hard to adjust to but does a good job.+Can be a bit action-y but still maintains good stealth elements-Really difficult to boot up (needing the Uplay launcher alone is annoying)-Can crash frequently.-Controls are hard to adjust to if using a controller.  Keyboard is a little difficult.-AI can be a little dumb yet frustrating (runs right into you sometimes, but you gotta admit, it's difficult to attack someone up close and personal in this game).-Game isn't really optimized for PC.  A lot of manual fixes are needed to have the game run at a good FPS (Thank god for GeForce Experience if you're a Nvidia user).-Apparently Multiplayer through Uplay can be frustrating or doesn't work well.I still wouldn't recommend this game for much more than $10 or more because these frustrations you may run into (and chances are, you will), the game wouldn't be worth the extra $20-$25.

												tl;dr: This is easily the worst Splinter Cell game I have ever played.  Do not buy it.And the long version:The writing is absolutely awful: the plot is stupid, boring, and nonsensical; the dialog is cliched and hackneyed (with the amusing exception of Kobin, who is supposed to be an unlikable scumbag, but is easily the most endearing character); the characters are completely forgettable (again, with the exception of Kobin); the action falls into the very worst traps of ""action tv"" with 'splosions and technobabble going off all over the place; and nearly all of the technical discussions are wrong (now, I may be crazy, but I've always found it odd that video games, which, you know, run on computers and were created by people who understand computers, don't have a very good track-record with using the things in-universe; the answer is probably that writers remain as uninformed and ignorant as always).Sound design is fine, but nothing special.  Voice work varies from character to character: Kobin is great, Charlie and Briggs (two more supporting characters) are OK, Grim is Canadian now (seriously, listen for her ""out""s and ""about""s—it's subtle, but it's there—but do it on YouTube because you should not buy this game), and Sam is no longer voiced by Micheal Ironside, which is actually a huge problem: the new guy, however good an actor he may be, simply cannot deliver the same gravitas and sincerity that Ironside could.  Also he doesn't sound quite like Ironside, which is suprisingly distracting.Map design is bi-polar, veering widely from abject linearity to twisted mazes filled with instant-game-over lasers.  Every once in a while, though, it manages to come together and be good—the Chicago water-treatment plant, for example, but such cases are rarities.We'll get to gameplay in a sec, but first let's talk about the Paladin.  My thoughts are ""why do we need a Mass Effect/StarCraft II-style 'interactive' hubworld? why? why do we need that? is it because we're following the leader and those other games did well, so our game must do well, too, if it has these elements?""  If so, Ubisoft not only failed to understand why those games did well but also failed to rip-off properly the gimmicks they thought were the selling points.  The Paladin does not need to be interactive.  The player does not need to talk to the characters, especially when they have nothing to say (except for Kobin).  It's a huge waste of resources and time for the designers, devs, and players alike.And now for the game mechanics: they are servicable, usually causing only slightly more problems than they allow the player to solve.  And that's where the game shoots itself in the head.  ""*Usually* causing only slight more problems than they allow the player to solve""—""usually"".  Every once in a while, for reasons known only to the good folks at Ubisoft, who should all be berated for not fighting against this harder (or at all or even proposing it), the game mechanics will be altered, sometimes in little ways, sometimes in big ways.  There's a bit where the player loses control of Sam and takes control of Briggs.  For reasons which completely escape me, these sections are played, with no warning, in first-person perspective (and with equipment that the player cannot choose, to salt the wound).  In all coop missions featuring Briggs as a playable character, he handles exactly the same as Sam, as one would expect, so why the sudden shift in handling?  No idea, other than the preposterous ""this is too easy, let's shake things up a bit"".  No, thank you, Ubi.  I don't like things being shaken up.  And, futhermore, if I wanted to play a CoD-style forced-stealth mission, I would be playing the Chernobyl mission in Modern Warfare.  No, I'm actually here to play Splinter Cell.  I would really like to play Splinter Cell all the way through this Splinter Cell game.  Shocking, isn't it?Continuing that line, we have the final boss fight.  The team (and the player) have spent the entire game chasing down this poorly-written (but actually quite well-performed) villain, Sadiq, and Sam finally has him cornered... but Sam isn't wearing his suit, and he doesn't have his gadgets or spare mags for his pistol, and he just gave his rifle to Briggs, who isn't actually in this fight—he's on the sidelines, injured and unable to help in any way.  So this stealth game, which has relied on Sam's supersuit, gadgets, guns, and ability to fight only the dumbest enemies who easily lose track of intruders, becomes a game of ""Redlight, Greenlight"" as the player tried to work his way, unarmed and unarmored, toward the boss, who is standing conveniently in one place until he decides that the player is taking too long, at which point he will retreat to a spot even farther away from the player, and the process repeats.  If the player should manage to sneak up on Sadiq and try a take-down, Sam and the boss will engage in fisticuffs, and the player will be asked with no warning to try to use the mouse to aim the boss' gun at him while the boss resists.  If the player fails, he has to start over again from the beginning (no mid-boss-fight checkpoints for us!).  If he succeeds, the boss will beat the tar out of Sam and then vanish, dropping his gun in the process.  The player is not allowed to pick up the gun.  The player then has no choice but to try to walk Sam, who is quite injured at this point, slowly toward the next objective.  After just enough time to be obnoxious, the boss will tackle Sam from behind, at which point, the player is presented with a quick-time event to grab the boss' knife.  If the player fails, the game resets to the start of the boss fight.  Again.  If the player succeeds... well, I don't know what happens then.  I only managed it the once, but the boss had tackled Sam into a crate, which obscured the action, so I couldn't see what was happening.  I think I managed to pass the first QTE only to die to the second.  After trying the fight several dozen times, I gave up in frustration.  I may try again in a while, but I'll certainly never try to play the game a second time, and I'll recommend to anyone who asks that they not try to play the game the first time.To reiterate: This is a bad game.  Do not buy it, and do not play it.  Find something better to do with your time.  Have you read ""The Killing Star"" by Charles R. Pellegrino and George Zebrowski?  It's really good.  Your local lending library probably has a copy or could get one for you through the inter-library loan system.  And, who knows, you might make a new friend while you're at the library.  That'd be cool and worth your time, unlike this game.			"

												This has been a hassle to finish :- story  is not interesting AT ALL.- gameplay is screwed. You can't stealth because Sam has an assassin's creed gameplay that is not accurate enough. You can't really assault because when approaching the end of the game, every enemy has an helmet and requires 4 or 5 headshots. You can exploit the AI and panther, but it's not really interesting and very repetitive. And then again at the end of the game, the enemies are too close from each other to really get undetected.- CRASHES ! i must have had like 1 crash (go to desktop) per hour.- one of the worst ending i've ever seen. There is all of it: scripted gameplay, the QTE, and if (when) you miss the QTE because it is really badly done, you have to do all of it again.what was good :- Animations. Wow, even better than Conviction which was my reference- Game is challenging, even though the difficulty is not well designed, i like the fact that the game is challenting (played on hard). mark-execute is not very useful unlike Conviction (when the game gets hard and requires it, all enemies have helmets so can't be executed)It's funny because it feels a lot like Conviction, and i loved this one, but i didn't like Blacklist. There were enjoyable moments and really really annoying moments, but overall i'd say it's a mediocre game. There's no way i play it twice like Conviction.Also, i have this feeling that all Tom Clancy's games tend to look all more and more the same. Kill with your mate assisting, send drone, go to cover, assault,... i'm done with that for now.			"

												Do you like inaccurate controls? Do you like overpowered enemies? Do badly placed checkpoints appeal to you? Do you like annoying trial & error passages? Do you like dealing with tons of bugs? Congratulations, this might be the perfect game for you.The single player mode is boring. It has some nice moments, but the story is predictable and only few of the missions are really memorable. The coop mode is nearly abandoned, but if you're lucky and manage to find a teammate you'll most likely end up crying in front of the game because he's unbelievably terrible. The PVP-mode isn't fun at all.Blacklist was promoted with different playing styles: Ghost, Panther and Assault. Well, it just feels like a downgraded version of Hitman: Absolution or Deus Ex: Human Revolution. You're in a big area and you can either take out one enemy after another or you just draw your gun and shoot everyone. Neither of it has an impact on the game, you only get a different score for highscore-hunting. You can't find any information or interrogate enemies like Sam used to do, you try to reach the next door and it doesn't matter how you do that.You can also buy lots of weapons and upgrades. However, after at most 30% of you game you should have earned enough money to buy all the equipment you need. You'll end up with millions of dollars, not knowing what to do with them because everything you can buy will be a downgrade.I played each Splinter Cell game on the highest difficulty multiple times, including Essentials and the Old Gen-version of Double Agent. This isn't going to happen with Blacklist.Please, Ubisoft, let the Splinter Cell franchise rest in peace. Either develop a decent stealth game like Chaos Theory or a decent third person shooter like Conviction, but don't deliver us some half-hearted piece of trash such as Blacklist.			"

												Okay, I'm rewriting this again since I've gotten more into the game.  But more simplified.+Interesting story+New actor may be hard to adjust to but does a good job.+Can be a bit action-y but still maintains good stealth elements-Really difficult to boot up (needing the Uplay launcher alone is annoying)-Can crash frequently.-Controls are hard to adjust to if using a controller.  Keyboard is a little difficult.-AI can be a little dumb yet frustrating (runs right into you sometimes, but you gotta admit, it's difficult to attack someone up close and personal in this game).-Game isn't really optimized for PC.  A lot of manual fixes are needed to have the game run at a good FPS (Thank god for GeForce Experience if you're a Nvidia user).-Apparently Multiplayer through Uplay can be frustrating or doesn't work well.I still wouldn't recommend this game for much more than $10 or more because these frustrations you may run into (and chances are, you will), the game wouldn't be worth the extra $20-$25.

												tl;dr: This is easily the worst Splinter Cell game I have ever played.  Do not buy it.And the long version:The writing is absolutely awful: the plot is stupid, boring, and nonsensical; the dialog is cliched and hackneyed (with the amusing exception of Kobin, who is supposed to be an unlikable scumbag, but is easily the most endearing character); the characters are completely forgettable (again, with the exception of Kobin); the action falls into the very worst traps of ""action tv"" with 'splosions and technobabble going off all over the place; and nearly all of the technical discussions are wrong (now, I may be crazy, but I've always found it odd that video games, which, you know, run on computers and were created by people who understand computers, don't have a very good track-record with using the things in-universe; the answer is probably that writers remain as uninformed and ignorant as always).Sound design is fine, but nothing special.  Voice work varies from character to character: Kobin is great, Charlie and Briggs (two more supporting characters) are OK, Grim is Canadian now (seriously, listen for her ""out""s and ""about""s—it's subtle, but it's there—but do it on YouTube because you should not buy this game), and Sam is no longer voiced by Micheal Ironside, which is actually a huge problem: the new guy, however good an actor he may be, simply cannot deliver the same gravitas and sincerity that Ironside could.  Also he doesn't sound quite like Ironside, which is suprisingly distracting.Map design is bi-polar, veering widely from abject linearity to twisted mazes filled with instant-game-over lasers.  Every once in a while, though, it manages to come together and be good—the Chicago water-treatment plant, for example, but such cases are rarities.We'll get to gameplay in a sec, but first let's talk about the Paladin.  My thoughts are ""why do we need a Mass Effect/StarCraft II-style 'interactive' hubworld? why? why do we need that? is it because we're following the leader and those other games did well, so our game must do well, too, if it has these elements?""  If so, Ubisoft not only failed to understand why those games did well but also failed to rip-off properly the gimmicks they thought were the selling points.  The Paladin does not need to be interactive.  The player does not need to talk to the characters, especially when they have nothing to say (except for Kobin).  It's a huge waste of resources and time for the designers, devs, and players alike.And now for the game mechanics: they are servicable, usually causing only slightly more problems than they allow the player to solve.  And that's where the game shoots itself in the head.  ""*Usually* causing only slight more problems than they allow the player to solve""—""usually"".  Every once in a while, for reasons known only to the good folks at Ubisoft, who should all be berated for not fighting against this harder (or at all or even proposing it), the game mechanics will be altered, sometimes in little ways, sometimes in big ways.  There's a bit where the player loses control of Sam and takes control of Briggs.  For reasons which completely escape me, these sections are played, with no warning, in first-person perspective (and with equipment that the player cannot choose, to salt the wound).  In all coop missions featuring Briggs as a playable character, he handles exactly the same as Sam, as one would expect, so why the sudden shift in handling?  No idea, other than the preposterous ""this is too easy, let's shake things up a bit"".  No, thank you, Ubi.  I don't like things being shaken up.  And, futhermore, if I wanted to play a CoD-style forced-stealth mission, I would be playing the Chernobyl mission in Modern Warfare.  No, I'm actually here to play Splinter Cell.  I would really like to play Splinter Cell all the way through this Splinter Cell game.  Shocking, isn't it?Continuing that line, we have the final boss fight.  The team (and the player) have spent the entire game chasing down this poorly-written (but actually quite well-performed) villain, Sadiq, and Sam finally has him cornered... but Sam isn't wearing his suit, and he doesn't have his gadgets or spare mags for his pistol, and he just gave his rifle to Briggs, who isn't actually in this fight—he's on the sidelines, injured and unable to help in any way.  So this stealth game, which has relied on Sam's supersuit, gadgets, guns, and ability to fight only the dumbest enemies who easily lose track of intruders, becomes a game of ""Redlight, Greenlight"" as the player tried to work his way, unarmed and unarmored, toward the boss, who is standing conveniently in one place until he decides that the player is taking too long, at which point he will retreat to a spot even farther away from the player, and the process repeats.  If the player should manage to sneak up on Sadiq and try a take-down, Sam and the boss will engage in fisticuffs, and the player will be asked with no warning to try to use the mouse to aim the boss' gun at him while the boss resists.  If the player fails, he has to start over again from the beginning (no mid-boss-fight checkpoints for us!).  If he succeeds, the boss will beat the tar out of Sam and then vanish, dropping his gun in the process.  The player is not allowed to pick up the gun.  The player then has no choice but to try to walk Sam, who is quite injured at this point, slowly toward the next objective.  After just enough time to be obnoxious, the boss will tackle Sam from behind, at which point, the player is presented with a quick-time event to grab the boss' knife.  If the player fails, the game resets to the start of the boss fight.  Again.  If the player succeeds... well, I don't know what happens then.  I only managed it the once, but the boss had tackled Sam into a crate, which obscured the action, so I couldn't see what was happening.  I think I managed to pass the first QTE only to die to the second.  After trying the fight several dozen times, I gave up in frustration.

												DO NOT BUY! It has been a very long time since Ubisoft was made aware of a problem with their DRM that causes the game to crash every25 minutes on many machines. They have done nothing to fix it. Stay away! Had they addressed that issue I would reccomend the game, but really, Ubisoft doesn't deserve your money, buy another game instead.UPDATE: After updating my machine to windows 8, I managed to get the game to run. I really enjoyed it. It was a fun, engaging game with good replayablitiy. It's a pity that it's a Ubisoft game though, their front end interface and lack of any assistance to windows 7 users (During a time when many people still had windows 7) force me to leave a negative rview, It's a pity companies take no pride in their products anymore and just want to shovel them out to get onto the next one. I think long and hard before buying any game from Ubisoft because I know even if the game is good everything else will be terrible. Terrible support, terrible front end, and worse, the money I pay goes to the people responsible for all the terribleness, I hate rewarding idiot suits for their bad choices. Great game, awful publisher.			"

												WORST! possible the worst shooter game I have ever played. This is my first time playing a Splinter Cell game. here's a few questions I had to ask ""Why the hell does teh body get in the way of the shooting?"" Often you can clearly see someone but cannot shoot because your body gets in the way of the aim. Sometimes your body just prevent you from positioning yourself properly to shoot. There are some issues with the commands. I have been having trouble doinng things I want in my way. The commands do not always respond and the whole game seems clunky. I wish I could keep better review, but even other shooter games do not have your character's body getting in the middle of shooting.			"

The team (and the player) have spent the entire game chasing down this poorly-written (but actually quite well-performed) villain, Sadiq, and Sam finally has him cornered... but Sam isn't wearing his suit, and he doesn't have his gadgets or spare mags for his pistol, and he just gave his rifle to Briggs, who isn't actually in this fight—he's on the sidelines, injured and unable to help in any way.  So this stealth game, which has relied on Sam's supersuit, gadgets, guns, and ability to fight only the dumbest enemies who easily lose track of intruders, becomes a game of ""Redlight, Greenlight"" as the player tried to work his way, unarmed and unarmored, toward the boss, who is standing conveniently in one place until he decides that the player is taking too long, at which point he will retreat to a spot even farther away from the player, and the process repeats.  If the player should manage to sneak up on Sadiq and try a take-down, Sam and the boss will engage in fisticuffs, and the player will be asked with no warning to try to use the mouse to aim the boss' gun at him while the boss resists.  If the player fails, he has to start over again from the beginning (no mid-boss-fight checkpoints for us!).  If he succeeds, the boss will beat the tar out of Sam and then vanish, dropping his gun in the process.  The player is not allowed to pick up the gun.  The player then has no choice but to try to walk Sam, who is quite injured at this point, slowly toward the next objective.  After just enough time to be obnoxious, the boss will tackle Sam from behind, at which point, the player is presented with a quick-time event to grab the boss' knife.  If the player fails, the game resets to the start of the boss fight.  Again.  If the player succeeds... well, I don't know what happens then.  I only managed it the once, but the boss had tackled Sam into a crate, which obscured the action, so I couldn't see what was happening.  I think I managed to pass the first QTE only to die to the second.  After trying the fight several dozen times, I gave up in frustration.  I may try again in a while, but I'll certainly never try to play the game a second time, and I'll recommend to anyone who asks that they not try to play the game the first time.To reiterate: This is a bad game.  Do not buy it, and do not play it.  Find something better to do with your time.  Have you read ""The Killing Star"" by Charles R. Pellegrino and George Zebrowski?  It's really good.  Your local lending library probably has a copy or could get one for you through the inter-library loan system.  And, who knows, you might make a new friend while you're at the library.  That'd be cool and worth your time, unlike this game.			"

												Okay, I'm rewriting this again since I've gotten more into the game.  But more simplified.+Interesting story+New actor may be hard to adjust to but does a good job.+Can be a bit action-y but still maintains good stealth elements-Really difficult to boot up (needing the Uplay launcher alone is annoying)-Can crash frequently.-Controls are hard to adjust to if using a controller.  Keyboard is a little difficult.-AI can be a little dumb yet frustrating (runs right into you sometimes, but you gotta admit, it's difficult to attack someone up close and personal in this game).-Game isn't really optimized for PC.  A lot of manual fixes are needed to have the game run at a good FPS (Thank god for GeForce Experience if you're a Nvidia user).-Apparently Multiplayer through Uplay can be frustrating or doesn't work well.I still wouldn't recommend this game for much more than $10 or more because these frustrations you may run into (and chances are, you will), the game wouldn't be worth the extra $20-$25.

												WORST! possible the worst shooter game I have ever played. This is my first time playing a Splinter Cell game. here's a few questions I had to ask ""Why the hell does teh body get in the way of the shooting?"" Often you can clearly see someone but cannot shoot because your body gets in the way of the aim. Sometimes your body just prevent you from positioning yourself properly to shoot. There are some issues with the commands. I have been having trouble doinng things I want in my way. The commands do not always respond and the whole game seems clunky. I wish I could keep better review, but even other shooter games do not have your character's body getting in the middle of shooting.			"

												This is more or less a Splinter Cell Double Agent with the style of SC Conviction, nothing more. Some spots (some=very few) felt exactly like Chaos Theory but it was just not enough. The game feels like a normal blockbuster, and ubisoft added all these features about unlocking equipment, upgrading and buying stuff with money you earn by doing the mission in a certain way and doing stupid soulless side missions and so on....Well, I did not like it and I am a huge fan of Sam Fisher. It is ok, it feels like Splinter Cell but it is still the rotten Splinter Cell we carry on since Double Agent. Buy it very cheap if you really miss some stealth action but be warned, it does not differ so much from the latest Splinter Cell games. The atmosphere is just not there. Repetitive missions, and not enough communicative.60/100			"

												Do you like inaccurate controls? Do you like overpowered enemies? Do badly placed checkpoints appeal to you? Do you like annoying trial & error passages? Do you like dealing with tons of bugs? Congratulations, this might be the perfect game for you.The single player mode is boring. It has some nice moments, but the story is predictable and only few of the missions are really memorable. The coop mode is nearly abandoned, but if you're lucky and manage to find a teammate you'll most likely end up crying in front of the game because he's unbelievably terrible. The PVP-mode isn't fun at all.Blacklist was promoted with different playing styles: Ghost, Panther and Assault. Well, it just feels like a downgraded version of Hitman: Absolution or Deus Ex: Human Revolution. You're in a big area and you can either take out one enemy after another or you just draw your gun and shoot everyone. Neither of it has an impact on the game, you only get a different score for highscore-hunting. You can't find any information or interrogate enemies like Sam used to do, you try to reach the next door and it doesn't matter how you do that.You can also buy lots of weapons and upgrades. However, after at most 30% of you game you should have earned enough money to buy all the equipment you need. You'll end up with millions of dollars, not knowing what to do with them because everything you can buy will be a downgrade.I played each Splinter Cell game on the highest difficulty multiple times, including Essentials and the Old Gen-version of Double Agent. This isn't going to happen with Blacklist.Please, Ubisoft, let the Splinter Cell franchise rest in peace. Either develop a decent stealth game like Chaos Theory or a decent third person shooter like Conviction, but don't deliver us some half-hearted piece of trash such as Blacklist.			"

												Some of the most ""Helpful"" reviews say ""Finally, a splinter cell that plays like splinter cell!""What splinter cell did you play exactly? was there a secret first edition game where -Fisher's voice sounded like something borrowed from a generic NPC databank, -it had a hard cover system that is both complicated and finnicky?-A gunplay system that makes it almost impossible to place a shot from a few meters accurately, and compensates by giving you a ""Pick and shoot targets"" system that charges based on you killing other people. (Think hitman absolution, without the cool slowdown or animations)-Finishing moves that involve using an ancient japanese magic trick where you tap a guy on the shoulder or gently knee his hip and he immediately faints Yea, I know, everyone likes this game, and I don't. I have tried over and over to get into it but simply do not enjoy it, I have no idea why. This Sam isnt Sam to me, he feels like such a generic NPC that it hurts, that wonderful gravelly ""Ive seen some♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; voice is gone. The gameplay is fast paced and the characters feel like they are straight out of a new era james bond move (The smart character, hacker, whatever, is a teenage ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, for instance) The plot is not developed at all and it basically says ""You are sam, sam sees bad guys, now sam leads task force, go kill bad guys"" with the same effing plot every game has had in this era ""The USA is finally going down for its sins, and this big random mercenary army that is more effective than any US soldier batallion is gonna make it happen"" Im gonna try to finish it, see if it gets better, really hope it does! I love splinter cell, but the newer ones have all been iffy for me, I played the original as a kid and played double agent as well, and loved them both. Will you like this? Probably honestly, if you like stealth games that are really forgiving for breaking stealth, and are not at all challenging, then yes. If you are a hardcore fan of the first game and the immensely challenging ""Break stealth and youll die"" gameplay, then no, this is not splinter cell.UPDATE: This mod can help somewhat with the difficulty being too easy http://www.moddb.com/mods/special-ops-modEDIT:Ok, since im getting whiners who claim the whole review is about his voice (hint, if you read past line 1...) Ill clarify.The Voice change is MINIMAL, but it is also SYMBOLIC. Sam's style of stealth and gameplay, as well as personality, has completely been erased. No more serious missions, all of them take place in a warzone, the stealth side missions can be beat in about 5 minutes with no difficulty ALONE despite being meant for COOP. Sam's voice actor replacement is TERRIBLE but thats not worthy a bad review, the collected terribleness of the actor, the complete rewrite of sam's look, demeanor, and style of play, along with the games shift from ""hey, this is real life, spies actually do these things, and everyone behaves like a professional"" to ""WOOHOO! James bond! lets have Sam act like hes bond and add a creepy kid who makes porn jokes about everything he hacks, lets just throw that wonderful noir out the window!"" This is what kills the game for me, in terms of atmosphere, no, its not just his voice, its every detail, hundreds that I cannot fit into this review, before you make a massive attempt to strike me down for ""Just"" not liking his voice, please use your damn brain and read the rest!

												Not recommended. They messed this one up. You got your Uplay, that's no problem I guess. The multiplayer is completely dead so there's that. The story is mediocre and it's your typical USA vs Jihadists setting. Whoever tells you that this game has good stealth is either delusional or has never played previous Splinter Cell games, it's run and gun continuously and stealth is way too easy and simply boring. You have some levels that occur in the Middle East of course (because you can't get any more original) where you literally have to survive waves of enemies. Just rambo through all the levels and the enemies probably won't even realise you're there because the AI is broken. This game also is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port, the video settings are extremely limited and playing with keyboard and mouse is almost impossible. They removed the quicksave option as well, which makes sense because that's not needed in garbage like this.In short: Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a rambo style game where enemies are deaf and blind as rolls of paper. It's a game where you fight Arabs and Muslims 95% of the time. It's a game where changing your settings is not needed apparently and a game that is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port. A game that is actually a horrible F rated movie because of the annoying cutscenes that keep happening. Want to play a good Splinter Cell game? Play Chaos Theory.			"

												If you have played Splinter Cell: Conviction, this game will feel remarkably unfinished and less impressive comparatively. The graphics are greasy (everything looks like it has oil on it), the character's faces have changed remarkably (for the worse) and the overall combat/movement system is a bit wonky. It felt like they released the game when it still needed a month or two of QA/beta testing.The item system is remarkably better than SC: Conviction, though. Love the wide variety of weapons and armor options.			"

												I started playing splinter cell games when i was young, starting with the first one ive played them all, this is a good installment of the series, with hours of tension and fun, and a few things that hold it back from being a realy great game.The good:Splinter cell style fun, never gets oldinteresting story with a few parts that actually made me ""holy sh$t"" out loudcustomization is both good and bad, but i had fun for the most part.splinter cellThe bad:characters are really cliche; the hot fast talking no nonsense female, the nerdy IT guy complete with smarmy lines and cardigan, the tough black dude with gravelly voice, the sumbag criminal whos always talking stuffThere are bugs, if you see a checkpoint and you run towards it, you can get shot in the back and fall over the trigger dead, and the next part will start.Enemies are dumb, i mean elite iranian commandos will see 2 knocked out comrades, search around for a while and then declare "" i guess its nothing""crashes ocasionallyOverall i recommend playing this game, but wait till its on sale, its a lot of fun			"

												This will be the 1rst Splinter Cell I don't finish... Why? Because it's the worst of the lot.Pros:-Amazing graphicsCons:-Side missions don't have any check points! Who's bright idea was that!?-The new voice actor pales in comparison to Michael Ironside.-Far too many daylight missions. Remember how Sam would go in at night because sneaking was easier? Well, not anymore.-The Enemies are unrealistic bullet sponges, taking upto half a clip to kill... yet Sam dies from 1-3 bullets.-Head shots. Wtf happened to them!? I'd repeatedly take the time to line one up... only to have it merely alert the enemy to my presence!I could go on... but I won't. Nor will I be playing this beautiful mess again.			"

												bought this and both DLC on sale, got all 3 keys, activated them, got 1 copy of the game on uplay, and for one of the DLC keys i got another copy of the Game via Uplay, and the last key didn't work. knowing ubisoft they wouldn't do anything, and knowing steam they wouldn't either. so wtf do i do with 2 copies of a game i only got because it was cheap?
