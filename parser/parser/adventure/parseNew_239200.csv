												There is a lot of people that hate this game, and I know why:TDD was a fad. The game became popular because of one thing, and one thing only: it was scary. Tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands likely bought this game because they wanted to get scared; they wanted a joyride complete with overwhelming fear. I don't blame them. The game is pretty scary, but here's the thing:It seems that most people do not understand that Amnesia, and the games before it, were not just haunted-house amusement park rides like they like to act like it is. No, it's a lot more than that. The game has thick atmosphere, superb pacing and storytelling backed by a very dark story that keeps you curious from beginning and even to the end. To be able to truly appreciate TDD, you need to look further than the scare factor; it is not the only thing that made the game great. Guess what the Chinese Room capitalised on? The story. They wanted to tell a story, much like TDD did. MFP was much more of a psychological experience; the game did not need to scare you with darkness or spooky monsters, all it needed was an incredibly wicked story. This was fulfilled. I expected an atmospheric, thought-provoking horror experience that would keep me on the edge and this is exactly what the game did.But what did everyone else expect? Probably something entirely different. They probably just wanted to get scared. Most of the fanbase is filled with people that appreciated TDD for nothing more than its scare factor, and therefor this is all they had expected from MFP. They are probably the kind of people that either skipped or skimmed through most of TDD's note readings, not givng a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the backstory whatsoever. They just wanted to get to the next ""scare."" The bad reception for this game purely comes from delusioned expectations, is what I believe. Horror is a much deeper genre than you'd think. Read up.

												First of all, this game was not developed by Frictional. It was developed by The Chinese Room: the studio behind Dear Escher. When I discovered that during its development, I became skeptical as to the quality of this game. I did, however, respect that it was a spiritual successor of Amnesia: The Dark Decent, and figured that it still had the opportunity to be an intriguing horror experience. I was incorrect.My first complaint comes from simplified mechanics, of which there are barely any at all. The inventory system has been removed entirely, and with both health and sanity. Managing health becomes trivial, as there are no situations in which you must do so, while sanity has been removed altogether. Hiding in the darkness no longer has its trade offs, while looking at the monsters does nothing. Monsters now only make your electric lamp flicker from quite distance away, removing the fear of their presence. This is part of another changed mechanic: oil conservation has been done away with as well in favor of the infinite energy electric lamp. At this point, only the levels themselves are left to make the game live up to its predecessor, which they don't.The game has been designed to be insultingly linear. Each level is a single, straight, path with no choices on how to proceed. The vast majority of monster encounters are scripted, along with a dozen or so out of place shock scares (I could reveal all of them and not spoil the plot). The levels themselves are badly designed and a pain to navigate, with large inaccessible areas and crappy lighting only made worse by the infinite lamp. The puzzles are all remarkably simple now that the inventory is gone. The only thing that makes this worse is the writing of the story.In the first act, The Chinese Room makes sure you know they made it by coming in so heavy with metaphors that you can't decipher any real context until you are a good amount into the game. As you try to ground yourself in the game's story, TCR continuously throws ""deeper meaning"" straight at your face until the story becomes completely drowned in its own pretentious metaphors and symbolism by the third act in a way that is relatable to the Matrix trilogy. The only parts of the story that feel as though they actually belong in the Amnesia universe are the references to the original game (albeit with one glaring inconsistency).TL;DR:Overall, I disapprove of this game. The mechanics are simplified, the levels are horribly designed, and the story feels like it was written by an undergraduate art student. If you have never played Amnesia: The Dark Decent, buy that instead. If you have played it, then still don't buy this. Wait for SOMA.			"

												To fans of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, this game is a huge disappointment.  To start with the good, it excels at creating atmosphere.  There are some great scenes and very fitting music.  You get a small taste of a story that would probably have been interesting if they told you more of it, but then that’s all there is.They give you an unlimited light source and simplify all other parts of the gameplay so you can just stroll through the one path they left you and let them tell you the story, which feels like a movie adaptation of a book where you can tell something's missing unless you've read the book, but there's no book.I can’t understand why they used the Amnesia title for this game which plays NOTHING like The Dark Descent.  It would have been a sort of okay game if they hadn’t tried to associate it with Amnesia, but since they did it's actually misleading on top of mediocre, so I recommend ignoring it and waiting for whatever comes out of Frictional next.

												★★☆☆☆ - ""Average at best, Id give it a miss""PROS:- The game starts really strong, I was creeped out by the mansion with its decor, stuffed animals and was interesting to explore.- Some of the victorian streets were very befitting to the games style.- That pigs head wasnt there before was it.- The whole game is very well voiced acted.CONS:- The puzzles are extremely obvious and theres little difference in them.- At first I was reading notes and listening for every sound but as the story went on the less I cared, its characters were severely lacking making it extremely dull and on a whole the game is uneventful.- The pigs are pathetic, they're not scary and their attacks barely affect you. Theres no need to hide and you can easily run by then in your few encounters.- Machine for pigs did nothing to build on the original and instead decided against all of the aspects that made it great, theres no survival or fear for your life.- Apart from the very early stages theres barely an ounce of genuine tension. As you went further down this worsened.- I suffered like many others with random lag when the talking scenes occured which really ruined any immersion I had, especially towards the terrible ending.VERDICT? This game offers the biggest deterioration from start to finish I have ever seen and it results in being a boring experience.			"

												Firstly, it's very short. I don't rush stuff and tend to explore but this game doesn't really reward that, there is nothing to collect no scarcity or danger of running out of light. The notes are just about the only extra to find and they didn't drive me enough after the first half to actually go looking.Secondly, there is not much of an actual game here. The few puzzles that do exist are embarrassingly simple so it's mostly just you walking around avoiding the occasional pig man and listening to the story.Ah, the story. Bit of a cliche, but of course the memory loss is expected based on the title. Other things that happen don't get much better and the plot completely gets lost up its own behind in the last half hour.On the positive side the atmosphere, music and sound design is excellent and builds a bit of tension early on. That this is squandered later is a shame. Is it worth getting? if it's cheap and you've played Amnesia:TDD then give it a go but there is probably somethign better.			"

												I wanted to like this, I really did. But the troubles start before you've even properly begun. The game is full of bugs. Forums are filled with people (myself included) trying to figure work-arounds for issues like constant in-game lag (has nothing to do with the quality of your rig or having the necessary audio/video drivers updated), random graphic hitches that filter the screen in a blue, washed-out color, and audio stuttering. Some of the fixes work, though mostly for temporary periods. If you do manage to run the game properly after all that:PROS: + The environment is great. The mansion is atmospheric, spooky and interesting to explore.+ The voice acting is very good. CONS:- First and foremost: The game is just not scary. It's not Amnesia. It's Dark Esther. It's not survival and stealth, it's exploration. There's next to no tension.- The tinderboxes (requiring you to work on conserving them for light) are gone. Instead you have a lantern that never goes out. Considering that the mansion is pretty well lit 90% of the time, I found I hardly needed to use it (even with Gamma turned down)- The sanity system is gone, and with it the tense effort to remain sane in the wake of prowling monstrosities.- The monsters. The pigmonsters are not scary. They're just silly looking. They don't pursue you with the intensity of the creatures in Dark Descent and you can look at them without fear of insanity, which whittles away the mysterious fear factor very quickly.- The story is just dull. There is some possibility in the beginning that it might go in a certain, disturbing direction based on the narrative given, but it turns out to be pretty boring and a bit nonsensical. The characters just aren't very interesting. You don't really care very much.For the money you pay, I really can't recommend this one. If you must, buy the steam code for it on 99Gamers for cheap, instead of throwing $22 out for it.			"

												I really don't think this game should be called ""Amnesia"" as it doesn't really have anything in common with the first game, except some loose distant connection through story. If you are looking for a survival horror game, there isn't really any ""survival"" or not even that much ""horror"" or ""game"" in this one. The first 90 minutes of this game are frightning as heck, but once you have encountered a few enemies and discovered that they aren't really much of a threat at all, the scary part is over. No feeling of being hunted, no brilliant AI, no mazes, no proper puzzles, no physics or interactivity etc, just a linear path.However, having cleared that out of the way I'm still giving this one thumbs up. Amnesia 2 is about the atmosphere and sense of mystery. Players expecting a challenge or interesting game mechanics are going to be deeply disappointed, but those seeking a good twisted story will get some moderately creepy and disturbing experience. This story has so many levels that it would require an entire book or something to go through all the possible theories. Some claim that despite the effort put into the writing, the plot isn't really that great or sophisticated either, but although it does has some problems, I think it does at least occasionally succeed. From story or atmosphere viewpoint Amnesia 2 is still an average game and if that's your thing, I recommend it. - 4 hours put into the game, 8 hours put into arguing (speculating) about what the story of Machine for Pigs is about			"

												I find this game very disappointing. Many of the interesting and intuitive gameplay elements from the previous game have been forcefully stripped away, and only the bare bones of gameplay mechanics exist.It doesn't even come close to The Dark Descent. I don't want to say this game is downright horrible, but it's not very good either. You get some good scares and interesting moments sprinkled in, but apart from that, it's a pretty dull game with a sloppy, rushed plot.			"

												Despite the warnings I went into A Machine for Pigs with bright eyes and an open mind. It only took about 10 minutes to crush that optimism.The supposed sequel to The Dark Descent casts you as a Victorian-era inventor and industrialist, wandering his home in search of his rather ghostly little boys. The chase leads him into the sprawling factory complex he designed for automating the butchering of pigs. Now, Victorian horror is a rich vein to mine, and the setting of a mechanized slaughterhouse really can't be beat. So I hope you can understand the crushing disappointment that comes with seeing this setup wasted. In my first 90-minute session, nothing happened. Nothing. I wandered my mansion, I turned on some machines, I wandered a factory, I changed some fuses, I wandered outside, I turned on a truck, I quit. At no point did I encounter an enemy or anything even remotely threatening.What I did encounter was a lot of poorly-paced jumpscares in the form of loud noises out of the blue and glimpses of scurrying NPCs. Understand that the original Amnesia did the same thing, but with a much better sense of moderation and coupled with an exceptionally strong sound design. A Machine for Pigs completely fails to build the same atmosphere, trading the mysterious whisperings and footsteps of the castle for the playful requests of ghost children (who basically exist to point you to your next objective) and awkward monologues recounting past events. Gone is the sanity system or the balancing of light and dark, along with the entire inventory system as well. You have an infinite lantern at your disposal, which you will need because the lighting in this game is a bit wonky, what with wall lamps and candles failing to cast any significant illumination. Hilariously, the game still uses the obnoxious visual sanity effects without the system... it just hits you with them at scripted points.I was hoping there was an interesting story here, but the central theme is mangled worse than the creatures you catch fleeting glimpses of. The monologues and notes are disjointed and mostly unrelated. The attempt to write in Victorian styles also does more harm than good, making some notes near incomprehensible. In the end, there's none of the magic of Amnesia here at all. The atmosphere is botched, there's almost nothing to interact with and no reason to search the environment, and the story is nonsensical and poorly conveyed. I was certain there was no way A Machine for Pigs could be such a step down, but my goodness was I wrong.			"

												Play for the story and the creepy atmosphere. No horror game excels Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs in those regards.IMPORTANT NOTE to anyone who has played Amnesia: The Dark Descent:Please do not take this game as a sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. What many people do wrong with this game is that they go with the mindset of the previous Amnesia - going for the horror.Now, I'm not saying it's wrong to play horror games for the horror in them, and it definitely is not a surprise why people think of this as a sequel, what with the blaring ""Amnesia"" in the name. However, while the game does make an occasional reference to the original, it's significantly better to think of this as a stand-alone game.Amnesia: The Dark Descent was made by Frictional Games. They have made a name for themselves by bringing back the horror in the horror genre. Their games have that creeping atmosphere that you can never be rid of. From Penumbra: Black Plague onwards, they took a theme of defenselessness, which definitely has been a big asset.Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs was made by The Chinese Room. When Frictional Games thought about making a sequel to the Amnesia series, they decided to have an other company make it instead. Being impressed by Dear Esther, they approached The Chinese Room for sharing similar mindsets in their game development. Frictional Games did not want The Chinese Room to make a game that is similar to the original, they wanted them to make a game in their own way.Two different companies make a game of the same world, with the same theme. It's obvious there'll be differences.From Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, you'll get to experience a creepy, gross, horrifying story of a mad man trying to redeem himself.From Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you'll get a full-blown horror blast in your face.

												Machine for Pigs is quite unfortunately, a letdown. The Chinese Room manages to prove that they are adept at crafting a world, and yet throw it all away over the course of the ""game"" - which contains the same or more exposition as the first Amnesia, and about a fifth of the puzzles. You'll be continually frightened by pig squels in the early part of the game, but you are very rarely in any real danger of dying or being attacked. Most angry MANPIGS are running along on scaffolding above or below you, and are mostly used as set dressing. As you move deeper into the game (especially if you're following the journals & notes) you'll realize you've reached a point where finding MANPIGS wouldn't make sense - and as such you don't. However, the game keeps up with it's eerie sound effects and music queues to a myriad of empty rooms & squandered settings. This retroactively negates the creepiness of the same queues you've been hearing all game.Also, the only times I was genuinely scared were from ""jump scares"", that seemed mostly out of place ""AHHH! THE FLOOR COLLAPSED!"" or ""AHHH! I SEEM TO HAVE BEEN TELEPORTED TO A RANDOM MAZE INCONSISTENT WITH THE REST OF THE GAME'S TONE"". If you're looking for a weird story, I would advise you to check this game out. However, fans of Amnesia or Penumbra will be disappointed.			"

												Darkly atmospheric and beautifully rendered, I thoroughly enjoyed this one, dare I say, more than the first. It abandons the point and click Hidden Object Game mechanics in favor of exploration while masterfully building tension. That's right, it's not a HOG like it's predecessor, which was innovative for it's time and we can still see it's legacy in a brillant masterpiece like Outlast. This one is much more polished and focuses on a cinematic audio that will have you taking off your headphones and turning on the lights to make sure that was from the game and not from the burning carbuncle eyes snorting in the darkness at your window. Often hiding the horrors, it knows that what you can't see will bend your mind on all fours to imagine far worse than any engine can grind up and reanimate. The porcine genius of it all is the sqealing progression of a story line that will raise the bristles down your spine as it roots around, huffing and snuffling, in the fetid mire of your psyche.			"

												Don't let the name fool you. This is NOT Amnesia. It's Dear Esther 2: A Machine for Pigs.Now, don't get me wrong. I loved Dear Esther. It was a wonderful experiment in video game storytelling, and I enjoyed every minute of it. AMFP, though, was different. I bought the game expecting a long, immersive, and scary journey through one of the scariest game worlds ever created. What I got was less than satisfactory. Too much of what made the first game great was cut, such as the inventory and sanity system, and the game just... wasn't scary. The monsters all looked the same with no fear factor at all, and there were no heart-pounding moments that were so welcome in The Dark Descent to be found. The only real positives I have are praise for the level of detail put into the world, the soundtrack, and the decent story.If you're looking for a short, narrative-driven adventure that betrays the very name it carries, give it a shot. For everyone else, stay away.			"

												If I were to compare the two Amnesia games quickly I would say that A Machine For Pigs is more horrific, The Dark Descent is more terrifying.I prefered The Dark Descent, but A Machine for Pigs is still a superb horror game. A lot of atmosphere, horrific story and solid gameplay. It did not scare me as much as The Dark Descent, but then no other game ever has either.See my full video review for details :

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a dumbed down version of Amnesia: The Dark Descent (which was a dumbed down version of the Penumbra games itself).TDD was still a good game and some of its changes were improvements over Penumbra (less clunky controls to name just one).The same CAN NOT be said about AMfP: The developers managed to remove everything from the game that made its predecessors fun without adding anything new in return, leaving behind only an empty husk of a game.There is no exploration in AMfP because it's extremely linear with virtually no alternative routes whatsoever.The hand lamp burns on forever and the inventory has been removed completely, so there's no resource management throughout the game either.The very few puzzles in the game are barely worth that name; they are almost insultingly easy and rarely more than using a picked up item at the end of linear corridor #134.On top of the game's linearity the monster encounters are, for the most part, heavily scripted and mostly consist of monsters moving in the shadows far away from the player - there are less than a handful ares in the game with free-roaming enemies where the player can actually get hurt.The following paragraph is about game mechanics, not AMfP's story. It can still potentially spoil the game's beginning to some degree, I guess. Therefore I put it in spoiler tags; you might want to skip it if you're planning to play the game sometime. Monster encounters are not only rare, the lamp also begins to flicker everytime a monster is near - usually long before it can even be seen. After noticing this the game entirely lost the little tension it had to begin with for me: I always knew when a monster would appear beforehand, when they appeared they rarely posed a danger because of their scripted nature and for whatever reason the effects directly looking at a monster had in Penumbra and TDD are gone as well (or at least toned done a lot), so the horrors that were quiet effectively left to the player's imagination in the predecessors are now shown directly, thus making the game less scary in the end.So, to sum it up: there is not much actual gameplay in Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, it is hardly a game at all.That doesn't necessarily has to be a bad thing. The same thing can probably be said about Telltale's The Walking Dead, but TWD makes up its lack of gameplay with a very well told story. However AMfP isn't very good storywise either: It's full of horror-pulp stereotypes, making it very predictable, and towards the end the story gets completely lost in a pile of pretentious symbolism.Not much is missed by skipping AMfP completely. If you liked TDD and haven't played the Penumbra games, better go for them instead - they are a lot better than this new game.Also note that AMfP was not developed by Frictional Games (who made Penumbra and TDD) but by The Chinese Room who apparently moved towards making console games by now (figures). So waiting for Frictional's game SOMA, which is currently in devolpment, could still be worthwile if it turns out closer to the games they made themselves.			"

												People do not do this game justice. First-timers generally recommend this game. Those returning from Amnesia - The Dark Descent, the prequal, generally do not. There's of course something to note about that fact, but it does not ruin the game if you've got the mind to follow the story of Amnesia - A Machine For Pigs.If you loved ATDD, you may have mixed feelings about this one. It is not like the other, so be aware of that. Many game mechanics from ATDD are not present in AMFP, such as inventory and puzzle items, sanity drain or oil for your lantern. Therefore, if you have high expectations of this game being like its predecessor, then you will join the group of people who were disappointed. If you, however, try it for what it is, I think you'll enjoy it.This game focuses on telling a narrative story. Most of the time you spend in this game is done venturing through the story at your own pace. There are notes to read if you would like to delve deeper into the story, which I highly recommend. The story is by far the best part of this game, however it can be very difficult to follow if you don't try. It's written like a poem, and should be interpreted as such. There are many metaphors and ""ye olden"" English-styled conversations from the Industrial Revolution period, so if you heavily disliked English class, you might struggle. Nevertheless it is an incredibly deep and wonderful story for those fortunate enough to embrace it.Some say they spent 4 hours through this game. My first play-through I believe was 8 hours. Obviously I was going very slowly through it but if you rush, you will miss the details that make it good. Take your time with it. It might not be for you if you're of the impatient type.Story, music, atmosphere, and narration is all excellent. There isn't much of gameplay though, as it's mostly just walking through this journey of a story. Think of it as an interactive movie. That's my advice. It's definitely not for everyone, so if this fits you, give it a shot. If not, well, you should know yourself.			"

												Oh man. This game is such a dissapointment.If ''The Chinese Room'' didnt get involved this could've been so much better.They didnt try to make Amnesia 2, they tried to make a sequel to Dear Esther.I loved the story in TDD, it had the perfect balance between gameplay and story. This one is more focused on the story but I couldn't really get into it because it's so effin boring. There was not a single scary moment in this game and the 'monsters' you'll face later on are no threat to you and you can just casually walk past them. Your character is never in any actual danger. You couldn't check your sanity; tinderboxes and oil didn't exist. You don't have an inventory so don't even bother exploring. But why mention it? You can't do that anyway since every door in this game is locked unless you have to actually go through it. If you loved grabbing random sh*t in TDD and throwing it at the enemy or just against a wall - you can't do it in this one cause everything is locked in place. The nerve wrecking atmosphere from TDD is completey lost, you don't have to worry about oil for your lantern cause it is unlimited. I quit the game 3 times but I kept giving it a chance because I WANTED it to be good but there is really no hope for this. A Machine for Pigs is a complete let down to every The Dark Descent fan.The fact that this game is 3-5 hours long is a joke.So I will say this: This is one of the worst Horror Games I've ever played in my entire life.It's not even worth a 1 out of 10 so I won't bother rating it.

Dark, horrific and utterly unimaginableCompared to the first game - Amnesia: The Dark Descent the second ""Amnesia"" game hasn't gotten such an extremely positive reception. This is probably more due to people constantly comparing it to the first game than to it being the lesser of the two. Comparisons with the original Amnesia game are of course to be expected - after all, that game has obtained a cult-like status as one of the scariest horror games EVER - but are not really fair in my opinion.Of course, the two games share part of their title and there is also a fairly strong connection between both games' storyline (although more in the background, subtle referred to in the documents that are to be found everywhere). But the developers clearly had a different goal in mind with Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and the deserves to be rated on its own merits. These are very strong and pronounced indeed: the all important story is told in a brilliant way, with lots of documents being interlaced with revealing diary fragments and mysterious phonecalls. Although the story is certainly not straightforward and demands some thinking and re-reading to become completely clear, The Chinese Room has done an awesome job in this department.Equally well done is the setting of the game: there is a very pervasive sense of darkness, gloom and horror during the game, helped by excellent use of the (fairly limited) graphical engine and, especially, by anothr gorgeous soundscape and musical score. Especially the music - freshly composed for the game by Jessica Cury - shines: it jumps between styles with astonishing ease, sometimes sounding as classical as Bach, and then all of a sudden going very dissonant and most unsettling. In fact ""unsettling"" in perhaps the single word that defines this game best: the unfolding story, the entire setting, the slow realisation of the unimaginable horrors that wait to be discovered, turned this game in a true horrific experience.But that is not the same as a truly frightening experience: I didn't feel the same sense of utter fear as when playing the original game, when I often had to stop after some time in order to recompose myself. The horror in Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is of a different sort: it is the horror of discovering the extreme, unhuman cruelty which lies beneath it all, combined with the slow but dreadful realisation of one's own part in this. Quite often I found myself reluctant to progress as I didn't want to discover more of the story, however intriguing it was. I simply refused to believe this was actually happening - which testifies to the complete feeling of immersion this game manages to achieve.As with all true horror games, it is of course very highly recommended to play this one in a very dark environment, preferably using headphones in order to absord the amazing sound world of this game. Recently some sort of ""sound mod"" for the game was released, offering players using stereo headphones the opportunity to experience the sounds and music in a true threedimensional, positional fashion. I didn't try this out myself yet, but I can imagine that it even adds to the atmosphere. Please refer to the guides in the community section for the game.Not everything is perfect though: the amount of actual gameplay has been reduced, not by a lot, but at least in one very important way. In the first game, you had to collect tinderboxes to be able to light candles, and lamp oil for the lantern you could carry with you (and which proved to be utterly necessary in the many pitch dark passages). Collecting tinderboxes and oil, adn keeping an eye on your oil level and the amount of tinderboxes left, made me play that game in a cautious, very slow manner, trying to keep at least something in reserve. In this game, however, the entire inventory has disappeared, and so have the light sources which needed to be managed. The lantern you are carrying with you stays ""on"" all the time, and the only thing you have to worry about, is not to attract the attention of ""the enemy"". It seems like a minor quibble, but it is not: the game changed from an interactive horror game into an almost exclusively story- and atmosphere-driven experience, although an extremely strong one.But in the end, both the story and superb soundtrack manage to overcome any shortcomings, and make this game an essential one for anybody not being deterred by the horrors to be found within.Very highly recommended, but don't expect a sequel comparable to the original one. Take the game on its own merits, and it will drag you into its dark world indeed. "

												Overall, A Machine for Pigs is a pretty good, if short game. The story is interesting, and the settings are well-designed (and certainly more visually interesting than the dull castle of The Dark Descent). If it was just called ""A Machine for Pigs"", I would have no problem giving it a positive review. The problem is that it's not called A Machine for Pigs; it's called Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and so the developers are actively encouraging me to review it as an Amnesia game because that's what they're pitching it as to the customer. And in that regard, it's kind of awful. It's important to understand that this game was developed primarily by The Chinese Room, the developers of Dear Esther (which was an interesting story-based exploration game with gameplay summarized as a walking simulator), and not Frictional Games, the creator of the Penumbra and Amnesia games. I've already made it known that I consider Amnesia to be a worse game than the Penumbra series, and this game just takes it a step further down. The worst parts of Amnesia are well in-tact, so you can fully expect to frequently get wobbly vision during setpieces and to constantly get slowed down and visually impaired while the narrator dishes out a bit of story, which consistently kills both the pacing and the atmosphere. But everything else seems to be fair game for the cutting board, since there's no longer a sanity system, you don't have to manage resources like fuel for your light, and you don't even have an inventory. There isn't a puzzle in the game any more complex than ""put the coal into the coal chute ten steps away"" or ""pull the lever"", which makes it hard to say that there are even puzzles in the game at all. Enemies are almost nonexistant, with the grand total of actual enemy encounters being about 6, and being generous, taking up about 3 minutes of the 3 or 4 hours it takes to complete the game. They're not even particularly good or long encounters, either; in one particular instance, you suddenly drop into an area with an invisible water monster (which was more or less shamelessly ripped from The Dark Descent in place of actually making something new, with only a single note giving a half-hearted explanation of why it exists in this game), all you have to do is run forward in the only other direction that isn't towards the water monster. The path to the ladder to escape is literally gated by siderails, so it's almost impossible to actually fail the segment. And that sentiment applies to all of the game's sparse encounters; each of them is a very scripted, very setpiece-like instance where the monster shows up, you hide in the designated hiding place, the monster walks by, and you continue your merry way. It's very safe and guided, and you never really get the feeling of being in any real danger. The game does a lot to try to build up atmosphere, but it falls flat after the first thirty minutes or so because you very quickly realize that the game is never actually going to pay off on the tension beyond quick fleeting glimpses of a monster or a sudden banging noise that has no purpose other than to try to get a jump out of you (which makes up about 2/3 of the game's ""scares""). Ultimately I would still recommend this game at a heavy discount, since all things considered it's still not the worst horror game on Steam (though that isn't saying a whole lot, considering thanks to Steam Greenlight even Bad Rats is no longer the worst game on Steam) and it does have an interesting plot, but if you're looking for more of what you've come to expect from Frictional Games then either wait for SOMA or download Penumbra: Necrologue.

												This is nowhere near as good as the original Amnesia, I don't think it was the same team designing it, and it shows. A lot of really glaring bad game design choices for this game. Also it adds nothing to the genre and isn't scary at all. I mean pigs. Pigs just aren't scary, you kind of pity them instead. I anticipated this game eagerly, based on the fun I had in the original, but this game falls short, and its a challenge to bother to even play it. So I am severely disappointed.			"

												look ok yeah it's not as scary as the dark descent and yeah it's easier, they removed the sanity system and the inventory and oversimplified the ""puzzles"" and changed some stuff up for the worse, so don't play it if you're looking for something that is equal to or better than the dark descent's gameplay.the thing about machine for pigs is its story. its horror is in the story and the lore and it's similar to dear esther in that way except pigs actually resembles a playable game with threats and goals. the story in pigs is much deeper and more interesting than the one found in the dark descent and if you read all the notes (there's a lot of them) and speculate on them while playing, you'll still get your amnesia sequel.all in all, where the dark descent was scary, i think a machine for pigs was suspenseful. that doesn't make it a lesser game. it had better story and better atmosphere. it lacks in certain aspects but makes up for that in others. still a fun and interesting experience.

												A horror without horror. Despite this terrible contradiction, A Machine for Pigs loses nothing by getting rid of its main feature. Even being much closer to an interactive novel rather than to a horror game, it's almost as tense as before - all thanks to the cunning narration and that great setting it uses.Although it's a bit frustrating that the game has lost a great part of its interactivity, leaving all the credits to the plot. The player is here to pull some triggers and watch the story, not to be an actual part of it. Not a big deal, but still.So, Amnesia's choice now is to become a story-driven thriller. If it seems to be fine with you, there's nothing else to complain about. In other cases, it would be better to take a closer look at Outlast.			"

												Looks pretty and the voice acting is good, but the scares are anemic (you don't ever explicitly ""die"" in the game for poorly justified in-universe reasons, killing any and all tension just because some moron at thechineseroom thought that would be worth doing to justify what essentially amounts to an in-universe replacement for a quicksave/quickload), the story and themes induce eye-rolling rather than dread (PIGS PIGS PIGS PIGS HUMANS ARE PIGS IN THE ETERNAL MACHINE OF SOCIETY ARE YOU SCARED BY THIS EXTREMELY GENERIC AND OVERUSED METAPHOR YET?, and too much streamlining of puzzles (I like streamlining of needless complexity and menus when it's done well but A Metaphor for Pigs took it a bit too far in my eyes) makes the actual game lack any true challenge or meat to it. Oh, and it can be beaten in less than four hours.Skip this porker. It's all sizzle and no steak... er, bacon.			"

												I get the hate for this game but it's not as bad as everyone puts it out to be. It's no Amnesia TDD but it's not that bad. It's far better than a lot of games on steam. The poor rating isn't justified. You have games like Dark Souls 2. Dark Souls 2 is the worst dark souls out of the 3 but it's still a good game. The same concept goes for Amnesia: MFP. Not as good as the first but it's still by far one of the most interesting games on Steam.			"

												A majority of the negative reviews are just people upset that the game isn't exactly the same as the first.Don't expect something similar to the first, but do expect a game less focused on the gameplay and more on the story.At first, I to was skeptical of this game due to it being made by thechineseroom, a group who made Dear Esther, a game I detest. However, the story in this game is actually a story and not just vague mutterings with barely any coherency, so this is actually worth playing.			"

												We've all heard most of what needs to be said about Machine for Pigs.In short; it's more Dear Esther than Amnesia.The Chinese Room butchered Frictional Game's good reputation they made with The Dark Descent.---The real reason I've decided to finally post a review is because on my second playthrough it literally took me less than 5 minutes to get stuck in the map. I encounter a machine that needs a fuse, find a new fuse, install the fuse, notice there's a second fuse so I bring it along with me assuming I'll need it later, come to a point where I need free hands so temporarily put the fuse down, then finally game tries to scare me by locking door behind me.Then the game tries to show clever level design by giving me access to the old location of the fuse, not at all considering the fact that I had brought it with me for most of the way, now lying on a table no longer accessible.Nice, Chine Room. Real nice.			"

												First of, before I start this review let's go ahead and get one important/key factor out of the way...THIS IS NOT LIKE THE FIRST AMNESIA.Yes, this is not like the first Amnesia at all... this is due to the fact that FRICTIONAL GAMES, did not makeA Machine for Pigs. The IP was handed off to a developer team called THE CHINESE ROOM. THE CHINESE ROOM are the ones responsible for creating this game and FRICTIONAL GAMES, was only involved in PUBLSHING (NOT CREATING)but publishing this game. The Chinese Room are also the author's of the narrative driven game Dear Esther.So in short, AAMFP is a game that is highly different than it's predecessor TDD(The Dark Descent.)Let's do a quick run through of Pros vs Cons.Pros:-Good Atmosphere-Good Story-Good GraphicsCons: -Not as frightful-Easier Puzzles-The Tension that builds early is quickly lost.The game itself is narrative driven, more so than the original Amnesia. The story presented in AAMFP is told and built quite well and solid in my opinion. It all led up to a more than predictable climatic ending however. The main difference I noticed between AAMFP and TDD is that often I found myself rushing through AAMFP content at times looking for the next scare/enemy interraction. There is significantly less interraction with enemies in AAMFP which in turn leads to long peroids of time where you're either exploring or solving mediocre puzzles such as changing a bulb, or turning a valve. It is during these extended periods that the fear and immersive dread that was originally built up is lost. However, I still found the encounters with the enemies to be tense at times. Overall I feel that this game is worth it's retail value, I enjoyed it, I got a good imersion/scare out of playing it and the only real way to know how good this game is is to pick it up and give it a playthrough. As long as you're not expecting a Amnesia The Dark Descent v.2 I believe any true horror genre fan will enjoy this title.			"

 Holy cow, this game was rad. There'll be a handy list of all the pros and cons below if you're into that sort of thing, although it is a bit concise. If you're a patient reader who can handle a crap-ton of text (or an in-depth review, you could say) I wholeheartedly recommend you to tag along.Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this game was not developed by Frictional Games, the developers behind the Penumbra games and The Dark Descent.  This is a collaboration between Frictional and The Chinese Room.  Frictional merely published this game. The number one complaint  this game got on release was that ""it wasn't as scary as The Dark Descent"". Heck, most even said that ""it wasn't scary at all"".I completely disagree.  I found this game to be scary,  most definitely so. I don't know how this came to be, but this is definitely how I felt while playing the game. You might already be thinking that I'm a colossal wuss, which I humbly deny, as this is definitely not the first horror game I've played. I went into the game with the same expectations as everyone else, thinking that it's the weakest of Frictional's titles and all that.  So don't be turned off by the fact that others didn't have a scary time with this game.  I surely did.Complaint number two was directed at the lack of resource management, which has been a core feature of all Frictional's past titles.  This game does not feature an inventory or tinderboxes, and the lantern has infinite fuel. There is also no sanity system and health is regenerated automatically.  People flipped their sh*t when they heard of this, let me tell you. I spent a good thirty minutes looking at the Metacritic user reviews for this game, and they all basically roasted the game for having ""dumbed down the gameplay to oblivion"" and ""taken away the fear of losing light"".I can see the logic behind both of these arguments, especially the latter. The former just seems silly. I actually didn't like the resource management in The Dark Descent that much, as tinderboxes were way too common and oil was really hard to find. I felt restricted because I didn't want to waste any oil. Infinite fuel seemed like a godsend if anything. Despite this, the game wasn't too bright at all, I'd say it was the opposite. The monsters were also a dissapointment for most people,  and I actually kind of agree on this one. I'm not saying they weren't scary, because they were (they're monsters for a reason, duh). They just weren't ""as scary"". One of the major cons I would personally give this game is the  terror meter/chase theme . Perhaps one of the most iconic pieces of audio in Frictional's games are the terror meters, which are basically the monsters' chase themes. Not only do they indicate that the monster has begun its hunt and that you should haul a**, they are a critical factor in maintaining the suspense of the chase. I'm sure everyone remembers the diabolical screeching  in The Dark Descent, as it was easily distinguishable and altogether terrifying. SOMA had multiple, one for each monster type, all of which were f*cking terrifying as well.  A Machine for Pigs' chase theme, when compared to the others, is a pretty big miss.  It's basically machine noises. And when you take into consideration that you will be near machinery for a big part of the game, the mistake becomes clear. One time I had literally no idea that I was being hunted, just because the chase theme was so quiet and indistinguishable from the ambience. The chases were still pretty scary, but definitely lost some of the terror that the other games had.Let's now look at some things that people actually liked, for once. The story is definitely one of the major things A Machine for Pigs got right.  The Chinese Room as a developer has their focus set on story-driven games, and it shows. The story is such an improvement from The Dark Descent's, which I found to be quite dull and it didn't catch my interest.  As this is a story-driven game at heart, you absolutely must tag along with it and pay attention to the notes and dialogue.  The writing is stellar, and the notes were a blast to read. I wouldn't say that the story reaches SOMA's level of excellence, but it's great nonetheless. Frictional's titles all possess brilliant sound design, and this is no exception.  The overall audio is great, especially the voice acting. The composer isn't our beloved Mikko Tarmia this time, but Jessica Curry still managed to make an epic score suitable for a horror game like this.I haven't seen many people talking about the environments, actually. I thought that the overall milieu was certainly more interesting than in The Dark Descent. I didn't really like TDD's trite castle setting, so I eagerly awaited what this game had to offer. After my first hour with the game I was already very happy with the choice they made. As a big fan of steampunk, I found the environments quite pleasing.I guess I've covered it all now, so here's the promised list for the impatient. PROS  Story is brilliant and a huge improvement over The Dark Descent's. Setting was especially pleasing to me. (Steampunk environments are fun.) Overall audio is great. (Do it justice and use headphones, please.) Yes, it can actually be scary. I went into it with the same expectations as everyone else, and still got scared plenty. THE NEUTRAL STUFF, I GUESS  Inventory is gone. (I actually didn't mind it at all.) Infinite light. (People are still flipping their sh*t over this. I actually like this change, f*ck resource management.) Less objects to throw...? (I don't care, neither should you.) No sanity system. (I actually don't like that you can look at the enemy all you want, but it's better than getting lasting effects from it. SOMA did this right by disrupting your vision only when you look at the damn things.) CONS  The monsters aren't as scary. (They're still scary, not just  as  scary.) The terror meter. (a.k.a the monster chase theme. It's very quiet and indistinguishable from the ambience, and not very scary at all.) A tad short when compared to the other games. Took me seven hours to beat, but it can be easily beaten in five. Summary I still don't understand why people are so mad about this game. The things that they took away from this sequel aren't really that significant, and I found the changes to be quite good. The story is a huge improvement over the last game's. And yes, the game can still be scary, especially if you play it in a proper environment (at night, in the dark and with headphones. This is how every horror game should be played, for goodness' sake!). I honestly thought this was a worthy sequel. Such a shame that everyone seemed to dislike it.			"

												In my opinion, the Dark Descent may have been the more terrifying of the two games, but Machine for Pigs told the better story. The community following for this series seems to overlook the story of either game and instead compares the levels of how ""scary"" the overall experience is, which I think is a poor way to judge this game. Sure it has the name ""Amnesia"" in the title and we may attribute that title to a ""scary game"", but I think this is overlooking greater factors in what makes this series unique.I liked the Dark Descent as the scary, immersive, and atmospheric game that it was, but I do believe it fell short on the story. A Machine for Pigs was not, as disappointing as it was for some people, not nearly as scary as it's predecessor. However, in my time with it I found the game to be just as immersive as the first and it told a much better story than Dark Descent did. This game is not flawless, keep in mind. It is made by a different team than the one behind Dark Descent, and as a result it's more likely than not they did not use the game engine to it's full potential. A Machine for Pigs is not the most well optimized game, suffering from frequent frame drops and screen tearing issues despite having Vsync enabled. I run a GTX 970 and an FX8350 and I was unable to get a stable 60FPS unless I played on the preset ""medium"" graphics setting.To sum up what I liked and disliked about the game, though:PROS:1) Monsters patrol areas instead of teleporting in and out of the map. Sure, a majority of the encounters ARE scripted, but unlike in Dark Descent if you do happen to die the monster WILL still be there when you load back in.2) This game has phenomenal and immersive sound design. Best played alone and with headphones.3) The game doesn't hold your hand through the last hour of the game like the Dark Descent did with Agrippa.4) There were no plot holes in this story that I was able to pick up on.5) Removal of the inventory screen, Part 1. Throughout my playthrough of the first Amnesia I must have collected atleast thirty tinderboxes that I never felt the need to use.CONS:1) Poorly optimized, screen tearing, frame drops, and I did encounter a glitch where an object I needed for a puzzle got stuck halfway through a wall.2) Lack of interaction with the world. There are so many locked doors that you can interact with that serve no purpose, but meanwhile the only objects that Mandus CAN interact with are chairs and items needed to solve a puzzle.3) Removal of the inventory screen, Part 2: Mandus's lantern never shuts off and he regenerates health. Along with this, in the Dark Descent there were items you would acquire from earlier parts in the game you find uses for later on. In Machine for Pigs, there's no need for an inventory screen because any item you need for a puzzle will be in the general vicinity.4) Removal of the sanity meter. I can understand Mandus possibly not being afraid of the dark like Daniel was, but if I saw a deformed man pig hybrid patrolling an area I would get spooked by it. 5) The game is short. Even shorter than Dark Descent. Like 4-5 hours tops.Overall, I did like the game for it's story but was slightly put off by the lack of puzzles and the poor optimization. I would give it a 7/10, and I would only recommend buying it during a sale.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is the second game in the franchise and one of the five games published by Fictional Games (Not counting the puzzle expansion for Penumbra: Black Plague). However, unlike the other four games this one is not developed by Fictional Games, instead it was developed by The Chinese Room known for games such as Dear Esther and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture. I'm not familiar with the story behind why this one was developed by The Chinese Room but it might have to do with Fictional being busy developing SOMA, but don't take my word for it. The reason why I bring all this up is because I think it is important that people know that this instalment was made by a team who has a completely different style compared to Fictional. The Chinese Room's games are pretty much ""walking simulators"". One could call A Machine for Pigs the love child of Amnesia: The Dark Decent and Dear Esther.A Machine for Pigs is a first person horror/adventure game that's focusing a lot more on the story instead of intense horror unlike The Dark Decent. There aren't a whole lot of encounters with enemies, and when there are, they are usually far between eachother, and for most parts not as intense and scary as the one's you faced in The Dark Decent.This is not necessarily a bad thing. Throughout the game you're surrounded by a very well executed dark and eerie atmosphere that comes to life thanks to well done sound design, creepy mansions, alleys and basements, and some very neatly placed events like the entire mansion starting to shake, children running by at the end of the corridor to just vanish in thin air, the re-apperance of a specific pig mask, and much more.Just like the previous game A Machine for Pigs includes a few puzzles you have to solve to progress in the game. A lucky strike for some, and a shame for others, the puzzles in this one are very simplistic and doesn't take much thought to solve  .While the story of the game is not one of the best the gaming community has ever seen it's still worth paying attention to, and is by all means fairly interesting and easy to follow. As the description of the game says: ""it will drag you to the depths of greed, power and madness. It will bury its snout into your ribs and it will eat your heart."", that pretty much explains what you're in for.Overall the game is worth a buy, but I strongly encourage you purchase it during a sale. It's a good game for those of you who may not be a huge fan of extremely scary games filled with jumpscares, or those of you who enjoys a story-driven experience with minimal complications and lack of action. To say that A Machine for Pigs is a huge step-down from The Dark Decent is not an easy task because the way they plays are familiar yet very different, and it all goes down to each individuals prefered taste in games. If you like intense chases, the fear of darkness, being paranoid and on your toes then The Dark Decent is defenitely superior. But if you enjoy a more story-drive game that doesn't require you looking over your shoulder every thirty seconds then this one is for you.Be aware that the game does have the tendency of crashing from time to time, so if you haven't manually saved then you may be in for a bad time of having to re-play hours of gameplay. Trust me, I had to learn it the hard way. Twice.			"

												I will say though, I have much more respect for bacon, now that I know where it comes from. :/Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs is alright, but nowhere near in great comparison to Dark Descent. The atmosphere, sounds and story is quite good, but it lacks enemies, real puzzles and in-depth secrets. It is basically point A to Point B with no backtracking, sidestories or mods to really boot. Basically you get chased by mechanical pigs in dark. What is groovy about it though is that the audio is incredible, the SFX is riveting, and voce acting is quite good. Only thing it lacks is the fear of shadows given to you in the older installment. Get this game when it is on sale, for sure.			"

												""I do not know how a man can **** that much blood and still live.""For such a short game, it managed to feel drawn out and unnecessary.  If there is one thing that we can learn from this narrative, it is that wordy and intelligent are not synonyms.  It brushes against interesting themes, but does not reach any conclusion worth noting, aside from the classic video game trope that ""evil is bad.""  The few encounters with enemy creatures devolve from an intial tense atmosphere to an annoyance, as the player realizes they can always outrun their opponent, and will never be challenged with completing a task while an enemy is present.  Heaven forbid you stumble on one of the half-dozen safe points from which you can view the underwhelming models of the creatures you have been running from.  In the final hour, there is a two-part boss battle which is mind-boggling in both concept and execution, and clashes harshly with the game's established world.  Then you get on the pork shuttle to watch the game play the final act through on its own - though why the final scene concludes the game as the protagonist wishes is not obvious to me.  This is not a technically challenging horror game, and it is not an intellectually challenging narrative adventure.  This is a drawn out and densely crowded narrative-heavy gameplay-light experience, which manages to come across as half-baked.			"

												I don't understand all the hate directed at this game. People have bought this game in hopes that it would be as scary as its predecessor. Sure it's not as scary as Amnesia: The Dark Descend, but still, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a brilliant game. First of all, it is story-rich and has an awesome plot, although the story might be a little difficult to understand if English isn't your first language. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a very enjoyable game that is both scary & story-rich. Sure, it's got its flaws like every other game such as being very boring in the beginning (Doing almost nothing for the first 1.5 hours) but Frictional Games, teamed up with the Chinese room has created a good game. However, the absence of the ""sanity mechanic"" somewhat makes this game ""incomplete"".If you like really good stories, mixed in with some horror, then this game is for you. I'd give it a solid 7.5/10 PS: ""SPOILER"" I wish we had the choice at the end of the game, of either destroying the machine, or let it do its job and ""save"" humanity.			"

												List of things that were good in Amnesia The Dark Descent:- you could light candles with limited supplies of matches- you had a lantern that could go low on fuel- you had to manage madness : stay stealthy in the dark and become mad, or get low on resources and be spotted by enemies by lighting stuff but remaining sane. It was smart and a balanced system- enemies were threatening AND frightening, and hard to outrunThis is also the list of things that have been removed in A Machine For Pigs.It is closer to Dear Esther than Amnesia. Don't buy if you're looking for a horror game.Didn't finish it, I was just bored playing it. Not frightening, not involving, not entertaining. And I've seen too many valves.			"

This was not close to what I was expecting, and I tried to make the best out of it but it was simply too hard to do! It is a good game, but it is not a amensia game. Dear Esther 2 maybe? xD (Nah jk)			"

												Do not buy this game if you're a fan of the original. In my oppinion, a machine for pigs was a huge dissapointment, and an insult to the original. Here are a few reasons:1) the message.Yes. I get it. The pigs are symbolism for men. STOP THRUSTING IT IN MY FACE LIKE AN ERECT♥♥♥♥♥♥br>2) No more physics. One fun thing to do in the original was too ♥♥♥♥ around with the physics. They weren't amazing but were still fun. In this game it's a bit different, you cant interact with almost any new objects, and even some of the old objects have had physics removed. 3) Sanity effects and inventory removed. Another appeal of the original was the sanity system. While not perfect the sanity system had some fun elements that could make the game much scarier at times. And the inventory system could to if you ever ran out of tinderboxes or oil at a bad moment. Not here! You instead get a lantern which occasionaly flickers.Brilliant4)The monsters weren't scary. While i was playing at the beginning, I was ♥♥♥♥ing terrified of the horrors that hid within the mansions. Then I eventually got to the first encounter, and lo and behold the monster didn't scare or frighten me.In fact the stupid prick didn't even notice me, he saw my charecter flailing his Lantern like an idiot, and walked right past me. Even when they did notice me, these stupid ♥♥♥♥ers accuracy was worse than a stormtroopers. Tehy'd try to hit me and accidentily knock on their neighbors door and get into a friendly conversation. The only time I felt like i was in actual danger was suring the bit you had to run through the town, while a pig frantically chased you trying to get a autograph.5) The water part. Instead of being open int he first game where you had to hop around on crates and throw meat to district the thing, you were dropped into a fenced off area where running straight was the only option. All you had to do was hold Shift+W and occasionly turn to mouse, and you were fine.6)and the puzzles. They were ♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												This game removes many parts of the original amnesia that make it a significantly weaker game overall. Some people would argue that the story is good and makes the game worth the price. The story is quite good to be honest, but only as good as the original's and therefore not good enough to make it worth 20$(maybe 10$). Add to this that it's only 3(MAYBE 4) hours long and you have gone from a 10/10 game to a 5/10 game.			"

												A Machine for Pigs is a good game, as long as you judge it on its own terms. Unfortunately, that's not exactly easy to do. For one thing, it carries the ""Amnesia"" title, which sets certain expectations. Also, releasing so close to a similar genre game like Outlast doesn't help either. A Machine for Pigs is nothing like either of those games - it is very much its own beast (no pun intended). Gameplay-wise, it resembles the original Amnesia, in that you explore a creepy location with nothing but the light of a lantern to aid you. The stories of the two games are also connected. But that's pretty much where the similarities end. In the original game, you had to manage resources to keep your light lit (and your character sane), which ended up being a pretty tense balancing act at times. Additionally, running and hiding from monsters was a key gameplay element. However, in AMFP, your lantern never runs out of fuel, the actual monster encounters are few and far between, and hiding is not usually necessary. The upshot of these changes make AMFP a very different feeling game. For one, it is not particularly scary. Sure, there are definitely lots of moments of dread where you find yourself not wanting to go through a door or down a dark hallway. However, you soon realize that in most cases, there is actually nothing there to fear. Secondly, the game is very linear and the puzzles are overly simple. Mostly, you just go through a series of corridors and turn on a valve here and there, which opens up the next corridor. It's pretty easy. So this isn't really a horror game in the sense of ""scare factor"". The horror mostly comes from the feelings created by the environment (level and sound design, which are both excellent), and the story. The story is the high point here, though. Most of it is revealed through notes and audio recordings that are found throughout the levels. The voiceovers, and the writing especially, are very good. I would say that is the main reason to play this game - the story and atmosphere. As a pure horror/scare-factor game, you will be disappointed. For that, you are better off playing the original Amnesia or genre newcomer Outlast. A Machine for Pigs plays much more like a horror version of Dear Esther (which should come as no surprise, as it was developed by the same people). If that sounds up your alley, definitely give this one a go. Just keep in mind it's not really very scary or action oriented, so if you are expecting a repeat of the original game (or something along the lines of Outlast), you will be severely disappointed. Playtime is around 4 hours or so, give or take. All in all, I felt it was a worthy successor to the Amnesia legacy, in its own way. Probably not as good a game overall, but definitely a unique experience that is worth checking out at some point if you enjoyed the original.			"

												First off: I actually was pleasantly suprised by the game, I like it.So I have played and absolutely love the Penumbra series and Amnesia the Dark Decent.I knew this was made by a different developer and that it was received with less enthousiasm.So when I played it I curbed my expectations but that seemed in the end to be unneeded.Gameplay:Well....there isn't much of that in this game, less then a handful meaningful encounters with enemies and I dont think the game ever actually threw a puzzle my way that took more then half a second to figure out.In fact most things that could have been a puzzle, the answer to it was given by the game (character) anyway.Story:Ah now this is were the game shines.....ok well partly.This is what the game is pretty much all about, figuring out what happened, who you are, what is going on.The game does a good job with the pacing and giving little bits of story along the way.Where imo it falls a little flat is that in the end its still not clear what is actually going on, the game drops hints, then drops hints that is not really like that, then drops hints that it is again or something totally different.In the end its hard to make heads or tails from what is going on.But the journey imo is a good one, and the writing is really good.Thats actually a major...if not the biggest part of the game, reading.You do a LOT of reading in this game, but its not a bad thing imo as again, the writing is really good.Its poetic and emotional, its understandable and vague in other areas, its just all very interesting.If you go into this game and expect a game like the previous, you will be kinda dissapointed.But if you go into this and see it as a novel in game format, very much like Gone Home, I think you will appreciate it.I think this is an experience worth having if you care about story telling and dont mind reading and can immerse yourself.

												Very underwhelming after playing the Dark Descent. The inventory screen is gone, the sanity mechanic is gone, and actual dangerous monster encouters are few and far between. While Dark Descent truly makes you pee your pants scared, this game focuses more on the story (which isn't even that good compared to Dark Descent in my opinion).It's not terrible, but it's a big step down from it's predecessor.

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs - The second main game from Amnesia series. After the amazing Amnesia: The Dark Descent people wanted next Amnesia, much better than first game, but is it really better? I won't anwer that question, I'll just say that it's ""Different"", but mostly in positive aspects.First you have to remember that this game wasn't created by Frictional Games like first Amnesia. It was created by The Chinese Room (You can know them if you've played Dear Esther). Ok, but let's talk about the game!Most of the players didn't like Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, because a few important aspects from Amnesia: The Dark Descent were cut off in this game. There wasn't any inventory, you couldn't pick up many items like chairs, boxes etc, no tinderbox to pick up and your source of light is unlimited. So the survival aspect of the game don't exist. The only items you can pickup are letters, papers and important items that you have to pickup to move on with story.Monsters aren't that scary like in first game, but still i have to say that power of imagination in that game still works! I was scared because of simply noises and i thought there is monster nearby. Also i should note that there aren't the ""warning alert"" when the monster is next to you. That alert was in first Amnesia and in my opinion it's better that it's don't exist here, because if you won't be careful you can me surprised in ""negative"" aspect of course! Don't get me wrong, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is still very scary game, but you can't compare it to the first game.Soundtrack is amazing! It was composed by Jessica Curry (Same artist like in Dear Esther). The style is again different than from the first game, but it's also amazing and it's fit with all those factory levels and London from fall of XIX century. Go ahead and try it

You could thought that i already said the most important things from that game, but nope, not yet! Now is The StoryThe story in this game... I can't describe it, if i'll say it's amazing it's not enough. In this aspect Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs owning the first game, no doubt about it! It's very emotional, sad and you'll think about it after you'll finish the whole game. I won't say any spoilers, but to make you curious i'll just say that the ""Pigs"" in the title of the game is an ambiguous word... In my opinion one of the best stories i've ever been seeing in video games. You should play this game even only because of that story. Also i recommend read all the notes that you'll find in the game from the chronological order after you'll finish the game.I'm really sad seeing all those negative reviews, most of these people were just looking for Amnesia: The Dark Descent 2, but I really understand them. I was also a little bit dissapointed when i realised i couldn't take chairs and other objects and throw them away, honestly I don't understand why developers removed that, but when i finished the game I was glad i pre-ordered it.I rate this game 8/10 (Very Good), mostly because of that great story, soundtrack and the whole atmosphere. It isn't that scary like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, so if you're looking for only scary horror game and you don't care about other aspects, then you should buy other game. My english isn't perfect so I apologise for any grammar mistakes, I hope i'll be better in future!			"

												Honestly, I think people are too hard on this game. Is it as scary as Amnesia: Dark Descent? Not necessarily, but then Dark Descent was such an unexpectedly delirious and exhilerating experience. It was a surprise. The difference with its sequel is that people have been expecting A Machine For Pigs for a while; based on those expectations, some were disappointed. I was not. A Machine For Pigs doesn't need to be as scary as Dark Descent. Of course there are plenty of moments in that game which made my blood run cold, such as the infamous chase through the flooded Archives with a monster snapping at your heels, the damned Prison area which gave me plenty of mini heartattacks, and just the growl of those disgusting monsters. Yet I remember only a few moments from that game, which to me are not as important as the overall experience. What was the most scary for me was actually the story, and learning about Daniel. At the beginning, he's a man that drank the Amnesia potion to make himself forget the horrors the Baron had inflicted. But of course, as we descend deeper into Brennenberg, we realize the truth. Near the end, I wasn't even sure Daniel deserved to be saved (which is why the three different endings pleased me so much). A Machine For Pigs has a story that is just as good, and in some respects, better than Dark Descent. It has its moments too, but A Machine For Pigs is all about how it leaves you feeling than the individual moments you can remember. The core element of discovering the story through notes, and the journal entries of Oswald, is still there. We learn he's a drunkard (wine is, after all, its own form of Amnesia). We learn he's a butcher. We learn he wants to be more effective at butchering through the use of technology. We learn his wife died in childbirth, which clearly has a bad affect on his sanity (like a true madman, he wants mmotality, and creates a machine to that effect). He apparently wants to save his children, and is guided by a vaguely familiar and sinister voice over the scattered telephones. His journal entries are distrubing enough, littered with contempt, hatred, anger, dispair, and revolting descriptions, all which offer a glimpse into his deranged mind. You really need to appreciate the briliance of this, along with the other core elements that made Dark Descent amazing, which A Machine For Pigs definitely has: the sound, the constant oppressive and immersive atmosphere, the music, the voice acting, and the mystery. Despite the tension which keeps you constantly on edge, you want to keep exploring the machine. You feel compelled to descend further down, past the scraping metal, the wails of steam, the screams and groans of the machinery, the flickering lights, the thick, putrid smell as its often described, the pulsing of the engines-A Machine For Pigs does a fantastic job of creating the setting. The fact that I felt no relief when I was briefly outside is also a testament to that accomplishment. The rain slicked and gloomy London streets offered no breath of fresh air. A Machine For Pigs is memorable for its hauntingly beautiful settings. Now, one of my complaints is that there is not really a sense of urgency. That's practically a requirement given the premise, but unlike the constant fear of having the Shadow chase you in Dark Descent, A Machine For Pigs takes its time delivering on the scares. To be sure, there are scares to be had, and there are a few jumpscares right from the very beginning. The urgency comes in bursts, mostly from being chased by the grotesque pig-men. The puzzles are mostly unnecessary (like the Sanity meter in Dark Descent, which did little more than blur the screen) and mostly frustrating. Interestingly, while I was playing, I couldn't stop thinking of Pink Floyd's video for Another Brick In The Wall. That's totally a good thing! I also couldn't shake the eeriness, the dread. The disgust, eventually, because just as I felt ultimately repulsed by Daniel, Oswald proved to surpass even Daniel's selfishness and brutality. That's why A Machine For Pigs is so good, in my opinion: the sum of its parts is an experience worth your time and careful attention. The blood splattered walls of the factory where the pigs are slaughtered take on an even more vile nature when you read Oswald's diary because his descriptions of people, often as ""swine,"" sends chills down your spine. Pigs are closest to humans, biologically speaking. And Oswald's pursuit of fortune, and of leaving a legacy which survives flesh and bone is accomplished without scruples and through ruthlessness which makes Daniel seem like a saint. His creation is the machine, and the setting of Industrial Revolution era London, with all of its distinct British cruelty, child labour, capitalism, and new technology is simply perfect to tell a story that is fundamentally about greed. And the bloody path we carve to sate it.And there are scares. Some require a bit more thinking and putting the pieces together, some require running away and hiding, some can make you yell and flinch away from the screen. It's good we don't have to gather oil for the lantern (it runs on electricity now, anyway) or that we need to gather an inventory because I think in this context, it would become tedious. Instead, we can focus on the atmosphere, story, and the scares. We can get lost in the growls and squeals, the heavy, incessant labours of the machine, and simply unravel the insanity within.So is A Machine For Pigs scary, all in all? That depends on your definition of scary; it will scare you when and where it's supposed to, in a heart pounding, sweaty hands sort of way. Think of it as a rush, a wave of fear that crashes into you, whereas Dark Descent was a constant flood. Yet instead of comparison, we should enjoy A Machine For Pigs rather as its own unique, interesting, and dark vision of human nature. So I think the real question should be: is A Machine For Pigs horrifying? And the answer is absolutely. That is the point, after all. Truly, I am not a fan of horror. I was intrigued by Dark Descent because my friends wouldn't shut up about it, with good reason. Dark Descent became the game which urged me to consider some other ones, and Dark Descent quickly became my favourite horror game, with Outlast being a very close second. I've found that the genre is deeply rooted in all the sorts of sad, brutal, sick and twisted ways humans strip away their humanity (usually by trying to become more than what we are; most of the time, the sacrifices aren't worth it). This game is no exception. A Machine For Pigs is certainly deserving of sharing the same panicked breath with Dark Descent.			"

												I found A Machine for Pigs to be much more horrifying than The Dark Descent, but less terrifying. What I mean by this is that there are substantially fewer moments of white-knuckled terror than in the first Amnesia. Instead, the game is much more about creeping dread and repulsion as the story unfolds. It is a much more focused game, and I have read that the linearity and lack of interaction disappointed a lot of players. I, however, did not mind. In The Dark Descent, very little of what could be interacted with served any purpose, and removing this freedom to interact with useless objects did not bother me. The linearity did not bother me either, because the story was compelling enough to keep me wanting to progress onwards.If what you liked about the first Amnesia was primarily the moment to moment scares, I am hesitant to recommend this game to you, as you may find it disappointing. I would recommend Outlast instead, which has a laughably bad story but excellent atmosphere and scares. If you loved Amnesia due to the Poe-esque or Lovecraftian horror story behind the scares, and the repulsion as you discover what the protagonist has done, then you will most likely love this game. Personally, I found this game to be a superior experience to The Dark Descent, and this is not a statement I make lightly.			"

												I preordered this game, I was so hyped. Amnesia the Dark Decent was fantastic, I was ready for a sequel. However, this one didn't meet expectations.PROS Graphics are pretty solid and historically accurate The voice acting was good Had that 'Amnesia Feel'CONS Not scary enough. The original had you sweating. It made you want to quit every second but you had to keep going. This one didn't feel this way. The enemies here, when they spot you, just kinda run up and hit you. In the original getting killed gave you the chills. No inventory. The inventory in Amnesia 1 was a little flawed, but having none whatsoever is a mistake. This means you don't acquire any items over the course of your entire adventure. NO SANITY???? Like why? Sanity meter was one of the most popular and iconic features of Amnesia 1, and without it you can just camp in the dark forever. The lantern lasts forever. Lame Lack of interactivity with the environment. In Amnesia 1, most doors could be opened and explored to find lore or items, but here pretty much everything is glued to the map. Similarly, finding secret passages isn't fun anymore because you can just mouse over everything until your hand lights up Everything is on one straight path. Too much direction "

												Usually I'd want to describe a games setup before going into the nuts and bolts of its gameplay, but to go into any detail about the story here would pretty much have to give it all away.A machine For Pigs is the sequel to one of the scariest, most intense games in quite some time - Amnesia The Dark Descent.  Having set the tone with the first game, you would think all a sequel had to do is rehash its best elements with a new story....Well...you get a new story and setting, but they've stripped out almost everything that made the first game so superb. It was very much a cat and mouse kind of horror game - no weapons, dwindling supplies, and a mechanic where the protagonist would lose sanity if he spent too long in the presence of enemies.A Machine For Pigs does away with all of that, bar there still being no weapons and you are vulnerable to enemies. Except this time around they're not even much of a threat - I died once during the entire game....The pulse pounding setpieces are gone, except for a couple of pale imitations that last all of about 30 seconds.Its one of the least scary games I've ever played, and an exceptionally disappointing release considering how awesome its predecessor was. Its ridiculously short with a length of around 4 hours, and the enemies (which are actually pigs) look rubbish. Though its almost worth playing through just to see the electric pig they introduce near the end, that looks like it came out of Wolfenstein - I doubt it was the developers intention to be hilariously stupid, but they've done so with aplomb.Its a pity that so much of the game is non existent, because in terms of the setting it does a wonderful job of massively different environments to the first game. And it even livens up somewhat near the end, albeit at the cost of feeling like its a totally different game - one they should have pursued right from the beginning. Instead its fairly dull for most of it, with only the last 45 minutes or so being of any merit.The story is pretty average too. So: overall - no recommend, though I'd rather give it a ""meh"" rating, than have to say its outright bad. But this is Steam, and there's no flexibility, soooo.....			"

												Whether or not you will like this game depends very much on what you are looking for.This game is a polarizing one.  You will likely laud it, or hate it.  If you have to look up the word 'laud' in the dictionary, you should probably pass, (or better yet, buy the game and start the processes of understanding nuanced and subtle literature)You will probaby enjoy this game if      - you appreciate enviormental atmosphere     - you enjoy literature     - you like horror that builds more on deep issues and less on 'shock' or 'camp' gimmicks     - you like Dear Esther     - you want to support developers that are pushing the boundaries on games as a literary medium     - you enjoy a game with puzzles that feel 'real-world' and don't call attention to themselves or hinder the pace of the                  narrativeYou will probably not enjoy this game if     - you don't like not having a gun in your video games     - you don't enjoy having to do your own critical thinking to come to conclusions concening the story or how it ends     - you think it will be very similary to The Dark Descent (the game feels much closer to Dear Esther in my opinion)     - you want something with puzzles that requires you to scratch your nogging     - you want a horror game where things jump out at you oftenIn short, if you value deep narrative experiences in games, and feel familiar with literature and coming to terms with your own underlying meaning, you will find an absolutely matchless gem here.  Although narrative indie games are on the rise, this  one is still leading the pack.  If you don't value these things, or are looking for something that doesn't require you be knee deep in your mind, thoughts, beliefs and opinions, it may not suit you.  Either way, consider this tale a gothic horror tale in the traditional sense, as anyone familiar with the novels Frankenstein or Dracula could tell you, the 'horror' is less about bloodshed or constantly spooking you, and more about building a sense of dread over the whole canvas.

The storyline never felt compelling enough to push me forwards, the twists were predictable, and I never felt particularly threatened, scared or under pressure.			"

												If you've played the original Amnesia, 'Machine for Pigs' will leave you disappointed. Just about everything that can be defined as 'gameplay' was gutted from this successor, turning it into a spooky walking simulator with little to no intricate reaction with the world around your digital character. However, if you're just a simple onlooker passing by whose curiosity has been piqued by that title artwork, who's seeking an intriguing story experience of a tragic tale with weird Bioshock-esque sci-fi properties and a light spook here or there, don't hesitate to grab this game for a look-see. You'll enjoy it.Also, as one would guess, 'Machine for Pigs' uses the titular farm animal in quite the iterative way that complements the game world and its themes seamlessly, which is why it should win the nomination for ""Best Use Of A Farm Animal"" in the Steam awards. So nominate it up, folks. This award's not about quality gameplay.			"

												Without The Dark Descent's sanity mechanics, A Machine For Pigs is creepy and atmospheric, but rarely scary. I don't get the same sense of dread or terror as I did playing The Dark Descent. That said, I did still quite like the game. The environments help to emphasize the scale of the operation and the machine while also looking pretty good. It presents an intriguing story and mystery with some clever ambiguity and morbidly interesting ideas. A Machine For Pigs may not fill your expectations if you're looking for a traditional adventure or horror game, but if you play it with a mind for macabre atmosphere and story, you'll enjoy yourself.

												The original game Amnesia the Dark Descent is my favorite horror game. I was very excited when they anounced this game. When it came out however is was very dissapointed. The devs gutted mostly all of the gameplay that made the first one so great. It is mostly a walking sim. Its only four hours long max! the first one took me 24 hours to beat! Get the Dark Descent, or SOMA, but not this game.			"

												Amnesia a machine for pigsClassic amnesia: puzzles, great story and it's scary. This is not as scary as dark descent, not even close. Instead this game offer amazing story that you have to see yourself. It is scary enough to be called Amnesia, but it could be a bit scarier. The graphics are great, it makes this really fun to explore and look around. There is some harder parts in the story that you might have to try more than twice to get trough. The story is so good, all the things you will get to know while playing the game are so well done, the story is amazingly well done. You will know what I am talking about after you finnish the game... My grade for this 9/10			"

												I miss a good trailer from the store page that really encapsulates the psychological horror this game represents. The images, unfortunately, do not do justice and not the best ones were taken, to be honest.In any case, Machine for Pigs is the spiritual successor of Dark Descent. Frictional Games here only acted as the publisher while the development tasks were carried out by the company called Chinese Room. They have gathered fame recently with ""Everybody's Gone To The Rapture"", plus, not long ago they released a new edition of their first game called ""Dear Esther"".Similarly to its predecessor, this game also has a protagonist suffering from amnesia. Mandus, a wealthy businessman wakes up in his bedroom hearing the voice of his children calling him. He sets out to find them and along the way he finds notes and receives phone calls - all these explain the background story more and Mandus quickly realises that in order to find his children he must go deep. Into the horrifying depths of his mansion where a machine lies capable of doing terrible things.And this is where I go no further as everything else would be a spoiler especially mentioning the nature of our enemies. In terms of game mechanics the creators simplified the game. We still have a light source important to use in dark areas but you 1) do not become afraid in the dark resulting in hallucinations and 2) there is no need to collect oil or anything like that - the lamp shows the way all the time.So, it really is just the lantern and running and hiding but unlike Dark Descent in this game we do not get used to the dark. If the lamp is turned off we are truly in darkness. I think this makes the game more terrifying, however, regarding the encounters with enemies they are much fewer this time. It seems the emphasis was on story immersion and jumpscares were given much less importance.Sill, MfP is a great successor and if you read every note in the game carefully you might just find out how this game is connected to its prequel. I think Chinese Room did a wonderful job with the sound effects and the music of the game. The graphics may seem dated (I believe they use the same engine here) but we get to feel we are in London in 1899. If you liked Dark Descent you may get disappointed in the sequel - it all depends on what exactly you liked in the first game. I would say MfP is a lightweight version, still, it is part of the roster of great horror games.			"

												First thing's first - I don't understand the angry rant about this game. People literally drown it in pig♥♥♥♥ while other really crappy titles manage to get away. Often the reason why players hate AMFP is that they beleive it's far worse than the original Amnesia. I suggest you should consider these two as completely different games. The Chinese Room (the developer I put highest hopes on and will defend) did their thing. OK, they got rid of core Amnesia gameplay elements (lantern oil, thunderboxes), but I think they did it for the good sake of the story. For story and atmosphere are the basis for Machine For Pigs. Storytelling is just plain dark, almost pitch-black and somewhat Lovecraft-ish as it's predecessor. Game is sophisticated as it is asks global and complex existential questions. Ominous atmosphere is here allright, driven by classy frightening sound desing and music. And YES, this Amnesia is scary - not too scary, but still.. Although it's hard to terrify a Survival Horror vet like me, AAMFP did that. And this what I ♥♥♥♥in' expect from a horror game! Ain't no need to throw ♥♥♥♥ at gamer's face, more of that - no need to drop them off their seats. Freeze them on the spot so they are afraid to move a finger! That's the real horror. And here's the thing some will consider DarkDescent-blasphemy: maybe removing oil tanks, thunderboxes and difficult puzzles was necessary for this particular project, like blinding a man makes his hearing sharper. Cutting the gameplay elements allowed story and setting take the spotlight. IMHO it's better than solving riddle after riddle after riddle in similar tunnels in Penumbra: Overture. Amnesia AMFP isn't an interactive movie though - you do things besides walking. I will however admit it lacks some hard puzzles. And dying. Yeah, I dropped dead TWO (!) TIMES. Anyway, it helped me to percieve the story better. Game's not short too - if you take time and won't charge your ♥♥♥ forward you'll get your healthy 8 hours as I did. To summerize, game's great, all I've expected from the sequel. Dark Descent fans should give it a fair chance, I think. Bare bones of the franchise, huh? Hell of a skeleton then. The Chinese Room FTW.			"

												This chapter in the Amnesia series is definitely going to upset people expecting The Dark Descent 2, but if you can separate the two games you'll appreciate them both for what they are; Amazing survival horror experiences.A Machine for Pigs (AMFP) relies less on chases and monster stalking to create its tension.  That's not to say there isn't any, but much less than Dark Descent.   AMFP goes for it's horror in it's atmosphere and writing, letting your imagination paint the disturbing pictures of what our character has experienced.  Since so much of AMFP story and horror is fleshed out in reading notes it doesn't surprise me that people are giving it so much hate.  It took me 6 hours to finish the game without getting stuck too long on any ""puzzle"", so when I see people claiming to ""beat"" it under 3-4 hours it's no wonder they aren't enjoying it.  I'd wager they speed run through every area and don't bother reading any journal entries.  They're only giving themselves half the experience.Perhaps The Chinese Room should have preceded the game with the same disclaimer A Dark Descent used:  Do NOT play this game to Win.  Let yourself be immersed and enjoy the experience.   People that enjoy reading horror storytelling will enjoy AMFP, while others looking for more adrenaline pumping action may want to look to Outlast.The Chinese Room took a step in the right direction with AMFP.  While the puzzles in AMFP were simplistic compared to Dark Descent, they fit perfectly into the level design and story, and offered a degree of interaction that was completely void in Dear Esther.I highly recommend this, but with a huge disclaimer - Do not expect Dark Descent 2.

												A significant step back when compared to the Dark Descent. If you haven't played Dark Descent, do so. If you have then you will probably feel this is a let down.Removal of many features, most notable sanity and any meaningful inventory system combined with an over all dumbing down of puzzles leave this sequel an example of game Devs stripping a game of what made it good in order to apeal to the lowest denominator.Diagnosis: Casualised.

It does not encourage exploration whatsoever if you're not suppose to go somewhere the door will be locked, no inventory and infinite fuel for your latern...WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ING HELL! having to scavange for fuel was the one of the key factors of the game, forcing you to savior and cherish every ounce of light you had! The monsters in this game are NOT terrifying, the puzzles are TO ♥♥♥♥ING SIMPLE, and this game would have been fine as long as it wasnt a sequel to the brilliant AMNESIA THE DARK DESCENT! this should be called Amnesia for kids, thats how unterrifying this game is. Dont get me wrong amnesia the dar descent easily on of my favrite games of all time. But this.......this is just pitifull....Please..dont waste your money on this trash and hopefully if there is a third amnesia...it'll go back to its roots where exploration is encourgaed,the inventory are back , Laterns have fuel..... Im sorry Fictional games but if you want to make a game that we love, do it without the help of Chinese Room becuase this game is Terriable!			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a psychological thriller created as the sequel to the first game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Although the game plays somewhat like the first installment, it is actually a very different game in terms of storytelling and jump scares. Let me just say, if you are going into this game expecting the same experience as the first, you will be disappointed. A Machine for Pigs takes place in the late 1800’s after the industrial revolution, and the world has been modernized. Gone is the need for lantern oil, and tinderboxes, as your new lantern never runs out of battery power. Sanity is also apparently not an issue any longer and you won’t have to deal with any inventory screens either. The story itself is a long twisting tale of a tortured man who has done some pretty awful things. His journey to reclaim his troubled memories is a journey through the mind of a man driven to the brink of insanity from the overbearing weight of emotional loss. Determined to correct his mistakes and set everything right, he finds himself on the precipice of his own destruction. As for gameplay, the traditional Amnesia style of solving puzzles shines through as the player will need to solve many throughout the game by interacting with the environment around them. The sound is, of course, another compliment to the Amnesia series, and gives the player that same sense that they are being followed continuously by something… or someone.There are a couple chase sequences and moments where the player will be required to hide in the darkness to avoid detection, but the monsters themselves seem to be rather linear and will appear and run off in a preplanned route many times throughout the game. Most people were disappointed with the monsters as they don’t actually bust down doors and search for you like they did in the original Amnesia. Basically, if you avoid them then they will avoid you. But that does not mean it isn’t scary, the atmosphere of the game is incredibly creepy and there is barely any warning as to when a monster is in the area.My overall score for the game: 8/10. This game is worth playing for the story alone. Go into this game as ‘A Machine for Pigs’ and not ‘Amnesia.’ As a game of its own, it is great and worth checking out. But if you are looking for the same horror experience as the original Amnesia, skip this one and try out Soma.  "

												Amnesia was a hugely acclaimed hit, so this follow-up shouldn’t surprise anyone. Oddly it wasn't done by the original developers, Frictional, but it was handed off to The Chinese Room who was responsible for Dear Esther. Personally I think its nice to see how a different set of devs would take on the title but not everyone is going to be happy with the outcome. I will readily admit, I didn't enjoy this game as much and the first Amnesia and that game didn't blow me away either so there are some significant issues with this game. Most noteworthy would be in the gameplay department.  In the previous title you found yourself looking in every nook and cranny for tinder boxes to light nearby candles and fuel for your lantern. While this wasn't the most exciting thing, it allowed for you to have some kind of purpose as you explored around. As well keeping the lantern from running dry was a source of tension and added to the gameplay. In Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs they removed all resource management, your lantern will never run out and nothing can be found in the environment to aid you. The developers where likely looking to streamline your experience so as to allow for more focus on the plot and the game world but sadly this had a hugely adverse effect for me. I found that without any inventory or items you really lacked a reason to search the environment. A new room was really just a new hallway in the wax museum instead of a place to explore. That sounds harsh, but I just lost motivation to take my time and look around.  Puzzles, puzzles were a large part of the earlier title but again they were practically removed. It can be said that the puzzles in  Amnesia #1 had about the depth of Doom 1 puzzles. By this I mean you entered an area were confronted by a door (or mechanism) preventing you from proceeding, the only way to get passed was to find the key. The key was the sole collectable item in that area so it caused no brainpower besides finding it and inserting it into the door. Yes there are a couple puzzles in Amnesia that had a bit more depth but for the most part they were about on par with Math Circus. So why tone them down? Again they wanted to streamline  the game, make it more accessible and focus more on the plot. Good or bad that's mostly up to the player but since we are talking about video games here the gameplay should stand up for itself a bit, hopefully.  Is it scary? that's honestly the biggest question most people are going to have. The answer is yes, sort of. Its scary but not as tense or even jump scare happy as the other title. Its environments are definitely chilling and there are a few scary encounters but to be honest you really only have to deal with enemies 5 or 6 times throughout the game. Pretty much every time you see an enemy it’s a G-man encounter, if you haven't played half-life that’s to say that it’s a scripted event where an enemy shows up, startles you and then leaves the area. In the rare occasion where there is a patrolling enemy you can you just turn off your lantern and crouch away from him.  So why did I give this game a recommend. Well its defiantly not for everyone, but this game does have a bunch of things going for it. The environments are terrific. The early 20th century factories and mechanisms are truly creepy and an awesome setting for a game. The atmosphere as a whole is well done. Plot is given to you through letters and diary entrees left about, as well as phone calls(kinda) from a reoccurring character. I found the ending to Amnesia #1 to be a letdown, this game did a bit better with the conclusion I thought.   So if you are a fan of the first person survival horror genre or Amnesia #1 and want a more streamlined game focused on narrative. Then Amnesia  a Machine for Pigs is right for you. Otherwise you might want to consider waiting for the next game by the original devs. Either way this game is still a decent play though for $15 If you don’t like the sound of a gameplay lacking survival horror game I would strongly advise checking out Penumbra: Black Plague. Its currently only $5 on steam and is in my opinion the best fps survival horror game out there.			"

												A spiritual sequel to one of the greatest horror games, it dissapoints in quite a few key areas, improves in some, but overall delivers on the core idea of a hellish descent into madness in a very special way.The industrial hell that you explore is particularly striking, and contains moments of pure marvel and disgust.The sound design is fantastic, and had me jumping at shadows all the way through.The music is also a big highlight, and although it is used sparingly, it is particularly effective in evoking dose chills.When compared to the first game, a few things are immediately apparant: removal of the inventory, removal of resource management, and removal of the sanity meter. While I have a sneaking suspicion this may have been due to a large outcry of people 'running out' of light sources in the first game, it might have just been a design choice, who knows. But I do feel that a lot of the tension is removed along with these systems, which is damn a shame.The puzzles also suffer due to the lack of an inventory, restricted generally to an immediate component search to fix whatever machine has broken down. At no point is there any real challenge, unlike the first game which I remember had me stumped on at least a couple.The use of monsters has also been peeled back in a way. They will run by as means of scaring you initially, later on they serve more to illustrate certain story points. It is actually rather rare to be put in any direct confrontations in this game, and  even rarer that any amount of stealth or hide-and-seek is required. This is the biggest dissapointing aspect for me, as hiding from the monsters in DD was much more pants-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scary than just running away from the scripted manpig sequences.One thing I think the game improves on is mindgames. I can't be certain, but I'm pretty sure that sometimes an areas makeup, (such as doors or other props) have shifted around (then again, it could have been all in my head, but if so, you can chalk that up to the palpable atmosphere). An early revelation in the mansion is also particularly effective in putting you in the paranoid frame of mind of the protagonist Mandus. Some other unique scares or tricks the game throws at you really helps to mix it up and distinguish it from dark descent.The story is pretty interesting, and some of the notes are rather disturbing, or striking, especially with Mandus's own twisted vision of mankind. However don't expect anything spelled out for you, or for there to be some great revelation.Overall I'd say that the game is well made, if a little dissapointing. Certainly if you enjoyed Amnesia DD, Dear Esther, or even both, you'll definitely find something here. If you hated one or the other, then probably not ;)			"

												It's not exactly like The Dark Descent, for sure. But too many people evaluate A Machine for Pigs on the standard of how similar it is to its predecessor, too afraid to look at it on its own merits. Indeed, there are fewer gameplay elements, such as an infinite lamp duration, easier/fewer puzzles, and an overall lower danger level. But what AMFP has, it does spectacularly. The Chinese Room took a more story-heavy approach and crafted the world around how it's told, and it's a tale well worth hearing. The environments are beautifully constructed, the voicework fits the characters perfectly, and Jessica Curry's music is spectacular. It's like a roller coaster: just because you're not pushing the carts yourself doesn't mean it's not a enjoyable, thrilling ride.People looking for a game that will leave them petrified with fear will be more at home with The Dark Descent. But if you enjoyed the story of The Dark Descent and want to lose yourself in a tale just as gripping and harrowing, definitely give A Machine for Pigs a shot!			"

												Review of:  *Amnesia: A Machine for  Pigs*AAMFP is the sequel to The Dark Descent and tells the story of Oswald Mandus, an wealthy englishman who owns a meat processing company. He returns to Britain from a disastrous journey to Mexico. He found an orb while in Mexico, and upon touching it saw the future of the 20th century (the game is set in the year 1899), having visions of World Wars, Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, Vietnam... He kills his children on the temple steps to ""save"" them from the horror of the world. He starts seeing humanity as a disease, as filthy swine. Upon returning to London he is hit by a mysterious fever and starts having nightmares, seeing visions of a machine. With his massive wealth and the guidance of the orb he starts creating a massive device, a machine for pigs.-Gameplay:This is AMFP's weak side and a big reason for it's criticism. Much of the gameplay mechanics from TDD have been stripped out. There is no more inventory nor can you observe your health, althought that the bloody red filter on your screen and blood splatters do indicate if you take damage. There is no more oil or tinderboxes; the new lanterns is infinite. This is fine, since those collectables sometimes made it feel like a scavenger hunt.    The insanity system has also been removed, althought that it was one of the core elements of TDD. This CAN be explained by the fact that Mandus is more ""sane"" than Daniel from TDD and has no nyctophobia like Daniel does, but it really was a dissapointment for me.    The environment is not interactable anymore, for the most part. You do need to interact with certain puzzle objects but other than that, everything is fixed still. I hate this one so much. Made me feel like I was playing something else. -Puzzles are also a big part of Amnesia, and I could not have finished the first game witouth the internet. AMFP's puzzles were too easy. I never felt lost and always knew what to do. None of the puzzles were challenging or memorable. It felt like I was being walked on a leash......which brings me to my other point: The monster gameplay. The new lantern (and other lights) start flickering whenever a monster is nearby; this is a bad and a good thing, mostly bad. It tells the player about the danger too well. But the bigger problem with the monsters, and PERHAPS THE WHOLE game, is that the monsters are rarely a threat. I would go on to say that atleast half of the sightings are visual or auditory. This strips away the fear when you know that they probs wont come for you anyway. I also never needed to hide. I did not feel hunted like I did in TDD, with the exception of the Tesla Pig. Most of the monster chases were just quick sprints to the next door and did not feel threathening at all. THIS is a shame.BUT here are the good parts of this game:-The story: This is where AMFP really shines; the story is far more bigger than epic than TDD's, you really feel like more lives are on the line this time. MUCH more. Are humans just garbage, swine, inbred hogs? It makes you think. The 20th century was arguably the bloodiest century so far, the Machine wanted to save the world with blood now before the insanity of the 20th century. It also has a few links to TDD, like another Orb and the body of the Grunt, aswell as the major part of Alexander's vitae. The story is simply great: it might be a bit hard to understand if you don't pay attention, so be careful not to stray.-The level design: Another strong point; TDD's main fault was it's lack of different and interesting scenery (for the most part), and this is where AMFP really stepped up the game. The levels all feel different and have nicr graphics and designs. My favourite ones are the last ones.-Music and voice acting: Not saying that TDD's acting was bad: far from it; but Mandus' and the Machine's voices are incredible. Go search some recordings on YouTube, they are incredible.    Again, not saying TDD had bad music, it was awesome, but AMFP's music is simply pure gold. Search for the OST on YouTube, you wont be dissapointed.*****Conclusion*****AMFP does not feel like an Amnesia sequel, and that's the main fault of it. If it would not be needed to compare to TDD, a far superior game, it would be just great. But the lack of gameplay and wasted monsters make it alot less scary; you never need to hide or feel like hunted. The last 45 min of gameplay is absolutely terrifying, my hands were shaking and heart pounding, but I should've felt like that the whole game. I did not.     BUT Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a great game. I would not say it is worth 20 euros, but if you do decide to buy it, you wont be left dissapointed, especially if you are new to Amnesia.			"

												I'll start this recommendation by plainly saying that this is one of my favorite games of all time. Now, into the review. This is a first person linear horror game made by the Chinese Room, and their signatures are all over this game. The game is beautifully written, every document fascinating, every bit of dialogue engaging. This game masters immersion, and it simply makes sense. This is not a leap at you horror, it is not jumpscare based, it is not overly gorey (not at first anyway), and it is not overly forward with it's horror. It is more conceptual, and a good amount of the horror is lost to all those who rush through the game without reading the documents. This game makes me think of a lot of eastern horror games, less am onster in your face and more one breathing down your throat, as if the very world was against you. The factory is well crafted, the story is superb, the atmosphere coats you like a blanket and tries to suffocate you in fear. I honestly found this game more scary than A:TTD, and I even played through a second time to find stuff I did not see before. I do admit, this game is not without it's flaws.  The puzzles of A:TDD are heavily reduced. The puzzles here are straightforward without a lot of wandering about. To me this is great. It makes it a little closer to an interactive novel, but the puzzles of A:TDD mostly just took me out of the game. A:TDD was closer to those old point and click games where you used everything against everything else and got a bit frustrated, removing all the horror. This game has nothing of that, so the fear is able to sink in. It is very ""Chinese Room""-y to focus less on the gameplay and more on the story aspects (the world and whatnot). For a more extensive review, here's a link.Amnesia:AMFP Review[xshadowsaurgaming.wordpress.com]All in all I love this game, but I understand the fact it has a limited audience. If you enjoy horror, great story telling, the chinese room, or you're even mildly interested and willing to explore I'd say pick it up. I don't regret gettting it and I'm certain I'm far from done with it.			"

												Although different in many ways from the original Amnesia: The Dark Descent, I find that the game stays true to its cause, fulfilling its purpose in delivering a dark, original and interesting story. At the same time, the horror element is somewhat less agravating than in the original installment, which might turn some of the original fans away. I for one was slighty disappointed at first, but steadily got to love the game for its uniqueness.       The gameplay is biased towards telling a story, rather than scare the player as was the case with the first game. Thus, there are fewer environmental interractions (aka clicking on objects) and the grueling randomness of the monsters in the first game were replaced with scripted and, most times, less difficult encounters. Furthermore, the overall time needed to finish the game is somewhere at half of the original Amnesia (not taking into account exploring and searching for certain lore items like letters and notes).       In conclusion, I can recommend Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs to most players looking for a solid story, intertwined with decent gameplay mechanics as well as a dark and gruesome, yet exceptional envinronment design.

												The more you play it the more you question the game designing of ""scary"" games. What are you afraid of ? The dark ? You have a lantern and a friendly blue fog. The monsters ? What monsters ? I am not kidding, they litteraly ignore you even when you run in front of them. Perhaps I just got lucky, they were eight or so anyway. The first opus left you vulnerable, this one just leaves you alone. What else is there, an unnecessary complicated story, a linear path, no items at all, infinite oil and a short lifetime, a stupid, stupid part that makes you pitty the ennemies. The environment looks great though, and some spooky scripted tricks are welcome.In conclusion, this game fails at what it was supposed to accomplish.			"

												I got 'AMfP' as part of an Amnesia bundle for pretty cheap during a sale and went into it ahead of time knowing about the lukewarm critical reception. Maybe if I had paid full price during its initial release with high expectations I would have been let down but in the end I thought it was a good game.To be sure, it's not as good as the first one. With the first game I actually had to stop at various points because I was too nervous to progress into a darkened area. There's only one scene in this one where I felt close to that level of scared. This game simply isn't as horrifying this time around. It's also a considerably shorter, more streamlined experience -- there's less interactivity, puzzles, etc. Another thing that disappoints me was the lack of a custom story option. The original Amnesia has hours and hours of replay value that this does not because of it. The game is different enough than the original that there's potential for a number of custom stories using the elements present here. On the positive side, the game is still an effective and atmospheric experience. I would stay the story is stronger this time around. The protagonist Oswald Mandus plays a much bigger part in his own story than Daniel did in the first one and as such his his character arc is more rewarding in my opinion. The game's world is beautiful and haunting to look at; I stopped several times just to take in the scenery. I normally don't talk about music in games but Jessica Curry's soundtrack really adds to the story. The developers had the unenviable task of following up 'The Dark Descent' and to their credit they took a risk as opposed to simply copying the formula of the original. Not all of it works but I still have to applaud their efforts.If you're all hesitant I would wait until this is on sale but I do recommend you try it out at least once.			"

												This is one of my favorite horror games. It also contains one of my favorite stories featured in a video game. It's deep, thought-provoking, and emotional. The atmosphere is very thick and highly detailed. I found the game to be pretty scary because of what was suggested in the atmosphere and small details rather than monster encounters. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a polarizing game because of the overwhelming sucess of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. From what I understand, soem of the dislike towards AMFP is rooted in the difference in core gamplay between the two. I think it's important to ackowledge that AMFP and TDD had different developers, and were created by different groups of people. The developers of TDD took a game titled ""Amnesia"" in one direction, while The Chinese Room, developers of AMFP, took it the other.I love the game for everything I've explained it to be in this review. The other ~half~ who dislike it have thoroughly shared their opinion in other reviews. I think, in deciding whether or not to buy AMFP, the most pressing question should be ""which side sounds more like ME?""			"

												I'm not a fan of A Machine for Pigs, mainly because it's so far from the original. It's not near as scary, and the monsters just act stupid. A Machine for Pigs tells a pretty decent story, but it tells it in a bad way. This should have not been an Amnesia title. I think it would have done great as a stand alone release. I think the namesake was the reason so many people did not like it. It had high hopes to live up to, but did not even come close. Through all that it's still a good game to play, but I recommend grabbing it on sale. Just don't expect the horror fest that the first Amnesia was, this is more  of a creepy walking simulator than anything.			"

												I'll just get right to it.Positives:-The visuals of the game is very beautiful, and much more interesting to look at than TDD.-Story is interesting in it's own way, with the theme of questioning humanity itself and it's morals.-Soundtrack and voice acting is superbUnfortunately, there is alot more negatives than positives to this game:-Taking this game as an Amnesia sequel, TDD's core features (insanity meter, inventory, importance of light, danger music) is stripped from the game, making it very underwhelming and easy-AI wasn't very impressive (Sneaking was easy)-Monster encounters are at a minimum, there is many scripted events, yet the events aren't very impacting-In my opinion, the story is somewhat hamfisted (heh, ham)-Removal of custom story-I would claim that it's way less scary than TDD due to it's removal of all things that made the first game scary-and finally, it's way too short for it's price. (First playthough 6hrs, second 4hrs)Being an Amnesia sequel (as well as being a huge fan of TDD) this was a bit of a disappointment. I would recommend buying this for it's story, but at a discounted price. Even if 'Amnesia' was removed from the title (and my huge facination with pigs) I wouldn't consider recommending it overall.

They have, quite literally, removed all of the gaming mechanics present in the first game and provide an on-rails, spookless, soulless experience that wouldn't scare your grandmother. No more hiding, no chance of death unless you literally feed yourself to the half-dozen antagonists, you have a permanent flashlight and no sanity mechanic from staying in the dark.

												Not as great as it's predecessor but Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs has its moments. The story is not that fascinating but the 1899 London setting makes up for it. The enemies are kind of uninspired yet there are times when the game builds up so much tension that they can scare the living Jesus out of you. It was disappointing to see that you can't interact with anything, and the game itself is rather short. Still this game is not bad and definitely has that Amnesia atmosphere.			"

												I am enjoying this game fairly well. So far, a nice dark atmosphere with chilling random events in the background. (Typical Amnesia) I only have three problems with this game that don't quite put it at the same level as ""The Dark Descent"" The game has many locked doors which takes away the adventure aspect. You can't pick up small objects and randomly throw them. There also is not an insanity meter. Even in these negatives, the story line is phenomenal so far. It makes me want to dive deeper and deeper. So far, in the first hour of game play, this is a really enjoyable sequel to ""The Dark Descent			"

												I have a confession to make. I never finished the first Amnesia. It's more accurate to say that, according to Steam, I have played 28 minutes of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. That includes times spent setting up options in the menu. So in reality, I've gotten far enough that the first strong gust of wind howled through a corridor before I quit. I'd like to say that's because I didn't like the controls. Admittedly, I do prefer gamepads to mouse and keyboard, but the atmospheric elements of Amnesia: TDD kinda scared me. Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs recently went on sale for 66% off on Steam, so I decided to roll the dice. It does, for the record, support gamepads. As far as the technical aspects of the game, Frictional teamed with The Chinese Room, creators of Dear Esther (developer of 2008's popular First Person Walking Simulator Dear Esther). It's got a fairly hefty options menu, and the game looks gorgeous (when you can see it).  It ran well on my GTX770, and once I'd nailed down a particularly nasty case of screen tearing (disable in-game Vsync, both regular and adaptive, and enable it in the Nvidia Control Panel or your ATI equivalent), the game ran at a smooth 60 FPS with no screen tearing. The gamepad controls were responsive and simple to learn, and even the object manipulation mechanic of the first game translated well from mouse to thumbsticks. This is not an overly complex game, though. It's pedigree shows through, as many sources have said that this game is far simpler in its gameplay mechanics than the previous Amnesia title. Your lantern has unlimited oil. There are no items to pick up, no laudanum to keep you sane. Your character is obviously far more mentally stable, seeing as the monsters in this game doesn't affect your ability to cope with the world around you. Where A Machine For Pigs really shines is its storytelling. You wake up in a caged bedroom of a properly posh Victorian mansion, and bits of story are slowly fed to you throughout your descent (a dark one!) into the heart of a Steampunk monstrosity of brass tubes, gears, pistons, and oh-so-many nauseating swine carcasses. Like many dark horror stories, there are aspects that fall apart if you look at it too closely, but the game wraps up before most people have time to question those aspects. The game runs about 4 to 4 and a half hours, but that's a tight 4 and a half hours, with very few wasted moments, and a hectic (if overly obviously scripted) sequence later in the game where the monsters really come into play. Overall, it's dripping (quite literally at times) with atmosphereIs it worth the usual $20 price tag? That's all going to depend on whether you're a big horror buff. Personally, I'm not. That I only paid < $7 for the game, goes a long way to my personal valuation. I feel I got my money's worth, even though it didn't quite hit that “dollar-per-hour” magic mark. If you're a fan of horror, I recommend this at a higher price than I paid, especially if you like your horror to come from the storytelling as much as the gameplay.			"

The story is not all that bad really but really thats all there is because like I mentioned there isn't much thats makes the game feel creepy. There was no oil and tinderboxes which was a bummer because it was one of the coolest things from the original. The graphics were pretty cool but the game itself didn't run well, I thought it might get fixed at some point but never did and this was another big issue for me.

												I'm sad this game even bears the Amnesia name. This game was a mix of missed opportunities and pretentious storytelling, made me sick to my stomach. They had the audacity to put in one of the scariest monsters from amnesia and turn it into a minor inconvenience, at best. The water monster was put in during a late chapter for a grand total of 30 seconds, just long enough for you to say ""FINALLY, SOMETHING FRIGHTENING"" then have it taken away and never looked at again. I shed a tear knowing what this game COULD have been if the Chinese Room didn't get their hands on it. I guess the only good thing that Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs gave us was freeing up Frictional's development time for SOMA.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is quite the game; first off, the graphics are utterly beautiful. It's quite obvious that a lot went into the multiple environments and the dark levels. It looks brilliant and it feels great, you can stand there and soak up all the detail in each individual level. The story is utterly brilliant, it’s dark and somewhat surprising, if this game would to be made into a book, and it would be a damn good one. It’s immersive (the story) and it’s one of the kind of stories that don’t really start from ‘A’ to ‘B’ but it’s one of those stories where you’re caught somewhere between ‘A’ and ‘B’ and you pick it up along the way. It may seem like a good game, right? Well…On the downside, most of us were expecting a scare right? Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs sadly falls short of that department. The A.I aren’t as scary as the one’s in the first, they don’t seem to be ‘hunting’ you, most of the time they’re just shuffling along past you looking pretty for the spotlight. On that note, the monsters look brilliant, but personally are a little stupid. Most of the interactive environment as we see in Amnesia: The Dark Descent is taken away so we’re given more of an immersive experience (This has its upsides and downsides.) Also, this makes the game more of a ‘rail’ where you are lead most of the way to the end and it’s not as tempting to go find hidden items/secrets because there's really nothing to find, besides the main path. Also, the Inventory is taken away as well as the first Amnesia’s famous Sanity Bar, which on the plus side leaves us with fewer things to worry about, but sort of takes away the risk of it all.Don’t get me wrong, the game is fantastic in story, and graphics, but falls woefully short in what most of us came to this game for: the fear. Personally, if this game were to have ‘Amnesia’ taken out of the title, and only left with ‘A Machine for Pigs’ as a stand-alone game. Then this game would be very unique and fantastic, but as a sequel to the first Amnesia, it doesn’t do so well.Personal Gaming Score: 6/10Highly recommend this game for those wanting an immersive story/environment or those looking for a great game to play, but a bit of a disappointment for those looking for a scary game or came here from the first game.

												For the record I played about 3 to 4 hours of this game (offline mode).I was a big fan of the Penumbra Series, and of the first Amnesia. I was amazed at the amount of ineractivity, even if there was no reason for it. I loved the puzzles, and the fact that sometimes the sulotion was as simple and as frustrating as smashing open a power box with a brick I found on the floor.There was a definite story improvement as the Penumbra series went on, and I was also impressed with Amnesias storytelling, and effects on the player and their mental health.However, A Machine For Pigs lost me. Most of the world was non-interactive, i never had to move things out of the way to look behind them, the puzzles just seemed to be, can you get this simple thing. There was no patterns that I had to solve, or mental puzzles that had to be thought out, or even things that I could get lucky on, it just all seemed to mainstream simple to me. The effects on the players mental health etc only took place for short bursts, and mostly just made you unable to move. Felt much more like a classic movie horror, then an actually scary puzzle game.Don't get me wrong here, if you let yourself be scared, you still will be.It did have some of the good elements, like not quite letting you see the scary thing on the other side of that wall, and the audio (recommend headphones) was as always terrifying. However the other missing elements stopped me from being fully emersed in the game.I tried going back to the game a few times, hoping that the old style would return after the introduction section, but I am sad to say that it didn't.I will continue to admire the original author for what he created before, but I can't see myself buying the next game if this is the direction it is taking.I will however, highly recommend all the previous titles, I even bought copies of a few for friends.And to be direct, i played the first amnesia for free, then bought it because it was worth the money. Then I bought Penumbra.If the author is taking feedback, here are my suggestions:1. Return to interactivity, make the objects in the world pick-upable, they can move, and can be pushed by other objects, but not picked up.2. make the puzzles hard again, I know you can make more money by creating simplistic puzzles for the common player, but it just defeats the game.3. Bring back the horror, instead of having ""horror"" cut scenes, bring back the character getting scared of things even if they have seen them before, There also needs be other options for ""would you reccomend this game"" I Can't decide, I am saying no though, purely compared to the previous games.However I would also recommend this game, it was worth playing, it just wasn't compared to the previous games.I will try to finish this game if I can, one last time, before I give up on it.

												I can see why people reacted so badly to this game, though I did still enjoy it. I finished it pretty quickly and felt that it didn't quite fit in with what made the original Amnesia so great, though I find it hard to describe quite what this was. In terms of atmosphere, the original game was more subtle and the setting made the player feel isolated, which really added to the feeling of helplessness that made it so much scarier. The monsters and plot of this game are more ridiclous and far-fetched, which makes it feel rushed. I did appreciate the originality of it though.I think the worst aspect of the game was the lack of challenge or gripping gameplay; this is why I think that The Chinese Room were not the right developers for it, as they're best known for walking simulators which Amnesia should never have been.

												Started off very strong. Great atmosphere, kept me on edge everytime I opened a door or rounded a corner. Plus, those claustrophobic pathways in the house terrified me. After a while, it started to lose me. I get that the story was meant to be a commentary on what was to come in the 20th century, and using the pigs as part of the metaphor, but I don't feel like that was handled very well until the very end. Got it on sale, and it did provide some entertainment, but I probably wouldn't buy it unless it was on sale, especially if you want a game like the previous Amnesia.TL;DR: It was aight, kinda disappointed me. But it had a teleporting, electric pig. 10/10			"

												So, going into this game I was expecting something just as great, if not greater than The Dark Descent, however going into it I ended up feeling it to be not just not quite as scary as The dark descent, but also a huge lot easier.. In this game, unlike the dark descent, you don't have to be sparesome with fuel for the lantern, nor do what you can to keep sane, there's no such thing really as picking items up and keeping them in your inventory, such as keys you'd find, pick up and with them unlock doors to progress, in this game, where you need to go is already open... not to mention, you can't really sidetrack because if you try, you'll find that all the doors you're not supposed to go through, will be locked.. I was expecting greatness from this game, being the sequel to the dark descent if I'm not entirely mistaken, but after playing through it, I must say it fell short... the game felt short, was not quite as scary, even if sometimes very eerie in a way, but that's more around me not being a huge fan of steaming-engine sounds basically :) To sum it up, this game feels like a reply to people who have played The Dark Descent, complaining about it being ""too hard"" or ""too obscure"".. it feels like the game is made as a very much easier version than it's prequel.. Things I felt whilst playing the game, which kept coming back for several reasons is mainly disappointment, honestly... the game could've been so much more if it only kept some of the core elements of the dark descent, such as an inventory, keys/other ""ulocking"" items, fuel for the light source, whichever kind you'd like, and a health+sanity tracker etc. Unlike the dark descent this game felt very linear, never really branched off where you could pick where to go, what to get first of the x number of items you needed to progress etc.. If you're looking for a good horror game, or have played the dark descent, and are thinking about getting this one aswell, I'd say you'd be better off getting/sticking to Amnesia: The Dark Descent and leave this one be, since it's more a dissapointment in comparison to TDD, than it is enjoyable in and off of itself.. Sadly that's how I'm going to have to lable this game.			"

												Well, here we go again with that eternal question:  Scariest video game EVER?  Hmmm...   It certainly has a rival for the scariest SOUNDTRACK for a game ever (the load screens alone filled me with more dread than most so-called ""horror"" games)!  And it's definitely in the running for the most ""sinister"" game ever (my much-beloved Silent Hill series being the closest competitors herein).     But more than anything, I would say this possibly emerges as the single most ""oppressive"" video game ever.  Put it this way:  If you're in any way claustrophobic and/or unnerved by the near-constant humming, banging, clanging, hissing and clattering of machinery...then you may be in for a somewhat stressful experience.  And if you in any way harbour a phobia of PIGS, then suffice it to say you're SCREWED.  Even the squeaky doors grunt like pigs when you open them.  This game sets up a near-relentless atmosphere of being trapped in a nightmare you can't escape, at least as well as any game before it, and possibly then some.  I personally found I had to muster a certain amount of ""courage"" up just to commit to a session of gameplay.  Let's just say you gotta be in ""the mood""...     A further warning though:  For those who vastly prefer busy ""gameplay"" elements over story, this may not be the game for you.  This one is almost ALL about story, though evidently not as much as The Chinese Room's previous is-it-or-isn't-it-a-game experience, Dear Esther.  Sure, there's a bit of (not-TOO-challenging) machinery-based puzzle-solving, and a few scenes where you'll be running for your dear life not even knowing what the hell is chasing you (but daring not to look back, at any cost!)...yet the JOURNEY is what this game is all about, just as Esther was...just with a little more action along the way.  All in all though, anyone who got anything out of Esther, and not to mention the first Amnesia, is unlikely to be disappointed by this overly successful mating of its two spiritual predecessors.(An afterthought:  Should I be concerned about the degree to which I sympathised with the game's more, erm, ""anti-social"" themes?  I'm not even sure I entirely agree with the protagonist's last-ditch attempts to ""redeem"" himself in the last few chapters.  ""Kill them, my little piggies!  KILL THEM ALL!!"")Verdict: 9.5/10.			"

												If you're looking for more of what made the first Amnesia so good, you'll probably be let down. This one takes things in a very different direction and dials back the scares and puzzles in favour of sheer atmosphere. It still can be unsettling in parts if you let yourself get sucked into it, and has excellent writing and sound design that really make it memorable. More a very creepy playable horror story and less an outright horror game, you'll enjoy it if you like more emphasis on enviromental horror than the threat of monsters. Experimental and worth experiencing, but not for everyone.			"

												Ater playing and thoroughly enjoying ""Amnesia: The Dark Decent"" I was delighted to hear that there was going to be a sequel (in spirit). The atmosphere is quickly set by the story introduction, but sadly it couldn't keep that atmosphere all the way through. The flair of Amnesia is the feeling that you can't fight whatever is after you, sneaking around and hiding are your only way to survive. In Machine for Pigs this mechanic is less pronounced. I felt like the enemies weren't that treatening, I felt like I could run, like I could beat them. This is notthe feeling that creates terror (something that I expect from a game in the horror genre). Overall I wouldn't recommend Machine for Pigs.			"

												It was honestly pretty bad, especially if compared to the first one. For starters, it was a rather short game especially being the same $20 price as the first Amnesia game, which consited of much more playtime. The storyline was father boring and consited of a very predictable plot twist towards the end. Enemy encouters were hard to come by and usually lasted only a couple seconds along with being really easy to avoid. They removed the inventory, sanity feature, oil, tinderboxes, as well as the ability to interact with items in the environment. From other reviews read along with conversations in forums it appears the game also consits of capability issues making it hard for some people to even be able to play the game. If you are someone looking to purchase this game just buy the first one, Amnesia: The Dark Descent. And if you already bought it and beat it you're better of just downloading custom stories which are free and very easy to install.			"

It lacks the atmosphere and great monster design that made TDD great. It's not that bad, but The Chinese Room really ♥♥♥♥ed up on this one. Writing and premise is kind of hackneyed and the atmosphere is nonexistant. I remember seeing the first monster in TDD and thinking, ""Man that looks ♥♥♥♥ed up, I wonder what that is."" In AMFP, however, I didn't feel creeped out and when I saw my first monster it was a three foot tall pig man whom I got a very clear glimpse of and felt cheated by a mere 30 min. into the game.

												I just completed A Machine for Pigs and all I have to say is that I am disappointed. It is a good horror game overall and the concept is interesting. The story is very messed up, but comparing this to The Dark Descent feels like a bit of an insult. The TAB inventory is gone, your lantern doesn't need any sort of resource to work, so you can just use it all the time. It flashes sometimes in an attempt to scare you, but failed for me. Survival elements are pretty much gone! You have about 5 encounters with enemies throughout the game, but that isn't exactly a negative thing...I was shocked with how linear this game felt - the puzzles were too easy, and the atmosphere isn't even half good as the previous game. It's also a very short game taking me 3.5 hours to beat (not speedrunned). As I was saying, linear is the best I can describe A Machine for Pigs. You can't pick up / grab most of the objects to have some fun like you could in the previous game. When you do, you can be almost sure that said object will be used for a less-than-challenging puzzle.Jessica Curry did a good job on composing the soundtrack. It is actually well-executed but not as panic-inducing or creepy as TDD. The concept art is great and the looks are pretty much like The Dark Descent. Not many graphical improvements are seen but it's still a good looking game.The verdict: Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a good horror game, but not *that* good compared to the first Amnesia. To be honest, I was only scared about twice through the whole game, and I am a coward Nemesis in what comes to horror. It's a bit overpriced for a four hour experience, and I consider this a slightly wasted potential, because story-wise, it is better than the first one. If you're interested in it, wait until it goes on sale. After all, I still had a great time exploring 1899's London and what lies beneath it! Come here piggy, piggy!Too long, didn't read?

												As a huge fan of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, I had very high expectations for this game.Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs is a disturbing and distressing entry into the Amnesia universe. The story focuses on Mandus, a wealthy industrialist from the late 19th century who wakes up with, well, Amnesia. His intention is to find his children who are no where to be found.The atmosphere in Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs (AMFP) is always spooky and unsettling. There is never a moment where you don't apprehend something scary happening. I suppose this could be argued to be a disadvantage. The environments are both visually good looking and interesting and always kept me staring at things.I personally believe that AMFP does not live up to Amnesia: The Dark Descent(TDD). Although AMFP kept me on my toes for most of the game, I feel that there are some integral things missing. Those which made TDD a truly brilliant horror game.First of all, the monsters. Probably the most important element in a horror game, the monsters are the beings which make you fear every door opening and puzzle completion. The monsters in AMFP were not terribly frightening as those in TDD. There is something about human form monsters being scarier than animal form monsters, in the sense that I suppose we can relate to human form monsters, rather than animal form. By human form I mean stand up straight on two legs, like the monsters in TDD. The monsters in TDD are horrific because of their disfigured bodies, especially The Grunt. As for the telsa pig...well... I found it to be a bit silly. ""You can look, but you can't touch"" - If you know what this is, then you know what is coming next... Interaction. An important concept from TDD. But, it was completely removed in AMFP, apart from a few essential things required to progress through the story. This was... dissapointing. I loved the aspect in TDD. Picking up books and looking at them made the game even more immersive. The fact that this is not present in AMFP seems a bit...lazy. Yes I said it. The Chinese Room were very aware that this was an important concept in TDD and yet failed to implement it properly in AMFP.Another important point that may seem trivial to some, is the absence of ""Danger close monster music"". The monster music in TDD was brilliantly composed. The truly chilling and terrifying music, that played when a monster was near, rang in my mind after playing TDD. I think that it would have been an excellent addition to AMFP if this was implemented. Although, when a monster is near in AMFP, the absence of music is still fairly scary. Also...the flickering lamp concept. Just seems like it ruins the point of a horror game, being warned that something scary is approaching.OK, rant over.Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a fantastic game, don't get me wrong. It just seems like it could be better. It is a very disturbing game that focuses on a distrurbing and strong story.If you enjoyed Amnesia: The Dark Descent, then you may be a little disappointed by AMFP, but none the less, you will enjoy this game for what there is. So try to avoid comparing if to TDD because the truth is that it is not as good, but it is still enjoyable.			"

												Amnesia A Machine for Pigs isn't the sequel I was expecting. The Dark Descent filled me with horrors and left me with many sleepless nights. It was and still is in my opinion, the best horror game ever made. Amnesia A Machine for Pigs placed me in the shoes of the wealthy Oswald Mandus, another Amnesiac like Daniel. Like its predocessor, the game successfully builds tension unlike any other. I was terrifyed as I opened any door for fear of what lurked on the other side. The story surpasses The Dark Descent's, and the game has one of the best soundtracks I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. The Sanity Meter is gone, which saddened me, and I no longer had to scavenge for Landanum and Oil for my lantern. And then there's the monsters. I won't spoil anything, but when I did encounter them, even though they are terrifying, the soundtrack didn't distort and the screen didn't blurr, which was one of my favourite things about the original. Even though the game was stripped of these mechanics, Amnesia A Machine for Pigs was still an inticing and thoroughly engrossing experience. I highly reccomend it to fans of the original and horror fans in genreal. Amnesia A Machine for Pigs isn't the kind of horror you may be expecting, but it's a welcome change that stands out from many other horror games, and it has and will stick with me for a long time.

												I must admit, I had the highest expectations for this game. Since it was labelled as the sequel to the brilliant (and bloody scary) Amnesia TDD. However, this was anything but a sequel to me.With the dark descent, the sanity mechanic was a key factor in maintaining fear, as it would put you under more and more pressure, forcing you to be resourceful and managing the use of the lantern to avoid the inevitable. However, in machine for pigs, the lantern is still there but sanity is gone, and the lantern never even runs out. This causes you to feel secure as you don't have to think about the lantern ever running out, let alone even needing to use it (most areas were adequately lit). The dark descent also had a brilliant way of making you scared of nothing. Creepy sounds, unnerving ambience and groaning monsters made you believe that you were under attack, even though you weren't. Machine for pigs didn't have nearly as much of this as TDD, and at times I barely felt scared, let alone unnerved or tensioned.The dark descent was critiscised for it's linear maps and somewhat weak storyline, which was understandable and a good story does help in a game like this. Even though this is fixed with machine for pigs, I never took the time to notice since the game wants you to focus on it's supposedly ""disturbing"" and ""interesting"" dialogue. For christ's sake, if I was at least unnerved by the atmosphere then I might have wanted to realise what was going on. No wonder this game has been said to be a ""walking simulator"". I mean, if you want one of those then get a treadmill.The story was alright at best, since the vast amount of text and pitiful amount of gameplay was distracting. It's ironic that the previous little issues in the dark descent that distracted you from the horror are the ones that have been fixed, and make it worse. Yes, the story is better than the dark descent, but I was expecting a horror game. Something branded with the title ""Amnesia"" suggests that it will be scary. The addition of this game has done nothing but ruin the name.I completed this game in roughly 4 hours, which was not long by any means. The odd part is that it felt as if I was flying by. The dark descent was scary, and this would often make you stop and take a break (and a poo). I was trying to progress into the game and trying to find some scares, and before I could it was over. Then I realised, why is this game so utterly underwhelming? I read up and found out that it wasn't made by frictional games, it was made by the chinese room. There's the problem. They only know how to make these walking simulators (dear esther), so it would be obvious that they would have incorporated some aspects into machine for pigs. This does show however, that it was the worst idea ever and they should have actually tried making it scary, instead of being like glue and not adapting to the given task.My final words are, just buy the dark descent if you haven't already and play some custom stories. Tenebris lake, The great work and Subconscious trials are all better than this game, and are all made by a couple of guys with no budget.			"

												It's sort of a mixed bag.The intent of the game was to move away from the puzzles and resource management so it could focus on just the horror, but these aspects were part of what made the original so terrifying. Without the need to keep an eye out for important items, we aren't paying close attention when a monster sneaks up on us. The dark isn't as scary if we don't have to fear running out of oil/tinder boxes. There is also too few monster encounters, that being less than one per hour.Still, I found myself enjoying this game because of the scary atmosphere and a great narrative. The environment is just dripping with life and really feels evil. I liked the Dark Descent a lot more, but Machine For Pigs is still worth a play-through given how few games are in this genre.			"

												Welcome to another Amnesia and his own world. Welcome to his authentic world. Shorter than his predecessor, Amnesia : A machine for pigs stay on his strange and fascinating world. As he had use to do, the author didn't forget to put his scary atmosphere ! It's really stressful, scary, etc. You will not disappointed if you want to have some ""jumps"" and scream as a litlle girl...This game have a strange history, really strange... but it's why it's authentic. It's fascinating. You will love it.I loved it.			"

												Although that I felt the game was short, I enjoyed it. The storyline was excellent and there were times where I felt spooked. There are a few “features”, such as the insanity, that were not in this Amnesia that sort of made it feel as if the game was lacking something. The game wasn’t very difficult and I played through it in about 7 hour’s game time. If you are looking for a game that will last, I do not believe this game is for you. However, if you want a game that is a thriller type and you love playing a game for the story, I would definitely recommend checking it out!			"

												Combine Dear Esther and Amnesia: TDD and get A Machine for Pigs.  It is a little more than a walking simulator.  The atmosphere is not as spooky as I remember TDD being.  Unfortunately the game stutters a lot, though it is still worth a quick play through.One thing I found out is that a pig corpse will prevent a gigantic truck from backing up.  Who would have thought?  "

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs — удивительный проект этого года. Новый ""хоррор"" делали неординарные ребята из The Chinese Room. Это сразу дает нам понять, что перед нами игра в которой придется напрячь извилины. Нам не дадут все пережеванное на серебряной ложечке как это делают в дешевых сериалах. Нас поставят перед определенными фактами, после которых вы будете задавать вопрос: Что произошло? Когда произошло? Кто он? А почему так? В конце концов, было ли это вообще? А игра вам сухо будет отвечать: Думай. Смотри и думай. 1899 года, канун новой эры, промышленный век. Как и в предыдущей части игры, наш протагонист просыпается и естественно ничего не помнит. А что нам нужно вспомнить? Лучше узнать самому. Из первых рук.Интерактивность в игре пропала практически полностью. Конечно будут дикие индивидуумы которые забракуют игру лишь по этому поводу. Не обращайте внимание. Так же вас может насторожить частые претензии на отсутствие такого обширного понятие как ""страх"". Есть ли он? Определенно да! Можно сказать ""Машина для Свиней"" страшнее своего предшественника. Если первая часть нас пугала на достаточно примитивном животном уровне - неожиданном появлении жуткого гуманоида из темного угла. Что согласитесь, уже глупо.  То вторая часть пугает своей историей которая может сравнить с романами самого Стивена Кинга. Проходите в полной темноте, не для примитивного страха, а для определенной атмосферы. Видите в записках Имя? Дату? Событие? Сразу идите в интернет. Читайте. Это только вам в плюс, это дополнит мозаику сюжета. Не забывайте про картины, они хоть и могут повторяться, но все они весят на правильно месте. Дерзайте. 5/5 — Отлично! P.S Если вы встретите человека, который сравнивает A Machine for Pigs и Outlast. Бегите! Этот человек думает не тем местом.			"

												You know, I play dozens of games, I play a lot of horror games but I´d never expect that a game would scare me as AmnesiaThe dynamic of this game mixed up with the essence of both psychologically and visual horror just like footsteps in the house or (more or less) things that may sound like voices make you feel creepy as hell, also the way of the dark rooms and hiding places would make you feel mad. Later on in this game when you have to run away from the pigmans you will get a feeling you never had especially when you are in a room with them just hiding in a kind of locker or wardrobe, the adrenalin will flash you.The Amnesia series is not an experiment in how games can be scary, it’s an exemplification!This game is awesome nothing more to say about it (10/10)			"

												Contrary to the popular opinion, I think this game was good. It might not be on the level of it's predecessor (Amnesia: The dark descent (TDD) ), but it sure had incredibly good athmosphere, was scary, and had a good story behind it, even if the link to the story of TDD seemed a bit forced in.The fact that some of the encounters with the ""monsters"" in this game were not actually dangerous to the in-game character wasn't a big downer, since you wouldn't know which encounters were actually dangerous. The puzzles in this game were far less ""putzzling"" than those in TDD, though.All in all there are thigs that they could have done better, but this game is worth getting anyway.			"

												As someone else said, it's ""Dear Esther"" with pigs.Embrace this as the Chinese Room walking simulator it is - you will be disappointed if you expect a traditional Amnesia sequel (that's what SOMA is for).Machine For Pigs is a very well woven story in an incredibly atmospheric game with some not-too-puzzling puzzles - well worth the few hours it takes to play through.The downside? Surprisingly for an ""Amnesia"" game, the few monsters you meet add little to the narrative and the encounters are more irritating than terrifying.			"

												The reputation A Machine for Pigs has garnered since it came out has proven that the game is, if nothing else, controversial amongst gamers (particularly fans of the first game, The Dark Descent).  For my part, I really enjoyed this one, even if it made some noticable changes to the way the game plays.In this new Amnesia, you will no longer have to manage resources.  The inventory and sanity systems are gone, and your latern never runs out of fuel (it does flicker however, when enemies are nearby, which is a good touch).  Personally, I don't mind any of these changes because it fits the style that A Machine for Pigs is going for.  It wants to be a more brooding and atmospheric game with a bigger focus on the story, and forcing you to deal with sanity and the like would be counterproductive.But despite that, there is one change I cannot understand: the limitation of physical interaction with your environment.  In the first game, you could pick up many different objects lying around the environment and toss them around.  Aside from helping with puzzle solving, it was a good way to immerse you in your surroundings.  But in A Machine for Pigs, many of the objects you see are just static, which bothers me especially because there's sometimes no good logic for which ones can or cannot be interacted with.Even so, I could recommend this game based solely on the environment and story alone.  The environment is awesome.  The rumble of an giant unearthly machine spinning to life below your feet and shaking the mansion you start the game in is something to truly behold.  The various steampunk influences on the environment are clearly visible, especially later in the game as you start going underground.  The story is also something to behold.  Compared to the first game, the story of A Machine for Pigs is probably its strongest point.  It's a twisted tale of loss, redemption, madness, and hits on some themes you probably won't see coming.  After completing the game, I couldn't get it out of my head for weeks.  It may start slow, but the final hour of the game is worth it (the entire game took me five hours or so to beat).  It's a tale of psychological horror you won't soon forget.The implications of being a sequel to what many call the scariest game ever made are big.  A Machine for Pigs may not be the Amnesia sequel many people wanted, but as a game in its own right it stands as something incredibly deep and thought-provoking.  The gameplay may not be as complicated as the original, but the story and atmosphere are both incredible experiences.  Playing the first game is not required to enjoy the story, although there are some references you won't understand if you haven't played it, and it definitely gives certain things a new context.  My final verdict: recommended for those with an open-mind and a love for complex and thought-provoking stories. "

												First off, I loved the setting, I loved the atmosphere, I agree with others the design of the pigs was not exactly a masterwork in fright nor horror, but heck, anything that shreiks, chases you, and beats you up if it catches you will do the trick. No, the art was fine. Assume that every other element of the work fails. if that promise of art and atmosphere is still enough for you, stop reading this review and go on and buy it.But once you've had your fill of the art, what's left is plot, and the plot, the thrust of the game, is totally craftless.As is standard for amnesia, you discover partway through that you're supposedly someone who's done terrible things. The problem with that is the game spends the first three quarters letting you operate under the assumption that you are not that person, and developing an in-universe identity who's done nothing but try to protect his children. So, when the game tells you that you did something baffling and awful and there is blood on your hands, that you built a hell machine and oiled it with the blood of men, yes you, the person who probably baught this game because you were attracted to its strong anti-industrialist themes, this is the emotional reaction almost all players are going to have in light of this revelation:No. No, I didn't do any of that. My hands are clean, and none of this has any relevance to me. I am not even slightly invested in the role.And it really is all totally irrelevant to you because, as in The Dark Descent, the very empty explanation as to why our player character did these things seems to reduce to the influence of some black box alien artifact. You know, something that's explicitly not trying to analogize any real-world system, past, present or speculative future. Even if you were, against pragmatism, curious about this thin fictional construct, the game gives you basically no information.Despite the familiarity of the industrial distopean setting, none of it is meaningful (beyond the premise itself, which is great, but that is conveyed in full by the cover text). It is not a commentary, or if it is, its angle is deliberately obfuscated. Not in a fun way. In a ""there's no hint that there is any thematic puzzle here to be solved"" way. If you think Dan Pinchbeck has said something meaningful, you could just as well be imagining it.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game, you could play it but you will probably be dissappointed because it was a huge step back for a title with ""Amnesia"" in itPros: -The music and sound effects are great and terrifying-Story is interesting-Locations and environment are good-Gives chillsAfter playing Amnesia: the Dark Descent those are the things i couldnt ignore, it feels that the game lacks so many things, I immediately felt being cocblocked because i couldnt open all the doors and search all the drawersCons:-No inventory             this kills the purpose of exploration and collecting and risking to enter side rooms, which leads to-Point A to point B gameplay             with no side areas, therefore the only doors which are open are the ones you have to enter to get further into the game-No sanity meter              Stay in the dark, stare at monsters, do whatever you want: your actions are not punished, you dont have to be careful and balance being in light with a risk of being seen or sitting in the dark, raising insanity meter.-Infinite lantern               You dont have to manage the oil and use lantern only when needed, just leave it on. I understand they wanted to imply that pigmen cause electric lamp to freak out but it wasnt worth it.-No tinderboxes                Everything is lighted up already, you dont have to light anything up or manage tinderboxes: no more thrill of limited view -No places to hide              If in the first Amnesia you didnt have the means to defend yourself, in this game you dont have means to hide! You dont need it because there are no enemies! and if there are you just outrun them, so no more closing doors and sitting in the dark, no more closet hiding-Cannot interract with many objects                No more stacking boxes on top of each other, no more throwing barrels or books. Thats how you know that if you finally found something you can interact with, you will need it for puzzle-No puzzles                You could, of course, call pulling levers or spinning wheels a puzzle, but it as dumb as it gets: walk in the room, you see there is a lever, you pull it, you go further.-Little environmental jumpscares                Yes, there are such things as shaking ground and loud roars, but very little and game mostly scares you through audio, not visuals-No enemies                  There are enemies, of course, but 80% of the game youre so lonely you actually get happy when you are finally being chased-No stress, no fear                  There is no tension throughout the game, it gets very predictable and dull as you progress.-No immersion                   Main Hero doesnt behave like Daniel in ATDD, he fails to express fearConclusion: this is my opinion and although i was very dissappointed with the game and completed it just for the sake of the story, you could still play it, go ahead and do so, but dont expect it to be like ATDD. This game doesnt live up to standards set by the first Amnesia, either, as a standalone it is more like a interactive story than a horror stealth game			"

												Right on the heels of playing Amnesia: The Dark Descent I jumped into Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. Despite the fact that it was developed by a different group and has a completely different setting, I was expecting to have a very similar experience. While the beginning was very similar, as the game progressed it diverged in many ways, and not all of them were bad.Unlike the first game, the player character has a very specific goal from the beginning: find his children. At first I thought that he hadn't lost all of his memories, but as the story progressed it became clear that he didn't know how the machinery around him worked, even though he was clearly the one who had built it.Lighting is very important, and just like the original you get a lantern to light your way. However, this lantern never runs out of juice, and spending time in the darkness doesn't affect your character's sanity. I found this very odd, because it was one of the main sources of tension and fear in the first game. As it turns out, A Machine for Pigs is much more about the story it has to tell than it is about scaring your pants off.The story starts off slowly, when the game is still at its scariest. It then builds into an arch that I don't want to say anything about because it would be very easy to spoil and it really is the strong point of the game.The themes surprisingly focused heavily on the class struggle of the late 1800s, and utilized pigs as the metaphors and imagery for almost everything. In a way it reminds me of the social commentary that Bioshock gave, but a much smaller taste.The gameplay was a lot simpler than the first game. Most of the tasks that I had to complete wouldn't even count as puzzles, they were that straightforward. It probably helped that most objects that were interactable were puzzle elements. For example, I once found a candle that I could pick up; suspecting that there was a puzzle coming up that required it, I brought it with me. I was right. A lot of the drawers and doors had these huge visible locks on them that clearly meant ""You cannot open this, there is nothing useful inside, and the developers don't want you wasting all of your time opening tons of drawers because there isn't any health or sanity for you to worry about. Just move along and continue the story we have crafted for you.""One of the creepiest things in the game were these colorful pigmasks. They would show up in areas that I had already explored, and occasionally disappear again while I wasn't looking. It gave me the sensation that I was being watched. I also suspect that they sometimes changed the map around me, similar to Antichamber but much less obvious. Or maybe I just got myself lost.Oddly, there were several things in the game that reminded me of Portal 2. In many areas there were large maps of the complex with the area I was in highlighted so I could tell how close to my goal I was.There was also this one walkway that would have fit right in among the older parts of Aperture Science.A Machine for Pigs was a very well-made narrative, and it moved me deeply. However, it was extremely short at 4.5 hours long. I would price this game at $10, so wait until it goes on sale.			"

												I loved this game. I truly believe it was fantastic.It is definitely different than The Dark Descent, but it engaged me just as strong as the original did along with terrifying me in new ways.The level design,story, atomosphere, lighting, and sound all come together to create a world that is disturbing, frightening, forbidding, and at the same time compelling. I was terrified to continue exploring, but I was too curious not too. I needed to know what was going on. I NEEDED to know, who the main character was, what had happened to his family, and what this massive machine truely was. Once I began my descent into this machine, I felt the horror and mystery begin to dig their icy claws into my soul.The Dark Descent gained most of its terror from the atmosphere and its monsters trying to kill you. Here it is what the atmosphere, main character, story, monsters, and surroundings, and what they representthat is so terrifying. It is also a strong exploration into the mind of a madman, as he tries to atone for his mistakes and come to terms with the horrible things he has done.Once I had begun to unravel the story, where the pigs came from, the main character's past, the machine's purpose, and what it all represented to me, I experienced a style of terror and horror that I have not felt since Silent Hill 2.A Machine for Pigs is NOT The Dark Descent. It has a much stronger stoyr focus, simplified gameplay, and completely different ways of horrigying you, so if you go into this expecting The Dark Descent 2, then you may be disappointed.If you wanted another Dark Descent, then go play The Dark Descent. I however, don't like when horror games stay in the same area too long (I'm looking at you resident evil) but a true way to expand upon horror is to approach it in new ways.A Machine for Pigs does this, and it does it damn well.

												Before playing this game I had very high expectations about it, the first was was pretty good so I assumed that this one would be just as good. However, this game had a story line that was hard to follow and has random events that i didnt feel link to the previous and also very little scares in it which makes it more disapointing. I had some fun playing this game but I dont think that it was worth the hype it got or the money to pay for it. Overall was worth about 6/10 being generous.			"

												Imagine you are wading through muck and it is too dark to see, but you become aware that the muck is pig guts, and you realize you are in a factory processing pig guts, only you are also a pig, and there are pig guts inside of you, and you are swallowing the pig guts and the pig guts are inside of your pig guts and you are drowning in pig guts. That's something like this game.The Machine for Pigs is intentionally drowning itself in its own theme of pigs. The pigs are the people. The people are pigs. The pigs mean inhumanity, but the pigs also are what is left of humanity. Everything is pigs. The fable, or reality, or symbolism is so widely applied: It is spattered across everything, it is haphazard, it is messy, but that allows it to grow deeper. It festers. It swallows everything and drags it to the bottom of its murky depths. And then it defiles the air. And it leeches the earth. And it seeps into the night. And it feeds upon itself. Just like the pigs.It is great.Somehow.			"

												The Chinese Room takes Amnesia on a trip down to the pigpen to drag it through the mud. It has a fairly strong opening and atmosphere, but the almost complete removal of interaction, the bizarre unravelling of the ending that veers off towards comical territory and its short length, stain the title deeply.A significant decline in quality from the first entry in the series.5/10			"

												I'm writing this not as a recommendation, but as a warning. This game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. I have never in my life been let down so unbelievably hard by a game in my entire life. When this game was announced, I was hoping that it would at least live up to the first one, but it doen't just fall short of being a good sequel. It falls short of being a good game. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I wasn't scared slightly ♥♥♥♥ING ONCE during the entire FOUR HOUR game. The monsters are non threatening, there are no machanics that have been updated or added, there's no tension, no oppressive atmosphere, the puzzles were simplistic and idiotic, the story is stupid and convoluded, and your character is immediately unlikeable in every aspect. Not to mention that your entire motivation is to find your kids (how ♥♥♥♥ing cliche can you get). I went through the entire game wondering ""Why the ♥♥♥♥ should I care"". There are no redeeming qualities of this game whatsoever. If you want a good survival horror game, go buy Outlast by Red Barrel.DO NOT BUY THIS STEAMING PILE OF♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I don't get these people who are saying that Amnesia is ruined by this entry. They're wrong, they're all wrong. However, this is a completely different Amnesia, one that sacrifices sanity meters and tinderboxes for more atmospheric Victorian horror. I actually think it should have gone further, because some elements remove me from the experience so their voice actors can have a talk at the player. There is also a dispiriting lack of chases by monsters. So why did this game take two years to make? Because it's a finely crafted experience, one with excellent design and unrelenting dread, the kind that actually creeped me the ♥♥♥♥ out instead of vaguely irritating me. Even the jump scares, an incredibly worn out cliche, are done effectively and with reason. So if you need your sanity meters, chases around the dinner table with monsters, and are not willing to sit down and actually listen to what the game is trying to impart, consider playing something else. Everyone else: The sequel to Amnesia is here.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs tells a great story about a father who is looking for his missing children, and if you are like me and have played The Dark Decent, you know that this game is going to be scary as well.There are some things that not everyone knows, it's not the same developers that made this game that made the previous game, but they used the same engine as the other developers used. The developers, which is The Chinese Room, they have had a much bigger focus on the atmosphere and the surrounding in the game that Frictional Games had, which to me was a good thing. It's not necessarily a very scary game, but it makes you feel like you want to quit the game and continue to play at the same time, because of the great atmosphere.The only thing I found a little bit dissapointing was the length of the game, I thought it was going to much longer. And it was the same with the puzzles in the game, they were a bit too short and easy from time to time.To finish of, I would like to say this game had an excellent story and a very dynamic atmosphere. If you're like me and don't like horror games too much, buy it, because you won't regret it.			"

												Well. Im not too sure what to say about AAMFP. I, being a huge fan of TDD, had been looking into this game since it was announced. The idea of the game really got me pumped up, and the lack of real information made me even more excited about its release. The amount of delays was really upsetting though. The game (I think) was originally set to release in October 2012 (Again, Im not sure), but was released in September 2013. When the game showed up on Steams store page, I instantly bought it for pre-load. On the day it came out, I instantly got out of bed, started up my PC and started playing. In short, it was one of the most dissapointing things ever. For starters, Custom Story was taken off. That part really upset me. Gameplay wise, there is now no inventory system, no tender boxes, and unlimited oil, taking away greatly from the survival horror feel. Also, the Insanity system was removed. When a monster is seen, it doesnt give the insanity effect that was seen in TDD. Story wise, I thought they had something going. I liked the idea of the story. It is one of the main reasons I got excited for the game in the first place. But like a lot of the other reviews are saying, it is like a toned down versoin of TDD. Im not saying that its the worst game ever made or anything. I just thing that maybe, just maybe, if Frictional Games was the only one who worked on this, it could be a little bit better. You can check the game out yourself if you haven't, but if you have never played The Dark Decent, I suggest you play that one. Or Outlast			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, I wouldn't say it's a very good Amnesia game.If you are expecting Amnesia or Penumbra, Stop. This is not the same type of game.This is more or less a lot like Dear Eshter, a mod made into game, that is simply you walking around listening to stories by the narrator. In Amnesia AMFP's case, you are doing very little puzzles and mainly just walking around as things happen, there is really no point in searching for any items, because there are NONE to gather! You are directed to every single object required to finish a puzzle and you don't do much aside from walking around, turn on a valve or two or pull some levers, then walk some more, often the narrative takes control from you, for the sake of telling you the story.Cons: - Lack of inventory, there are no items to combine for a puzzle or things to conserve.- Lack of sanity meter, you don't have to worry about anything.- Most of the environments were dull and you can't interact with it, 80-90% of the time like in Amnesia and Penumbra. They look good though, but thats about it.- The flashlight you find is endless, it requires no fuel or battery.- Exploring in it is kind of pointless since all you are looking for are notes, and if there are puzzles, you mostly find stuff immediately, there is nothing cleverly hidden.Pros:- The Score is pretty good.- Most of the areas had nice-good atmosphere.- It had very good concepts for the most part.I would say more about the story and monster, but this remains spoiler free.Overall, I rate this game 5/10, it's not really a survival horror game, it's just a walking horror tale.

												The date is December 31, 1899. You play as Oswald Mandus, a wealthy English businessman and a loving father, who has recently returned from a trip to Mexico. Sick and feverish, Mandus is startled awake in the middle of the night by the sound of his children calling out for him. Following the echoes of their voices, Mandus enters the cellar of his house. If only he knew what he would discover down in the depths.A Machine for Pigs is probably best described as an indirect sequel to The Dark Descent, and though it shares the Amnesia name, the developers are not the same, and jumping in with the expectations of it being the same game will only leave you disappointed. A Machine for Pigs is by no means a bad game, but it certainly is different from its predecessor.Gameplay-wise, the most noticeable changes are the many elements that are absent compared to The Dark Descent, most notably the sanity meter and inventory. Rather than picking up items and combining them to solve puzzles, you instead must physically carry around anything that you need, and can only hold one item at a time. While this does make for much simpler puzzles overall, it also makes the game feel more immersive. There's no pausing to combine items while a monster chases you down, everything is real-time. Other than those changes, however, the game plays just like Frictional's previous games.Atmosphere is a large and critical element in any horror game, and few developers know atmosphere better than The Chinese Room, most well-known for their game Dear Esther. As you travel from your cozy mansion, to the graveyard of the church, to the industrial bowels of the Machine, the atmosphere is persistent, realistic and very intense. The monsters, though there are relatively few that pose a real threat to you, are gruesome and terrifying, and the infamous Amnesia invisible water monster even makes a return in a new form.However, where A Machine for Pigs truly excels is in the story. Like The Dark Descent, you start out knowing very little about yourself and your surroundings. But as the game progresses, you learn more and more, and the plot twists and turns as you uncover more about what is really happening. As you descend farther into the Machine, you discover journal entries and voice recordings revealing the story, but only at the end does everything tie together. This form of storytelling has a way of pulling the player in, giving them clues to let them piece the story together, while making them want to keep playing so they can see if they were right all along. And the ending is nothing short of satisfying. Assuming you pay attention to the notes and conversations along the way, the game's conclusion leaves you without any big questions, and wraps everything up very nicely.As I mentioned, this game is not by any means The Dark Descent, so playing it and expecting something just like it will not leave you with the same sense of satisfaction. A Machine for Pigs is a very good game, and if it weren't for a few small issues (namely some graphical problems and simplistic puzzles) I would even call it great. And for the $20 price tag, it's certainly worth it if you're a fan of any survival horror games. It won't make you soil your pants like Outlast and it won't make you go insane like The Dark Descent, but A Machine for Pigs certainly has its place in the genre.			"

												I have heard complaints that this game is not as scary as its predecessor. This is correct. I have heard complaints that this game is easier than its predecessor. This is also correct. I have heard complaints that this game is terribly bad. This is not correct.Through effective use of sound and vision, The Chinese Room manages to create a horror game much more akin to the likes of Poe or Lovecraft, focusing on a slow burning dread rather than the all-out terror of the first Amnesia. This game is telling a story much more than the original Amnesia was. Sure, the original Amnesia did have a story and it was quite good, but the terror and the game mechanics were the centrepiece. This is not the case with A Machine for Pigs. Here, both terror and game take the backseat and the story and ambience is the main attraction. Personally I think this is a good idea, as this fits the talents of The Chinese room much better.This is a good game. This is a great game. But do not expect a game as scary and gamey as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. If you crave something to make you scream in your youtube let's plays or to solve complex puzzles, this is not the game you want. If you want a well-told story in a well-realized enviroment, this might just be the thing you're looking for.			"

												I will be completely honest here, I used a walkthrough for this and played it in a fully lit room, and sped my way to the end in about two hours. The game is no where near as scary as the original Amnesia, but I still ended up going through multiple pairs of underwear. The puzzles are decent, however I don't see how anyone could work some them out if they didn't have a guide. The game does also have some serious performance issues, no matter what settings I changed, the frame rate dropped rapidly between 60 fps and 30 fps. Not sure why, it may just of been me, but my rig is more than powerful enough to run this. If you haven't played an Amnesia game before, I'd definitely recommend the original over this one, however Machine for Pigs is still a good game.			"

												Unfortunately nothing like its predecessor, maybe the spookiest game I’ve ever played Amnesia “The Dark Descent”. The ""Machine for Pigs"" is dull, uninteresting and slow paced, you don’t feel scary, you feel bored, I couldn’t bear more than 40 minutes of this game and had to uninstall it afterwards. Although I read the reviews, I really wanted to check it anyway, so yes, reviews don’t lie; it’s a poor ghost of Amnesia, nothing more to be said here… Chinese room made ""A Machine For Pigs"", who did a stand alone and critically acclamed 'Dear Esther', but not the Frictional Games and you can clearly see the other hand at work, ""Chinese Room"" is know best for athmostherical and rather emotional games, not horror ones.

												AAMFP was game for which I had high hopes, but I don't think I am the only one who is disappointed. The game is not scary at all, the plot isn't very interesting (the idea is not bad, some guy being lunatic doing some crazy crap related to murder, canibalism etc, but it doesn't really feel like you want to know entire story), some great features from Dark Descent, like playing around with various objects, are simply removed. Frictional Games shot their own feet with deleting the Custom Story feature, along with putting the game back instead of expanding it from Dark Descent. This doesn't feel like sequel - it feels like somehow ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of original Amnesia. Even if you somehow enjoyed the gameplay, it is ultra short - took me 3 hours to finish it, while the first one took like half a year (cause I was so scared to even launch it). The only good thing I can say about AAMFP is the sound and partially a bit steampunkish enviroment.			"

												Alright, let me start off by saying that the first Amnesia was among my favorite games ever. While the scares got a bit predictable towards the end, the puzzles remained at least moderately challenging and the story that unfolded was just simply incredible. With the year delay on the release of Amnesia 2, I was really excited for this game. A small flag came up for me when I saw that Frictional partnered up with the devs behind Dear Esther (I don't care what anyone says, that isn't a ""game"" but a pretentious bunch of boredom thrown together to seem artsy).I'm happy to report that The Chinese Room keeps up their air of pretentious stupidity throughout this game as well.Let's start with a positive; the atmosphere is great. From the very beginning I was cautious around corners and appreciating the game.  But Chinese Room never gets past this point. They create a wonderful atmosphere, but when they ask themselves ""now what?"" I imagine everyone in the company just kinda shrugs and says ""add more bloom effects.""There are no puzzles. With the removal of the inventory system, you simply pick up a battery and put it in a machine to open a door. It never gets any more complex than that. There are no real enemies (besides the very small 45 second segment at the end of the game). There are stupid little pigs that walk around, but they move slower than you do. In almost every situation you can just kinda walk or run past them and you'll be ok.As I love to say, The Chinese Room is pretentious as hell. The whole overabused theme of ""we're all pigs in the machine of society,"" which was never original to start with, gets beaten over and over until even the most stalwart fans of these devs (which is probably the devs' mothers) have to be second guessing their taste in entertainment. But the way the narator talks, even at the end of the story, you realize that the devs really, honestly, truly believe that this is the most original metaphor that has ever been created in the history of mankind. What's truly sad is that the story itself is actually somewhat decent, I'd say nearly on par with the first Amnesia, especially with the twist. However, the ending sequence that explains everything is done in such a purposely convoluted way that it's almost as if the devs are trying to flaunt some level of intellegence to anyone who will listen. That purposeful air of arrogance from the writers comes off as overly-conceited, making it seem like they view themselves as exceedingly superior to the player.Now, for the worst part; THE GAME IS ABOUT AN HOUR LONG. I played it through once, was convinced I missed something, played it through again, and realized that I had waited and extra year for them to scrap an entire game and give me crap.There are good aspects here in what I would like to call a demo for a much better game: 1. The atmosphere is incredible until you realize nothing ever actually happens, which makes the buildup turn stagnant very quickly. There's no sense of danger to accompany the dark and forboding mood.2. There's a ""final boss"" if you wish to call it that, which actually has the elements of a real game. Incredible, I know, it took every ounce of actual willpower that TCR has as a dev to make a real bit of gameplay. But it's essentially over in a minute and you never get anything else even remotely like it.3. There's one little scene at the end where you walk around the streets of London. Again, this could have been incredible, with an open map in a phenominally made environment in a scary game where enemies could be anywhere. But wait, it's just more narrow corridors, the roads all blocked by boxes, and all of the action happening offscreen while you just walk around.That's all this ""game"" is. Action is implied to be happening elsewhere, but you're lucky to even witness it. You just walk from one room to the next picking up batteries and putting them where they go to open doors for an hour, then you get the same motifs and themes beaten into you for a good couple minutes before it ends and you're sitting there thinking ""did I really pay 20 dollars for an hour worth of boredom."" Yes, I did. And I'm writing this review so you won't. If you're really interested in it, find a YouTuber who does Let's Plays without all the stupid 10 year old screaming and scare cams and other crap (I can't point you in the direction of one, pretty much everyone on YouTube over-acts like this, so I avoid the site entirely) and watch them play the game through.Hopefully Frictional goes in another direction with Soma, otherwise I think I'm going to write this company off as a failure. I like Penumbra, and Dark Descent was a classic addition to the survival-horror genre. It's a shame they had to ruin what was shaping up to be a fantastic series of games. "

												I can see why there's mixed feeling about it. It's not a  bad  game, but it's not great either. It had the tools to be better, but I felt like it wasn't utilized right. Ignoring the 'Amnesia' in the title, I mean as a Psychological-Horror game it left me on the fence. I ain't no critic, but I always been a fan of horror, suspense and this just left me apathetic.In short: Don't expect much if you're going to play it. I can recommend it for the atmosphere and theme, but if your looking for story it's aightLong Version: Like I said before, this has the tools. And it's frustrating every time I think about it how much of BETTER game this should've been. They had the scenery, atmosphere, and MUSIC downpack but there's other stuff that could've been executed better.What I mean is the writing. At point the buildup just stopped , and I felt I got left out on the mystery and suspense. Me thinking ""What the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, Who,  When, Where, etc."" for too long put me out of the  immersion  that I didn't understand or didn't care anymore. By the penulimate, I FELT that♥♥♥♥♥♥was getting real. The music was awesome and it got dramatic and passionate. I just didn't quite understand for what reason, and that sucks. It's like walking in on the middle of a movie and a bunch of stuff is happening that makes you wonder why it's happening, but the game doesn't tell you. You just wander around dark corriders hearing how nuts the main character turned out to be.Short part 2: If you like old timey English and drama, run past 2/3 of the game and learn what NOT do if you want to want to make/write your own spooky thing.

												The first Amnesia was the most terrifying game for me to play. The second Amnesia is also very scary, but not really a game. You should see this more like an experience instead of a game, a very disturbing experience. It still has lots of elements that you can recognize from the first game, like footsteps around the corridor, small puzzles, a few jumpscares and horrifying monster encounters. What's different compared to the first game is that you don't have to search for fuel for your lantern and the fact that the whole sanity system is removed. Because of these adjustments, I didn't feel like I was in constant danger of running out of fuel or the inability to move forward because of the drained sanity. But I still had the feeling of encountering monsters anytime during the whole game. That's because the sound design and the music was so well made and as a result, me sitting on the tip of my chair throughout the entire game. After a few hours of playing you realise, half relieved / half disapointed, that the game is trying to scare you with scripted scares. At that point, Amnesia lost it's grip on my heart - a bit.Sometimes you have to hide and flee from monsters, these are the only actual 'game-moments'. But this game isn't as scary and tense as the first game. However this game does surpass the first game with a deeper, more disturbing and twisted plot, including some very nice themes about industrialization, massacre, war and religion. The combination of the beautifull enviroments, music, and the disturbing story, was enough to keep me playing for 6 / 7 hours. The fact that I didn't had as much heartattacks as when I played the first game, isn't always a bad thing.7,8/10			"

												An honest review: Okay, so a lot and I mean a LOT have been disappointed with Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. So, you right now, reading this, might be wondering ""Should I get this game?"" Well, here is the answer. (In details) The beauty of this game is not in the scares, nor the chase scenes, nor graphics but also with the story itself. It does have its moments, and it does have its creepy scenes, just not as good as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The true beauty of this game is in its story. The story of this game in my opinion is just really nice. There is a lot of hidden symbolism that I think everyone should appreciate (I do) What makes this game unique is the fact that this story can be/is related to our modern lives in a way or another. It also relates to our parents and grandparents. What I liked about this story is that we can all relate to it somehow which makes it a little better. The story in Amnesia: The Dark Descent is amazing as well but I have not seen such similar hidden symbolism. Those messages throughout that adorn the story make it stand out. Sure it may be a little complex to comprehend and maybe the story may not be explained as much due to some reason which I will explain a little further but it is a really good game if you look at it in a different perspective. Okay, so this game somehow relates to political movements and actual tragic events that happened where some people might be offended if elaborated in the game. Those who understood it appreciated it and those who did not understand the hidden messages and symbolism found that it made no sense and that the story sucks as well. I really liked this game due to its story.If you are looking for:-A game that will make you feel scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.-A game that has terrifying chase scenes.-A game that has extra ordinary graphics.-A game with complex puzzles that will need you to think heavily.-A super long campaign that will take more than 10 hours of gameplay.Then this is not the game for you.If you are looking for:-A game that has some terrifying scenes but not the scariest out there.-A game that has a beautiful story with hidden messages throughout long notes found during the gameplay.-A horror game that concentrates on storyline more than to try to spook you. -A game that has an average length of gameplay (neither short nor long).-A game that has descent graphics yet not the best out there. Then this might be the game for you. Honestly, I don't like pointless games that just want you to feel scared for the sake of it. Also, for the people who say they could have added more scare scenes and some enemies that cannot be avoided easily then I will have to say it may have worked but then it would seem to be a little unnecessary. I mean, like in some games out there where they just overload with jumpscares and that after a while gets frustrating. (In Amnesia: The Dark Descent the amount of scares and chase scenes is just perfect) but in other games like Outlast or the DLC of it to be exact feel a little repetitive and just too sloppy. You would only like the game if you want to feel scared. Also Alien: Isolation is an example that the scares just feel that they are too much and you keep dying constantly. Luckily, I like both haha, games that make me feel scared and games with good stories! Anyway, if you are planning to buy this game but not too sure buy it now when there is still a sale! Happy holidays! "

												I highly anticipated the release of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs ever since I played through the first Amnesia and found out it was awesome.But Amnesia:AMFP was not scary. And I mean over the four or so hours it took me to clock this game, I can count the number of times I actually had any sense of fear on one hand. It had almost no puzzles, and while the story was alright, it really didn't grip me. If you want to play a game just for story, you might as well play Dear Esther. But then again, if you want a good story. WHY NOT READ A BOOK OR WATCH A MOVIE!Somewhere between the first and second hour I discovered that boredom had set in. And I was doing a speed run of the game. Which is never really any good for a horror game. People should be scared about what is around the corner, NOT RUNNING HEAD FIRST ROUND THE BEND IN A FUTILE ATTEMPT TO CURE THEIR SENSE OF BOREDOM.Ultimately, People play Amnesia:AMFP to get scared. And yeah, some people would be scared by this game. Without a doubt. But it's not as scary as the original. For a start, the AI is laughably easy to avoid and ignore when compared to Amnesia, which is just pure awesome in a horror game. I mean, people are naturally scared of things that are difficult. ""oh no, I'm so scared of this exam coming up"", ""Careful of those creatures, they'll smash you up"". So if people are naturally scared of things that are difficult, or dangerous or powerful, then this begs the question: WHY THE HELL IS THE AI SO PASSIVE AND WEAK? What were they thinking? Without the threat of the AI I don't think there is anything else scary about this game. I mean the only other thing that could kill you is fall damage. No puzzles and no credible threats makes Jack a dull boy.			"

												It's a lousy cash-in by Chineese Room. Frictional shot themselves in the foot when they licensed Amnesia to Chineese Room. Chineese Room developed  the marvelous masterpiece 'Dear Esther'. It was one of the worst games I have ever played. Seriously, go look up gameplay of it, it's pretty hilariously bad.So why's it bad? Because it's NOTHING like Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The atmosphere feels forced and dull, the puzzles aren't nice breaks from the non-existent horror but rather there just to make you play the game for just a bit longer. As a matter of fact, apart from the bad puzzles, there's really not any challenge in the game. The 'monster' in AAMFP is basically a slow swine, that groans and moans at you. It's not surprising, it's not scary, it's just another bump in the road on your way to the next puzzle.The story is not too bad, but it's delivered horribly. You start the game off waking up in your mansion, and you're suddenly thrown into a house with predictable and laughable jumpscares, with few bits of story. The story could've been good, if it wasn't delivered horribly. You have to pass boring and annoying puzzles and monsters to progress the story, and it's just not worth it.All in all, it's a cash-in on the title of Amnesia. It's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of an amazing horror license, which fell into the wrong hands.My final verdict is a 3/10, a game to ignore. If you're a hardcore fan of Frictional Games (like me) you might enjoy bits of it, but overall it's not worth the time, money or effort.			"

												Introduction:Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is the first person horror sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The game is also set in the same dark and twisted universe as the previous one, though in an entirely new time setting and features a new cast. The game features a rich and breathtakingly horrifying story. Where the first game took place in Prussia in 1839, the second installment to Amnesia is now set in London 1899 on New Year's Eve. The protagonist, Oswald Mandus, who is a wealthy industrialist and butcher, has returned from an expedition to Mexico and has contracted a fever. At the beginning of the game, Mandus finds himself awakened in his mansion from his fever, which has lasted for several months. Only guided by the voices of his two sons, Enoch and Edwin, Mandus ventures out to find them, all while they lead him deeper into the abysmal depths of London... The story is the main drive behind the game. Exploring the dark underworld of London is a thrilling experience. However, going through the game a 2nd time is less exciting, as all of the mystery will be gone. The replayability of the game is therefore nothing to brag about. Control & Gamplay:Amnesia is a first person game, where the main goal is to explore and delve deeper into a frightening world, and survive. You are armed with nothing but a lantern, thus rendering you utterly helpless should you be confronted with the horrors that await you. Therefore, running and hiding are your only options. This is one of the defining elements of the game. Being unable to defend yourself, you feel constantly threatened, danger lurks behind every corner and you are always on your toes, ready to run away and hide and beg god the thing chasing you doesn't find you.The game itself is not difficult. The real challenge is in actually daring to advance further in the game before you get another heart attack. There are no real puzzles as in the previous Amnesia game, which is a shame. The ""puzzles"" that are present are very obvious and annoying. For the most part, the controls are good. However, when you have to use the few items in the game, the controls can feel clunky and difficult to coordinate. Graphics:The visual aspect of the game is not impressive. However, the slightly dated graphics create a more gloomy and sinister atmosphere that fits very well with the overall mood of the game.Sound: The soundtrack is my favourite aspect of the game. It is deep and melancholic and it fits the dark and twisted mood of the game.Conclusion:The game offers hours of horror, mystery and heart attacks. Amnesia is a horrifying and exciting universe that must be experienced, especially under the cover of night and preferably all alone. However, in light of its predecessor, The Dark Descent, this game offers little new in terms of mechanics and features. The puzzles feel little more than inconvenient stops in the progression and they have been unnecessarily simplified. On the other hand, the story plays a more significant role, as it often comes across as eluding and perplexing. Thus, even after the credits have rolled, Amnesia will keep you pondering about what exactly has occurred throughout the course of the game.For both old and new players to the Amnesia universe there is a twisted, yet compelling, story in wait, which is definitely worth the money.Score: 8/10			"

												I personally think this game was pretty good, but  I did not play the previous game in the series so I have nothing to compair it to. Without getting into spoilers all I am going to say about the story is that it gets pretty crazy. The story, setting, and music make most parts of the game either really scary, or really moving and dramatic. In my opinion the monsters are scary and well done from their modeling to the sound they make while they chase you. Over all I would give the game a 7/10 and suggest that you pick it up.			"

												To sum up this page of text, if stories could sell, this game would be worth it despite its ok-ish gameplay. And in many ways stories do sell, just look at the Telltale Games' ""Walking Dead"" game. However people were expecting a game that ""one ups"" the previous game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent. It doesn't as far as scare factor goes, however it makes up in story. With that being said, be sure to buy this on a steam sale. It's worth atleast $10, maybe $15.Gameplay is lacking, it’s definantly a step back from the previous game in that department. And the previous one wasn't particularly scary either. At least they tried however! There are some moments in this game where the level was seemingly designed for patrolling monster areas. It’s confusing!  Also the puzzles, which were also not hard in the first one, were laughable in the second. Really they were not puzzles, just impediments for your ""walking sim"" (see tags). With a grain of salt however it isn't particularly bad, the setting gives a lot of flavor and variety. Making the walking trip a little bit more enjoyable.The ""H. P. Lovecraftian"" story and setting are top-notch; it's very disturbing, tragic, and contemplative. If only stories could sell alone. Clearly you don't need a good one in the case of ""Outlast,"" great gameplay with genuine moments that can make you jump. However the story is... well... let’s just hope that the prequel DLC will have a good one. Although in retrospect the comparison between the two games is like comparing a campy movie and a book in the horror genre section. Getting back to Amnesia. Some of exposition in the pages in game probably should have been addressed in dialogue. There are needlessly vague plot points which are very relevant on how this came about and link directly to the previous Amnesia title. There are a group of people out there who ignore this exposition (A few sentences are just too much for them unfortunately). The dialogue does needlessly beats around the bush at times as well.  Graphics; are not all that impressive. Lot of little details, but some of the textures are not great, clothe seems to be a particular problem. But then again this category was never a selling point, it is enough that it creates a level of immersion that doesn't take you out of the moment. The running movements however for some of the models were a bit clunky. Primarily because of how they were shaped (it just doesn't look like they were meant to run).The music is also good and very memorable in the parts they were used.  Although there was this moment when the music was too good and didn't fit with the clunky movements on screen (The ""Mors Praematura"" and London scene, this scene really shows the graphical limitations of running models). The voice acting was very good also, even though were some lines late in the game which were a bit rusty in execution. But I am just being nit-picky in that regard. It is enough that you can sympathize with Mandus in his tragic quest.Overall Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs leaves much to be desired in gameplay, but the gameplay isn't particular bad. The story was good enough for me to recommend this title. It’s that good. Not to overhype it or anything, but when this game hits a steam sale… buy it, the journey into the depths of despair and desperation is worth it.			"

First thing I noticed, there's completely no playr menu at all, no sanity, no oil, no tinderboxes, nothing that Dark Descent was iconic for.Mostly all of the doors/drawers/and cabinents are locked and can't be interacted with, almost completely removing the exploration portion of the game.And lastly, most of the time you're sitting there stuck not knowing what to do and how to progress.I'm kind of disgusted by this game and how The Chinese Room can poorly develop a sequel to a game. 2/10			"

												The classic example of an angry fanbase tearing apart a sequel on release day, and essentially killing any chance for this decent game to be noticed:""A Machine for Pigs,"" is without a doubt, severly underrated and highly controversial among Frictional fans, however the anger towards this game lies simply within it's name. If the devs had just labeled it a different name rather then Amnesia, people wouldn't have been up in arms about its flaws, it wouldn't have gotten its infamous reputation, and it might even be considered a great game among some players. None of this is to downplay the flaws that the game has, but rather simply to show that a good game has no chance of redeeming itself among the fanbase because of silly marketing campaigns to try and atract more players due to its label. In all honesty, the game is quite good, but commits serious sins against the Amnesia franchise, however, after playing it, all of these can be overlooked by those who put in the time and effort to experience it like they did with ""The Dark Decent.""

												Новый проект от студии Frictional Games. Новая серия Амнезии никак не связана с предыдущей. Что это за конфетка и стоит ли её кушать? йа вам сейчас расскажу1)СюжетОн в отличии от оригинала запутан. Только под конец йа начал понимать суть происходящего, а переваривать всё новые открытия сюжета дались мне с трудом. Сразу скажу щто концовку данного творения йа не смог до конца понять...Могу только догадываться. Но в целом он довольно интересен2)ГрафикаОна не сильно изменилась. HPL2 Engine... тут его исполнения меня не удивило. Но из за мрачного освещения на всех локациях, наслодиться почти нечем3)ГеймплейТут разработчики меня удивили... и йа сам не понял в какую сторону. Убрали инвентарь...Убрали здоровье и мозги... убрали самоконтроль(ужас) без него ничего не видно когды на корточках сидишь с выключенным фанарём... ну хоть бесконечный фанарь есть. Отсудствие выше перечисленного сказывается на геймплее глобально... начинаешь думать...""Frictional Games...ВЫ делали эту игру?"" 4)АтмосфераОна начинается чувствоваться только ближе к середине. звековое сопровождение слава Кхорну есть. Оно отсудствует при появлении монстров... ЭТО пичалит =( наслодиться месными простороми не удастся, ибо по большей части мы проведём в тёмных помещениях с прохим освещением. Внешний вид напоминает СтимПанк....И ещё... некоторые персоны не только в некоторых моментах дают некую атмосферу.Итог: Стоит ли вам играть В новое творение Frictional Games? Если вы фанат серии и любите пошалить нервишки, вы фанат Стим панка и вы не вигатарианец....Приобритайте, не пожилеете!			"

												Far better storyline, atmosphere, and music than the first amnesia. Considering that this was made by the Chinese Room who made Dear Esther, I was expecting that they would sacrifice gameplay for story. The story elements are riveting and actually tie close to reality especially the machine's speech in the end about humanity and its willingness to kill innocents. I guess it depends on what kind of gamer you are. If you are someone who can enjoy video games as an art form then this is the best video game that I can recommend.

Seriously, not for the feint-hearted. Can be fustrating at times running around the house (like a madman) retracing steps and pushing doors open, scanning walls and reading rather chilling diary entries.

												This game could have been incredible if Chinese Room had only handled the story and design, and handed gameplay back to Fricitonal. Instead, we get a great story and unique monsters wrapped in one of the least frightening games I have ever played. Half the length of the original game, with about a quarter of the features, A Machine for Pigs is truly a step back for Amnesia. I did like the idea of the electric lantern though. It'd be cool to see more games in the series using different light sources in different times, like maybe a game where you have to use torches, essentially combining tinderboxes and the lantern into one system? Idunno man. Only buy this game on sale and if you can't stop yourself.			"

												Amnesia: a machine for pigs mixed reviews represent the afternath of the clash between the Amnesia franchise fans and Dear Esther sequel hopefuls. Amnesia fans wanted more of the 'scary' Amnesia series while and Dear Esther fans such as myself craved more of Robert Briscoe's unique style from its debut, genre defining title. In the end, neither really received what they wanted, although thankfully the game certainly is more of a ''walking simulator' than a series of cheap scares.The production values might not be stellar but remain relatively high throughout the adventure, and for the most part, the title delivers a solid gaming experience for the 5 hours or so it takes to complete it.7/10. Bring Robert Briscoe back.			"

												Amnesia: A machine for Pigs is (as the credits will state) a game made by The Chinese Room aka Dear Esther. In other words, what you get is Dear Esther's essence wrapped in Amnesia. Don't expect the game to have puzzles or rooms to explore, this thing goes on tracks (nearly) like a steam locomotive and is only supposed to follow the track. I was able to learn in 15-20 minutes what I can open/collect and what are closed/unusable objects. If there is an item to pick, one have to use it. If there is a door that opens, one must go through it. Locked doors and such carry no value, meaning one is not going to run along the rooms to solve how to enter another room like in Amnesia. The game has an excellent atmosphere making this horror story enjoyable. What ruined my gaming experience was expectations for this to be a little more Amnesia than what it was. I was able to enjoy the game as soon as I let go of old Amnesia concept. In Amnesia, one must use light sources to keep sanity, in Piggy one has lantern that has no limits. To put it simply, in Piggy one does not have inventory, one does not need health, oil, any items. Also the the night vision (eyes get used to darkness in Amnesia) is gone. One more thing about tracks and monsters: because this game is supposed to run on tracks, monsters also disappear and appear randomly. Making it sometimes less.. scary. When I started to play the game without using lantern I mainly saw shadows of the monsters or heard the screams. To sum it up, this game has it's strong points and is enjoyable, just don't expect it to be Amnesia/Penumbra.			"

												story-you wake up in a house at the end of 19. century and (surprise) you have an amnesia.your characters name is Oswald Mandus,who's trying to find his two childern.later in the game you come across a telephone,where somebody tells you to descend into underground and start a machine.as plot goes its pretty good,even with the few nonsenses in a story.the begining is very reminiscent of the original,but has a twist that (lets be honest) you will see comin miles away and another twist that was actually pretty good.(aside a house) whole game takes place in industrial complex and (in my opinion) setting is better than in the original.it feels more atmospheric and eeriegameplay-and this is where new amnesia's problem lies.the whole game is made by the guys,who made Dear Esther,so its just understandible that they make it like Dear Esther.In theory its not a bad idea i mean one of the best things in the original  was the story and flashbacks,so that means its going to be perfect match,right?Well,yeah it kinda does,but what was also great in the original were the puzzles and here they tried to squeeze in some puzzles,but most of the are just either click that or put thing into thing and it doesnt help the fact that you dont have an inventory,so your just using your hands (or telekinesis since you dont see his hands,so your probably also a ghost) and its kinda akward,but that is not the game's intention.you can finish the game in 2 hours,which is short as hell,but for the type of game developers  are trying to make its understandible.there are also monster encounters here and there and......with mutated pigs.....ehm.........Yeah,this game s enemies arent exactly frightening,but they are not laughable either.Its easy to avoid them so.......By the way this game gets kinda silly,kinda frightening and kinda weird at the same time at the end.Audio/visuals-Visually game looks like an updated version of the original.it still looks pretty though (for an indie developer) .where the game shines the most is the soundtrack.It s incredible,seriously,person who made the soundtrack deserve some big prize.The soundtrack not only matches the period of time the game is set in,but also is just so beautifull.It can be eerie,it can be subtle,it can be tender,it can be menacing.I highly reccomend to listen the whole soundtrack,its greatscare factor - id like to praise the game for its subtle aproach and let most of scary stuff be delivered by its story. (well that and lots and lots of crumbling sounds)pros+atmosphere+setting+story+amazing soundtrack+good visuals+subtle aproachcons -few nosenses in a story-the game length-absence of puzzles that chalenges you mindverdict-for what it is,its pretty good.its a walking simulator with good story,great soundtrack and atmosphere.Sure the game is short ,bit overpriced and doesnt have much puzzles,but for a walking simulator game made by a studio,who is known for these kinds of games,I am surprised that it turned out the way it did and...................its better than first amnesia (for me atleast).If your not into these kinds of games and you want to try it,wait till the price drops and if youre into those games you'll probably like it8/10			"

												To put it simply: It's alright. It was made by the same people involved in Dear Esther - and the influence takes over the original Amnesia feel. The original Amnesia was a great game, especially considering it wasn't a triple A publisher. A lot of what made the original game so great is not at the forefront this time around. *potential spoilers*The game starts with the same scary vibe, but after a few minutes that completely diminishes. You have an infinite supply of light, something that was scarce and added to the tension of the first game. That on its own isn't a game breaker, BUT - there is now a system in place that WARNS YOU when an enemy is nearby. Not only does it warn you when an enemy is nearby, but there are barely any enemies to speak of. I spent a good majority of the first half of the game with anticipation, just waiting to be scared. Go into a new room ""oh god, I hope there isn't anything spooky in here"" nothing. Next room, nothing. By the time the game actually starts to pick up place, that feeling of dread is completely replaced with a feeling of boredom. There were a few moments of being scary, but for the most part it feels more just like you're playing an interactive story like Dear Esther rather than ever actually feeling the need to survive.The game isn't horrible. On its own, I think it is a decent enough game - but as an Amnesia successor, and judging it as so - the game isn't that great. If you can get it for a decent price, and are a diehard fan of the first game - it's worth it just to experience, but it isn't anything quite as memorable.			"

												Amnesia A machine for pigs is a good game, but unlike the dark decent not a great one. The dark decent set the standard too high so that nothing would ever be able to compare to it despite a machine for pigs having alot going for it, but also a few problems that in my mind defenitly affected the overall gameplay.First the negatives:1) if you look at how many hours ive played up to this point your probably thinking: ""3-4 hours? how can you have an educated opinion on a game youve barley played"" well thats my point. I finished the entire game in a night. A machine for pigs (amfp is how i will refer to it from hence forward) is way too short, and while i dont mind a more linear story (which amfp definetly is) at least stretch it out I was expecting at least a 10 hour story and with no custom stories there will be very little too come back to. 2) repetition, In The dark decent there where a sh** ton of puzzels but atleast they were different and in my mind much more creative. In amfp each puzzle is completed in very simalir fasion and I think this not only made the game much easier but also was one of the major reasons as to why the game was so short. In TDD i spent nearly an entire hour trying to solve one of the puzzels. In amfp the longest it ever took me was 10 minutes. long story short some puzzels in tdd took longer for me to complete than the entire first half of amfp.The Positives:1)TDD heavily depended on atmosphere, in amfp atmosphere is the games saving grace. the music and ambience is just absoulutly increadible and there where countless times were i found myself shaking JUST because of the ambience or mood in an area, combine that with manpigs and youve got yourself one terrifying experience.2) the story in amfp was in my mind scarier than any mosnter or beast that attacked you in the game. the very premise scares me just thinking about it. even now, almost a day after i completed amfp, i still feel horrified and sick. I wont spoil anything but the twist about half way through the game made me stop the game and listen to soothing music for atleast an hour. the story in this game fully surpassed any prevoius expectations i had before the game and i love discouvering it piece by piece. It also has some social commentary in the game about religon, wealth and coruption, going where the first game never dared to go... and i loved it3) the graphics: not much i can say other than i thought the game looked awesome.Final verdict: 7.5/10 -a good game with some minor yet noticable set backs.would recomend. would play agian			"

												A comparison to the prequel+strong variety of different environments, you even go outside occasionally!+I can hear the dialouge, plus there's subtitles just in case.+Very creepy and unsettling-less terrifying(doesnt help that I'm now  calloused towards spookiness)-Puzzles more basic and less rewarding with no inventory-Shorter-I could hear the voices clearly enough but still didn't understand the story as it was going on. Turns out the plot is pretty good, wish I could have processed it as it was going on. The wiki filled me in on the plot after I beat it.Overall while it manages to stay creepy in some new ways, it loses a lot of the difficulty by enforcing more linearity. Still worth a play if you're curious.  "

												Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs.Well I got to say, I was a fan of the first one but when I played this one I was a little frustrated with a few things they took out from the first one. The removed Oil and Tenderbox pick ups, which means infinite light source from your lanturn and to me that took some of the fun away because you didnt have to use them sparingly. The inventory menu they took out, so no pick ups even for important items so you had to drag them clear back across some areas, Also couldn't check your sanity (Because they basically took it out). But it still was a bit fun just was a little upset with the removal of those features. But I still would recommend this game with a rating of a 7.9/10. Will I replay this, Most likely not. But still was fun while it lasted.			"

												Гениальный сюжет, который просто затмевает все остальное что есть в игре, он действительно держит игрока до самого конца. Он ""впивается в ваши ребра и сжирает сердце"". Он мерзкий и ужасный, но в то же врменя чертовски умный. Именно из-за истории в эту игру и стоит играть. Все остальное уже не так важно. Но собственно более обьективно я скажу : Хоррора уже как такого уже не осталось, игра действительно не пугает. Все собираемые предметы канули в лету, как собственно и загадки (то что присутсвтет в игре, даже загадками назвать не могу). Немного улучшенная графика, отличная архитектура и дизайн, ну и конечно просто отличная музыка (особенно под конец). Игра пролетается на одном дыхании и да же тот факт, что она очень коротка, не портит её, даже могу сказать, что именно благодаря этому ""Машина для свиней"" и не успевает наскучить. Могу порекомендавать только тем, кто любит многогранные сюжеты с глубоким подтекстом и получает удовольствия от самоличного нахождения истины. Всем же остальным, кто играет только ради геймплея не могу 100% советывать её, вам скорей всего больше придется по душе, тот же Outlast.			"

I have been a HUGE amnesia fan since my first few minutes of The Dark Descent and it was The Dark Descent that got me into the horror genre. A machine for pigs comes absolutely nowhere near the amazing and uncomfortable feeling or atmosphere the game bestows and reveals to the player. I'm really upset that the amnesia series is being put on hold or stopped and i really hope frictional games can pull my loyalty to their games back with SOMA			"

												This game isn't what you would expect, but it doesn't mean it's a bad game.Pretty hard not to remember The Dark Descent when you see the title. But A Machine for Pigs is not a survival horror like the previous game, it's more of a dark tale.Sharing the game engine and some gameplay from the first Amnesia, this game drops the inventory, but keeps a detailed world, with the help of music fitting perfectly.The story is quite predictable, but also pretty detailed and well counted.If you look for a deep survival horror, you might want to look somewhere else. But if you like tormented stories, this is one you must live.

												Okay, let me just say that I loved this game. I loved every single moment of it. Even the parts that weren't very scary.I played this game all the way through, and I have to say, I was horrified. Was I horrified by monsters constantly chasing me or something jumping out? No, I was not. What horrified me, you ask?The plot.If you are going in to this game expecting something like The Dark Descent, turn away right away. It is very different from the first. Is that bad? No.The game is highly dedicated to telling it's story, which is absolutely horrifying in every detail. It is exactly what the description says it is. It is a game that drags you into the depths of greed, power, and madness.Looking back at The Dark Descent, it did not have a very good plot. Sure, it worked for the setting of the game and was well written, but for what it actually is, it is rather simple. It did not scare me at all, even with the horrible things it implied. However, the game made up for the uninteresting story with the absolute terror it induced into every one of it's players.Now lets look at A Machine for Pigs. It has it's scary moments, but it isn't very scary once played all the way through. However, the plot of this game got me hooked, and I wanted to know everything about it. By the end, I was absolutely shocked. The game features a storyline that if you really, truely listen to, will put you at the edge of your seat. It is told in a way that is very vague, and requires you to think.The other features of this game are also very well done. The sound design if phenominal. It's so well done that you actually feel like you are descending into a horrible, dark machine. The music is some of the best I have ever heard in a game, and it goes very well with what is going on.The game isn't trying to be like The Dark Descent. It wants to be different, and it wants to scare us in a different way.If you want something exactly like The Dark Descent, do not buy this game. If you want to be scared in a new way while being told a beautiful story, then this is the game for you.			"

												As a big fan of good, subtle horror, and amazing stories, I was a huge admirer of ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"", and when I heard about the second game, I couldn't contain my excitement. That was sort of my first mistake. Having huge expectations after the first game, I sadly had to be let down. This does not mean the game is bad, this just means, that after ""The Dark Descent"" it probably just had to go downhill. And even though I would love to judge the two games separately, comparing the two is sort inevitable.On the up side, I believe the story in this game is way more interesting, heart touching, and creepy at the same time, than the intricate, but slightly… “whatever” story in the first game. It is more personal, and emotional, and the outcome is way more disturbing.The music has definitely left an impression, and I still listen to ""Mors Praematura"" from time to time, cause the atmosphere it created was divine. Graphics are noticeably better, as the game is a fresher release.Yet, as I moved through the empty house, as I watched Mandus' story unwind, I felt complete peace. And this is not what you want to feel, when playing a horror game. Maybe I have developed a strong resistance to scares, cause of my love for horror, but as hard as the game tried - I just could not get scared. Even though I love the design of the monsters in this game (whom I will refrain from calling by their name, in case you would rather be surprised), I found it hard to fear them. Found them extremely disturbing, but also had a strong sense of pity for them. They just couldn't get me in the ""oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, running away"" mode, that the first game had me in most of the time.Also the puzzle difficulty in this game is very low, and doesn't require any real thinking skills. Which can be considered an advantage by some, but for me is again, very disappointing.So in conclusion, I would suggest playing this game for the interesting story, which left a strong unease in my heart, and the amazing music that stays with you for a long time. But if you are expecting getting really scared, or a good mind boggling puzzle, you will probably be left with a feeling of letdown. All in all, not a bad game, just probably not what you would expect. "

												While definitely a very different experience than the original Amnesia, I personally believed that Machine for Pigs was worth playing. While it started off somewhat lackluster with basic puzzles, little challenge and not a very compelling story,  as the game progressed it really started to draw me into the atmosphere and environment of the world. Upon finishing the game I was forced to admit (despite not initially liking the game) that I thought the story was much better than that of the first game, even if it was substantially shorter and not near as terrifying. Should you play this game? It depends on what you want to get out of it. If you're playing it for a compelling story about a father's search for his missing children, then it delivers and you'll  be pleased. If you're looking for simply a ""scary"" game filled with jumpscares and things to send chills up your spine, it may be best to look somewhere else.			"

												Building upon the legacy of Amensia: The Dark Descent, it is hard not to feel a bit let down about this game. This is a shame really, considering how atmospheric this game really is.The Amnesia HPL game engine succeeds in giving a real sense of weight to the machinery, and together with the sound design it actually manages to fully drag you in at certain moments in the game.What the game lacks is partially some of the gameplay mechanics that made the original Amnesia what it is today. This current system is simplifield, which in a way breaks the sense of helplessness the original game introduced.The game is also extremely linear, which might not necessarily be a bad thing, but compared to the original it feels way too limited and scripted. On the other hand, the way the story is told could have suffered from too much freedom as well.All these areas of critique are, however, intensified by this being a successor to what could arguably be, the best and most well designed horror game of all time.If you can look past its flaws, this is a short and sweet horror experience that is still one of the better examples of how the genre is presented today. Fans of steampunk and fiction with elements of horror won't be dissapointed, just don't set your initial expectations too high.			"

												As a lot of people already said it, no this is not the same experience as The Dark Descent. But that doesn't make AMFP a bad game. These two games are very Lovecraftian in the idea, and that's about it for the similarity. TDD was more focused on the gameplay and the basic human fears, fear of dying, of the dark, of the unknown, etc.AMFP was more focused on the story, it was a psychological kind of horror, the fear of what you would discover, what might have happened.The story of AMFP is very good, the music is beautiful (Jessica Curry did a wonderful job), and the ending... there is no words to describe it.So even though I think TDD is a wonderful game, I enjoyed AMFP a lot more.

It is more of a story driven game, and the story is unlike anything I have ever seen before.  It is so eerie, uncomfortable, and downright eye opening, it is an experience in gaming I can't say I have had before. Almost acting as a sort of strange documentary to the things that may be going on in the world at this very moment. It is amazing. Remember friends, This world is a machine, A Machine for Pigs.			"

												Atmosphere.For any kind of horror game the most important factor is its atmosphere.

												Once in a while, a great game comes out. That game becomes famous. And then, when a sequel comes out, it’s made simpler, easier and more “accessible”. That’s what happened here.The only good things about it are the extraordinary voice acting and the story. The actors knew this was a serious game and took it that way and the story is good enough to keep you from uninstalling before you finish it.You no longer have to manage which torches or candles you light up. There’s no more insanity, so you can be in the dark and look at enemies all the time you want. Puzzles are mostly just picking something up and taking it from one place to the other.This game is also hardly scary. It only scared me three times in four hours.It doesn’t have many jump scares, but you don’t need them to make a game scary. Some of the things that made the prequel scary were moments like hiding in a room and then, when an enemy entered the room, hoping he wouldn’t look at where you were. Or having an enemy chasing you and you knew you couldn’t outrun it. You had to close doors or setup obstacles on your way. The sequel has none of this.My main problem with it is the difficulty. I’ve been playing video games regularly since 1993 (even earlier, if you count electronic games) and this was the very first non-racing/sports/strategy game ever that I finished without dying. And I’m not even that good. Before this, my best survivability record was only dying twice when I finished “Sonic Chaos” for the first time with Tails, when I was a teenager. When I became aware of my “invincibility”, I stopped being afraid of the pigs.“Amnesia: The Dark Descent” will be known in History as one of the greatest horror games. “Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs” will be a footnote saying there was a sequel. Well, I hope Frictional Games made plenty of money with this use of the Amnesia name.			"

												It's very hard to shine if you stand in the shadow of your bigger brother. Amnesia 2 really can not hold a candle to its predecessor in terms of ambience and overall gameplay. No time pressure because your lamp cannot run out of fuel. You see the enemy very very early, that really takes away a lot of tension. Also it's pigs... that's not scary.			"

												Not quite sure how I feel about this game. I mean, it's scary and all, but I don't think it's as scary as TDD. And I believe the problem lays in the fact that it was not developed by Frictional Games, but was made instead by the Chinese Room. A company that's only well known title is ""Dear Esther"" and very lack luster 'Adventure' game.

												If you approach it as a sequel to Amnesia, you will be sorely dissapointed.If you can seperate it from that title, and instead think of it as a unique title, you're more likely to enjoy it. I really enjoyed my time with A Machine For Pigs, although I'm not sure ""enjoyed"" is the right word for a game that made me feel incredibly uncomfortable for its duration. It uses sound to more effectively disturb the player than many other games ever hope to do, and while it makes just as many missteps as it does successes, overall, I think A Machine for Pigs is a trip worth taking.Just please, don't expect Amnesia 2.

												As an Amnesia game? It's not good. But looking at the developer that was obvious. The chinese room is amazing at atmosphere and if this game was a cheap short jaunt into the machine it would have been amazing.This however?Got dull. There was almost no thrill to be found, things got old, the enemies were incredibly repetative for how little they actually appeared (One was added at the VERY end, only to be used twice. There were a number of times I could see irritating clipping. The voices, while done well droned on.Overall, while I LOVED games like Gone Home and Dear Ester, this  game? It was just boring. I KNEW what my character did for the longest time in the game, yet it get droning on about it so I was just left there waiting for the penny to drop.There was only...twice where I had anything close to a bit of fear. Once you realise that most areas literally have NO threats to you, you just rush through.That's another thing. It's only 5 hours long? A part of what padded out the playtime of the original amnesia was the need to collect oil, tinder and the fun you had when you got bored of just throwing♥♥♥♥♥♥around. This game has NONE of that. You just move through the levels, no need to explore.The most interesting part of this game to me was the very beginning. Exploring the house and discovering more about the characters. As it started to decend into the machine though it, again, got dull.One thing that really bugged me is that I REALLY wanted to see the machine properly. To look at it in it's glory but the draw distance on those objects was far too short and I doubt there was much effort in designing something the player wouldn't see. another thing was small graphical things. Clipping and noticing spots where textures didn't meet, creating a gap where there was no texture. Yes many games have those and I was willing to look past that but at the very end there were two spots, the convayer belt leading to stairs where your children are constantly appearing in the alcoves, watching you. The  belt clips into the stairs at the end. For such a cinematic part it really killed it for me.Then, at the end where you get into the chair. It really bugged me that he had no body, EVEN then. It was the very end of the game and you only had one thing left to do. Yet you were just a floating camera, no body, no anything. AND then when those arms come down they clip through a part of the console you just used. Overall it just didn't feel like fun or worth the time I put into it.			"

												I was a HUGE fan of The Dark Descent and Penumbra's style of horror and I was so very excited for MfP to come out.  To my dismay, after completing the game in less than 2 hours (compared to more than 10 for TDD) I was left feeling completely unsatisfied.  I did not speed through the game by any means and in fact, only really got slowed down by the common obtuse puzzle.  The game left me incredibly unsatisfied and here is why.Throughout the entire game, ignoring the last half hour or so, you encounter the monster probably twice.  Both times, the encounters lasted less than a minute or two as I just wait for the monster to walk past and exit through a door or just sneak past while he patrolled the area.  This aspect almost completely killed the atmosphere after the first 45 minutes or so when I realized that the monster is never a threat.  During the last half hour of the game when it bizarrely turns into a Michael bay sequence of explosions and pigs running everywhere doing little dances, I basically ran through it all because they were never a serious threat.  There is also no sanity meter and no pickups in the game whatsoever including fuel for your lantern which makes it less important than it was in previous games to scour your environment to find necessary items.  Having the items absent on their own isn't necessarily a bad thing but there is nothing else other than the notes to encourage exploration except when desperately searching to find ""missing item #x"" to progress past the latest puzzle.Along the lines of not encouraging exploration is the level design itself.  Much of the game is claustrophobically linear to a fault and feels very forced at times with locked doors absolutely everywhere in the game.  This felt like it was designed in a way to keep the story's pacing from coming to a screeching halt for too long or to keep the puzzles from becoming even more complex.This game is also developed solely by The Chinese Room (unknown to myself until after, I had thought they were simply working with Frictional Games) who are best known for making Dear Esther.  The story for MfP is absolutely impenetrable for many if you don't get the symbolism involved and you don't read the notes scattered around the map (because of the aforementioned lack of items).  When I made it to the end of the game, many things began to make sense but a lot of the circumstances leading up to the game's introduction made very little sense to me.The other issue I have, while a small gripe, is with the graphics of the game.  They look uglier than TDD mainly due to the dark brown camera filter that is placed over 80% of the game as opposed to simply being in the environments' color palate.  While TDD's color palate was more of a bluish hue which ironically promoted a sense of calm in the player when in shadows (blue being a calming color and most visibly present when your ""eyes"" adjust to the darkness in-game).With those negatives in mind, I must say that despite the lack of a real threat in the game, the game's atmosphere and soundtrack are incredibly tense and deserve mention as the game could almost be carried entirely by the atmosphere imo.  If there was one thing that kept me pinned down behind some boxes with my eyes wide and unblinkingly searching the room for potential threats, it was the atmosphere.The voice acting is also very emotional and I was quite moved by many story sections leading up to the game's conclusion.  I wasn't bawling over it but it left me in a very sorrowful mood though in a good way.  By the end of the game, except for my lack of understanding the story behind it all, I genuinely cared about the protagonist's goal and once again the soundtrack helps emphasize these moments beautifully.  While I didn't understand the finer points and symbolism hidden within the game's story, I got enough of an idea to find it interesting, though the dominant symbolic idea (pigs) quickly grew repetitive by the end of the game's very short runtime.With all this in mind, I do not recommend this game to anyone but those who liked Dear Esther AND aren't too picky with their horror experience.  The Chinese Room very obviously wanted to make another game like their previous game but also wanted to make it seem like an Amnesia game what with a monster to chase you and physics puzzles to solve.  Stripping out much of what made the previous game and other Penumbra so unique and even making the monster a rare occurrence took out much of the soul of this game.  I know there is much deeper meaning within this game than I could really understand but it should not be the only part about this game.  If they had just added more encounters with the monster in this game that were actually dangerous, while still keeping everything else the same, this game would have been incredible if not damn-near perfect.  As it is, this feels more like ""Dear Piggies"" than an Amnesia game or really a horror game of any kind.  An incredible atmosphere and believable voice actors could not save this game from feeling like more than a rather mediocre custom story from TDD.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is the sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent.The game takes place at the end of 1899 in London. You play as Oswald Mandus, a rich industrialist who awakens at the beginning of the game in his mansion with no memory of his recent past. It seems the he has lost his two sons and his wife is may be dead. There is something very strange going down with regard to pigs in and around his home and adjacent factory. You move through the ominous mansion in first person, piecing together your troubled past courtesy of notes, the odd entry in your journal, sound recordings that play on Victrola-like devices and even telephone conversations with a mysterious man who may have your children held captive in the bowels of the factory.You guide Mandus through the game, you will often face problems that need solving in order to progress. Most of the time you will just have to pull a level or two, sometimes having to retrace your steps in order to find the item that goes into the item-shaped hole. This all sounds very basic, and it is.In the previous game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, players had to carefully manage the oil in their lamps, while also attempting to maintain their sanity. A Machine for Pigs abandons this gameplay mechanic entirely. You have a lamp, with unlimited power and any notion of turning insane, simply is not present.With unlimited supplies, players are free to explore without hindrance; a feature which will make some players happy and others not so much. Those who enjoyed the sense of fear and pressure evoked when running low on supplies in The Dark Descent, will find A Machine for Pigs a little disappointing in this respect. There are tons of creepy sounds throughout the game and a lot of great music too, some of it is beautiful and haunting, while some is very creepy and vile.A Machine for Pigs has increased graphics compared to The Dark Decent, but it has less gameplay features that made the game easier and also the survival horror aspect is reduced compared to the first “Amnesia”.All in all, I can still say that Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a game that all horror fans should play. The soundtrack alone will make most people feel fear, with the visuals and gameplay certainly not taking much away from the experience.Sounds 10/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 5/10Atmosphere 7/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is an interesting game. Those who seek a deep emotional storyline with a few creepy thrills in them, might find this game a game for them. However, the hardcore Amnesia/Horror fans will be quite dissapointed. I never finished the original for being too horrifying, however this game I have played out in 3.6 hours. And I must say, I haven't been jumping out of my chair. The voice acting and story is very sublime, Audioeffects does make you feel on edge, however, it has no scary moments. Except for running away from the ""pigmen"". And the soundtrack is amazingly good. I recommend this game for those who seek for a little thrill and a good story.			"

												Very different from what you would expect from Frictional Games, but it is The Chinese Room who has developed the game.All in all without going into detail, it's a very straight forward plot with very predictable actions. The ending is a bit ""neh"" due to that. I would not call it a sad, scary or intense game at all. It's alright by means that it has a plot. The engine is the same as the previous game with some new objects added. The scariest thing for me was properly the trophy room, which you probably will understand why if you see it. The game is not worth the 12 euro I gave for it for the story and graphics, but I'm sure it's worth the effort the developer put into it, considering the game is almost a year late!If you like scary games, then this is probably not the game for you. It concentrates on instant shocks rather than atmosphere. It lacks the ambience in most parts of the game, but you are able to hear the soundtracks in the rather important parts. Lots of puzzles, but they are easy enough to figure out.The game is VERY metaphorically! Basically everything is considered a metaphor for something else, so beware of that! My recommendation for the game: 6/10The story is not horrible, but it misses out on some points, and is very predictable. It's not a Frictional Game production and you can clearly feel the difference, however if you want to check it an almost scary game, then this is probably the right for you. Ambience could be better by creating an atmosphere instead of just listening to the sounds of the machine.			"

												I'll start off by saying I never played through The Dark Descent personally, so I couldn't fairly compare the two even if I wanted to. However, as a stand alone title, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing experience. Play alone, at night, with noise cancelling headphones. Observing the story unfold is a great reward unto itself, but the fact that you are interacting with a three dimensional world creates a sense of surrealism that helps the dark themes to permeate through your psyche and truly makes you believe that you cannot escape the infernal machine.

												Although this game isn't as good as Amnesia: the Dark Decent, it's fairly enjoyable and creepy. The plot isn't all that great and it isn't as immersive as the previous game, but it's interesting. I have no complaints about the game mechanics except for the lantern. The lantern has an infinite burn time, you don't need to go find oil for it. I think that limiting lantern use makes the game more creepy. It does attract the antagonist, but you can easily outrun him. The AI for them is a bit lacking compared to The Dark Decent.The atmosphere will make you reluctant to continue with the game. I played 20 or 30 minutes at a time before I got completely creeped out and stopped to play less creepy games.I'll give it 6/10 simply because the plot was so lacking and the infinite lantern.			"

												This game has great atmosphere and story but lacks action. Unlike the first Amnesia game you wont find yourself running from monsters all that much, although there are parts where you will need to and that will make you panic. You have unlimited light source and it steers you towards enjoying the scenery rather than hiding in cupboards, mainly seeing an enemy will be a scripted part of the game. This is ok though because even though you can more or less figure the story out eventually, its still interesting and fun not knowing whats around the next corner or what the mysterious man on the phone will say next, its just not the same as the first if thats what you're expecting.

												I didn't like the first Amnesia game due to it's tedious gameplay mechanics, but this installment isn't good either.It lacks a creepy atmosphere and storytelling. Puzzles are repetive and too easy.The enemies aren't scary at all, and easily avoided by running away.It took me literally 15 secs to figure out how to 'kill' the endboss, because all you ever do in this game is pull levers.The game is also way too dark, even with the torch on you barely can see the environments at all, instead of making it 'scary', the gameworld becomes dull and repetitive.

												Fans of Amnesia: The Dark Descent may find the sequel a bit dissapointing in terms of scariness.  Don't get me wrong, it's still plenty more frightening than most so called 'Horror' games, but without wishing to ruin certain game aspects, I found myself a lot less tense playing the sequel than I was with the original.  The story of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs takes more of a center role, wheras it was more of a guiding factor in The Dark Descent, and in this aspect it's definately more engaging, particularly the ending.   If you like horror games, it's definately worth checking out.  Just try not to hold it up to The Dark Descent in expectations.			"

												Very different from what you would expect from Frictional Games, but it is The Chinese Room who has developed the game.All in all without going into detail, it's a very straight forward plot with very predictable actions. The ending is a bit ""neh"" due to that. I would not call it a sad, scary or intense game at all. It's alright by means that it has a plot. The engine is the same as the previous game with some new objects added. The scariest thing for me was properly the trophy room, which you probably will understand why if you see it. The game is not worth the 12 euro I gave for it for the story and graphics, but I'm sure it's worth the effort the developer put into it, considering the game is almost a year late!If you like scary games, then this is probably not the game for you. It concentrates on instant shocks rather than atmosphere. It lacks the ambience in most parts of the game, but you are able to hear the soundtracks in the rather important parts. Lots of puzzles, but they are easy enough to figure out.The game is VERY metaphorically! Basically everything is considered a metaphor for something else, so beware of that! My recommendation for the game: 6/10The story is not horrible, but it misses out on some points, and is very predictable. It's not a Frictional Game production and you can clearly feel the difference, however if you want to check it an almost scary game, then this is probably the right for you. Ambience could be better by creating an atmosphere instead of just listening to the sounds of the machine.			"

												Alright. Before I go on, I will start by saying this is an excellent game in its own right, and it is very much worth playing, the vast majority of my concerns for this game stem from comparing it to it's predecessor. But more on that in a moment.What I liked about A Machine for Pigs:The music. Music in games is always a big factor for me, and this soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. I adore Jessica Curry, and her work here is just as well-crafted as in Dear Esther. It absolutely defines the atmosphere, and complements everything going on in the game wonderfully. The atmosphere. Very, very well-done. The game starts in a very domestic atmosphere, which has it's own nightmarish qualities, and eventually segues into this vast demonic machine complex which is confusing and oppressive, and I love it. Very dark, very tense, very good.The plot and themes (mostly). [POTENTIAL SPOILERS] The plot of this game draws a lot on the concepts of the first. Self-induced amnesia, in an attempt to undo the unspeakable deeds the protagonist has committed, nothing new. But it is the context in which this is done that sets it wildly apart. Whereas the first game has the protagonist a victim, slowly turned psychotic in his work, this one has the protagonist as a monster on such a larger scale. The themes of industrialization and dehumanization are fascinating, and portrayed in very unnerving and gut-wrenching modes. I say that I mostly liked the plot, however, because I am utterly baffled by the ending. Maybe I'm stupid, maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention, but I just did not understand it at all. I feel like there was some huge twist and it was completely lost on me. What I did not like:Other elements of the plot [VAGUE SPOILERS CONTINUE] were poorly delivered, jarring, or incredibly predictable. Twists and revelations fell flat because you had seen them coming from ten miles away. I'm not sure if the character of Mandus is in massive denial or if he's just that dense sometimes, at the repetition of certain elements of the story. Overall the story really felt incomplete.[END SPOILERS]Removal of literally every gameplay element from the first game. Your lamp is unlimited, tinderboxes are not a thing that exists, you have no health or sanity bar. I think the sanity thing is the worst offender. There is now no consequence for looking at monsters, which destroys half of their menace, there is no consequence for sitting around in the dark the whole time. And now that your health regenerates, there;s really no sense of desperation if you come away from a creature encounter poorly.The horror. It was weak at best. I was infinitely more unnerved by the themes, setdressing, and practices of Mandus' processing plant than I was by any of the game's overt attempts to scare me. I think the moment I realized this was going to be disappointing in the horror department was my first concrete encounter with a monster. I saw it turning a corner and I froze and put my lamp away, all well and good, got the adrenaline flowing just like old times, but then I go down to where it is, and after hiding in the corner trying to get past it, it sees me, chases me into a dead end, and proceeds to..... do nothing? I'm not sure if this was scripted so that your first encounter with a monster was tense but safe, or if it was just a glitch. Either way it ruined the scariness of the monsters from then out.Even after that though, the monsters are unresponsive, slow, and generally less than terrifying. There were a few moments of true terror in this game, but they were few and far between, and not due to the monsters at all. Overall, I have some very saddened disappointment toward this game. I expected it to be everything the first was, if not more, and that was my mistake. Regardless, it is an excellent game, especially viewed in it's own light and not in comparison to it's precursor.7/10			"

												A lot of people reacted very negatively to this game because they were expecting the same game as the original.  In this regard, it is true, AAMFP fails.  Where The Dark Descent was a shining example of survival horror, AAMFP is much more in the direction of an interactive story, like Dear Esther.  That's not to say that AAMFP had no elements of a survival horror whatsoever - there were still more than a couple points that require quick thinking to get out of a tight situation.  However, expect much less focus on puzzles and escaping from monsters and more focus on storytelling.  If this doesn't sound appealing then AAMFP is not for you.  It's clear that Frictional Games took the backseat in production of this game and let The Chinese Room do their thing.However, as an interactive, Dear Esther style story, AAMFP is excellent.  It's immersive environment and engrossing plot kept me playing steadily until the end.  The truly awesome visuals and powerful soundtrack are incredible.  The sprinkling of Aztec themes and recurring plot elements were always fun to find.  I enjoyed AAMFP, but only because I can look past ATDD.If you're expecting a sequal to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, don't buy this game.  If you want to buy this game, do it expecting a game more oriented towards interactive storytelling and less towards survival horror.  But do expect an incredible ride!			"

												While AMFP stumbles in a few ways, it's still a fun, albeit short, play. It excels at psychological horror, but the lack of real threat takes the teeth out of the gameplay. The full light monster reveals are another poor choice, and the extremely linear areas play more like a strict narrative than a puzzle adventure. This is a completely different game than TDD, and should NOT be treated as a sequel. With that said, it's a fun game in its own right, but could have benifited from the mechanics present in its predessecor.It actually would have been interesting if the gameplay style found here was an easier game mode where you can focus on exploring the story. AMFP is more accessible than TDD, but as a result, a lot less scary.			"

												If you played the first Amnesia game, then you just need to know that its allmost the same game but in diiferent settings - the overall feel doesnt diviate much from the first and its both a good and a bad thing.. This is survival horror in its truest form - you cant fight back, your only choice is to sneak and hide if you are attacked. Amnesia : A machine for pigs is pretty much a form of ghost story, with some cool twist every now and then, build around the notion that what you dont see is a hell of a lot more scary, than the things you DO see.. A good advice though - if you are not into reading every lillte note you find in the game, then dont buy this, cause you wont get half of the creeping feeling from it that you should.. A bit on the linear side, but still a very cool story thats worth going all the way to the end for - especially if you like atmosfear and soundscapes..8/10			"

												After playing the first Amnesia: The Dark Descent, I had high expectations for it's sequel. But alas, seems like the company sold out and decided an investor or co-company make the sequel. What bothers me about the game is that it is so linear now that you're shoe-horned into every single path. It feels cramped and very forced. Not being able to make small descicions like; which room to explore first, where to go, exploration bonuses, hidden easter egs; ruins the amnesia experience for me. And this game feeled like an half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥effort to copy the original.I would recommend it for the story, but the horrible gameplay overall and the descicions made by the creator brings it down many nothces.

												Not quite a full-blown sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent but a spiritual successor that's a fantastic horror experience in it's own right.The Chinese Room prove, once again, that they are more than capable of crafting a dark, deep and thought provoking story. The fantastic physics engine from TDD is still here - increasing your immersion with the game world and keeping you constantly on-edge. AAMFP is downright disturbing and terrifying at points; I had flashbacks to my first time playing Silent Hill 1 at various points during play. Highly recommended for fans of psychological horror!

The game overall is less terrifying than Dark Descent as well as being more linear and puzzles which are hardly worth calling puzzles, but seriously do not shrug this on off.

And I must say, I haven't been jumping out of my chair. The voice acting and story is very sublime, Audioeffects does make you feel on edge, however, it has no scary moments. Except for running away from the ""pigmen"". And the soundtrack is amazingly good. I recommend this game for those who seek for a little thrill and a good story.			"

												Interesting first-person horror game that is grounded in social/political commentary about the ills of society and man's effort to save humanity from self-destructing (albeit in a morbid way involving lots of pigs). Also deals about the consequences of playing God in order to make that happen. Play this game for the slow-building tension and suspense that accompanies a profound story about one man's quest for redemption in an unforgiving world.Overall, this game is nowhere near as scary as the first Amnesia. The first game was more focused on instilling a constant fear and dread in players, while this sequel is more focused on having players slowly unravelling the sad story of one man's ambition. Puzzles are boring but easy (I rarely ever got stuck and the lantern in this game has endless energy so you won't have to worry about finding matchboxes like the last game. Get this game on sale for 5 bucks because I bought it for the same price and spent 5 hours to complete it, even as I explored the levels for the notes that added to the games' story. "

I wouldn't categorize AMFP as a horror game, though it definitely had some scary moments/sequences (at least for me). Rather, it's more of a game with elements of horror and an interesting (albeit rather dark) story that you get to experience. And in my opinion, the tense and, at times, terrifying atmosphere coupled with the overarching narrative make it a game, and a story, worth experiencing.			"

No, this game is about eveloping your soul into a creepy, disconcerting atmosphere and telling you a horrific tale, and it does those things damn well. The grapics, lighting, and architecture are overall fantastic. The Score and sound design are some of the best I've heard. The story is creepy and bizarre.This is definitely worth the play. It's only about 5 hours long and it's best played with lights off, headphones on, and completed in 1 or 2 play sessions. The controller support is perfect as well.			"

Although I have not played Dark Descent, I still believe that this game was successful in freaking the crap out of me. The developers of this game do not establish horror through jump scares and immediate danger, but rather through the atmosphere which makes the game feel like you are always in danger. The story was excellent and extremely original and overall I highly recommend buying it. The extensive story also makes it interesting to play with friends  and the overall experience has made me a fan of the franchise.

												I will be making this relatively short review a positive one for one reason alone.That is that it's not a review of an Amnesia sequel.Much more so than its predecessor, the game feels and acts like an interactive movie, being 110% linear with less exploration than a retired Indiana Jones trying to find his way to bed. It is, like previous titles, heavily narrated at certain points, and most of the story and background story is told through this narration, or pieces of paper. While it does indeed have a very interesting story, any survival horror game should focus on a mix between both story, gameplay/immersion, and ambiance, one of which is lacking almost entirely to most players because:If you go into this expecting an Amnesia experience, you're going to be extremely disappointed and left with horrible gameplay that is impossible to immerse yourself in the way you're used to. But if you remove the word ""Amnesia"" from the title, and focus on it as a standalone survival horror game, it tries and does a relatively good job compared to other titles of the genre when the game came out. Inventory, oil, insanity, all is removed from the game because believe it or not, it ruined immersion at the worst possible times, by making you fall over and gurgle at the mere sight of an enemy, tumble around the dark tediously clicking everything... Before falling over and gurgling at the darkness, or by just leaving you clueless and aimlessly wandering back and forth until you find that one thing you use once and never again to unlock the next area of exploration. This game removes all of these tedious, immersion-breaking aspects and leaves you with a fully immersive game that does not feel like a traditional game at all.A Machine For Pigs is an immersive experience above that of The Dark Descent... If you have not played The Dark Descent. And if so, I would recommend that you play this before playing The Dark Descent, as this game WILL disappoint you, should you play its predecessor first.Remove ""Amnesia"" and I give it a solid 8/10 as an independent horror game. Should I have reviewed it as a sequel, I'd have given it a 2-3/10.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs satisfied my persistent morbid curiosity and my craving for an atmospheric horror game.The game relies on heavy-handed, fantastical themes, and it commits to them fully throughout. It works. The writing is over-embellished, yes, and it suits the game just fine and is fun to read.It is a great little horror story, one of my favorites in gaming.This game shares a few similarities with Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but should not be regarded as a sequel. I adore The Dark Descent, and I assure you this is not the way to replicate that experience. A Machine for Pigs is simply a similar game which shares the main essential plot device: you play as a character who wakes up with amnesia, and you need to explore to unravel the mysteries of recent events and what happened to you. This framework is very effective and A Machine for Pigs is justified in putting it to use once again for another romp through horror-filled corridors.For those that do play The Dark Descent first, you will find a few nods to its story within A Machine for Pigs, allowing for more layers of terror.So, A Machine for Pigs:You will explore, and you will glimpse things, but the information you gather is where the real horror lies. I like that about this game. I found that I was more frightened by what I could not see, as is often the case with the human imagination.This is a short game. It doesn't overstay its welcome. The story is concise and the pace is very good. While playing through I appreciated how tight everything was. In this case I'll take a short, powerful punch of a game over something drawn out with filler for the sake of a few extra hours of gameplay.I appreciated that there was virtually no backtracking and no repetitive fetch missions. Each new environment felt fresh and progress never halted.The story drives the gameplay.  You can feel the weight of it. A series of horrific events now culminate in this conclusion - where we join the game - where a character's journey will unfold over the course of a single feverish evening.In most games time is very abstract, but not here. These events feel like they're passing in real time which is a great effect.The mansion was very creepy with some unique imagery. It comes off as memorable, almost a character in its own right.I'm glad there were almost no jumpscares, and they kept ""chase sequences"" to a minimum so they did not lose their effect.I enjoyed the gruesome nature of the game, and I was left wanting more information and details. In regards to morbid curiosity, there was plenty to gawk at.I thought the character models would benefit from a few aesthetic changes. They were nearly perfect but needed to be tweaked to be truly scary. The animations were lacking for me.The lightsource was necessary only at some points. I thought it could have been implemented better, and it should have flickered more sporadically. I must insist the game benefits greatly from being completed in one sitting, or a single day. Considering the runtime of 4-5 hours, I urge players to save it for when you can play to completion. It is important to immerse in the game, read all of the writings and infer what you will about ""what lies beneath...""Buy it on sale! When I found out the game was shorter with simpler gameplay, I just stalked it forever on Steam until it finally went on sale for the first time. It was a long wait but I wanted to play it and I got it for a price I thought was fair.I am very happy to have this game in my growing horror collection on Steam. If you're anything like me (if you love horror but find that nothing scares you) my advice is to try to let yourself be scared. Similar to when you're viewing a horror movie, it's much more fun if you go in with the right attitude of wanting to be scared. You have to buy-in in order to get the experience. Always play in the dark with headphones and avoid distractions or interruptions. (Old, tired sentiments, I know. But I have to remind myself to buy-in sometimes.)			"

												I actually don't mind this game that much. Yes I am disappointed in a few things such as: not losing sanity and never needing to replenish supplies, but I personally don't mind it being a walking simulator. The game isn't as scary, but the story and music are very interesting. I came in open minded and thus more accepting of the big differences between this game and TDD. I think this game would have gotten higher ratings if it wasn't branded as an Amnesia game, but personally I'm not bothered by it at all. Highly recommend this game but only on sale as there isn't much replay value and it is a short experience.			"

												I know it might not be the same thing as The Dark Descent, but...In its own way...This game has made a huge impression on me due to the symbolism and storyline involving the industrial era and perhaps even today. This is NOT a typical horror game involving jump scares. It's more about figuring out what is happening, what has happened and what will happen, as well as the meaning of it all. In the end, it is truly rewarding. A lack of inventory system only added to the immersion because there was no extra pause screen to go to try to combine items / use oil or health, or even escape for a moment.

												Although not nearly as frightning as the first game, Machine for Pigs is however, much more story driven, and honestly, much easier to keep up with. Now, I did beat the first game, but once it ended, I had no idea what the heck the whole thing was about. I'm not sure if it is just me, and it was simply too complicated for my feeble mind, or if this game really based on a fever dream one of the developers had one night, but in short, I was totally lost with the story, but damn if I didn't wet my britches while running away from sheer terror.Anyways, Machine for Pigs (No, I have not finished it) so far is a much simplier story, one of which a father is looking for his children, while exploring the giant slaughter house that he inhiereted from his father's rich pork business. Yes, there is not that many scares, and with the few there is are harmless.So pretty much just flip-flop the two focuses of the two games. Dark Descent: Terror > Story;  Machine for Pigs: Terror < Story. Since there was a diffrence between devlopers, there was bound to be diffrences, and I, for one, liked the change of pace, and am eager to see the next projects of the game devs.			"

												I went into this game assuming it had nothing to do with The Dark Descent, and was basically a spiritual successor. However, it played pretty similarly to The Dark Descent, and even had a somewhat related story. It's about half as long, but just as good in my opinion. There is no puzzle-solving to speak of, and you likely won't have a problem with the enemies. The draw of this game is the sense of unease, and concise storytelling--I think I had more consistent fun playing A Machine for Pigs.If you like horror or The Dark Descent, I recommend sticking this on your wishlist and maybe waiting for a sale. It's not as perfect as The Dark Descent, but it's still great.8/10, forever stuck in The Dark Descent's shadow			"

												If you're expecting to have the same expirence as Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you will probably be disappointed.This Amnesia is more story-driven instead of a puzzle-filled spookfest. The visuals are nice and give a very immersive tone to the area around you. There is no inventory, the lantern can last till the end of time and you can't play custom levels/mod your game.Seems like a complete waste of time, but it isn't all that bad.If you would like to waste your time and get a little scared, see what the story is then sure, go ahead.But if you are thinking you will have the same experience as the last game, stay away.I enjoyed it, but not enough to recommend it.

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs despite being another entry to the series, feels like a different game.  The main difference is the larger emphasis on a psychological horror.  Overall it is weaker to the previous Amnesia before it.  Part of this comes from too easily revealing the illusion between a lot of the mechanics.  It ruins the mystery of danger in the game.  Also to note the puzzle solving is simpler than it was before as well.I still reccomend it in the end, but it cannot meet the higher marks the first game had.			"

												Look... Amnesia: the Dark Descent ismy favorite horror game to date, other than Cry of Fear, and Resident Evil 1, but this game is NOT AS SCARY AS AMNESIA. Far from it. the monsters are more visible, removing the terror of anonimity in the first game's monsters, and it's quite linear. However, it is an incredible game nonetheless. If you want more Dark Descent nail-biting horror, then definitely do not buy this. But if you want a gruesome story of betrayal, loss, and  the result of a helplessly sick and twisted mind? This game is it. It's desperately dark, sick, and twisted. I loved every minute of it. To be deep in the guts of the machine was a gut-wrenching and claustrophobic nightmare that few games these days manage to portray.Other points:The game is decently short. I wasn't too disappointed at all, but it isn't a long game. (STILL WORTH PLAYING.)Maybe a bit predictable to some, but my mind was mercifully clueless as to the bigger reveals.Well put together. Few glitches, immersive puzzles and world, and enough inhumanity to satisfy any fan of classic horror stories.Once again, it's NOT AMNESIA QUALITY, but a hell of a good game anyway.			"

												If you liked Amnesia: The Dark Decent and are buying this thinking it's like that, DON'T. This game is nothing like TDD. I was playing for an hour and got maybe 2 jumpscares, 0 monsters, and 0 puzzles. Now I only say zero puzzles because the game blatantly directing you though a puzzle should not be considered a puzzle. I think I saw a couple monsters but they were so far away with no way of getting to me that I was able to just ignore them. As for the jumpscares, that's all they are. once the jump is done that's it, you can relax. Whereas in TDD, the jumpscares led to chases or something else to make the scare last.I give this a 2/10 so far. Maybe the game just takes to long to get started. Lets hope so.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs introduces many changes to the original game's formula, but nevertheless manages to be as, if not far more, scary and aggravating on the player.The inventory system and all related agemplay mechanics are gone, in favor of personally picking up and using right away the proper item in the proper place. Since puzzles weren't exactly the main beef of Amnesia: the Dark Descent, they aren't such in this sequel too.While the monsters encounters are more rare, and the removal of the sanity mechanic make things more manageable, they have been made overall harder: the creatures don't despawn after a short while, the enviroment is far more cramped and the sound hints are often covered by other noisesAmnesia: A Machine for Pigs shows its best suit in the story, voice acting and general atmosphere, which is far more gritty, grotesque and nauseating than in the first game.

												Is this game as scary as Amnesia: The Dark Descent? No, the monsters aren't as disturbing, the sanity and limited lamp oil mechanics are gone in this game (which means, you can look at the monsters directly). Is it as good as The Dark Descent? No, there is no inventory, little exploration and the puzzles are easier. Is it even scary? Well... it's really creepy, the ambient sounds are good, the monster noises are chilling, and when the hell breaks loose, you get the sense of urgency to get all fixed once for all.Then why do I recommend it? Mostly because of the plot. As in the original, you want to get this over once for all. And as you descend, you begin to discover the story of a man playing God. But no, it was something far worse. But most of all, it's a critic about society and human civilization.Bottom line. This game it's definitely inferior to the first Amnesia, but it's not a bad game. It has a creepy plot with a scary meaning, in a very adequate environment. So I recommend to buy it when it's on sale.			"

It removes a lot of elements that TDD had to focus more on the story.  And it's a decent story, albeit kind of convoluted.  A lot of things happen pointlessly, various mechanics and whatnot.

A Machine for Pigs is far more leasurely, allowing one to take in the late 19th century great industrial machinery aesthetic oozing with lovecraftian horror, at ones own pace. And it is lovely, it is sad and ghastly. It does not inspire terror, it does not frighten terribly, it does not push you away... it pulls you inside, into the heart of the machine.

												I might as well say that this game is far from as scary as Amnesia: the dark decent.Allthough this game lack some scare factor it still works it wonders. As of now i haven't finished the game because of a game crash,You should be able to save at will instead of saving and quiting or rely on the auto saves as i have to play for about 30 min before reaching the point i was at prior to the crash. This ruins it for me as the game is linear and you rally don't have a reason to play through it twice.I have played through amnesia: the dark decent three time and it still gives me chills. This game however would be lucky if it could scare me on the second playthorugh.The monsters in this game lack some level of scaryness and i don't really fear rushing on as there are no scary audio that backs up the fact that they are chasing me, and when they see you, it is not very hard to run away. If you tried that in amnesia :TDD you would be killed before getting anywhere and the scary music would make me take a 2 day break in an instant The game also removed the inventory and it also have no sanity bar(or health meter) also you no longer need to rely on tinderboxed and oil to progress, there are no wardrobes to hide in either. Taking all of this things away is like taking away key parts of the originalWhile you still can't fight the game doesn't make it challenging at all. It is a cakewalk at least until the part i am at. And there are only a couple of jumpscares, other than that it is the usual thrill when you get to see the monster for the first time.Compared to Amnesia: the dark decent i don't think this game does it justice, but the game is fairly scary and i would recommend it to fans of Amnesia			"

												Although different from the classic it follows, Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs doesn't fail because its bad, it fails because it isn't scary. Although conceptially disturbing, no sense of horror is felt beyond the first hour of the game once you meet the pigs. There's something about them, something I can define that just renders them unscary, whether it is because of the stripped out Sanity mechanic that deters you from glaring at the bacon-on-legs as it squeels fall hallow and its strike inflict enough damage to perhaps dent a spoon, or the concept that these creatures are not hunting you like the grunt of Amnesia: The Dark Decent, they just don't work. The narrative is perhaps the only thing I can recommend but even that is convoluted and (forgive the pun) ham-handed in its delivery. The idea is sound and if you are more into interactive fiction in the way of stopping every two seconds to read the story out of a journal then go ahead but for me, the point that the story no longer held weight was when a teleporting 'tesla pig' popped out its snout. I wish I was joking.

												Although different from the classic it follows, Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs doesn't fail because its bad, it fails because it isn't scary. Although conceptially disturbing, no sense of horror is felt beyond the first hour of the game once you meet the pigs. There's something about them, something I can define that just renders them unscary, whether it is because of the stripped out Sanity mechanic that deters you from glaring at the bacon-on-legs as it squeels fall hallow and its strike inflict enough damage to perhaps dent a spoon, or the concept that these creatures are not hunting you like the grunt of Amnesia: The Dark Decent, they just don't work. The narrative is perhaps the only thing I can recommend but even that is convoluted and (forgive the pun) ham-handed in its delivery. The idea is sound and if you are more into interactive fiction in the way of stopping every two seconds to read the story out of a journal then go ahead but for me, the point that the story no longer held weight was when a teleporting 'tesla pig' popped out its snout. I wish I was joking. So yeah, not the worst thing in the world but it definitely trots over the IP with mud stained hoofs, really just look up the machine for pigs ending by rapid retrospect to get the cool payoff monologue instead of slogging through a confusing yet not complex enough story that doesn't make a good use of its videogame platform.

												First and foremost, this is not The Dark Descent. A Machine for Pigs is far more leasurely, allowing one to take in the late 19th century great industrial machinery aesthetic oozing with lovecraftian horror, at ones own pace. And it is lovely, it is sad and ghastly. It does not inspire terror, it does not frighten terribly, it does not push you away... it pulls you inside, into the heart of the machine. With a fantastic soundtrack.			"

												This game gets an unfortunate bad rap.  It's a great game, just one needs to understand what they're getting into when they play it.This is more like Dear Esther, which is understandable since it was developed primarily by the Chinese Room, the same dev team.  Thus, it plays more like an intereactive novel.  The point of the game is the experience of it: the mood, the atmosphere, the story.  If you let yourself get immersed in the experience I think you might find that you enjoy it very much, if you enjoy Lovecraftian tales of personal dread.It's a different type of game than A:TDD, really, in both gameplay and mood.  And that's ok, it's still enjoyable.  Just understand what you're getting and engage it on that level.			"

												Now before you go bashing this game for not being as scary as the first, please go play it all the way through. There's a real respect you [should] have for this masterpiece. Now if you're an avid horror game fan, I will admit, this game will most certainly dissapoint you along the way. Although, not as frightening as its predecessor, when the story sinks in, you realize how twisted and crazy this game is that you're playing. Besides, it's so well written and this is what these people love to do!Some of the elements I feel stole away from the suspense were due to a ""lack of"" rather than an ""addition to."" No longer having a solid inventory (minus some notes and a journal), no need for a lantern that runs out of oil leaving you in the dark, no real looting, no health deficiency, no sanity meter, and so on, all once contributed to the strength of the user's play. But that was all missing from this game. And this wasn't really apparent until half way through it. Though, eventually, I had forgotten about it and was so focused on the plot. Without that particular strength, this game would have been a useless play. At any rate, I recommend this game for you mystery fans. Have fun!			"

												Let's get thigns straight: this is a Horror game, not a Terror game. ATDD is a Terror game, a game that exists to scare you out of your wits. This game is nothing like ATDD in terms of terror, but this game can immerse you and envelop you and disturb you in ways equally terrifying. This game was my single most favourite experience of 2013. Even though it lasted just under 3 hours, I have since played it twice over. Everything about this game is incredibly intricately designed. The atmosphere intoxicating; and the music, oh the music that gets inside your head and controls your thoughts.Do not buy this game to be scared and have a bit of a laugh like ATDD, buy this game to play in a dark room, undisturbed with headphones on and the volume cranked to obscene levels. Read each note carefully, and build your own picture on the events of the game's story. Connect with Mandus, and experience his journey through his own creation in (I would say) the best psycological horror game to date. This game is not a game, as such; it is an experience, to be experienced, not so much played. It may as well be a book or a film, but there is not as much personal connection with the character in those mediums. I wholly recommend this game to anyone who is serious about their horror stories, and really everyone old enough to play it. You cannot miss this. Although I do recommend waiting for a sale as it is a tad expensive. Or steal it off a mate, if you liked it, great! if not, so what? you didn't lose out reall, except for a few hours, maybe. So go one, give it a try, and you might even become a pig yourself! "

												Before starting the second installment of the Amnesia series, it is important to note that the property has been handed off from Frictional Games to The Chinese Room. The new developer's slant on the series takes everything that made Amnesia:The Dark Descent what it was and pushes it in a more narrative direction. This is still clearly an Amnesia game - all the physical representations of the character's increasing fear are still present: the blurred screen, the panicked breathing, the random hallucinations. It just has slightly different priorities. There is a story to tell and anything that would get in the way of that has been dealt with. Death results in a respawn to the closest safe space and possibly even the removal of the threat that killed you. Puzzles are made obvious by journal entries and the solutions are never far away. The levels are designed to offer only a few directions at a time, so as easy as it is to get turned around in the dark, it's never hard to get back on track. The old oil lantern has been converted to a more modern electric model and has a near infinite charge. It only needs to be put away to rest every once in a while; there's no fuel or power to watch slowly drain out. The character is in less jeopardy than in the first game, so A Machine For Pigs ends up being less frightening most of the time. The horror now comes from the slow revelation of how appalling the state of affairs has become. This is not a game that wants to scare its players with threats or challenges; its sole focus is on the macabre tale at hand. It's a good thing then that the tale is so compelling.			"

												Overall, I thought that this game was pretty decent and well worth my $5. It started off strong and I found myself a little scared in some parts. The music, the lighting and the music all worked well together to achieve this. However, as the game progressed, it became a little repetitive. Navigate this room, find a note, flip some switches, open doors and occasionally run away from the enemy. What kept me going to the end was the story. I wanted to know the ending. Controls were fairly simple. Move forward, point and click your mouse, occasionally use your lantern and sprint. I had a lot of fun playing it until about 3/4 through where the game got buggy. My game kept crashing at one loading screen, which is apparently common for this game. A few changes to my graphics settings and I was able to continue. I didn't hit a problem until the 2nd last chapter where I encountered a bug that caused my map not to load properly and me to fall to my death. That would have been okay.....but then on respawn, that same bug made it impossible for me to move on to the next stage. A fact that didn't dawn on me until an hour later after dying to the electric Manpig a bunch of times while trying to open a door that was bugged shut. A reload to an earlier save point fixed this however. And almost 7 hours later.... game finished. So, if you're looking for a cheap scare for a few hours and enjoy a decent story, I reccommend this game. I give it a solid 7 out of 10. Points lost for the bugs encountered.			"

												Is this game as scary as Amnesia: The Dark Descent? No, the monsters aren't as disturbing, the sanity and limited lamp oil mechanics are gone in this game (which means, you can look at the monsters directly). Is it as good as The Dark Descent? No, there is no inventory, little exploration and the puzzles are easier. Is it even scary? Well... it's really creepy, the ambient sounds are good, the monster noises are chilling, and when the hell breaks loose, you get the sense of urgency to get all fixed once for all.Then why do I recommend it? Mostly because of the plot. As in the original, you want to get this over once for all. And as you descend, you begin to discover the story of a man playing God. But no, it was something far worse. But most of all, it's a critic about society and human civilization.Bottom line. This game it's definitely inferior to the first Amnesia, but it's not a bad game. It has a creepy plot with a scary meaning, in a very adequate environment. So I recommend to buy it when it's on sale.			"

												I do not understand all the hate and disappointment that the people writing about this game. Fricitional Games is a company with just 7 employed and they don't got the best engine and it can't be easy doing a game like this just on 7 pers. I agree they took a very long time to realase the game and it wasn't that long but it's still live up to the name right? Mr Mandus had an Amnesia. Obviously there are the cons of the game also. I can imagine FG was reaaaally frustrated and just wanted to realase the game. And we all know (atleast should know) a horror game is not just about getting scared. I mean what is the point off just walking around and getting scared? A Machine For Pigs had everything you need in a horror game. Horror, A really touching story and there is really no reason not to get it. If you liked the first game this an awesome sequel and worth every singel cent.+ If you want a really good touching soundtrack this game wont let you down8,5/10 Good Work CR and FG!

The game has lost its fundamental mechanisms: the refillable lamp and the sanity meter. Puzzles are rare and more than easy. I don't even think you can die in this game. Somehow, you could say it's a dumbed-down version of the Dark Descent. But it's not. It's something different. It doesn't aim for the same effects/affects. The narrative is powerful and the setting is unsettling. The story  has this most peculiar lovecraftian quality that makes you realise that what is to fear is not in the fantastic world, but in the real one.

Between the design of the eponymous Machine and the incredible sound design, ""A Machine for Pigs"" does a fantastic job of creating a tense, oppressive environment as you wander the vast, claustrophobic passages of the groaning behemoth.So with the understanding that any sense of actual fear (though not unease, by far) will evaporate after about the third Manpig encounter, and that the game isn't that much longer than a Peter Jackson film, I still recommend giving this game a try.

												I concur with aforementioned reviews acknowledging the fact that A Machine of Pigs is different than The Dark Descent. Having played 'Dear Esther' (also from Chinese Room), I noticed the similarity that the game focuses largely on the narrative and their excellent ability to tell a story that can almost be classified as virtual literature. This causes the game to lose some ground in the interactive part. In itself I don't find this to be a negative point, since too much interactivity can interrupt the flow of a game if not done properly, but I expected the game to have the same balance between scary moment, storyline and interactivity as The Dark Descent. And I think that is the reason why the reviews might be a bit more negative than they might have been if it wasn't so closely related to the Dark Descent. If you can set aside your expectation for the game and play it with an open mind, you're in for a treat.The game is short, for me it was about 5 hours. Thing is, if a game lacks interactivity or the story loses its pace, it might be a good thing to not have the game taking 10 hours. While the story might be good, you don't want to get the reputation that folks want to finish your horror game to see how it ends, but are bored throughout it instead of scared stiff every once in a while. So all in all 5 hours is a good time for a decent horror game. Catch the game on a sale if you want the money to match the amount of game time (I have this arbitrary rule that 1€ = 1h game time to make it worth my while, but that's just my idiosyncrasy).Final verdict: Play it without expecting it to be like The Dark Descent and you will have about 5 hours of good creepy fun.

												I'm going to start this review a bit from the middle. There are way too many freaking notes from the main character. He writes a note after every single thing he does. ""I solved this puzzle! I must now move onwards into this madness!"", ""I opened this door! My epic struggle continues!"", ""I farted into an oven! When will my nightmare end?!"". There is no point to most of them, they provide no worthwhile insight into the mind of the protagonist. Unless you consider him repeating the same god-damn thing in 10 different ways as insight. Other notes are very frequent too. There's a note in every other room. In addition, the game has one of the cringiest lines I have ever had the displeasure to read: The final descent beckons me to enter, as Lily once lay on our wedding bed and summoned me into manhood. I have no idea how the writer decided ""yep, that's an exceptional piece of work, nothing cringeworthy to see here"". Also, I'm not even going to write down the note where a character apparently  is standing naked in front of a mirror and is jacking off to how evil he is . What's more, the game drowns you in needless metaphors and analogies: nearly every note uses elaborate manners of describing the simplest of things. The pretentiousness is palpable at times, which is a shame, since the game's story is overall thought-provoking and worth exploring further. It takes a while to get going, but the ending is pretty intense and I loved the ending monologue from  the Machine . The music is really good and stands out. Enemy encounters very few and far between and are easily avoided by just running past. They lose interest surprisingly fast and are not persistent like the ones in The Dark Descent - just shut a door in their face and they'll leave. This makes the game almost a walking simulator: almost, because you can die... if you stand still and let yourself get hit. As an Amnesia game, is this scary? Nope. Is it worth buying? 4 hours of a good story and soundtrack and notes every 30 seconds: buy for $5 or less.<edit>The ending monologue from  the Machine / Engineer  if anyone's interested:I have stood knee deep in mud and bone, and filled my lungs with mustard gas. I have seen two brothers fall. I have lain with holy wars and copulated with the autumnal fallout. I have dug trenches for the refugees; I have murdered dissidents where the ground never thaws, and starved the masses into faith. A child's shadow burnt into the brickwork. A house of skulls in the jungle. The innocent, the innocent, Mandus, trod and bled and gassed and starved and beaten and murdered and enslaved! This is your coming century! They will eat them, Mandus! They will make pigs of you all! And they will bury their snouts into your ribs, and they will eat. Your. Hearts!</edit>			"

												WOW THAT WAS IT?! Im sure that's what just about everyone else was thinking when you finished AMFP, but that really doesn't do the whole thing justice.Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs was not a direct sequel to TDD, so the fact that there are no similarities between the two, aside from the references to the Orb, shouldnt be suprisingly. Anyway...Yet again, Frictional Games and the Chineseroom have really outdone themselves. After waking up, with minimal idea of whats happening or what had happened to you or your kids, you wander about your mansion in search of clues. The atmosphere was very well done, but like someone had brought up before me in one of those countless online youtube reviews, the introduction of the latern that has infinite energy stomped all over the fear of darkness that you so wholy embraced after playing the first game. That being said, dark areas, even with the latern, are ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying. Not because of your squishy, oink-y looking enemies, but because of the literal framework of the building - overlapping, rusted grating. Doors that look like they might explode outward at any second. Machinery that towers menacingly over you, giving you the idea that the machine really is bigger and more powerful that you. Dark tunnels, leading to no where. The music was very well done along with the level make-up, well timed and very appropriate for the situations they were cued in to. What I noticed to be the biggest difference between Amnesia 1 and 2 is that in 2, there was really a lack of scary moments compared to 1. Since The Chineseroom produced this game, one should expect that story will almost immidiatly become more important that jump scares and chase scenes. They do happen, chase scenes, but the ultimate creep factor of this game comes from the accumulation of the notes, journal entries and audio logs and what they ulitmately mean. I won't spoil the end for you, but just know that the lack of (in the words of the Escapist) ""aboogly woogly woo"" will be made up for in the finale. Im going to keep this brief so as not to ruin the game for you cause you need to get it. You need to. Just do it. JUST.do it.			"

												I read through some of the reviews for this game and it doesn't do the game Justice, I played through Amnesia The Dark Decent and then Machine for Pigs and I can honestly say Machine for Pigs I liked FAR BETTER! Amnesia was scaryier with the insanity meter, and the creatures were eeryier.... the music trailing you and having to always find places to hide was spine chilling. But Machine for Pigs had a far more in depth story, the music relfected the atmosphere of every scene.. I liked how the story played out and the characters a bit more, I liked getting to know the creatures and understanding their side of the story as well as the main characters. A lot of thought was put into this game. Yeah after awhile the creatures arent nearly as scary because you come to understand them and you can study them they don't just disapear all the time. But it adds to it in a different way. I didn't miss the sanity meter it was still there in some ways just it didn't damage your brain. This game is more about the story but it definately kept me on the edge of my seat, lots of scares! The first game makes you feel more on edge, But this one sends chills down your spine and makes you question A LOT of things. The ambience of the scenery and the evolution of all the different aspects of the story were amazing. If your looking to buy this game don't listen to the comments about the game sucking because they took out some aspects of the first one. It is still a DAM GOOD GAME! and its worth buying!!			"

												The most impossibly boring game I've ever witnessed, I've played a little under 3 hours of this game in total and fallen asleep no less than four times in that time. Supposedly this is a ""Horror"" game yet in the almost 3 hours of gameplay there has been nothing in this game that comes close to what I'd consider ""scary"" or ""horrifying"", that added to the poor quality visuals, audio, excruiating slow pace and completely uninterresting story make for a game that's never worth purchasing.Unless you have trouble sleeping, this game could very well help you in that regard.

												I really enjoyed MFP. Different than TDD in many ways but I still think they did a great job. Like TDD, they did perfect creating that creepy atmosphere through the sound effects, music and environment.. still a psychologically thrilling horror, imo it really is good in this department. Of course like any horror game, I think it helps when you play this when its dark outside with the lights out and a pair of good headphones with fully trying to immerse yourself into the story.  I would say its not near as scary as TDD but it had its few moments, at least for me it did. You no longer have an inventory, nor does your lantern need to be refilled, neither do you go insane in this one, elements I did kind of miss at the beginning, but got used to it pretty quickly. I also think I enjoyed this story a tad bit more than TDD. Anyway, I think its worth the purchase and play through.  7.8/10			"

												When you play this game, you should not judge it by the name 'Amnesia', because it is little to nothing like Amnesia. It's little to nothing like an actual game. The puzzles are easy, the enemies rare and easily sidestepped... The only thing that makes this title playable is the story. And that's how you should think of this game. As an interactive story, that you unfold, one phonecall, diary and note at a time. The story is quite good.Our man returns from africa with a terrible fever, and he builds a machine. But  something's not quite right... He brought something else with him too from the Dark Continent. Something that he must stop, before it's too late.Yes, I would recommend this game. 4/5, lost some points because it's short.			"

												Amnesia, a title we all know that strikes us with fear has returned.  Amnesia a machine for pigs is a scary game but fans of the origional amnesia will see that it is not as scary as the origional.  It has gotten rid of many of the origionals components, like the sanity meter, and your lantern know longer requires constant oil supply.  During your time with this game you will be doing alot more puzzle solving, but none of them take long or make you thing ""haha I did it!"" A machine for pigs the enemy is obviously a pig but it is a mechanically enhanced pig that probably wont scare you if you have played the origional.  Michael brown gives this game an 8 out of 10.

												More Lovecraftian than haunted house, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs suffers greatly for being so directly tied to its precursor. Those looking for an experience similar to the Dark Descent will undoubtedly be disappointed. However, beneath the sheep's clothing, there lies a disturbing tale that sums up a century worth of suffering. I recommend Outlast or an alternative horror game for the scares, but I recommend Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs for its narrative morbidity.			"

Posted: November 30, 2014
												It breaks my heart to say it, but this game is NOT good! Long story short, this game is a ""horror"" version of ""Dear Esther,"" which was the previous game made by developers The Chinese Room. If you are not familiar with that game, its basically an interactive novel, which could also be said of Amnesia: AMFP. The problem with this type of game is that it isn't scary!I played Amnesia:TDD and loved it and I waited a year to play AMFP. I read the reviews, both good and bad, and I knew that this game didn't play the same way as TDD, so I wasn't really expecting a sequel to that game. I was ready to play AMFP as its own game and I desperately wanted to love it. However, regardless of how you look at it, whether you compare it to Amnesia: TDD or you take it as its own game, Amnesia: AMFP is neither scary nor fun.First, let me talk about the gameplay: It's extremely simplistic. The primary point of the game is to turn on/off a giant machine or factory. You would think this would offer a lot of opportunities for organic puzzles as you figure out how to operate a complex machine that you have no memory of creating, right? WRONG. I was never confused about what I was expected to do because the game is extremely linear and usually the switch your are supposed to flip is the ONLY switch you can touch! To make matters worse, whenever you enter a new area, you get a journal entry telling you exactly what you are supposed to do, even though you will already know because it's so obvious.The second part of the gameplay is avoiding the pigs, which are the main ""monsters"" in the game. The pig monsters were absolutely terrible for two big reasons: 1) they are NOT scary, and 2) they have terrible AI and are extremely easy to avoid. Every time I entered a new area I attempted to find good hiding places in case the pig monsters would appear, but 80% of the time it was unnecessary because they wouldn't show. That is probably the worst aspect of the game: you rarely ever see the pigs. The few occasions in which you do, they are stupid easy to avoid and don't even kill you instantly, so you can actually run away from them while taking damage and escape! The other element of the game that matters is the story. The story is comprised of documents found throughout the game as well as ""visions"" or scary moments that you have in-game. The creepiest part of the game is your character's two children, which appear and do creepy stuff every now and again. Everything else, just isn't scary. The pig's are scary for about the first 30 minutes of the game and after that, you just get used to what they look like. The storyline makes very little sense and your character's motivations are unclear. It is hard to give an example without spoiling, but the best I can give is the pigs themselves. It is extremely unclear why the pig mosnters exist and what the purpose for their creation is. Ostensibly, they are supposed to kill people, but the giant machine already does that on its own, so why the pigs? This question is never fully answered and even after going on the wiki and reading the full explanation, it still makes no sense.Overall, I was completely devastated by how completely bland, boring, and uninspired this game was. If there is a third game in the works, they need to keep The Chinese Room far away from it!			"

												An unsatisfying, extremely short, mostly non enjoyable, very linear, disappointing sequel without any challenging segments that can be a downright bore.Some good I can say is that the story does eventually culminate in something that feels as big and grand as they were aiming for. Also, some of the environments and machinery looks very good. But really, I just finished it and I'd be really hard pressed to come up with anything else. And both those come with a hitch or two. The story isn't engaging until it's been built and fails to deliver on the whole ""Amnesia"" aspect. And the game is horribly optimized so you can't really enjoy anything when it comes to the graphics or gameplay. Perhaps I was the unlucky one with the perfectly wrong setup but I could not get this game to avoid frame rate drop offs (big ones) on any graphic settings at all. At least 30mins of my gameplay time is adjusting settings. No matter how low and small or how high and big I went the frame rate got beat in to the ground at random spots. And thus detracted from the already shallow gameplay and the pleasant environment visuals. But while this was the most glaring and annoying issue, I can't say my review would change much if the frame rate was a steady 60FPS. Nothing drew me in. You walk. You run. You climb a ladder here and there. You pull a lever. The gameplay is as shallow as it gets. You never have to think or complete a puzzle. You can only interact with what you need and usually its just a couple feet away from where it goes. There's absolutely no mystery as to where you're going or what you should do. Just no confusion at all, no ""Amnesia"" if you will. While the environments look great there's a lack of atmosphere built. Maybe the sound is just average? Maybe the special effects are lacking? I do not know, but it just lacked the atmosphere the first game created as a whole. An hour in I was already looking forward to the end as it began to feel like a tedious chore even though it wasn't really tedious. If that makes sense haha... I just couldn't get drawn in. There was no intensity or panic. I never felt threatened. Even when enemies have a rare appearance in the game a little jog in a circle around an object will buy you the time you need. Just no threats in the game at all. As a standalone game it doesn't offer much at all and as a sequel it is downright awful. I applaud the effort and was able to enjoy some late game moments as things built up in a grand way and the story was more valuable than gameplay. But as someone who just enjoyed Amnesia: The Dark Descent I couldn't be more disappointed in Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. Throw an absolutely atrocious price tag on top all of this and I can comfortably tell you to avoid this game.			"

												I really enjoyed MFP. Different than TDD in many ways but I still think they did a great job. Like TDD, they did perfect creating that creepy atmosphere through the sound effects, music and environment.. still a psychologically thrilling horror, imo it really is good in this department. Of course like any horror game, I think it helps when you play this when its dark outside with the lights out and a pair of good headphones with fully trying to immerse yourself into the story.  I would say its not near as scary as TDD but it had its few moments, at least for me it did. You no longer have an inventory, nor does your lantern need to be refilled, neither do you go insane in this one, elements I did kind of miss at the beginning, but got used to it pretty quickly. I also think I enjoyed this story a tad bit more than TDD. Anyway, I think its worth the purchase and play through.  7.8/10			"

												I personally love the game, and the creators did well, but could have improved.*Pros*- Mind blowing graphics- Unlimited lantern- Did a good job with building tension- Photos and little kids were creepy, especially ""Daaaaddyyyy""- Harry Potter is in the beginning of the game (maybe an easter egg?)- Frictional Games did a good job.*Cons*- Who is this new developer ♥♥♥♥ing this story up?- Unlimited lantern takes its toll, and it could have been more fun if we could have a challenge- Monsters were slow and not even that scary!- Really, the jumpscares get tiring after a while.- Ton of glitches with the chairs and dressers and stuff. I ended up breaking into all of them!- I had to make any cons, I thought it was gonna be incredible!All in all, not good, not bad.			"

												This game is ok, but not nearly as good as Amnesia ""the dark decent"".  Four things really bother me about it...1) the lack of an inventory2) not being able to light candles lamps ect. (no tinderboxes)3) its to dark4) 90% of the game looks the sameI originally thought the game was bugged.  I pressed every key trying to find the open inventory button, then I find out that you have no inventory, really?  Puzzles are solved by carrying the needed object which is more often then not very close to where you need to use it, making for an easy to solve (almost boring) puzzle system.  I liked in the dark decent how objects need to sometimes be carried long distances before you find a use for them *note the chemical puzzle in the dark decent, where you need to combine the 4 acids.*The game takes place in 1899.  Electricity has just been invented and is not widely popular, so why is there so few candles and oil lamps?  No tinderboxes? no light-able light sources?  I think this is what I dislike most about the game.  In the original, players could light candles and torches whenever they feel insecure (which is most of the time).  In ""a machine for pigs"", its so dark and without the option to use light sources, after about 30min the player gets use to it, and the scary effect is lost.  Jump scares are one thing, and this game has many of them, but atmosphere is just as important.  You're given a battery powered lamp that never runs out of juice.  A good thing considering 90% of the game is almost pitch black.  However, I really wish they used an oil lamp instead.  Or even a battery powered lamp that runs out over time.  I liked in the first game how you needed to keep a close eye on your oil so you don't run out at a time when you need it most.  Back to the game being to dark...  In the first game there were really bright rooms occasionally, sometimes with the moon light shining in.  As you play the game and come across a room like this, its a breath of fresh air.  It makes you appreciate the dark rooms a whole lot more.  A nice change of atmosphere, keeps the game fresh and enjoyable to play.  A machine for pigs is pretty much dark all the time, get use to it...I understand that the game is based around old steam technology, which I found very appealing at first.  Especially the part where you have to start the massive steam engine.  Watching that huge flywheel turn around, gave me goosebumps.  Very well done on that part!  However 90% of the game looks the same.  Your constantly walking through maintenance corridors full of steam pipes.  It got dull very quickly.  I just wanted to see something green again, but it never happened.Overall, this game is worth checking out if your an amnesia fan.  If not, I would probably pass it by.  I don't regret buying it, but I probably wont play it a second time.			"

												Much less frightening than Amnesia: The Dark Descent and has no insanity mechanic, which makes it more of a walking simulator than an actual horror game.The dark industrial age Victorian atmosphere is done very well however, I did enjoy my time with this game. Then again I do like walking simulators as well, not just real scary horror games, it could have been so much better.Vid below of my first impression, not all that much happening, the game has a really slow buildup, and this video is mainly just that, so don't expect anything too spectacular.

												A Machine For Pigs is not terribly scary. You are very rarely in any actual danger and even when you are, the game is very forgiving of failure. In many cases, you'll just respawn and the enemies will be gone. The sanity and lamp fuel mechanics of the original game have been removed too. You also have regenerating health. If you're looking for a traditional survival horror experience, A Machine For Pigs will likely disappoint you.That said, if you're looking for an atmospheric and disturbing descent into madness, A Machine For Pigs does that pretty well. The story is twisted and interesting, if a bit predictable, and the environments always feels appropriately ominous. The game's audio is fantastic and really sets the mood. You may never truly fear for your life but the game's presentation will always leave you feeling unsettled.Ultimately, A Machine For Pigs offers a better narrative experience than its predecessor, though the dumbed down gameplay is definitely a step back. If you're willing to overlook its mechanical failings and immerse yourself in the story and atmosphere, A Machine For Pigs is an enjoyable experience.			"

Supposedly this is a ""Horror"" game yet in the almost 3 hours of gameplay there has been nothing in this game that comes close to what I'd consider ""scary"" or ""horrifying"", that added to the poor quality visuals, audio, excruiating slow pace and completely uninterresting story make for a game that's never worth purchasing.Unless you have trouble sleeping, this game could very well help you in that regard.

												The good -- The machine you descend into and explore is beautifully realised, as you watch huge mechanisms working away in the vast darkness around you it really drives home the sense of isolation and loneliness. Much like Dear Esther, the game is very linear but it allows the designers to craft a detailed world for the player to explore.- The sound design and music is probably A Machine for Pigs' best feature. The rumbling and groaning machine feels alive as you move through it, and little stings of music serve to build the atmosphere. The snippets of dialogue both found throughout the game and uttered by the main character as he explores are well acted and clearly depict a man who has lost his mind.- Machine for Pigs is not a fun or enjoyable experience, but it isn't meant to be. Thechineseroom have crafted a story that will make the player feel a range of emotions - as well as terror and revulsion, there are elements of empathy and even pity at certain points. While it ends rather abruptly the story gels with the sound design and creates an experience that, while not exactly fun, definitely stirs up something.The bad -- The game can be finished in less than 5 hours and there is no reason to play through it again. The ability to jump to certain chapters is redundant as its like picking up a book and starting several chapters in, stripping away the context that's needed for this game.- From the start of the game to its conclusion you are on a linear path. Even exterior locations are simply tunnels, skyboxes and events that render alternate paths closed off. There are a couple of simple puzzles throughout the game but nothing compared to the item gathering and riddle solving puzzles of The Dark Descent.- A lot of the fear in The Dark Descent came from showing you fleeting glimpses of the unknown and letting your mind fill in the gaps. While Machine for Pigs does this early on, it quickly reveals the unknown and tries to take a different angle on the horror. While it works in some ways, simple mechanics like managing your sanity levels and conserving your light, hallmarks of The Dark Descent and a great way to build terror in the player, are completely stripped out.Personal Highlights (contains spoilers) -- Learning the true purpose of the machine. Although never explicitly stated, by putting the pieces together you will understand its true nature, and the revelation will sicken you...- The holding cells of the Pigmen is a unique experience. Walking through the halls and looking into the cells makes you realise these horrible monsters patrolling the machine are actually semi-intellingent, or at least sentient, and the conditions they live in, as well as the human element of their cells, conjures up a feeling of pity towards what was your main antagonist.- The ""escape"" scenario where the Pigmen are released on the streets of London to ravage and cause chaos is a personal highlight, not because it's good, but because its a great example of how to completely ruin and stop the story dead. Its the lowest part of the story and doesn't really serve anything to the plot.Summary -An unfortunate miss from thechineseroom. A Machine for Pigs isn't a terrible game, in fact in some areas it can come off as a more horrific and disturbing game than its predecessor. It gets under the skin and the story leave a lot to the player's imagination to drive the horror home. The machine itself feels colossal and largely unknown, and the music and sound design helps to immerse the player in this horrible world. Unfortunately the linear nature of the game makes it feel like a guided tour, and a sudden and abrupt ending jars with the slow buildup of the preceding few hours. Thechineseroom can craft a great story, and to that end they've succeeded, but for all their ambiguity, clever dialogue and creative vision, a game without mechanics, even simple puzzle solving, is not a game, its a tour of a 3D model put into context. A good horror game in its own right, but hardly deserving of the Amnesia name.5/10Context - 8Challenge - 2Catharsis - 4			"

												!!!READ THE LAST PART IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THIS WALL OF TEXT!!!This game was one that I was excited for since its announcement and when I finally got the game my excitement only grew but things went downhill incredibly fast.Story:You awake in a room and have amnesia, (in case that wasn't obvious enough,) then you start finding journals that will talk about this spooky machine and you must find out what this machine is and how much you were part of it, (you were a huge part of it in case that wasn't obvious enough,) you are also looking for your kids. The story isn't much but hopefully the scares and immersion will make for it (Spoiler, They don't.)Scares and Immersion:Scares are incredibly weak since most of it is sound effects and nothing else (but I will admit the game did scare a bit only because of the sound effects). The enemies themselves aren't even scary because the game does a nice job of making you see them a lot before they become an actual threat also the lights around the place warn when an enemy is nearby. Immersion is a bad one also since the game focuses sound only on loud noises and the environment doesn't draw in at all.Puzzles:Puzzles are almost nonexistent. The ""puzzles"" are merely carrying one object to another room, placing said object into where ever it goes, and hitting a switch when you're done. The lack of an inventory destroys all possible puzzles there could have been and instead makes them all too simple.Exploration:Since the game doesn't have an inventory, there is no real reason to explore besides to look at the area even then the areas are so linear that there is still no reason to explore. The game doesn't reward exploration and the only thing to gain is journals entries except you still don't need to explore since most of them are in plain sight.Mechanics that were in Amnesia: The Dark Descent but removed:-Sanity Meter: While the sanity meter was sort of annoying in the first game, it encouraged you to stay out of the dark and to not look at the monsters but with this removed, you can stay in the dark as much as you want and stare at the monsters all you want once again making them less scary.-Inventory: This had no reason to being removed since it helped the game out with puzzles and encouraged the player to explore and collect objects.-A limited lantern: The lantern got changed in such a way that took away most of the horror in the game and that being it has unlimited light. Dark Descent's limited lantern encouraged the player to only use it when it was really needed while in this game the lantern can be out at all times and the worry of it running out isn't there also the lantern is key in knowing when a monster is nearby since it flickers when one is close once again taking away the fear of the enemy.-Large amount of physics: This game will hardly let you pick anything up or move anything-Custom Story Support: This one thing is the main reason I still play Dark Descent since I know that when I'm done with one story, I can go download another. Some custom stories are incredibly well done and playing those provides whole new experience with the same game.The Monster:The monster is nothing to be scared of in appearance or sound (unless you think an angry pig snort is scary.) The enemies look like humans with pig features such as snouts and hooves for feet. The monster ‘s AI isn't the best either, at times they can stand right in front of you and not notice anything. There was also this time where I flashed the lantern in its face and stood directly in front of it and it didn't notice me and instead went the other direction. Also the monsters despawn incredibly fast.Outside sections:The game lets you go outside and its' a great new feature but the Amnesia engine is great with inside buildings only so the outside parts don't look amazing and even when you're outside, you still get this feeling of being boxed in.The Wrap-up/ The TL;DR:This game is complete let down when comparing to Dark Descent but when not comparing, it still doesn't do that well. To be honest, this game felt more like a mod for the first game than an actual stand-alone game. This game really shouldn't even have Amnesia as the title since it is nothing like it should or could be. I suggest not buying this and instead getting the first game or wait till Frictional's next game.(I know that it isn't Frictional's fault that the game ended up like this and I know the Chinese Room is to blame.)

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs was a game that i really waited because i liked Amnesia: Dark Descent and its nice scary atmosphere and creepy monsters. First moments in Machine for Pigs were good because of the good scary atmosphere and you didnt know what kind of monsters the game have, and sometimes you got scared by tiny jumpscares wich keeped the atmosphere up. It kind of felt that the game will be like Dark Descent, Unfortunately after you see the monster first time, the scary atmosphere kind of vanishes because the monster itself isnt so scary. Tough the few jumpscares and ""ONE"" particular monster keeps scaring you, i was really disappointed of the ""Horror"" part oh this game. If we compare Amnesia: DD and MfP as horror games, it feels like MfP isnt horror game at all. I would more likely categorize it as agonizing game. Few things what makes it lose its Scary feeling is that you have lamb WITHOUT oil meter, Wich means you can use your lamb all the time without worrying that your oil will suddenly end. There is no need to hide in closet, because when you use your light and those ""monsters"" are getting close to you it starts to go on and off. When you are near monsters it flashes fast so you know that you need to turn your light off and just go littlebit backwards behind some boxes or barrels and wait until it walks past you.Tough the game itself doesnt seem to be so scary it has amazing story in it. At the beginning of the game you really cant get into it so well but if you keep following it and you listen all the conversations and read all the notes what you find you soon notice how depressing and oppressive it is, and how much the game offers you with its story. The story of this game is only reason why i would recomend this game for people. The horror part of this game seems to be so small that i would more likely keep it as nice extra for this story what you play. In my opinion Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is more one depressing and oppressive but still amazing story, wich have few puzzles and some jumpscares and horror scenes in it.Im gonna give thumbs up for this game only because of its story.For this game as a horror game im gonna give in my scale just 5/10. i really didnt  like it at all.. BUT! as walktrough of Story im gonna give it 8,8/10. I really enjoyed this game after i just forget the thing that it ""sould be"" horror game and just focused more the story. So in my opinion, If you are looking for nice Horror game this game get tumbs down. It really isnt worth of money.. But if you wanna game with story then Yes. I highly recommend it for you.			"

												When I started playing A Machine for Pigs, I expected for it to maintain the mechanics from The Dark Descent. However, upon grabbing the lantern, I knew that this was going to be a horse of a different color. Unlike The Dark Descent, this game focuses more on its admittedly complecated story and does not have as many tense enemy moments. There is no item conservation, no oil, no health pickups, no sanity meter, and no direct connection to the first game. Unless you do some research, you will never find the connection between both Amnesia games. It's almost like the creators made a new game, but slapped Amnesia on the title just to lure fans of the original. The levels are more linear than the first game, so you may be disappointed that there is not a lot to explore. There is also the missing option to directly access custom stories from the main menu. In fact, this whole game is like a custom story that you would download for the first Amnesia.If the game has these problems, why am I still recommending it? For one thing, it does have some pretty creepy moments. I found the factory setting to be gritty and atmospheric, almost like you could see the filth and decay that it is going through. If you were to think of how blood would crust up and stain the metal cogs and pipes of the machine, you would be in the right mindframe. Sound design is also great, as you will sometimes hear things from seemlingly nowhere. I played with headphones to immerse myself in the game, and that turned out to be a good choice. It wasn't a bad play, but it just doesn't measure up to the tense, dark, and forboding nature of the original Amnesia. For curiousity's sake, it's worth a play. Even if it is just for the familiar Amnesia atmosphere. However, I suggest that you buy this when it is on sale. I got it half-off around the holidays. In retrospect, that was a better choice because had I paid full price, I probably wouldn't be as forgiving to the game.In conclusion, this game does not meet the same knee-jerk horror of the first one. It is average, but throws in some really good moments. If you are a die-hard Amnesia fan, you can skip this one. It does not have the same impact as the first game. If you are a fan of atmospheric, creepy-looking games, you would probably get some enjoyment out of it. Just wait for the game to go on sale. It is not worth $19.99.			"

												""Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs"" is a pure horror experience. Not the trivial horror in which the player is always firing with a shotgun, but a deep and perverse psychological experience that dig into the player's darkest thoughts. This second chapter differs in many ways from ""The Dark Descent"": the sanity meter, the inventory and the oil/tinderboxes related difficulties have been removed, probably with the intent to create a more realistic atmosphere. A great limitation. This was not the best choice to me, since puzzles can't be satisfactorily complex and does not require much effort to be solved. Overall the gameplay result a little too linear but is compensated by a breathtaking atmosphere created by the story, the lovely and disturbing graphic, the dark sound environment and the superb music.""A Machine for Pigs"" is a very compact and well designed game, that have only one misfortune: be the successor of a perfect game. A lot of people didn't expect Amnesia to change it's way of being.I replayed this game 3 times now and I would definitely recommend it.			"

												Not like Amnesia: The Dark Descent. There is very little 'horror' in the game itself. The Dark Descent was terrifying, it scared me so bad I could only play the game in half hour bursts at max. The chase music was terrifying, being terrified to even look around a corner drew me in. A machine for pigs has none of these things. The atmosphere was great! But that does not make up for the lack of pure terror you felt as the chase music screamed at you (A Machine for Pigs has no real chase music) when you were being chased by a monster like what happened in the Dark Descent. A Machine for Pigs simplifies much of the gameplay from the Dark Descent. You have an unlimited light source (which I feel takes away from the fear as well as you never need to worry about running out of light), simpler puzzles, no sanity meter (arguably better, arguably not) and no inventory. A Machine for Pigs has great atmosphere, the plot is intriguing, but the horror elements that made the Dark Descent great just aren't there - and it's a huge disappointment.			"

												I completed Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs in 2.9 hours, including restarts, pausing for breaks, and setting up my stream. This isn't a horror game nor is it a puzzle game. The extent of the 'puzzles' in Machine for Pigs is finding the correct lever and giving it a swift tug. There, puzzle complete. Unlike the previous Amnesia game you cannot pick up in game objects other than chairs in a few areas. The developers disabled the ability to pick up objects - very hastily I might add, as you can still knock things over with chairs and easily cause other ""nailed down"" props to glitch out. Throughout the game the ambience tries to be spooky but due to the limitations of the game there is no sense of danger. When you are confronted with the monsters you'll laugh or even stare with your eyes half-open at the pathetic excuse of a threat. They are slow and give you plenty of opportunity to run away, and its not very hard to just walk around them when they see you. The new 'lamp' in the game flickers to notify you when a monster is near, which might've worked in a game like FEAR when the atmosphere and the script were above average, but not in a poorly written, poorly built game like this. They took out the paranoia features that the first game had, as well as the tinderboxes and lamp oil. The player doesn't even have any health potions, or any item to retrieve for that matter, which means there's no reason to explore the map other than to look for scraps of paper with sappy dialogue. I expected this game to be an excellent addition to the Amnesia universe, but TheChineseRoom failed in every possible way to make this game worthy of its title. Might've been better if it was designed as a standalone game instead of being directly related to Amnesia. (Note: same universe sequel, not story continuing sequel. Barely any crossovers. Absolutely no reason to have Amnesia in the title.)I really hope TheChineseRoom learns from their mistakes with this game.			"

												After playing Amnesia: the Dark Descent I came into this game thinking I would be in for an experience that would terrify and fascinate me just as much as the first. Tragically this was not the case, it creates cardinal sin of video games of being BORING. The game play is so severly dumbed down. There is no more exploration, no more sanity, no more lamp fuel, the enemies are just basically path blocking obstacles instead of actual threats. There a near non-existant level of immersion to be found.The only redeeming feature aside from the above average story, is if you have NOT played the first Amnesia or any scary games in general then this game would be a solid start. I judge games by 1 dollar per hour of entertainment, with exceptions to be had for higher quality works. This game has a play time of 4-5 hours, and I would say that is an appropriate price to pay as well for those who are still interested in purchasing the game.			"

												Not like Amnesia: The Dark Descent. There is very little 'horror' in the game itself. The Dark Descent was terrifying, it scared me so bad I could only play the game in half hour bursts at max. The chase music was terrifying, being terrified to even look around a corner drew me in. A machine for pigs has none of these things. The atmosphere was great! But that does not make up for the lack of pure terror you felt as the chase music screamed at you (A Machine for Pigs has no real chase music) when you were being chased by a monster like what happened in the Dark Descent. A Machine for Pigs simplifies much of the gameplay from the Dark Descent. You have an unlimited light source (which I feel takes away from the fear as well as you never need to worry about running out of light), simpler puzzles, no sanity meter (arguably better, arguably not) and no inventory. A Machine for Pigs has great atmosphere, the plot is intriguing, but the horror elements that made the Dark Descent great just aren't there - and it's a huge disappointment.			"

												After finishing MFP I started on TDD a few months later. I feel prompted to write this after seeing lots of negative reviews for this game. MFP was a great game but was over shadowed a bit by TDD. MFP was more liniar and relied more on atmosphere to deliver scares than TDD which was more brutal and disturbing. There is no insanity or inventory to manage in MFP which makes the game much more focused on the story and atmosphere. I don't understand the rampant hatred for MFP. It was a good game. Not quite as good as TDD but absolutely worth playing. I think fans of TDD came into MFP expecting something more like TDD and were dissapointed when it didn't deliver the same kind of scares. For those of you who did just shut up and play the damn game. Don't compare it to TDD. I would recommend MFP but remember that its going to be a little different so take the game at face value and don't try to compare it to TDD.			"

												I played this game a while ago and I have to say... I was very dissapointed. I will try to share my memories with you.I was excited for this game, it seemed promsing... you start in a room, the feeling of the world arround you seemed quite similar to the first game so it was okay... so I set out for adventure and find out what is going on. Now the bad news begins... as I went on and on and on... it just seemed to be little puzzle after little puzzle, nothing that was even slightly scary happening arround me, now and then some pig corpse to remind you that you are playing ""A machine for pigs"" I guess... but really, nothing happens for about 2-3 hours, there's not a single creature walking about, except sometimes in the background but it's quite obvious that it's not going to come for you. Heck, after the first half hour you even forget that you can actualy take your time... you just desperately try to get to the scary part but it never really comes. Now... I did not finish this game and I infact stopped shortly after the first 'enemies' show up... walking pigs are just laughable really, I just laughed so hard upon seeing these... they just looked stupid and silly, not scary.Now, I do not remember too much about the story but it did seem somewhat interesting and I kinda wanted to figure out what was going on... however, the rest of the game seemed so purely excecuted and I had to force myself to play as long as I did... the game has the look of Amnesia, but not the soul. Avoid it unless you are willing to play a way less scary and exciting game than the first.I wish the game was good, but it's not.			"

												(I'll try to keep this spoiler-free) Kind of sad that I finished this game on the very day that it was released. Not a whole lot of hours of gameplay, but it was a few hours of VERY high quality, stylized, atmospheric, and memorable gaming however. I don't like that they don't have an inventory anymore, no health or sanity meter. The lantern mechanic has certainly changed. I also don't think the opposing force of the game is as good as in Amnesia: The Dark Descent. In my opinion (Yours may very well differ), 'A Machine for Pigs' is better than 'The Dark Descent' in some respects, but in most ways, I prefer the first in the series. I DON'T think this one will catch on as well as the first did (though I've been wrong before, we'll see), however I most certainly recommend it to those who enjoyed the first one! Like I said, it's very memorable, touches on some historical facts of the time, as well as insight into 'future' events, and WILL make you think on occasion. I'm glad I played it, and might possibly play it again some time later on. Had a few good scary and suspenseful parts in it, and hopefully some talented modders will perform some similar magic for this platform as they have for the last one. As is the game has a GREAT feel/atmosphere to it, I don't think that can be improved upon, however as far as scariness goes I believe we can expect some improvements by the upcoming fanbase. People smarter than I who would know how to create mods and really make people quiver. Come on, give Storpy, Pewds, Markiplier, and the rest of the popular youtube gamers something to scream about ;) I hope you found this recommendation (and kind of review?) informative! Happy gaming!			"

												When I started playing A Machine for Pigs, I expected for it to maintain the mechanics from The Dark Descent. However, upon grabbing the lantern, I knew that this was going to be a horse of a different color. Unlike The Dark Descent, this game focuses more on its admittedly complecated story and does not have as many tense enemy moments. There is no item conservation, no oil, no health pickups, no sanity meter, and no direct connection to the first game. Unless you do some research, you will never find the connection between both Amnesia games. It's almost like the creators made a new game, but slapped Amnesia on the title just to lure fans of the original. The levels are more linear than the first game, so you may be disappointed that there is not a lot to explore. There is also the missing option to directly access custom stories from the main menu. In fact, this whole game is like a custom story that you would download for the first Amnesia.If the game has these problems, why am I still recommending it? For one thing, it does have some pretty creepy moments. I found the factory setting to be gritty and atmospheric, almost like you could see the filth and decay that it is going through. If you were to think of how blood would crust up and stain the metal cogs and pipes of the machine, you would be in the right mindframe. Sound design is also great, as you will sometimes hear things from seemlingly nowhere. I played with headphones to immerse myself in the game, and that turned out to be a good choice. It wasn't a bad play, but it just doesn't measure up to the tense, dark, and forboding nature of the original Amnesia. For curiousity's sake, it's worth a play. Even if it is just for the familiar Amnesia atmosphere. However, I suggest that you buy this when it is on sale. I got it half-off around the holidays. In retrospect, that was a better choice because had I paid full price, I probably wouldn't be as forgiving to the game.In conclusion, this game does not meet the same knee-jerk horror of the first one. It is average, but throws in some really good moments. If you are a die-hard Amnesia fan, you can skip this one. It does not have the same impact as the first game. If you are a fan of atmospheric, creepy-looking games, you would probably get some enjoyment out of it. Just wait for the game to go on sale. It is not worth $19.99.			"

												I completed Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs in 2.9 hours, including restarts, pausing for breaks, and setting up my stream. This isn't a horror game nor is it a puzzle game. The extent of the 'puzzles' in Machine for Pigs is finding the correct lever and giving it a swift tug. There, puzzle complete. Unlike the previous Amnesia game you cannot pick up in game objects other than chairs in a few areas. The developers disabled the ability to pick up objects - very hastily I might add, as you can still knock things over with chairs and easily cause other ""nailed down"" props to glitch out. Throughout the game the ambience tries to be spooky but due to the limitations of the game there is no sense of danger. When you are confronted with the monsters you'll laugh or even stare with your eyes half-open at the pathetic excuse of a threat. They are slow and give you plenty of opportunity to run away, and its not very hard to just walk around them when they see you. The new 'lamp' in the game flickers to notify you when a monster is near, which might've worked in a game like FEAR when the atmosphere and the script were above average, but not in a poorly written, poorly built game like this. They took out the paranoia features that the first game had, as well as the tinderboxes and lamp oil. The player doesn't even have any health potions, or any item to retrieve for that matter, which means there's no reason to explore the map other than to look for scraps of paper with sappy dialogue. I expected this game to be an excellent addition to the Amnesia universe, but TheChineseRoom failed in every possible way to make this game worthy of its title. Might've been better if it was designed as a standalone game instead of being directly related to Amnesia. (Note: same universe sequel, not story continuing sequel. Barely any crossovers. Absolutely no reason to have Amnesia in the title.)I really hope TheChineseRoom learns from their mistakes with this game.			"

Interaction is very low, especially when you compare it to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The monsters are not frightening at all. In fact, once I got a good look at them, I burst out laughing. The only time I was scared while playing was the beginning when I was in the mindset that it would be like AtDD. The story itself was a mess and predictable. Don't waste your time on this game and taint your memory of the Dark Descent.			"

 Positive + Some of the pointless gameplay elements that existed in the first game have been removed (the sanity system for one, as well as the constant need to refill your lantern), leading to a more fluid experience+ Again, story-wise the game manages to tell a story well, and has quite a sombre ending+ Similar to the first game also, the sound design is excellent, and ensures a quiet moment is never peaceful for long. Negative - While the first game’s length was nothing exceptional (just under 4 hours), this game is criminally short in comparison, barely passing the 2 ½ hour mark- Just like the first game, but worse-so, there are only a couple of moments where you are in any real danger; aside from the occasional set piece, dying is nigh impossible. Verdict “A game that tries to emulate the success of the previous entry, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs doesn’t quite hit the mark. Although the story once again is excellent and is worth the price of admission, the format of a videogame just does not suit this franchise. But, having said that, if you can get this game for cheap and have a couple hours to spare, a quick playthrough of this title just for the short story won’t go amiss.” 6.5/10 TJBs  "

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game from beginning to end!If you enjoyed Dear Esther then you will likely enjoy Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. This is a first person interactive novel/film experience. There are no guns or weapons or inventory system and, honestly, this ""experience"" doesn't need such features (""experience"" seems a better description than ""game"").  The developers have thought outside the box and created a brilliant work of entertainment that doesn't need to conform to the norms.  You'll have a thoroughly enjoyable (and sometimes disturbing) adventure.This really shouldn't be thought of as ""Amnesia 2"".  You should probably look elsewhere if you want an Amnesia sequel.  This is more like a ""mod"" of Amnesia to create a different type of product.  The graphics, sound and environment are immersive. Set your gamma low and turn your sound up and get ready to be swept away in the adventure.  It's not super scary but it's certainly enough to bring a smile and chuckle after a fright scene.The gore and blood is relatively tame but (personally) I wouldn't recommend this one for children or people of a sensitive disposition (although ""scariness"" is a subjective thing).A very worthy successor to Dear Esther.  The Chinese Room have done it again.  A royal shame that their next game ""Everybody's Gone to the Rapture"" will be exclusively Sony PS4.An excellent game if you've adjusted your expectations:- not horror, but it is tense- not a traditional FPS game, but it is thoroughly entertainingEDIT: Still fun to replay many months later.

												Play this game.Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is an enthralling work of fiction about a wealthy man coming to grips with his own evil right before the turn of the 20th century.This work's position as a video game makes consideration of gameplay an unfortunate factor in its appraisal. You really don't do much in the way of normal gaming during your experience with Pigs. However, you will find yourself engaged by what you might call narrative/ambient puzzle solving. You aren't asked to find a clever way around a locked door, or trick enemies into sucide, or rearrange parts of a painting to reveal a secret message. Instead, the intellectual satisfaction you'll find in Pigs comes from examining the game's environment and reading cryptic journal entries to understand this narrative's disturbing truths. That is, running through the game without paying enough attention and without thinking critically enough will result in failure--you will have missed the game's point. It's in careful methodic analysis of the narrative elements that you win and experience the pleasure of the game's reward--deep fear and revulsion about your character's tale and even what the story says about the nature of our own lives.I believe this game's only material shortcoming is technical--it is deceptively resource intensive, despite its lack of visual sophistication. It's not particularly pretty (Outlast, however, is particularly pretty), but slowdown is frequent nonetheless. Routinely, the frame rate would dip on my pc, from around 60fps to something closer to 30fps. I'm not sure if this is the result of visual tricks that I simply didn't appreciate enough to notice, or if it's because of less-than-optimized code. Vision blur never triggered the slowdown. Slowdown occurred most often in the large, more decorated rooms of Mandus's mansion, and in some of the larger chambers below.Play this game, though. Its terror doesn't come from visceral, instinctual tension as it does through Dead Space and Outlast. Instead, it disturbs the conscious mind only after reflection and understanding of the story's premise. You won't spend your time with Pigs with white knuckles and a tight stomach. Instead, you will spend days afterward dwelling on dread and the loathing you were meant to feel through Mandus as he rediscovered his own past.			"

												Play this game.Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is an enthralling work of fiction about a wealthy man coming to grips with his own evil right before the turn of the 20th century.This work's position as a video game makes consideration of gameplay an unfortunate factor in its appraisal. You really don't do much in the way of normal gaming during your experience with Pigs. However, you will find yourself engaged by what you might call narrative/ambient puzzle solving. You aren't asked to find a clever way around a locked door, or trick enemies into sucide, or rearrange parts of a painting to reveal a secret message. Instead, the intellectual satisfaction you'll find in Pigs comes from examining the game's environment and reading cryptic journal entries to understand this narrative's disturbing truths. That is, running through the game without paying enough attention and without thinking critically enough will result in failure--you will have missed the game's point. It's in careful methodic analysis of the narrative elements that you win and experience the pleasure of the game's reward--deep fear and revulsion about your character's tale and even what the story says about the nature of our own lives.I believe this game's only material shortcoming is technical--it is deceptively resource intensive, despite its lack of visual sophistication. It's not particularly pretty (Outlast, however, is particularly pretty), but slowdown is frequent nonetheless. Routinely, the frame rate would dip on my pc, from around 60fps to something closer to 30fps. I'm not sure if this is the result of visual tricks that I simply didn't appreciate enough to notice, or if it's because of less-than-optimized code. Vision blur never triggered the slowdown. Slowdown occurred most often in the large, more decorated rooms of Mandus's mansion, and in some of the larger chambers below.Play this game, though. Its terror doesn't come from visceral, instinctual tension as it does through Dead Space and Outlast. Instead, it disturbs the conscious mind only after reflection and understanding of the story's premise. You won't spend your time with Pigs with white knuckles and a tight stomach. Instead, you will spend days afterward dwelling on dread and the loathing you were meant to feel through Mandus as he rediscovered his own past.			"

												Let me say in the beginning: ""Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs"" sure is a nice horror game, but mostly if you never played or saw the previous ""part"" The Dark Descent. You play Oswald Mandus, the owner of an industrialised slaughterhouse in 1899. While you proceed through the game, it already starts with the name of the game and continues with multiple bits of information, that you constantly think ""What the actual ♥♥♥♥ is/was going on here"". I liked that most in the game, same as in The Dark Descent. From the beginning to almost the last minute, you add pieces of information to finally understand what kind of **** is going on here. On the other hand, after completing ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"" multiple times, I was really disappointed in the horror-atmosphere, which was the strongest part in Amnesia, compared to other games of the genre. The Dark Descent was so strong, because it used a few simple mechanisms of fear. Most important, you almost never saw what was called ""enemy"". In TDD you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants because you have no freaking idea whats behind you, what it can do with you, how close it is to you, and how long you need to run until you get rid of it. Now, A Machine for Pigs and also, in my opinion, Outlast (I don't say it's a bad game, not at all) lack that kind of atmosphere since you know a lot about your pursuers. For me, the enemies in AMFP were neither scary nor did they chase me in a horrifying or atmospheric way, simply, if you know WHAT is chasing you, it loses way too much of its horror. The loss of atmosphere is in my opinion the biggest contra compared to TDD. Too long, didn't read/All in all: I recommend this game. The story is pretty cool for the genre, the music and sounds create a good atmosphere, but answer the following questions before you buy it.1) Have you played The Dark Descent before and want to play the next part? Buy it. 2) Have you played The Dark Descent before and hope for an even better experience? You will not find it here in my opinion. 3) Have you never played or watched a Let's play of The Dark Descent before and do you look for a good horror game? Start with The Dark Descent. Then go back to 1 and 2.			"

												Very good game, excellent story. The only thing I disliked was the lack of true scare factors. I played Amnesia: TDD, and I could not play for more than 15 mins. I played AMFP and finished within 7 hrs straight. The story was a bit confusing, so you might have to consult Wikipedia for further information. It has very good graphics and when there are scares, it sends a chill down your spine. The atmosphere gets 10/10.  Story is 7/10 for its complex story. Id rate it 7.5/10 for the game in total.Also the ending is confusing. "

												At first I was scared, then I just became dismissive of the Wretches.And then I got bored.In the first hour and a half, AMFP was true to the scaring complex seen within TDD. I'd be trying to muffle a scream, pausing the game, being very, very cautious leaning around every corner and putting my head in my heads to try and catch my breath back... and then while I descended, the game descended in atmospheric quality. In the end, I just found myself trudging through the dark with my never-ending light source, not scared in the slightest. The puzzles... were not puzzles. Those ""sabotages"" acted more a mere obstacle with which just to step over; no challenge. Everything was spoon-fed. If anything, this made the game act as an interactive novel, in which I didn't feel any sympathy for the characters, nor the true innocents of the game.While some of the more immersive and explorative features of the original Amnesia were absent, I feel it didn't detract from the game. However, the overall linear feel of the game, and enemy indication feature was a complete buzz kill; there is no adrenaline injected into the atmosphere. Despite that, the scares at the beginning didn't feel cheap at all. In addition, I loved how my enviroment constantly changed around me, and that kept up a certain level of interest for me to complete the game within my 3rd session.I wanted to get lost in the dark. I wanted to be cowering in a corner behind some boxes with a Wretche's back to me, trying to sniff me out. I wanted ample cause to hide for ages, even when they are long gone. Music, as used in the previous game, could have ramped up that scare factor. The swine are lacklustre and did not carry a sense of intimidation.Also, the ending felt rushed. The anticipation and my expectations were wasted. Dissapointed.But nonetheless, this is from a different developer, who may have made the game within their best interests to put a different spin on it whereas their main concern should have been their audience and diehard fans of the previous game.

												I'd heard a lot about how dissapointing this game was. So when I decided to play it, I chose to judge it as its own game. Not an amnesia title.My conclusion? Even as its own game, I personally hated it.Why:Because it failed to involve me whatsoever with its story. It seemed to want to completely distance itself from the player. That's what books and movies are for, and they do it better because they can frame and pace it in an interesting way. In a game, you NEED interaction to make it interesting. Machine for pigs is a series of (more often than not) scripted events, and long periods of nothing happening. Sure, the environment is impressive. And without threats, or any need for resource gathering, it feels empty. I felt little or no desire to explore it, and there was rarely any form of reward for doing so. One might argue that this makes for a lonely, isolated experience that enhances the fear factor. One might also seek art in something that took little or no skill to craft, because it makes them look or feel more intelligent for doing so. While the environment LOOKS nice, I personally feel that it failed to generate a genuine sense of place. Places have character. Secrets, AI, readables, married together with visual storytelling and sound design, are ingredients for imaginary worlds we call ""games"". Places CONTAIN things. Events. They are  living things! While AMFP has some of these elements, its missing the most vital ones, and finds pretentious little ways of ruining the stuff that does work. Forced subtitles for posters, for example...because I can't just read it on my own...did Bioshock ever do that? A machine for pigs never felt living...it was a hollow experience. The story alone is not enough to save it from that. It could have been a novel, and would have been better for it. There is little to nothing that justifies it being a game. While I don't like the whole debate on what the definition of a game is (as it's quite subjective), I feel that a bad game is one that doesn't make effective use of the advantages this medium offers. Interactivity! The Stanley Parable featured nothing but walking, but it still made the player feel like they were somehow interacting with it. Making choices, finding things, etc. AMFP really failed to FEEL like a game for me, so I can only call it a bad one. For the sake of the things the game did right, I wanted to like it. But I couldn't. There was no reason this amazing environment couldn't have at least had more interactivity than walking and pressing buttons, with occasional glimmers of actual gameplay when a rare enemy was present. The jumpscares often amounted to nothing, and it wasn't long before I was shrugging them off. It wasn't much longer before I was feeling bored. Eventually, after an evening of giving this game a chance, I simply got too bored to finish. The story didn't intrigue me so much that I needed to finish. Had it felt like I was experiencing the story, as oppoed to feeling dissasociated with it, that could have been different. I'm often more leniant with gameplay issues for games I feel have a good story, such as deadly premonition (though I see no reason a game can't have both up to scratch!). This was simply a case where there was nothing to make the story worth it. It didn't grab my attention as much as it kept me mildly curious. It wasn't enough to make me want to endure any more boredom.For these reasons, I can only call this a bad game that I want to like, but frankly can't. Forgetting that it's connected to amnesia in any way, I just feel this is bad. It's a poor use of the medium that is unjustifiable, and really ought to have been a novel instead. If you enjoyed the game and found something of value to you in it, that's great and I'm glad you enjoyed it. This is just my honest feelings, and I'm aware that one man's junk is another mans treasure. If you enjoyed Dear Esther, chances are you'll enjoy this. I hated that game also for the same reasons, so that should give you a good idea of what to expect.			"

												I'm going to lay it right out. I think A Machine for Pigs is a master stroke in video game horror and storytelling. I consider it a far more captivating experience than The Dark Descent. Where TDD relied more on chase scenes and jump scares, AMFP focused far more on crafting a dark, Lovecraftian world to enthrall the player with.A Machine for Pigs drops the tiresome sanity meter, which at no point in its predecessor enhanced the experience. This artificial system only served to remove me from the experience. It accomplished nothing but making you feel like your character was extremely drunk. AFMP, on the other hand, approaches the question of sanity organically within the game. You will encounter situations that will make you question your character's sanity and perhaps even your own. Along with losing the sanity meter, it curbed the need for tinderboxes and oil because your lantern is permanently powered now. At no point did I consider this a weakness of the game. Collecting oil and tinderboxes was practically useless in the original even with the lighting settings correctly calibrated. The soundscape in this game is truly stellar. The music is haunting and beautiful and greatly adds to the atmosphere of the game. Outside of the music, it has superb sound effects. From the groans and shrieks of the machinery to the otherwordly sounds that come from the pigs, it is all done superbly. In another contrast to its predecessor, this game has far less focus on puzzles. And this is another thing that seems to have been very controversial for people. My reply is that this is a horror game. It is not a puzzle game. Puzzle games do not need to have horror sections. Why do horror games need to have puzzle sections? Beyond that, let's not kid ourselves about the puzzles in TDD. They were infantile and even the most challenged player could solve them easily without consulting a walkthrough. So let's not act like this series is famed for its amazing puzzles. It is not without its problems, though, It is a very short game. I completed it in 3.4 hours on my first playthrough and that was with seeking out everything and reading everything. While I consider it worth it even at full price, it is still quite a flaw. Another problem is that you cannot back track, so you have to make certain you fully explore an area before trying to move on or you will miss stuff.Still, this game is amazing. I completely adore it and hope that people will look past all the unwarranted negative reviews it has received. It is superior to The Dark Descent by far.			"

												I very much recommend this game.  Don't go into it expecting it to be exactly like the first Amnesia, though.  This game is a bit more story-focused than the original and not quite as terrifying.  But that's not bad; the story is pretty good and it does a good job of keeping you paranoid through the game.  Buy it and play it.  In the dark with headphones.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for pigs a loosely based sequal to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Most of the vital gameplay elements found in Dark Descent were completely removed in Machine, such as tinderbox collection, lantern oil, health, and ""sanity"". These elements played a vital role in making the player feel truly vulnerable and hapless, essential to this genre of game. In Machine, I never felt challened to complete the few puzzles, and the enemies were never more than a nuisance and could simply be ran past. I would say get it on sale if you enjoy mild spoops and spooks and easy achemevents. Good atmosphere and an interesting steampunk setting, but other than that it doesn't offer much else.			"

												""The darkest, most horrific tale ever told in a videogame."" - no, not even close.Dull, linear, lacking in horror, suspense, tension, or scares, and generally disappointing.  It seems the more effort that is put into in-game notes, voice work, and a supposedly deep story, the worse the game is.  Dear game developers of the world: please stop trying to be authors or filmmakers, and focus on making good games.  I've played all of the Penumbra series, Amnesia, and titles from other developers such as Slender: The Arrival, and Outlast.  A Machine for Pigs was a disappointment in comparison to any of these.  The game mechanics were stripped down to nothing in this title, losing inventory, resources, sanity, light, health of any kind, etc.  What should have been stripped out instead was the ""story"".

												As of this review I have put in only a few hours into Machine for Pigs and that was all I needed to sum up my thoughts on the game.  First and foremost Machine for Pigs is nothing like Amensia: the Dark Descent, so much so that I refuse to even it call it an Amnesia title.  Don't expect this to even marginally resemble Amensia: the Dark Descent because you will be sorely disappointed.Everything that made the original what it is known as today, a well designed and terrifying horror experience start to finish, is non-existant in Machine for Pigs.  There is no more health, sanity, lantern fluid and tinderbox necessities and there isn't even a means to examine what condition you're in after you suffer physical damage from enemies.  There is also no inventory to store the very few items you come across.  Granted, the only items you ever need to pick up are obviously only to solve puzzles, if you can even call them that because all they really involve is picking up an item and inserting it into whatever contraption.  There isn't anything puzzling whatsoever.  One final thought on items is that you must literally carry them in your hands to where they need to go, again, because there is no inventory.  Not a huge deal, however it is  bothersome nonetheless especially if you accidentally drop something and have to go look for it.  All of this  has been removed and I would love to know what the developers were thinking when they made these decisions. I do wish Frictional Games, Amnesia: the Dark Descent's developers would have gone through and created Machine for Pigs; the Chinese Room evidently had no idea what they got themselves into.  Ultimately Machine for Pigs does not live up the hype its predecessor proved and is an astounding failure in comparison and if it were a standalone title too.  It is no more than a dumbed-down, unbearably linear walking simulator with the occasional half-arsed jumpscare thrown in to laughably try and capture an ounce of horror. I'd suggest avoiding this altogether unless you just need to say that you finished both Amnesia titles.2/10			"

												It starts off well, but having finished it I feel obliged to point out the lack of danger that was present in the previous Amnesia game. It barely has any character involvement at all. The environment and music are beautiful as they are in Dear Esther, and that makese sense. It's the same developers and the same composer, respectively. The story is also very well written but you won't be able to appreciate it unless you can find the majority of the notes. And that's the only real thing to actually DO in it, besides the occasional simple, boring puzzle and avoiding the occasional pigman who will only spawn at scripted moments and will usually follow a set path, moving around stacks of crates or through hallways. It's only a matter of timing to avoid them. There is no survival elements either, further negating the actual danger in the game and making for poor payoff for the well-designed atmopshere. If this game had all the good elements in it's own right, the story, music, atmosphere and level design as well certain aspects of the first game such as the unpredictable enemies, survival mechanics and intillectually stimulating puzzles I would have appreciated it much more. My verdict 6/10.			"

												This is one of the most unique games ever created. Bold, daring and ambitious, although it has some debatable setbacks, it's essence is something you do not see in a video game. It is created and crafted with love, which is witnessed in the attention of the slightest details, every little bit of this game tells a story, shows us a full-blooded world. The only thing I wish was dread moments which were present in first Amnesia and Penumbra, which this game desperately needed. If that was included with some more polish with basic gameplay mechanics, and maybe some plot-point alterations, this would have been a perfect game.Don't take notice of the consistent whining about lack of inventory, sanity system or puzzles; This game offers much more than those trivialities.

But to summarise my thoughts here we go:PROS:- Fantastic Story- Terrifying atmosphere- Brilliant Music and Sound- Awesome and fitting graphics- Brilliant Build up and Tension- One of the best psychological Horrors.Cons:- Poor Gameplay (Game is more of an experience than a 'game')- Little Challenge- Can be short- Lack of Custom Stories- If you're expecting Horror similar to Dark Descent, you will be disappointedIn summary if you're expecting and wanting a game like the Dark Descent, I don't recommend it. However if you're open to a horror game which plays out more like an experience, then buy this game.			"

												a major step-down as a sequel to one of the most anticipated Horror Games of it's time. It requires too much rendering for it's average graphics, the whole thing plays like a train (meaning that it's linear), the scares are all scripted jump scares, and it takes no less than 3 hours to complete... also everything that was scary and fun about the Dark Descent is not in this one- there's no collecting notes, no solving puzzles- reducing it's play factor, exploration is a no choice, and everything, every object is tact down- which meant no Stephanos or Tiny Box Tims (and for those who get those references, I can say this game made me miss those)I also must mention how it's storyline plays out like a waterdowned Bioshock, plot twist and all. And the only thing this game has to relate to the first game is that it lazily throws in references from the Dark Descent; and it all feels so cheapSo without real gameplay, without the genuine thrill of being scared, all for the sake of making a cheap interactive horror movie that can't really play. And even with the arguement that this is better than most other horrors, I never play a horror game that I know is going to fail; because why spend money on something you know doesn't deliver.Honestly, I have had Minecraft gameplay that's scared me more than this whole gameFans of Horror, avoid this one and just buy the first one (it also has mods and a well made mini-horror)!!

												Rather than trying to repeat the success of ""Amnesia,"" Frictional hired The Chinese Room to make “A Machine for Pigs;"" a weird, little, ""Halloween 3"" style game that tells a complete story all its own, yet has nothing to do with the original.  To their credit, this was probably smart.  ""Amnesia"" was a brilliant game, but its scares were already wearing thin toward the end, so serving up a sequel that is nothing but more of the same wouldn't have gone over well.Unfortunately, ""A Machine for Pigs"" isn't even a fraction of the game that ""Amnesia"" was.  It doesn’t really bother trying to be a horror game, for starters.  The monsters are always well lit and kind of silly looking (I kept thinking of the pig sidekick from ""Beyond Good and Evil"" every time I saw them), and what's more, are barely in the game at all.  The lack of horror would be fine if it succeeded in some other area, but unfortunately it doesn't.  There are some puzzles, but it's not really an adventure game either.  ""Amnesia"" had very few puzzles, but made great use of its physics engine in the puzzles that it did have.  In contrast, the majority of AMfP's puzzles are of the ""find 3 different switches to progress"" variety, with next to no use of the game’s excellent physics engine.  Given the limited scares, gameplay, and interactivity, AMfP ultimately plays more like a sequel to the Chinese Room's earlier game, ""Dear Esther,"" rather than ""Amnesia.""  The ending deals with some interesting ideas about the horrors of the 20th century, but much like ""Dear Esther,"" the developers never find a compelling means of expressing those ideas via gameplay.  So you are left with an odd tech demo type experience that is part adventure game, part horror game, and part interactive movie, but that never commits fully enough to any of these elements to do them properly.  The result, much like “Dear Esther,” reaches far, but ultimately collapses under the weight of its own pretensions, ending up playing a bit like an amateurish “Amnesia” mod awkwardly mashed up with a freshman creative writing project.A huge disappointment.

												As a huge fan of the first Amnesia, I could not have been more excited for this game.  The games opens incredibly strong with a creepy and atmospheric world that begs to be explored.  However, this ends up being the high point.  As the story progresses and you deeper into the dark and atmospheric world things begin to fall flat.  The elements of horror that were present in the first game, are almost nonexistant in this sequel. It is quite disappointing going from the pure terror that was the first game, into this game which builds a fantastic world, but ultimately does nothing with it.  It was a huge disappointment from me, because you can see the structure of a fantastic horror game, but in the end, The Chinese Room built an atmospheric world that did not capitalize on the horror elements you expect from an Amnesia game.

												Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs is disappointingly short on the first playthrough. Clocking in at about three hours long, the conclusion to the game is rushed and the enemies do not provide the same tension those in the first game do, especially with the removal of the terror metre and insanity scale. Enemies are easily shaken off and the AI is painfully dumb: taking far too long to react when light is being shone directly on them from a few feet away.The puzzles are likewise easier this time around, the most challenging of them being shining a light on a tube of chemicals to generate electricity. It is all very straight forward, and the story the game tells isn't nearly as intricate as it's predacessor.The game would be scarier if they had more 'enemies' than pigmen and tesla pigmen, both of which you will find ridiculous to several degrees upon examination. While not a bad game by any stretch of imagination, it failed to deliver the horror aspect completely after the first few minutes of gameplay, and I felt that too much of the game takes place without seeing a single enemy (the first enemy you encounter is 30-45 minutes in, and there is little tension building prior to this. If this was an eight hour game that wouldn't be a problem, but it's not)			"

												The game feels like a fan contribution to the original Amnesia - similar theme but with none of the style. Jump-scares are substituted in place of tension and carefully layered atmosphere, The world feels less interactive and explorable, and the whole expereince feels like the subtlety has been stripped out, when compared to the original.Machine for Pigs almost exclusively tries to startle you rather than frighten you. The problem with this is that being startled is a physical reaction, being frightened is an emotional one: and I think most would agree a more satisfying one in a horror game.The only situation I think someone would prefer this game to the first one is if they are unfamiliar with computer games in general and find it distracting to have to manage lantern oil, inventory, sanity etc. All of these have been removed from the game.I picked this up from Humble Bundle and so I hardly spent anything to buy it, I would not recommend this if you are paying full price.

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a lot different than The Dark Descent, stripping previous mechanics and feeling almost like a different game. A Machine for Pigs is a lot darker than the previous installment and the features they took out from the first game aren't actually necessary for A Machine for Pigs. The game is a lot more story driven and is written beautifully, the eerie sense that the machine gives is full of dread and claustrophobia. This is also supported by the game's soundtrack, which is one of the few game soundtracks I have bought. Jessica Curry's soundtrack written for the game is some of the best horror music I've ever heard out of any form of horror, whether it be movies or other games.  This being said, a good majority of the time I was frightened by the music and found myself screaming for it to stop. (Locked inside my dorm room by myself with no lights whatsoever is really the only way to play a horror game).In conclusion, this shouldn't be compared to the first game at all. It would be rather dull if the predecessor of a game was exactly like the new one coming out and the creators should not be shunned for trying something different, especially when the game industry has recently been pumping out AAA titles that are no different than the previous games they have made.Personally, I enjoyed this game a lot more than the first Amnesia, it's different yes, but it's a whole new flavor, one that people may or may not like depending on their idea of horror.

												Overall I'd say this is a pretty good game. It isn't too much like The Dark Descent, and aside from a few faint story elements from The Dark Descent, the games aren't all that related. The gameplay and game style are different for sure, not to say that it's all bad. A machine for pigs is a lot more psycological in horror than The Dark Descent, and doesn't use monsters or jump scares to get to you, instead it uses its atomosphere, and tries to be more subtle about it, which admittingly worked on me. That being said, don't play this game if you're just looking for a good scare, its closer to adventure than horror, and it definitely feels like you encounter less monsters than you do in its predecessor. I think an accurate description of this game would be, a mix between The Dark Descent and Dear Esther. With 5/10 being average, I'd give this game a 6.5/10, I liked it. Buy it on sale.			"

												While others criticize Machine for Pigs for being a ""dumbed down"" dark descent, I defend the decisions made here. If you're looking for Dark Descent however, this isn't the game you're looking for. Machine for Pigs focuses more on narrative than the survival horror of its predecessor, and there's nothing wrong with that. Any horror Machine for Pigs delivers is through it's dark, forboding atmosphere and excellent sound design. It plays upon your expectations rather than presenting a giving you a physical identity to pin your fears on. Machine for Pigs achieves what it sets out to be, a narrative driven horror game. I believe if people stopped comparing the two, they could realize this as well.			"

												I've got two recommendations.PART 1 a stand point of ""Buy the game for the Story and Beauty"".This game had an amazing story and although it was shorter than Amnesia The Dark Descent It's story was alot better than ATDD. The enviornment was perfect everything seemed very beautiful, the textures were very nice, And the use of a Slaughter house was quite creepy. AAMFP did seem like it was going to be a lot better than it turned out to be because of all the hype given to it. But the story and setting(in my mind) exeeded the hype given. The was that the lantern flickers at the sight of an enemy was pretty creative, it made the game a lot more scary because I had no clue what happened when my lattern started to flip the ♥♥♥♥ out. So if you are looking for probably the best story I have seen in a game for a long time, BUY THIS GAME I DO RECOMMEND IT.PART 2 a stand point of ""buying the game for the gameplay"".I would NOT recommend this game to anyone who wants a horror game with good gameplay. If you want great gameplay play ATDD the first Amnesia. AAMFP was alot easier than ATDD and you weren't able to up the difficulty in anyway at all I know of and I looked into it for a good while. I felt like I could just walk straight through everything only hiding a few times throughout the game. I ATDD you didn't have that feeling you had to be a bit more careful and there was some more skill involved it was as much of a story game even though it had a very nice story, i feel the gameplay was better than the story. If you are looking ot buy a game for gameplay DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, it does not add any more to the original story of ATDD and it just seems easy and like the mosters and just their to make you take more time to finish the game, I found all the puzzles to be very easy giving minimal problems. OVERALL: Overall I think that AAMFP is a great game because I perfer to play through games for their story and AAMFP has a beautiful story.Highly recommended!I would give this game a solid 9 pigs out of 10.

 Overview It's nothing like the original - but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The Dark Descent featured challenging puzzles, pulse-raising ‘run or hide’ decision making, inventory management and constant danger. A Machine for Pigs holds none of these accolades, however, it’s still a good game! It has an interesting story with some horrific themes running throughout. It really makes you feel like you are trapped within the innards of some mechanical beast. The gameplay mechanics (or lack of) There are a few terrifying and jumpy moments before you actually encounter a pig-monster face-to-face... Until you realise that they are a totally pointless gameplay mechanic. Normally, in games where you must rely on either running or hiding from enemies (e.g. the game’s predecessor or Outlast), there is normally some general indication as to where to run or hide. Whether this is done by backtracking to previously seen areas, or running towards illuminated exits. With other games there is fun to be had in evading danger, but not in a Machine for Pigs. The pig-monsters spot you instantly and you can rarely outrun them! This is all okay though because if you get killed, you simply black out and spawn further on in the game, as if the encounter never happened... What’s the point?As soon as I hear a pig’s squeal, this is normally my reaction:“Oh blimey! It’s a pig-man! And he’s spawned right behind me again! I guess I’d better run ahead!”*runs ahead*“Oh-no! There’s nothing here! You know what?... Sod this! I’ll just take a beating because I have no idea what is going on...”*stands there, gets beaten to death by pig trotters and respawns*“Ohhhhhhh so I was meant to run down that ridiculously dark corridor that was obstructed from view by that massive pipe! Stupid me!”Literally, I’d say 2 out of 3 pursuits could pan out like this. The action is AWFUL. The ""puzzles"" literally rely on pressing buttons, replacing power fuses or turning steam valves. That said, simply looking at the machinary is a joy to be had and interacting with it can be quite fun! Why it is good! The game’s redeeming features are the story and the atmosphere. I’m not going to say much about the story, but it is really good! The themes expressed are extremely dark and the way everything unfolds is rather marvellous. Whoever designed all of the machinery did a really good job. The large growling machines and the spitting steam pipes twisting all around create a very immersive portrayal of 19th century industry. Brilliant ambient noises with the accompaniment of eerie music makes you want to jump out of the nearest factory window. There are some instances at the start that had me bricking myself. What's with the title? I personally don’t believe this game should have been called “Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs” because it is hardily like its predecessor. The only thing that is the same is that you can open draws and doors, and wind steam valves with mouse actions. That’s it! Everything else has changed. The game feels more like a scary industrial Dear Esther. However, I can totally understand why the developers would want to capitalise on a series.  Should you buy it? Essentially, if you want an incredibly immersive and very artistic story-based gaming experience, this game is probably for you. However, if you want a heart-pounding survival horror – don’t even think about it. It’s nothing like the previous game and your money would probably be better spent on Outlast, if you haven’t already played it. "

												This game does a few things differently from the original Amnesia that I didn't agree with. Unlike the first Amnesia, the environment can't be interacted with unless absolutely necessary. Closets, dressers, and nonessential doors have enormous locks on them and can't be opened, and the props lying around can't be picked up or moved unless they are explicitly used to solve puzzles. While this does prevent you from getting lost, it really hurts the immersion factor. There is no more inventory or sanity meter, and although you can die from taking too much damage, health isn't visible. Monster encounters are also a lot less frequent than the original game, and since the environment is static they seem a lot easier to avoid. You very rarely feel threatened or vulnerable so the game doesn't do a good job of being scary. However, the atmosphere is fantastic, and the visual style and sound design are a bit better than the original. I had heard that the story has nothing to do with the original, but it does in fact make several references, including namedropping Brennenburg early on. There is a pretty interesting plot here with good pacing, a few twists, and I felt compelled to keep playing to find out more about the mythos of the world. This game has a stellar soundtrack with excellent voice acting and beautiful music that lends an imposing feel to the world and really emphasizes the impressive setpieces and more dramatic moments in the story perfectly. I also enjoyed the grim industrial complex a bit more than the dilapidated castle from the first game. In all, I felt pretty good about this game. It was a good experience despite the lack of interaction. As long as you aren't looking for a real immersive ""horror"" experience I definitely recommend playing it, there's a lot of cool things to see and an interesting world to learn about if you're willing to explore. Plus the soundtrack is gorgeous. You might want to wait for it to go on sale though, it's not very long. I hope I can look forward to seeing more Amnesia games in the future.			"

												This game was about 1000x better than I anticipated.  I love the original Amnesia, but I wasn't expecting a whole lot more from the sequel. Boy, was I wrong.  Machine for Pigs managed to do what Dark Descent did, but better- and by doing even less.  The gameplay involves a lot fewer ""typical"" aspects (no health, sanity, or inventory) but still manages to not feel dumbed down.  The story is gripping and not only enhanced, but completed by the notes you find.  They don't feel like a random side thing to grab when you see one, but feel like an actual part of the story and make you want to actively search for them to uncover what is happening to you.Incredible game, solid horror atmosphere, and a thrilling mysteryPlay this♥♥♥♥♥♥ yo.

												I asked a lot of people about this particular game and I recieved mixed reviews ranging from 'Great!' to 'God-awful'. So to see for myself I bought it. I was pleasantly suprised. So to sum it up I'm gonna go over a few points. (WARNING: SPOILERS)Context: The game is set on the last days of December of the year 1899, with it finally turning to 1900 at the end of the game. You interact with a Victorian environment that's very steampunk-y in it's design. Expect cogs, pistons, sliding factory doors, conveyor belts and industrial blast furnaces. Throughout the story you will encounter early telephone devices on the walls and recieve calls from a strange and omnipresent voice belonging to a character known only as 'The Engineer'.Amnesia differs from the first game by introducing an outside element to the game, especially towards the end where you must run through the streets of Victorian London whilst the mass murder of it's populace occurs around you.Aesthetics: For me this was a beautiful game. The artwork was fantastic. This may have been because I'm a sucker for the steampunk genre but ho-hum. I enjoyed every single bit of this game and genuinely appreciated the time and effort gone into making this stunning environment. The visual appeal ranges from the ornate and flamboyant house that is Oswald Mandus's stately mansion to the grimy, grim and grotesque lab areas, slaughtering floors and the rightly feared animal holding pens.Play-style: Like it's older counter-part the Dark Descent; Amnesia: AMFP is a first-person survival horror in a steampunk-y, spooky environment full of beasts that crawl throug the sewage pipes, ventilation shafts and walkways of varying factory levels, storage warehouses and even a church at one point! The decision to remove the inventory was a brash and somewhat unexpected and occasionally unwanted move. But as contreversial as it was it did help the game flow and also removed the average Dark Descent player's favourite hiding spot! There is also an infinite lantern an the removal of Daniel's nyctophobic anxiety disorder; AKA: the fear of the darkness. These combined made it so that there was no need for a finite lantern fuel system. Many players would be very happy to run around in the darkness as there would be no pyschological consequences, unlike the Dark Descent where the other threat was passing out due to lost sanity from being in the dark too long.Instead the lantern now acts as a rough early-warning system in relation to the monsters proximity to the player. Watch for the flickering lantern!So in conclusion I think that the game deserves a solid 7/8-10. It's beautiful environment and chilling storyline following the plot of Oswald Madus slowly losing his mind in anger towards the harsh and unforgiving capitalist society only intersted in personal-gain and greed. I really enjoyed walking/running/hiding through the levels and thought that they really added towards a creepy atmosphere within the game. The music whilst beautiful is also deeply unerving and goes towards the horrific feeling of being within the bowels of this immense machine. It's only shortcoming is it's lack of really, genuinely terrifying points becuase of tension. Don't get me wrong there's tension but not the spine-chilling, brain-bursting tension that would make Chuck Norris weep in his seat. Despite this; overall, definately worth a look! Especially if you like steampunk. If you need further convincing look at some of the playthroughs on Youtube, there are plenty of intersting videos to watch! Enjoy and have fun!Regards ~ MetalMethod357P.S. I'd love some feedback on this. I'm thinking of writing reviews for a lot of games, so tell me what you think.			"

												Put simply, this game consists of encountering some kind of roadblock, finding the usually laughably easy solution to a ""puzzle"" and then watching as every important door relocks itself behind you. There's also machinery and pigs, all wrapped up in a very dark package. If you were to ask me in person what I think of A Machine For Pigs I'd reply with a shrug and a low non-committal noise, then suggest you just play it.You know in The Dark Descent how you could pick up all of the random clutter scattered around the place and throw it around or break it? It was a great way to destress yourself after a scary part. A Machine For Pigs doesn't let you do that, the vast majority of the crap strewn around is just for decoration now and can't be interacted with. You also can't throw important items, so if, for example, you had to stick a lever into a hole in the wall, you couldn't chuck it from across the room and feel like a badass. Luckily (or not I guess) you won't need destressing. We'll get to that later though.Speaking of not picking things up, you no longer have an inventory so you won't be scouring every nook and cranny for tinderboxes or oil. Almost everything's electric now, including your lantern, so there's no danger of running out of light. Not that that would be a problem anyway, but I'll get to that in a sec. On one hand, this is good news because it means you can keep advancing and following the story, but on the other hand not worrying about your oil removes a lot of tension. Remember when you were new to The Dark Descent and you didn't know all of the cheap ways to gain oil and avoid enemies? Those were the days. The lights suffer from the same issues as lights in every other horror game, so you know that if they start flickering it's brown trousers time.Back to running out of light not being a problem - this is because they've removed the sanity mechanic. In The Dark Descent if you sat in the dark or looked at a monster for too long you'd start losing your mind. This ultimately made it easier for enemies to get you. In A Machine For Pigs, however, you can just sit there with your light off and stare at the enemies until they get out of your way, just like in every other stealth game. The first time I encountered an actual enemy (as in an enemy that can attack you, not just scamper past and disappear around a corner) was in a massive dark room. I heard a horrid noise and was looking around, trying to find out what had made it, when suddenly a pig-monster thing ran at me and spanked me a few times. I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not, I ""escaped"" by turning off my lantern and crouching on the spot. I didn't expect that to work and had already resigned myself to having to restart when the monster strolled off. This brought back painful memories of Call of Cthulhu.Let's talk about scares. A Machine For Pigs takes the ""make a loud noise and shake everything""route. Now I'm not a game designer or horror writer or anything, I just play games, but this just feels more annoying than scary. The worst part is that whenever this happens the game stops you from moving, so you know there's absolutely no danger because you don't have the option to run and hide. When there is danger, on the other hand, the game makes sure to point you at the enemy during this temporary paralysis, so you know exactly where NOT to go. Thanks game. I don't know, maybe horror games just aren't for me any more.A Machine For Pigs was meant to be released in time for Halloween 2012, but was delayed until early September 2013. They said that the delay was because they weren't happy with the game and wanted to improve it. What we got was a watered down and honestly kind of dumb game that was over in about 4 hours, so I shudder to think what they had before the delay.This whole thing felt a bit unfair. I really should have been focusing on what the game DID, not what it didn't do. It's just that everything was done so well in the past. If you want my real opinion, The Dark Descent is better than A Machine For Pigs, and the Penumbra series is better than either Amnesia game. As for the recommendation, do NOT buy this for $20. If you've not got The Dark Descent yet, spend your $20 on that instead, or better yet head over to the Frictional Games store and grab the Penumbra series for $10. It pains me to say it but this was just a huge disappointment.			"

												Game-induced fear can take many forms. Having played quite a few horror games before, including even ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"", i thought i knew what to expect. This game, however, showed me this thrilling feeling in a new light, something that i don't recall having experienced before so intensely: the excruciating build-up of tension, the prolonged moments of waiting for your ""first encounter"", whose signs are scattered all around you and become increasingly common. You know you've been waiting for this moment from the beginning of the game, yet it constantly torments you not through immediate fulfillment, but through a psychologically exhausting postponement of the act, like a sick version of a prelude that drags on and on, until you almost beg for it to happen, certain that whatever horrors are eventually revealed can not match in mental fatigue the torture that you've been put through while waiting for it, while stumbling in uncertainty and confusion, never knowing what you will face beyond the next door in your path.And, not to worry - or should i rather say, do worry! - when the awaited moment actually happens, when ""your soul shudders at what you have just seen"", this feeling is far from over; if anything, it makes you even more aware and uneasy about the slumbering horrors burdening your journey into the dark and de-humanizing industrial complex.

												Finally tried this, and was let down. From the start there is no feeling of immersion, fear, nevermind horror. Runs very poorly on my computer, which is admittedly old, but which still can run much prettier games like Farcry 2 and Fallout New Vegas. This one looks worse and runs worse than either of those.Main reason I don't recommend this is a very poor sense of immersion. You can pick up some objects, but everything else is static. I threw a chair on a table with bottles and cutlery, and the chair just slammed into them, nothing happened. Also, although I didn't play for too long, there was no sense of urgency, and I just didn't care about the story at all. I just walked through the house, heard some rumbling and saw lights flickering. Not scary, nothing to do with horror.Also, some triggered events were just really annoying. Blurring effects and limited movement, and for what? Atmosphere? I wanted to like this, but really I can't.			"

												This game is largely unimpressive and an absolute disappointment compared to its predecessor.Admittedly, the removal of the HUD, that is, the inventory menu, and all indications of just about anything, including loss of health and sanity (the latter of which was removed entirely), had a positive effect on immersion compared to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. However, this was quite possibly the ONLY potentially positive difference made between the games, and I use the word 'potentially' very hesitantly. Why? Because, and you can ask ANYONE who has played both games all the way through at least once, a lack of information and indication on your status in the game also causes a bigger lack of things to worry and stress about. And let's face it, what good is immersion if the gameplay itself is tedious and incites no feelings or emotions in the player other than absolute boredom, especially if you made the transition from the first to the second Amnesia video game? In the first Amnesia game, you were always constantly made aware of your health, sanity, objective, and situations/surroundings. The more you let your loss of health, sanity, and light sources get to you, the more you focused on your objective in the forms of memo and journal notes, and the more time you spent being chased by monsters or traversing through eerie environments, the more you'd have genuine feelings of fear, stress, and even despair the more you 'got into' the game.Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs has a huge problem with all of the above. Health is no longer indicated in any clear or visible form, which honestly has more of a penalty on immersion to begin with. Let's face it, if you're physically hurt, you're aware of it, because of the feelings of pain. In this game, all you can do is 'make your best guess' on your current physical well being based on your memory of how often you were hurt before and how long it had been since then. Sanity has been removed completely, further decreasing the levels of difficulty and immersion while playing, making the game itself even easier than it already is. All that's left is lore and exploration, and a video game composed of nothing but lore is NOT a video game, it's a walking simulator. Objectives are generally more confusing at first glance compared to the first game, but at the same time, they're very easy and tedious due to the fact that they are all marginally you having to walk around to specific points and interact with specific things. That's it. Goals and objectives in this game are basically normal everyday tasks in a slightly creepy environment. Speaking of environment, the next topic, the overall 'feel' of the game simply doesn't seem to fit within fear or horror anymore, and is closer to that of a creepy, almost surrealistic cliché. I mean, come on; someone wakes up in a dark room, and they have to go to laboratory full of failed and murderous genetic experiments?Oh, the enemies, that's one of the biggest issues with the game. There is literally only one type of enemy which actively endangers you through the game, and only one other actual monster which is only found in the sewers, which is also there purely for cintematic effect; it's impossible to even see it up close and make contact with it. Compare this to the two enemies constantly hounding you in the first game, as well as two more found at specific points (the Kaernk or 'water monster' and the Shadow, or the bloody, goopy substance which constantly makes itself known in the form of restricting paths, adding scenery, and even actively hunting you down). More unique enemies essentially means more threat to the player. It adds a hopeless feeling of being outnumbered as well as constant paranoia that you can be watched and/or chased down more often and possibly even by more than one entity at once. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs' enemy itself isn't even anything too exraordinary, especially when compared to the first game. The way it looks and sounds, and even its background isn't frightening, it isn't scary, it isn't even eerie or creepy. In fact, it's nothing short of silly, amusing, and cliché. It essentially look like a pig on a more-than-lethal dosage of steroids.Even the lantern isn't left untouched by the transition between both Amnesia games. Yes, there is a lantern once again, but, and I personally find this to be the worst out of all other changes and features in the game, the lantern has unlimited oil and it constantly flickers on and off whenever you are close to or looking at enemies and while witnessing 'disturbing or unsettling events. In addition to the factors of this being unrealistic (which further breaks immersion) and making EVERY scary event in the game incredibly predictable and generic, it has an effect on the player which makes it easier to proceed without caution while simultaneously making it unnecessary to explore thoroughly (since you don't need to find new, unique areas to find more lantern fuel).Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs as a whole game feels like it was rushed and lazily made.  Unlike in the first game, there is not, nor will there ever be any possibility of custom stories. The developers themselves have made claims that it would be 'too difficult' to add custom story support due to the new engine, and that they will instead add new content to Amnesia: The Dark Descent instead, including but not limited to: new textures, monsters, and maps. Over a year later, we haven't even heard a single word about it yet. Even assuming this would ever be true, it almost makes it pointless to even buy the sequel in the first place. The first Amnesia game would be the obvious choice out of the two for any gamer to make since A Machine for Pigs is doomed to be a single adventure with absolutely nothing different or new put into the game while The Dark Descent supposedly gets even more playability and support than it already has.Another problem lies within the fact that the playtime of one single story playthrough, whether you're playing for enjoyement and story or simply rushing through it, is significantly less in A Machine for Pigs' story than in the first Amnesia game. Having not even 5 hours into the game myself and getting close to the ending (I couldn't finish it even once because I got so BORED with it, I'm sorry), while my first playthrough in the first Amnesia took me nearly 20 hours, I can confidently say that this game isn't even worth buying. I actually enjoyed the main story in The Dark Descent so much that I played it all the way through four times, simply because it was absolutely massive by comparison and plenty of 'optional' exploration possibilities. Combine this with the fact that there's a bonus of an additional mode called 'Justine' and a collection of short stories for even more curiosity-invoking lore in the 'Remember' option of the game's startup menu, as well as TONS of custom stories all for free, and it's easy to see that this Amnesia game is nothing short of an embarassment to the first.

												This is a really fun game that delivers, it keeps the same similar feel as the previous Amnesia title but with a completely different setting which was very welcoming in my eyes. The single player story was entertaining throughout and the puzzles were smoothly done to maintain a very flowing gameplay experience. Everything looked disgustingly gorgeous as well throughout the campaign and except a few textures that i personally would wantt a bit sharper up close when playing the looks of this game is great, so along with the sound work. Not only were the sound effects great but how the sound was used around you I do approve of, and in dark areas you rely as much on your hearing as your vision.CONS:However I do want to leave some cons in here, if you've played through the first Amnesia, this one feels a bit lacking when it comes to encounters of patrolling npcs in dark areas, there could've been more situations of this in my eyes since this is probably what most people remember the other game for. Though the story is just as solid if not better excecuted in Machine for pigs, you do feel like there could've been just more gameplay avoiding and sneaking past npcs and everything feels a bit too straight forward at times which might actually make it a bit shorter than it could've been, and the game lands in on about 3 and a half hours worth of playthrough, which I'd personally consider a bit too short to leave a greater mark.Another thing to note that doesn't have to always be bad but does change the mechanics of the game, is that the inventory system is completely missing in this game. This leaves out things like looking for items to carry and craft, to find and fill on your oil in the lantern etc. This was a what I'd consider an important aspect of the game to make it what it was, and without it, it just feels thin.CONCLUSION:The game is a great game by any means, and it remains on top of the line when it comes to horror/adventure games worth playing out there, but if it comes to the question ""Is it better than Amnesia: Dark Descent?"" My answer is,  No, it probably isn't. But if you enjoyed any of their other games I'd suggest getting this in no time since the pricetag is not too bad, and Linux support is great as well(Yes mac is for it too but who'd want to play on such crap anyway).Great game, get it if you like Amnesia or Penumbra. Just be aware that it might be over before you know it.			"

												Do not expect this to be anything like The Dark Descent, or you will hate it. The stories of the two games are indirectly connected, but that's it, they are completely different games. This one is much more like Dear Esther, in terms of gameplay. That made me skeptical at first, but if you can merge with the story and the atmosphere, A Machine for Pigs becomes nothing short of greatness. The storyline is about social darwinism and makes much more sense than the one in TDD, I also found it to be very emotional thanks to the superb voice acting. Do not buy this if you're looking for jumpscares and all those things that modern horror games promise, this one has something different to offer, and it's worth experiencing.			"

And if you ask me I actually thought the story in A Machine for Pigs was much better! So as you can tell I definately think you should buy this and quick whilst it's on sale!

+Incredible story that unfolds at a good pace.+Awesome voice acting.+Great soundtrack from Jessica Curry. Very evocative music that compliments the acting, the ambient sounds, and the environments.+Most of the puzzle elements from The Dark Descent are gone, in favor of a more streamlined narrative.+Top-notch sound design, honestly some of the best I've ever experienced in a game. Fans whirr, metal creaks as it expands and contracts, disembodied voices hiss at you, pistons churn, coolant drips, and a horrific monstrosity grunts and gurgles from somewhere very close by that you can't place and OH GOD IT'S RIGHT THERE-Tedious enemies, once you figure out how to avoid the first few it gets repetitive. On the upside, they are pretty freaky and you won't want to look at them (even though you don't lose sanity for doing so).-The atmosphere is very intense, like The Dark Descent, but unlike the first game, I didn't feel like I was in constant danger.-It's kind of short. I finished it and wanted more. Actually, that's not such a bad thing.(also, the 20th century didn't begin until January 1, 1901)			"

												Not as good as the Dark Descent, but it did have some pretty big shoes to fill. I think thechineseroom was a bad choice to develop a survival horror game. They do level design well but as indicated by their seminal work, Dear Esther, and this, they're pretty bad at telling a story without letting the surrealism of the story cloud the narrative. And they're terrible at symbolism. Very unsubtle.That said, it's a competent little game, even if the horror has been declawed somewhat with the removal of any real penalty for ""death"". There's enough good to recommend, but I wouldn't blame anyone who decided not to get it.			"

												Upon completion of Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, I found myself rather baffled... This game presented me with an intriguing, thought-provoking, entertaining and most disturbed tale that really had my mind racing all throughout and even after, as well as my heart for much of the second two thirds of the game. The gameplay is rather simple, in a good way; unlike the first game, you can't manipulate most of the objects in the game and there are no mechanics pertaining to the player (i.e. inventory, sanity, etc) except for health. Most of the game involves solving moderately challenging puzzles (not so easy as to be boring, and not so hard as to require the aid of the internet), with a few action scenes wherein the player must flee monsters or escape pipes filling with hot steam. The level design is relatively realistic and rather expansive in multiple cases, and the graphical design of the game is rather excellent. The actual graphics are somewhat average -- this was not a game intending to boast its graphics, but some of its textures are noticably low quality, and the same goes for some unimportant static meshes. These things aren't too prevalent however, and shouldn't bother most people (I just happen to be the kind of person that examines the textures, models and graphical FX closely in games whenever given the chance). Overall, excellent game. Simple, but entertaining, scary when it intends to be and involving an excellent, deep, thought-provoking and twisted plot.			"

												If you can get this game on sale for a decent bargin (like I did), I can't recommend A Machine for Pigs enough.The experience takes full advantage of it's Victorian London setting and weaves a disgusting, unsettling, but surpringly poignant narrative. Representing a factory as essentially a slaughterhouse for the detritus is nothing short of genius, and the emotional ramifications of the player's identity within this setting particulary puts me at unease.However, fans of The Dark Descent will certainly notice the huge step back in terms of challenge and gameplay mechanics with A Machine for Pigs. If you solely wish to engage in a terrifically written interactive experience, this might not be an issue at all, but gamers looking for challenge will find disappointment.If I have any real issue, it's that there doesn't seem to be enough here for A Macine for Pigs to exist as a sequel of a monetary value equal to its predecessor. Many mechanics and concepts from Dark Descent are discarded with basically nothing to fill that void (Although personally I'm glad they did away with the Insanity mechanic). This does mean the puzzles don't outstay their welcome like they begun to in Dark Descent, but it's still ultimately a full fledged sequel with half the content.But on the other hand, I still try to judge A Machine for Pigs (and basically all pieces of entertainment), not by its cost nor its quantity, but its quality. And A Machine for Pigs was a very satisfying nightmare to endure. It's short, but makes every single moment count for something substantial, and has a story and setting that is considerably more engrossing than Dark Descent's. The ending is also superior.If exploring a living, mechanical embodiment of humanity's capacity for efficient, apathetic evil is your jam, I can't think of a better way to spend 4-5 hours. Well, obviously there are several. But you should also look into this game. When it's cheap.			"

												Frictional Games took their highly praised Amnesia title and gave it to the developers of the walking simulator that is Dear Esther (The Chinese Room), and the result became Dear Esther 2: A Machine for Pigs. Anyone who enjoy the gameplay in the first Amnesia (or any gameplay at all) will not enjoy this. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a testiment that The Chinese Room are too incompetant to develop any gameplay beond walking mechanics.If you absolutely have to see this game then watch a ""let's play"" on youtube, the only thing you'll be missing out on is holding ""W"" for hours.

												As a narrative experience, this is quite good. As an Amnesia game, it's a massive disappointment. Barely half as long as the original game, with very few memorable scenes and completely lacking in scares or tension of any kind, it feels more like a half-baked nod to The Dark Descent rather than a true follow up.

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is very different than its predecessor. What has sold this game for most fans and I'm sure they can agree was the first game. My expectations were very high for it and that is initially my fault for not enjoying it. Unlike a long time ago, where I would see through a game till the end despite my opinion of it changing much, I grow impatient and would rather spend time on other games. The environment is the same but there is little to no incentive to be afraid of your surroundings. Too bad Amnesia, you dun goofed.			"

												I just finished this game and althou i hated myself for buying it at the beginnig, now i am actually reliefed. The AI of the enemies is horrible, pigman cant do sht, so at the early stages i just mocked them. There is no interaction with the enviourment, you can only touch items crucial for the plot advance... and chair. Major downfall from the first game i say...BUTComparing this story with the story of Dark Descent it actually got better, much better. The plot becomes more interesting and creepy as you progress, not the other way around as it was in the first game. Its kinda interesting. I find this good, and would play again to experience the story again.A little message to developers, who wont even read this:FIX THE GAMEPLAY PLEASE... want a checklist what to fix?>interaction with enviorment (all the meaningless item to pick up and play around)>fix AI , give em piggies some IQ coz the cant get anything done. dodging them isnt even challenging, are they even trying to kill you?Game worth 5$ :) I like it			"

												Do not expect this to be anything like The Dark Descent, or you will hate it. The stories of the two games are indirectly connected, but that's it, they are completely different games. This one is much more like Dear Esther, in terms of gameplay. That made me skeptical at first, but if you can merge with the story and the atmosphere, A Machine for Pigs becomes nothing short of greatness. The storyline is about social darwinism and makes much more sense than the one in TDD, I also found it to be very emotional thanks to the superb voice acting. Do not buy this if you're looking for jumpscares and all those things that modern horror games promise, this one has something different to offer, and it's worth experiencing.			"

												This is a really fun game that delivers, it keeps the same similar feel as the previous Amnesia title but with a completely different setting which was very welcoming in my eyes. The single player story was entertaining throughout and the puzzles were smoothly done to maintain a very flowing gameplay experience. Everything looked disgustingly gorgeous as well throughout the campaign and except a few textures that i personally would wantt a bit sharper up close when playing the looks of this game is great, so along with the sound work. Not only were the sound effects great but how the sound was used around you I do approve of, and in dark areas you rely as much on your hearing as your vision.CONS:However I do want to leave some cons in here, if you've played through the first Amnesia, this one feels a bit lacking when it comes to encounters of patrolling npcs in dark areas, there could've been more situations of this in my eyes since this is probably what most people remember the other game for. Though the story is just as solid if not better excecuted in Machine for pigs, you do feel like there could've been just more gameplay avoiding and sneaking past npcs and everything feels a bit too straight forward at times which might actually make it a bit shorter than it could've been, and the game lands in on about 3 and a half hours worth of playthrough, which I'd personally consider a bit too short to leave a greater mark.Another thing to note that doesn't have to always be bad but does change the mechanics of the game, is that the inventory system is completely missing in this game. This leaves out things like looking for items to carry and craft, to find and fill on your oil in the lantern etc. This was a what I'd consider an important aspect of the game to make it what it was, and without it, it just feels thin.CONCLUSION:The game is a great game by any means, and it remains on top of the line when it comes to horror/adventure games worth playing out there, but if it comes to the question ""Is it better than Amnesia: Dark Descent?"" My answer is,  No, it probably isn't. But if you enjoyed any of their other games I'd suggest getting this in no time since the pricetag is not too bad, and Linux support is great as well(Yes mac is for it too but who'd want to play on such crap anyway).Great game, get it if you like Amnesia or Penumbra. Just be aware that it might be over before you know it.			"

												From pigs come many great things: bacon, ham, pork, ribs, bacon, other pigs, bacon, Jim Gaffigan, bacon; and now industrial steampunk horror. The game draws inspiration from many classic novels, such as Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"", H.G. Wells' ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"", and that biography of Steve Jobs. Fans of last summer's syncretic mix of ""Empire"" and paint excissation, ""Dear Esther"", will find much to love between Amnesia's syrup-dripping pace and an absence of narrative cohesion. Others may be put off by the controversial inclusion of the ""jump"" mechanic, whereby the player may exert propersterous personal agency without consequence.  I mean, who jumps anymore? Who does that? Certainly not the upper crust. The feature voids Amnesia's imperative, cloying atmosphere with its exasperating flippancy and makes for art that, on the whole, feels too little like art and too much like a game.bacon/10Would serve at a roast.

												The Chinese Room has an excellent writer (or writers), of this I have no doubt. A Machine for Pigs burrows its way into Victorian fear of its own industrious brave new world, the hallmarks of futurism, and existential musings on the nature of man and evil. All of this wrapped in grimy, visceral prose, much akin to the machinery the player stalks the bowels of.But it feels TCR overstepped their creative boundaries into what drew people in Frictional's previous titles Penumbra and The Dark Descent completely. Gone are the inventories, the limited resources, the ever-growing insanity. Your light never fails, you never need to drag an object more than twenty feet, and death is only a temporary setback. It feels almost as if Frictional had very little to do with it, aside from the Amnesia brand name and some input on nasty monstrosities out to eat the player (And these moments are very few). You will spend a lot of time walking around and listening to talking. Doesn't that seem familiar, now? Dear Esther was an experiment, one I feel failed, but dragged kicking and screaming into this long awaited project. I think Frictional were tossed to the side as nothing more than code monkeys, with the rest of the design process dominated by The Chinese Room. Do not seek a survival horror, here: Whatever plans for it have been buried by script dictation.It's not all bad, though. If you do want the thick atmosphere of rusted, Victorian machinery, the trudging through the catabolism of our species as the anabolism of it stalks you, and finding out just what those colourful piggie masks are all about, I suppose you could do a little worse than spending the tenner to find out just what exactly lies deep beneath that meat packing plant. But if TCR want to create Dear Esther, then try to inject that piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥into Amnesia, then I'm going to hold it to the same criticisms: What is it, in the medium of videogames, that I could not have experienced or entertained from a good book, or an elaborate theme park ghost house? If you want to challenge the medium of videogames, you're going to have to do better than this. Take responsibility for your crusade, don't drag another's projects down with you into pretense hell.

												This game does have some scares, and the game is highly immersive with a deeply interesting story to tell, disturbing but interesting all the same, but ultimately is way too short and too easy to recomend as a game.I finished the game in around 5-6 hours allowing plenty of time for exploration...However ...those 5-6 hours were in a single play-through, I was hooked from start to finish. So while I find this game hard to recomend, I also have to say that I loved every second of it. The environments all have so much detail that it is hard not to get sucked into this twisted tale. Sadly only the atmosphere remains from the previous Amnesia:The Dark Decent, the gameplay and puzzles even the sanity meter and the limited light source have all vanished leaving just a walking simulator with a strong story to tell...shame.For people who like a good story or some twisted♥♥♥♥♥shit straight out of a horror movie check this out when it goes on sale.

												I'm fond of horror games such as Amnesia, the dark descent (I think it's the best I've ever tried), but honestly, a Machine for Pigs is not scary. At all. It's nothing like the first opus. At the beginning of the game, you stay alert, you hear weird and disturbing sounds, and as you remember the dark descent, you think "" omg something is coming "" ...but finally, nothing. You meet some pig (which is absolutely not scary either), he doesn't even attack you, so that's it. You just spend all your time walking accross places, resolving stuff and walking again. You can make noise if you want, nothing is going to happen anyway ! It's a pity because they removed  all the interesting things which were in the first Amnesia. Such as the fact that you go mad if you don't have enough light, and also with the oil thing...Anyway, in a Machine for Pigs, the atmosphere created is pretty good, but that's all. Really disappointing.  If you want to be scared out of your wits, go ahead and play with The Dark Descent !!			"

												The ""game"" stops being scary in any capacity when you realise that it doesn't want you dead. It's too busy pushing its poorly crafted story down your throat and washing it down with heavy handed vulgar marxist rhetoric. If there was more game and less awful, high handed dialogue then it might have stood a chance but frankly it seems to be too concerned with being the intellectual saviour of video games to realise that in order to do that it needs to embrace the qualities of the artfrom (i.e. the GAME part) rather than simply try to make a vaguely interactive film. I honestly can't believe this was written by a man who is allowed to lecture people in a university. Not a patch on its predecessor, Dark Descent.			"

												Big disappointment compared to the Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The story, monsters, environment, and puzzles are all less suspensful, unique, and frightening. I originally thought that it was because I had gotten used to the game style from The Dark Descent, but reading other reviews lead me to believe that the developer (The China Room) just simply goofed on this one. It is still published under Frictional Games, but it ultimately does not feel like a Frictional title. Certainly it has the large dark rooms and cooridors and such, but it's missing all of the magic from the previous titles.			"

												 My only disappointment in this game was the SHORT experience it provided.In the first Amnesia game, you were trapped in a surreal castle followed by a dimensional monster while being chased by aquatic ghost monsters and former humans, deformed into monstrous servants. The kicker, though? You were to confront the owner of the castle, an alien disguised as a human noble, from another dimension which defies all imagination.The dimensional guest we are to confront has a motivation for his perseverence in all things. He wants to traverse the dimensions, back to his beloved. After centuries of studying cultures, creatures and the very human nature.This would be a short and unimpressive description of the a fascinating plot which the first game has. Do the fans even care about these things? No, no one cares about the plot reasoning. They just want jumpscares so they can record their own stupidity on youtube.What A Machine for Pigs did, it cut out the cheap jumpscares and introduced a hard-to-digest storyline and a character which most fans can't comprehend or relate to in any way possible. The reaction? Not enough jumpscares.Bottom line, the PewdiePie generation has the last word in any horror game which actively tries to be more than a jumpscare-dispenser.			"

												Weaker than the first amnesia, perhaps a good game for introducing the horror genre to new comers that dont want anything too frightening. Atmosphere was decent but not as great as its predecessor, the setting i much prefered. I didn't expect what was delivered but i was not at all disappointed. However many elements in The Dark Descent have been removed for some reason, something as big as having an inventory even, which really damaged this game for me.I reccommend it, but definitely on sale. $10 or less.

												The first Amnesia game was horrifying. But it was so horrifying I could not stop playing it. That is what made it such a great game. This sequel can hardly be described as spooky. If you are looking for a scary game, this is probably not for you. The only way I could reccomend this game was if you were a major fan of the original and manage to get it dirt cheap on sale.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a really short game; I clocked in at around three hours.  To it's credit, even in this short time span I went through an impressive range of emotions.  First, I was unsettled and creeped out, waking up in a bed that was surrounded by an animal cage.  Next I was curious to learn who I was and what events had led to my precarious situation.  As I picked up and read some scattered notes I felt genuinely disturbed as they described surgical experiments and mutilation.  Roaming a labyrinthian sewer, I lost my way and confusion set in.  Then somewhere along the way I got tired of looking at bricks and pipes and I got bored.    The setting of A Machine for Pigs is intriguing; taking place in London (I believe...) around the start of the industrial revolution it's the Lovecraft tropes we know and love, but in a setting that's somewhat unique for the genre.  The character you control is the owner of a meat packing business, and the advent of automated machinery to replace human workers leaves him a little obsessed with streamlining the production line.  Under his house lies impossibly complex machines of death to slaughter the livestock.  And of course by “pigs” he means humans.  His kids take to playing in these death tunnels and have an accident around the pig people.  Discovering his twin boys' demise leads your protagonist further into madness, and he becomes obsessed with bringing them back.  The underground laboratories help his quest as he feeds more blood into his machines with the promise of quenching the insatiable appetite of an elder god residing in an abyssian pyramid.  His wife died, too?  Forgive me if the details are hazy, but this is one of those “pick up the notes” types of storytelling, and it also really doesn't matter that much because it's more about the atmosphere of the game.  And the spooky atmosphere is done rather well.  At first, anyway.  The early portions of A Machine for Pigs could reasonably be criticized for being nothing more than “boo, haunted house” jump scares, but these are quite effective and the strongest parts of the game.  Descending deeper into the earth you'd figure a darker madness awaited you, but no... it's mostly just recycled bricks and pipes and steam.  There's a real good buildup to revealing the pig-men hybrid monsters that stalk the halls, and seeing one for the first time is unnerving.  Unfortunately that's about all you're going to see in terms of monsters, and their effectiveness wears off long before the apocalyptic payoff of pigmen running rampant in the streets of London.  They become more nuisance than nightmare, obstacles between you and the solution to a simplistic puzzle you'd otherwise solve before you knew the problem.  Again, for a short game it seems like it's stretching itself too thin.  I started off fairly high on Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, but as I progressed I grew less interested.  It's been awhile since I played the original Amnesia, but somehow I remember much more about that game than the one I just finished.  It's almost like... no, ♥♥♥♥ it.			"

												I don't think the bad reviews for this are warranted. Overall it's a decent sequel to the first amnesia game. I admit it was a little less scary because of the choice of monsters, but there were still moments that had me on my toes, and the atmosphere was decent enough that I refused to play it with the lights off. Not bad altogether, recommend to any fans of the first game looking for a new experience.			"

												*Spoiler free*  Let me start of by saying, if you're looking for a game that is exactly like The Dark Descent, A Machine for Pigs isn't it.    While, I will admit that I would have liked to seen some more aspects similar to that of TDD, I'm still a fan of AMFP. Why? Well, because there's so many jumpscare horror games out there nowadays. Jump scare horror games while, yes, do scare you, are very easy to make and take minimal effort. The Chinese Room could've very easily done just this and given us a half-effort game full of cheap jumpscares. But they didn't, instead they decided to take time and make a game that will do more than give you a heart-attack, it will, instead send chills down your spine and leave you feeling disturbed long after you've finished it.    The atmosphere is spot on, the ambiance is great, the story is chilling and the main character is interesting and extremely complex. I won't give away details about the storyline but, if you're concerned about this game not being connected to TDD at all, it is, don't worry, you just gotta be quick enough to notice it ;). So, overall,  AAMFP is a fresh take on the Amnesia franchise and is one those games, where you honestly have to play for yourself to really develop a good opinion on it. Honestly, it's no TDD but, it's still a great game and worth a play. 7/10			"

												I'm a big fan of Amnesia: the dark descent, and I was really looking forward to this game. I'm sure the story is good and all, but I can't get into the story because the game is so boring. The monster isn't scary looking, mostly just boring jump scares like  you see the monster run past a doorway you're about to walk through like 8 times before you actually encounter it, when you encounter it, you can pretty much escape it by walking. If you loved running and grabbing random stuff and throwing it at the monster chasing you like in the first game. You can't do that in this one. Almost all of the objects are locked in place. The puzzles are extremly easy(maybe they get harder but I got too bored and disapointed to continue playing) I tried getting into the story, and tried coming back to the game a few times but i couldn't get into it. The disapointment was too much. I know the blame isn't all on the chinese room, but I think the game would have been much better if they didn't get involved. I don't see why they replaced fun and scary gameplay with a good story instead of just having both.			"

												I really liked the first Amnesia. Its one of the scariest games I ever played and it was probably one of the first games that really showed me what indie developers are capable of.Machine for Pigs is not worthy to have the ""Amnesia"" name in its title. I found it to be one of the most boring games I've played for a long time. Its more strange than scary. This review won't be very detailed simply because there's just not alot to do.Most of the time you're just walking along a linear path until you reach a locked door, then you find a way to unlock it. The solution is usually in an adjacent room. Occasionally you'll have to sneak past some creatures, but the level design makes it totally obvious which route is safe. Repeat for 4 hours.The story is told through a mixture of finding journal pages, and listening to someone talk over an intercom. Most of it just comes across as random nonsense, whilst replacing the word ""man"" with ""pig"" to sound deep and edgy. Because we're all filthy, greedy creatures, I guess.Trying to think of good things to say. It didn't crash. And it lets you save anywhere, which is something that many more high profile games don't give you the freedom to do these days.Sorry but I just can't recommend MFP under any circumstances. "

You might like if: You loved the original Amnesia and want more, but do not mind a weaker plot and the loss of limited light sources or puzzles.The spiritual successor to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but not quite of the same calibre.I'm undecided about 'A Machine for Pigs' - It's certainly got the Amnesia style and it's a pleasing change to see it taken to a more 'Industrial Revolution' style setting, than attempt to recycle the original. The smart, yet empty, house and the networks of industrial machinery are unpleasantly eerie and set the tone nicely. Crackling radios, the creaking of valves in the distance and the solitary ring of an isolated telephone... certainly a well-crafted environment.The problem, however, is that a large portion of what made the original scary has been removed. The tinderboxes/lamp are replaced by a lantern with unlimited fuel. Whilst the new mechanic does get used to good effect on a few occasions - There's no longer any dread, no longer any fear and rationing. You don't lose sanity, so the darkness is more an inconvenience than a threat now. The only fear now is what you're likely to stumble upon, which isn't quite sufficient to carry the game on its own. Unnerving, yes - but lacks the same intensity and immediate danger.The puzzles / environment interactions have also been largely stripped from the game. Whilst I appreciate looking in your inventory and collecting items might detract from the plot: It wasn't an issue before, so seems odd to remove it now. You're left with a more linear path and just having to throw switches / carry objects from A to B.Truth be told, the main appeal seems to be the story... but that too, has taken a kicking. It feels reminiscent of those films where you're shouting ""don't open the door you idiot!"" You're being lured deeper into a nightmarish factory by a weird voice who keeps ringing your phone to go ""Hurry. You must come quick, it's your kids..."" and the schmuck of a protagonist going ""Sounds legit. Shall I come unarmed and unaccompanied?""It works as a horror, but not much as a thriller. It's still fun to play, but it lacks the same exciting tension as before.			"

												Not worth 21.99 USD. But also not deserving of the negative feedback given to it. Yes the lantern is infinite and its much more simple than ""A Dark Descent"". The puzzles are trivial and it has nowhere near the horror of its predecessor. It's a psychological horror game, the type that you have to immerse yourself in. If being chased by freaks and attacked constantly is your thing, then Buy ""Outlast"". If Machine for Pigs goes on sale, Scoop it up. i picked it up for 5 dollars after 6 months of wanting it, and im not disappointed with it.Dont let morons ruin expectations of a game because its not Action packed like other titles.  In short: If Dark descent is a 10/10  this is a 7/10.			"

												This Follow up of a classic is better on many thing than the so acclaim classic.Yet, it is not better on things that are more popular.Difficulty, real and big spooky corridor with ghosts and mutants are not as present in this game than the first one.The atmosphere is different this time around and the story isn't telling about a curse and madman.It's more physolophical this time around with a more dramatic vibe.The monsters and kind of boss in the game appear more possible and not as surnatural as the first amnesia.All that have just said is actually making this game better in term of originality and keep the series fresh enough to explain why a spiritual sequel was needed. The different kind of experience you can have with this is interesting and if you prefer more unusual sad and horror story, you will probably like more this game.On my side, this was better than the first, but don't come at me saying it isn't as spooky as the first, I know that, but I have found this sequel to be better to almost erevything else while maintainning a general horror atmosphere. It's more unusual at the same time and that is why this game is better in my opinion.			"

In the game you have no inventory system, infinite lamp juice, no scavaging, not so horrifying monsters, and pointless puzzles. It basically is a walking simulator where you just walk and walk and pull levers and spin valves and continue walking. The game is not that scary at all so all the jump scares n all are just not in the game. Only a few things I liked about this game was the mapping and the story. The story was so interesting and great that their main focus was on that than focusing on more gameplay. It's nice to explore the maps like in Dear Esther, but the gameplay is still lacking. There is no point calling it an Amneisa game if it doesnt have what TDD had. It's not about how great the story or mapping is it's about the feel of the game. The feel of being helpless and trying to survive the terror of the monsters who are hunting you down. There is no custom stories for this and even if their was it would still not make up for the lack of gameplay.6/10.

												Frictional Games took their highly praised Amnesia title and gave it to the developers of the walking simulator that is Dear Esther (The Chinese Room), and the result became Dear Esther 2: A Machine for Pigs. Anyone who enjoy the gameplay in the first Amnesia (or any gameplay at all) will not enjoy this. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a testiment that The Chinese Room are too incompetant to develop any gameplay beond walking mechanics.If you absolutely have to see this game then watch a ""let's play"" on youtube, the only thing you'll be missing out on is holding ""W"" for hours.

												If you can get this game on sale for a decent bargin (like I did), I can't recommend A Machine for Pigs enough.The experience takes full advantage of it's Victorian London setting and weaves a disgusting, unsettling, but surpringly poignant narrative. Representing a factory as essentially a slaughterhouse for the detritus is nothing short of genius, and the emotional ramifications of the player's identity within this setting particulary puts me at unease.However, fans of The Dark Descent will certainly notice the huge step back in terms of challenge and gameplay mechanics with A Machine for Pigs. If you solely wish to engage in a terrifically written interactive experience, this might not be an issue at all, but gamers looking for challenge will find disappointment.If I have any real issue, it's that there doesn't seem to be enough here for A Macine for Pigs to exist as a sequel of a monetary value equal to its predecessor. Many mechanics and concepts from Dark Descent are discarded with basically nothing to fill that void (Although personally I'm glad they did away with the Insanity mechanic). This does mean the puzzles don't outstay their welcome like they begun to in Dark Descent, but it's still ultimately a full fledged sequel with half the content.But on the other hand, I still try to judge A Machine for Pigs (and basically all pieces of entertainment), not by its cost nor its quantity, but its quality. And A Machine for Pigs was a very satisfying nightmare to endure. It's short, but makes every single moment count for something substantial, and has a story and setting that is considerably more engrossing than Dark Descent's. The ending is also superior.If exploring a living, mechanical embodiment of humanity's capacity for efficient, apathetic evil is your jam, I can't think of a better way to spend 4-5 hours. Well, obviously there are several. But you should also look into this game. When it's cheap.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is not a horror game, and can barley be classified as a video game. Its not scary, the story is boring and predictable up until the very end, and there is even less gameplay than the first Amnesia. The only things that it has going for it is the atmosphere and the music, so I guess what I am trying to say is watch a playthrough on YouTube.			"

												Yeap, it is a lot lighter on cheap tricks than The Dark Descent. There won't be huge spiders. So if you are some 15yo schoolgirl - you will like it a lot less than first game and probably will be bored in no time. This game is not about some demons, cults, monsters and castles. It's the game about greed and poverty, about love and ice cold cruelty, it's about charity and power, about family and betrayal. If you are looking for story - A Machine For Pigs easily outbeats The Dark Descent. It's a lot more dark, disturbing and unsettling game. It is a lot more intelligent game. And there is ten times more style. Though this is where it all flaws are - it is too smart for common gamer. You need to actually read and think. And A Machine for Pigs will gnaw into your ribcage.

A failure of marketing, a success of a game.Machine for Pigs is an excellent horror themed walking simulator. It's not hard, there's no 'game over' screen (and for good reason, nothing reminds you that you're playing a game more than re-loading to-try-try-again) but failure is punished in a way that makes sense within the story and doesn't pull you out of the experience.If you want an excellent and atmospheric gothic horror camp fire story to wander through then this is a game that will appeal to you. If you're expecting it to be a sequel to Amnesia, with its gimmicky fear mechanics and try-try again difficulty, as the origonal advertising campaign for the game might have lead you to expect, then keep clear.

You might like if: You loved the original Amnesia and want more, but do not mind a weaker plot and the loss of limited light sources or puzzles.The spiritual successor to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but not quite of the same calibre.I'm undecided about 'A Machine for Pigs' - It's certainly got the Amnesia style and it's a pleasing change to see it taken to a more 'Industrial Revolution' style setting, than attempt to recycle the original. The smart, yet empty, house and the networks of industrial machinery are unpleasantly eerie and set the tone nicely. Crackling radios, the creaking of valves in the distance and the solitary ring of an isolated telephone... certainly a well-crafted environment.The problem, however, is that a large portion of what made the original scary has been removed. The tinderboxes/lamp are replaced by a lantern with unlimited fuel. Whilst the new mechanic does get used to good effect on a few occasions - There's no longer any dread, no longer any fear and rationing. You don't lose sanity, so the darkness is more an inconvenience than a threat now. The only fear now is what you're likely to stumble upon, which isn't quite sufficient to carry the game on its own. Unnerving, yes - but lacks the same intensity and immediate danger.The puzzles / environment interactions have also been largely stripped from the game. Whilst I appreciate looking in your inventory and collecting items might detract from the plot: It wasn't an issue before, so seems odd to remove it now. You're left with a more linear path and just having to throw switches / carry objects from A to B.Truth be told, the main appeal seems to be the story... but that too, has taken a kicking. It feels reminiscent of those films where you're shouting ""don't open the door you idiot!"" You're being lured deeper into a nightmarish factory by a weird voice who keeps ringing your phone to go ""Hurry. You must come quick, it's your kids..."" and the schmuck of a protagonist going ""Sounds legit. Shall I come unarmed and unaccompanied?""It works as a horror, but not much as a thriller. It's still fun to play, but it lacks the same exciting tension as before.			"

												From The Chinese Room the Creators of Dear Esther come the long awaited sequel to Amnesia the Dark Descent.I understand why Frictional Games did not want to do a follow up to Amnesia the Dark Descent, i mean there first game was already perfect so why bother. It's also an interesting gamble that they hired The Chinese Room to make a Sequel considering that they have never done a horror game.Whether it payed off or not is up to the player to decide i personally like Amnesia Machine For Pigs but i understand that it might not appeal to everyone. Unfortunately it's a walking simulator and the focus on sneak gameplay and horror encounters has been strip down to a bare minimum. So the only thing that is there is a level design about clicking a few switches and a audio narrative story about a tale of love, death and pigs. Thankfully The Chinese Room now's how to Tell a story since they have done that in the past with Dear Esther and with Everyone goes to the Rapture (which would release on the ps4 a few year later).7.3/10 Verdict: Sadly it's Dear Esther with an amnesia skin so try to see it as different take than an actual Sequel and you might still enjoy it.

												This game does not deserve the Amnesia title and is a pale reflection on it's predecessor.Amnesia The Dark Decent was developed by the excellent Frictional Games, A Machine for Pigs was developed by The Chinese Room.There are some vague links to TDD but by and large this is a vastly inferior game.-Gone is the sanity and darkness mechanic. You actually get a flashlight and can quite happily wander around most of the game with this out.-Enemy encounters are few and far between-Very linear game play, there is a set path and the game pretty much sticks you to it.-Paper-thin plot where the ending is very predictable from quite early on.I found the experience quite dull and was glad to see the closing credits if I'm honest. It was an effort to force myself to continue playing this game and I would not reccomend this to anyone expecting a similar experience to the great TDD.I purchased this as part of a Humble Bundle and still feel ripped off by the few pence I spent.

A machine for pigs is indeed scary as hell, but still the story and everything does not work for me. You can easily tell that this is not the same studio that made the first one, as is correct. It will never be the same, because they are made very differently. Removing of the fear bar is a horrible choice. If it ain't broken, why fix it? -Still, it is a scary game, and if you like scary games it's allright I guess, but there are way better games out there than this.			"

												Anyone who has played the first Amnesia but not the second DONT! For the love of everything good please do not waste your time it is easily the worst game I have ever played. It is a huge step down from the first and is poorly made and written. There is no threat and it is all jump-scares there is no sense of urgency or danger. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!   Its like frictional stopped trying. And the notes are nonsensical ""poetry"" and everything grabs desperately at the pig theme. ""I went to the market, then I went home, I had some roast beef and the next I had none..."" Like that was unnecessary I get that the game is about pigs you don't have to beat me over the head with pig references thanks.This game is actual trash, it isnt scary at all.  They took the interactivity from the TDD out of it.  They took the health and sanity out of it.  The urgency of not having oil in your lamp is gone.  There is no need to be worried about if you are going to have enough light to make it through the next section of the game.  There are no tinder boxes so you dont have to worry about having enough light in certain areas of the game.  Also, there is no inventory so you dont have to worry about carring all those pesky usable items around with you. Also, the puzzle mechanic from the first game is entirly gone. You dont have to worry about firguring anything out. It is very point A to point B.  You dont have to take any time to figure anything out, everything is haded to you on a silver platter saying, ""Here you go, here is what you have to do."" Whereas in TDD you have to read through notes and figure out what you are supposed to do next.All in all the game is really poorly made and the lack of game machanics from the first game cripple this game to almost unsalvageable. I fail to find a single redemable quality in this game. Not to mention the story, virtutally unfollowable. If you liked the first Amnesia DO NOT play the second one! Stick to 'Justine' or Custom Stories. "

												AMFP was very dissapointing to me. I personally was all hyped up and couldn't wait for it to come out, since TDD was one of my favorite video games ever. After playing it and realizing I paid for this ""game"", I feel like an idiot. There is no inventory or item management. Gone is sanity and the darkness mechanics. Basically, there are no mechanics at all, even. The only thing you do is walk down boring, empty corridors over and over again. There is no challenge, no difficulty. This would be ok if the game was redeemed with story. However, there was no story either. In the begining, there is kind of a hint at a story. There is something starting to grow, but it gets squished by the time the game ends. The ending is pretty much just a bunch of symbolism and drama. And not in an interesting way, like Bioshock Infinite or the like, but in a ""What just happened?"" way. The game is also full of this silly pig motiff that doesn't really mean anything. ""At least it's scary, right?"" Not even close. There are only three times where the monsters can actually kill you. And even then, they can be outrun easily. They're too easy to escape. There is no tension or sense of danger. They're also pig people. When I realized they were pigs, I just let them kill me. I'm out. The final aspect is the puzzles. I was hoping that they would be interesting, logical, fun, and challenging like in penumbra and TDD. No. They consist of physics puzzles that are way too obvious and easy.  "

												OK. I believe I have to have a break from shooting, or my brain turns to mush, and everything is a 'situation' to be figured out. Hmm..., Anyway, I have a huge place in my heart for the weird and creepy. I go for games like Fear 2, Fear 3, Silent Hill, and Paranormal. That genre: Horror,... Great games and cool in their own way. The best thing about all of them is: Atmosphere! I love it when you can throw the headphones on, and get the life scared out of you! I think there is a desire for a scary experience in all of us(vicariously)! One thing I have found in this game, and it took a while to get used to learning what I need to do at first but when the game was starting to heat up, some of the most beautifly rendered shots and weird shots in the game had me hooked. I love good art. I love games that are good looking as well as having atmosphere. This game has it all. I love the look and turning up the PC hasnt hurt, running this on High and 1910x1080 @ 60FPS it is just as creepy and scary as you can handle. If you don't get scared, you haven't found much, yet... The game hass some easy puzzles but, it gets harder and evasion comes starts Meaning something, when  you start seeing 'Things' down in the cellars and machines, With you! And looking for you! It is great game to pass the time with and if it goes on sale Definitely consider it. I have spent about 6 hours and Im getting close so the game play seems to be coming to a cllose after 8 hours of straight play. So its an average length game but so fun because it just gets to you and keeps you unbalanced with the sound effects that are excellent at providing a sense of terror.This little game is overlooked and so are Amnesia games. Untill you play them, then if you like the games youre Hooked. I like the game, and think you'd at least like the demo( if there is one) . Hope so! This is a wonderful escape for me. I have all of the Amnesia catelogue. On sale, like I said, and it was worth every dime.			"

												Like the Chinese Room's Dear Esther, Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs seems more like an art project than a video game. Many of the game mechanics from The Dark Descent are gone, no inventory, sanity, or latern oil remain. There is very little survival or horror in this sequal to one of my favorite survival horror video games. If you expect this to be like the original then you will most likely be disappointed.All of that being said, the game does look good - in an artistic way, this isn't CryEngine. The music fits the atmosphere very well, and the story isn't too bad either. If you pick this game up on sale, or you don't enter the game with too many expectations, then you will most likely enjoy it. It's not bad, but in my opinion Frictional Games messed up by having the Chinese Room develop this. I wish I could give a more neutral recommendation, but given the binary option Steam gives me I will have to say No, I will not recommend this game. This is mostly because I was personally disappointed, but you may not be - so don't let that stop you from playing.I hope that there's another Amnesia game in the future, but I hope that next time Frictional Games goes back to how they made The Dark Descent.

												Since it's called Amnesia, one would expect a good horror/adventure. Well, it's not. The game was developed by Dear Esther creators and it shows: you simply move forward solving easy puzzles and occasionally meeting non-scary monsters. I cannot say the game is bad, but it shouldn't be called Amnesia and it's worth a shot only if you liked Dear Esther.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a lackluster ""horror"" game if it can even be considered a horror game.  It is a barebones version of Amnesia: The Dark Decent.  All of the mechanics and things that made surviving ""The Dark Decent"" fun and exciting are missing from this.  My first playthrough with finding most journal enteries totaled around 4 hours to completion.  Would I play it again? No.Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is directed at casual gamers looking for a thrill. This overpriced thrill is nothing more than one jump scare and some an engaging atmosphere that seems eerie but is lacking.  The story is well thought out yet simple.  The sounds in this game are what make it the creepiest but are not nearly enough to deliver what I was looking for.  I would not recomend this game for more than $5 USD.4/10			"

												If you liked the first one you will enjoy the second one as well. It has a lot of what the first one had and the team who made it suceeds in bringing that similar horror feel the first one itself had. Not too sure why there are negativie reviews, i think people just expected way too much from it, and put the first one on too high a pedestal. This is a great horror game in its own right :)			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs uz nie je Amnesia... ale aj tak ide stale o vybornu hororovu adventuru.Je o nieco kratsia a hadanky su podstatne jednoduchsie, ako v pripade The Dark Descent. Mne osobne ta jednoduchost ale neprekazala, ma to rychlejsi spad. Viac ale zamrzi fakt, ze objektov s ktorymi mozete interagovat je uplne minimum a spravidla su to len tie, ktore pouzit musite. Takze su prec situacie so skladanim bedni na seba, alebo ich odsuvanim k objaveniu vzacnych kresadiel, ci oleju do lampy. Tu ma lampa neobmedzenu vydrz a taktiez uz nic cestou okrem dopisov nezbierate, tym padom odpadol aj inventar. Ale ako som pisal, mne osobne to neprekazalo a k A Machine for Pigs som pristupoval ako k samostatnej hre, nie ako k pokracovaniu Amnesie a sklamany som nebol.Vyssie uvedene ale bezproblemov dohana pribehom, atmosferou a hudbou.Pribeh samotny si dovolim tvrdit, ze je zaujimavejsi, ako v pripade prvej Amnesie. Niekto by mohol sice namietat, ale mne osobne prisiel lepsi. Je taky surovejsi, tak nechutne desivejsi a donuti Vas zamysliet sa, pretoze vzdialenejsie odraza aj nasu skutocnu realitu. Atmosfera je to, co mi v tejto hre vazne nechybalo. Bol som napjaty od zaciatku az do konca a velkym dielom k tomu urcite prispeli aj zvukove efekty. Tie spolu s hudbou vytavaraju naozaj velkolepo-posobive a desive sceny. Aj ked ma A Machine for Pigs s The Dark Descent uz len malo spolocneho, tak ju rozhodne doporucujem. Uz len kvoli tej zvukovej stranke ide o skvely zazitok. A nebude mat ani ziadny problem obklopit Vas strachom. Druha Amnesia Vam zabori rypak pod rebra a zahryzne sa do srdca!			"

												Only the name and the controlls seems similar to the number one terror game of the world, Amnesia, the dark decents. A machine for pigs is indeed scary as hell, but still the story and everything does not work for me. You can easily tell that this is not the same studio that made the first one, as is correct. It will never be the same, because they are made very differently. Removing of the fear bar is a horrible choice. If it ain't broken, why fix it? -Still, it is a scary game, and if you like scary games it's allright I guess, but there are way better games out there than this.			"

												DEAR AMNESIA: RUNNING IN THE DARK WITH PIGSThis game is worse than its predecessor in almost every way. It's a very short linear path to complete the game, finding and reading all the notes did little to pad out the 4 HOURS it took to complete this game. Sound and music, while the amount was limited, was good throughout and I enjoyed the music as soon as game hit the main menu. Story was pretty weak and forgettable with a twist ending that was heavily hinted at throughout if you paid attention. Graphics/visuals are pretty and interesting to start off, but seem to get worse and less interesting the further you go. Starting with beautiful building interiors, transitioning to interesting machine stuff, and then it started to become bland with the next sections. As I got to the belly of the machine, I wanted to be disgusted, seeing a mix of pig and human gore that powered the machine all over the place...all I got was poor red water textures travelling in.The gameplay is sadly the weakest part of this game. Sadly its boring compared to the previous game, there were 2 sections where I started to get interested, saying: ""this is where it starts getting good with the pig monster."". Unfortunately that didn't happen. Instead of playing cat and mouse with the monster as you complete objectives, its practically all on rails to run away along the linear path of the game. While the previous game had these segments, they were intense because you played with it by closing doors, hiding, jumping onto furniture to avoid the water monster, etc. This game just had run. These were frustrating because the monster was much faster than you, rather than be roughly the same speed as in the previous game. getting killed by the monsters in the last game was because you ♥♥♥♥ed up. In this game its the game's fault by its  poor design. The puzzels are stupidly easy, and completing an objective is basically done in a few steps in one direction. There are also removed gameplay features, no mods, less visuals, completely removed sections, sounds, and ai compared to the previous game. Simply put: this was an amnesia game repackaged into Dear Esther in the dark. Did i mention once you go through many of the doors that split the game's sections... YOU CAN'T GO BACK! WTF, WHY DID YOU DESIGN IT LIKE THAT. I know I missed a bloody note, and i cant get it without restarting the entire game. ♥♥♥♥ you. At the time before release I saw the trailers and pre-ordered based off of those and my experiece with the previous amnesia game. If only I had realised just how much of this was a ""the chinese room game"", and not a ""frictional games"" game. I expected to feel tense and excited to finally play this game. Unfortunately I got virtually kicked in the balls and in the wallet, and a lesson to not pre-order games.I DO NOT RECOMMEND: DEAR AMNESIA: RUNNING IN THE DARK WITH PIGS			"

												It took Frictional Games a couple of tries to perfect their take on survival horror. The original Penumbra (2007) was original and nicely atmospheric, but flawed due to its atrocious combat. I get that they were going for difficult mechanics to make the player favour flight over fight, but I felt that their efforts back fired and hurt the game over all. The sequel (2008) fixed what was wrong with the original, and made for an excellent experience, and its famous spiritual successor, the outstanding Amnesia: The Dark Descent (2010) finally got the devs the acclaim that they deserved.It should be of no surprise then that when it was announced that the provocatively titled Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs was to be developed by The Chinese Room (famous for their intriguing interactive poem Dear Ester (2012), I was plenty excited.  Whilst the game they released certainly contained the excellent prose and visuals they introduced to us with their former game, I was disappointed to find A Machine for Pigs played out like a rather dull ghost train, rather than the panicky terror Frictional had accustomed me to. The entire experience was over in a few short hours, there was only two enemy encounters, and dying had no consequence other than to mysteriously erase my foe.I’m not at all against games being presented as a linear art piece to simply immerse yourself in and ride out, but when I was expecting this title to be consistent with its predecessors, I was left entirely disappointed. I imagine that I would have enjoyed my time in the belly of the beast far more had the title not bore the Amnesia moniker. This situation reminds me of the film Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001) earning a hostile reaction for not feeling like a Final Fantasy adaptation (no, calling a character Cid is not enough).I Can't Remember out of Ten			"

												This game is a clear downgrade from the original. Gone is the depth of interaction and deep sense of immersion. Gone is the pressure of being conservative with your light sources. The game has a few good moments but not worth playing for. The story line while initally seeming promising, becomes very cliched. Enemies are almost never seen, and when they are, your latern flickers easily alerting you, not that it matters since they are very easy to aoivd. Play the original and forget this game exists.			"

												A Machine for DisappointmentEdit: But seriously, this game had so much potential behind it, I looked forward to this game maybe a bit too much.While the game itself looks great and plays great, it still feels too restrictive, guiding you down a very linear path, rarely branching off. The exploration I did do still couldn't help the fact that it's a very short game. Take in mind I read through everything I did find, and listened to the story unfold, I even had a bug at the end-game where I wandered around for quite some time until realising I was stuck and had to restart, and I still managed to clock this game in just about 4 hours.If you can get this game cheap, then I would recommend it, but at it's full price, I just can't say yes to it, which is a shame, as it is a game that had great potential to me.

												From The Chinese Room the Creators of Dear Esther come the long awaited sequel to Amnesia the Dark Descent.I understand why Frictional Games did not want to do a follow up to Amnesia the Dark Descent, i mean there first game was already perfect so why bother. It's also an interesting gamble that they hired The Chinese Room to make a Sequel considering that they have never done a horror game.Whether it payed off or not is up to the player to decide i personally like Amnesia Machine For Pigs but i understand that it might not appeal to everyone. Unfortunately it's a walking simulator and the focus on sneak gameplay and horror encounters has been strip down to a bare minimum. So the only thing that is there is a level design about clicking a few switches and a audio narrative story about a tale of love, death and pigs. Thankfully The Chinese Room now's how to Tell a story since they have done that in the past with Dear Esther and with Everyone goes to the Rapture (which would release on the ps4 a few year later).7.3/10 Verdict: Sadly it's Dear Esther with an amnesia skin so try to see it as different take than an actual Sequel and you might still enjoy it.

												This game does not deserve the Amnesia title and is a pale reflection on it's predecessor.Amnesia The Dark Decent was developed by the excellent Frictional Games, A Machine for Pigs was developed by The Chinese Room.There are some vague links to TDD but by and large this is a vastly inferior game.-Gone is the sanity and darkness mechanic. You actually get a flashlight and can quite happily wander around most of the game with this out.-Enemy encounters are few and far between-Very linear game play, there is a set path and the game pretty much sticks you to it.-Paper-thin plot where the ending is very predictable from quite early on.I found the experience quite dull and was glad to see the closing credits if I'm honest. It was an effort to force myself to continue playing this game and I would not reccomend this to anyone expecting a similar experience to the great TDD.I purchased this as part of a Humble Bundle and still feel ripped off by the few pence I spent.

												Anyone who has played the first Amnesia but not the second DONT! For the love of everything good please do not waste your time it is easily the worst game I have ever played. It is a huge step down from the first and is poorly made and written. There is no threat and it is all jump-scares there is no sense of urgency or danger. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!   Its like frictional stopped trying. And the notes are nonsensical ""poetry"" and everything grabs desperately at the pig theme. ""I went to the market, then I went home, I had some roast beef and the next I had none..."" Like that was unnecessary I get that the game is about pigs you don't have to beat me over the head with pig references thanks.This game is actual trash, it isnt scary at all.  They took the interactivity from the TDD out of it.  They took the health and sanity out of it.  The urgency of not having oil in your lamp is gone.  There is no need to be worried about if you are going to have enough light to make it through the next section of the game.  There are no tinder boxes so you dont have to worry about having enough light in certain areas of the game.  Also, there is no inventory so you dont have to worry about carring all those pesky usable items around with you. Also, the puzzle mechanic from the first game is entirly gone. You dont have to worry about firguring anything out. It is very point A to point B.  You dont have to take any time to figure anything out, everything is haded to you on a silver platter saying, ""Here you go, here is what you have to do."" Whereas in TDD you have to read through notes and figure out what you are supposed to do next.All in all the game is really poorly made and the lack of game machanics from the first game cripple this game to almost unsalvageable. I fail to find a single redemable quality in this game. Not to mention the story, virtutally unfollowable. If you liked the first Amnesia DO NOT play the second one! Stick to 'Justine' or Custom Stories. "

												Nice work Chinese Room, way to ruin this game.  Can't really say I'm surprised this was so bad after playing Dear Terrible by them.  Take everything good about the first Amnesia, get rid of it, and you have this piece of garbage.  No inventory, no sanity, infinite lantern, mostly nonsensical story, and no challenge.  You spend most of the game walking/running down long corridors.  ""Puzzles"" consist mostly of you touching a switch in one room, which will let you go touch a switch in another room, which lets you continue to the next long corridor.  Occasionally you have the real brainburner ""puzzle"" of inserting two objects into something (fuses, vials, coal, gears), which will of course then allow you to press a switch, which of course allows you to continue to the next long corridor.  You figure out pretty early on that there aren't going to be many enemy encounters, which removes most of the horror.  There might be 4 enemy encounters throughout the course of the game, all of which are very easy to get through.  Even the ""final boss"" is a joke.  He appears and then you press two switches in the room you're in and he goes away.  Way to work hard on that idea guys.     Seeing as how everything else about this game is terrible, you'd think there would at least be a decent story, but there isn't.  You get what's happening pretty quickly, though the how and why take a while to develop.  I'll save you a little time, this guy doesn't like people.  He does, however, love pigmen.  Now, as the story goes on, I began to question his pigman masterplan.  It seemed like there might be a few flaws in it.  Towards the end, it began to appear that I was wrong to ever doubt his evil schemes.  Apparently, the small army of pigmen are well coordinated and too powerful for normal people to handle.  This criminal mastermind's dastardly plan for world domination and the extinction of humanity was underway.  I then began to question new flaws in his plan, such as the very large issue of getting the pigmen army out of England and to the mainland continents.  I wondered about the navigational ability of the pigmen.  Would they be able to board ships and navigate the high seas?  Would they be able to read the maps or would they just kind of float around until they wrecked somewhere?  If they♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and pillaged after landing, would they be Viking Pigmen?  Fortunately, the hero of the game kept me from having to wonder to much about these questions, as he destroyed the pigman making machine and saved the world...... except from the small pigmen army which had previously been released and was currently running amok and killing people.  RIP England.  You'll be remembered as the country that was overwhelmed by the awesome military might of the pigmen.     There was one part of the game that I did enjoy.  That was when I got to enter into his secret creeper room, where he drew sexy photos of his wife while watching her bathe through a one way mirror.  She never suspected a thing.     To wrap this up, this game sucks.  I'm reluctant to even call it a game.  You spend most of the game walking around being bored and wanting it to end.  Especially terrible are the parts where the game forces you to walk in slow motion.  This game kind of reminds me of Dear Terrible, except it's 4 hours long instead of 40 minutes, and you get to press a button now and then instead of not being able to do anything.  It also has 100% more pigmen in it then their other game.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs maintains the core mechanics and gameplay from Amnesia: The Dark Descent so prepare to experience an intense and scary game. The game starts off very strong, but then does fall off in terms of horror mid-way through the game. The game is also shorter than the original and a lot of the ""danger"" elements have been removed so you are not constantly dying but experiencing the story. Recommended if you enjoyed The Dark Descent and want another pass for a horror game.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a kind of a mix between the previous Amnesia game and Dear Esther, and the resulting product is certainly not everyones cup of tea. The game is a very streamlined version of Amnesia with all of the survival and most of the horror elements removed. However what remains is kinda very good but not reminicent of the previous game. You just kind of walk around and listen and read the well written story while listening to the excellent sound design and soundtrack. There are some enemies in the game, but they don't look very threatening and you can easily outrun them. The lack of threat and pressure is a major letdown, and while the sound design is impressive, it is at best only unnerving and not at all scary.In true The Chinese Room fashion the game is also very artsy and pretentious and it is very lacking in its forms of engaging with the game world. That might annoy some people who just want to play something with more clearly presented story and substantial gameplay.I myself enjoyed most of the game, and I was kind of expecting something like this when I heard The Chinese Room is involved. You just need to tackle A Machine for Pigs with an open mind and not expect it to be like the original Amnesia, and maybe you'll find something to enjoy in this game.The game gets a recommendation from me, but only barely.

												Stay away at all costs if you're expecting an Amnesia game.There are only a few monster encounters throughout the game, and most of them are scripted. The AI is completely braindead and not threatning at all. The gameplay is as linear as it gets. No exploration, no puzzles, only walking. This isn't worthy of the title Amnesia. This is worthy of the title ""Walking Simulator 2013"". That's all you do.Core elements have been removed from the game. No sanity, no inventory system, unlimited lantern, no tinderboxes and most importantly, the impressive physics have been completely removed. You can no longer pick up any objects other than those which are essential to continue the linear adventure.On the upside, the plot is fairly interesting. If you enjoyed Dear Esther then by all means, pick this up. If you enjoyed Amnesia and you are looking forward to more Amnesia, steer away at all costs. This isn't worth it even at 50% off.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, the much anticipated indirect sequel to Frictional Games' blockbusting indy horror hit The Dark Descent. Bringing in the writing power of TheChineseRoom (makers of Dear Esther) and delaying the game's release in order to better meet the expectations of the consumer base it was widely expected that aMfP would be a smash hit...In reality, it's very disappointing.The first of many flaws is the absolute removal of almost all the interactivity that made the first game so immersive, the player can no longer pick up/throw objects like in The Dark Descent, making the game feel so much more restrictive alongside it's extremely linear level design.Secondly, the challenge of the game is almost non-existant with the unnecessary removal of the Insanity mechanic, and the light has unlimited use, these two poor choices of gameplay make aMfP seem more like a cheap Slender ripoff than anything that can rightfully bear the title of an Amnesia game. Finally, the story is nearly the polar opposite of The Dark Descent, instead of being compelling and interesting the story for A Machine for Pigs is drab and uninteresting, completely failing to capture my interest and leaving no memorable moments (they resorted to using the ""creepy little children"" archetype, a telltale sign of desparation for a scare factor). Since I loved TheChineseRoom's previous game, Dear Esther, and I greatly respect their ability to convey story, I left A Machine for Pigs feeling all the more dissapointed. Frictional Games and TheChineseRoom let the Amnesia fanbase down, and should have payed more attention to what made The Dark Descent the king of the horror genre. So no, I do not recommend A Machine for Pigs.			"

												This is a Walking Simulator. It's an atmospheric one, without doubt. But essentially it is about 4 hours of wandering through endless gloomy rooms full of boxes, waiting for scripted events to happen which have no real impact on the gameplay. It also boasts one of the most confusing and ultimately pointless storylines in modern gaming, where each and every event seems to cancel out the last one and every note you read sends the plot careering down yet another dead end. And sadly, without doubt its' biggest crime is quite simply that it isn't scary. Not even a little bit. Any tension built up at the start of the game is quickly fizzled away and simply never returns, leaving you with nothing else to do but monotonously continue to plod through the game's grey and brown environment.A horrifying (but sadly not in the way the makers intended) waste of potential and legacy, and without doubt the biggest disappointment of 2013. Only to be bought if -very- cheap or for some reason you get some kind of perverse enjoyment from wasting your money.			"

If you've never played the first one this is kind of cool but if you HAVE... it's UTTERLY DISSAPPOINTING. It's NOWHERE near as scary or cerebral as the first one. The story makes very little sense until the very end where it's all explained to you by... you know... the voices in your head that turn out to be you and even then you're staring at the screen going; ""How the ♥♥♥♥ was I supposed to cobble THAT together out of what you gave me???"", there's a TON of wonky symbolism, which wouldn't be SO bad if it wasn't all PIG related and they didn't beat you to death with itthen there's the fact that there is ONE type of monster in it (SPOILER ALERT they're PIGS) and they are so DUMB AND SLOW that literally the only way they can kill you is if you corner yourself. In the first one if the mobs find you, you have literally 5 seconds or less to get the HELL out of sight and hide before they mow you down. Now that may SOUND like the worse of the two options but this is a HORROR GAME. It's not scary unless there's a sense of danger which doesn't exist if you're not afraid of the mobs. At that point the only threat is jump scares where you go ""WAHHHHHH! OHGODWHATSTHAT!?! Oh never mind it's just Babe. That'll do pig. *pats and walks away* "".Over all, it's not scary and you get the feeling they focused too much on the shock value of the pig aspects and forgot about storyline until a few hours before the deadline. If you played and liked the first one, DO NOT play this one. You WILL be disappointed and you WILL regret spending the money.			"

												First off, before I start this review, I want to say that I TRIED to like it. Even forced myself to like it.But me, and the friends who have played the counterpart, have both agreed they took a major part away from Amnesia, namely... The InventoryThe inventory is what defined most of Amnesia, if I'm fair, holding items crucial to the story, and player development. When they took this away, they cut a major part from the story, in my opinion. You are now bound to weird phones, and dragging things along for 3 levels. (Exaggerated)This was a major downfall for me, because the predecessor had this so well done.One of the good things I found, is that the monsters do not dissapear after you die, but instead keep patrolling. I have got to admit, I got frustrated, but none the less, a good feature.Then on to the enemies, who help you in the cages. They are extremely dumb, and can be easily avoided by a hit-'n-run tactic. Just gotta wait your time. This was also a huge letdown for me, as they remained oblivious to you, when you already reached the next room, and gave up chasing you, thus ending in really easy enemies.I could of forgiven SO much about it, though, if it wasn't for the biggest dissapointment of all.The StoryThe story makes absolute zero sense, about some guy going to the Nevada desert, or whatever else got sand, coming back, getting ill, and his children have vanished, and all of a sudden pigs roam the castle. I mean, COME... ON.... This is original, yet SO crummily put together.Two hours into the game, and I set it down, and never finished it since.IT honestly pains me to give the second part of the game, such a bad review, but this leaves me nothing else but a sad, low 2.5 in my book.As much as I'd like to say the contrary, it's not worth the buy, if you're in for a good experience.

												If you've played the first game and are expecting this to be similar just turn around and save your money. A machine for pigs has nothing in common with the first game. The major elements that made the first game successful were removed for a narrative feature that falls short of its intentions. I understand that the game world was supposed to be a giant metaphor for the title of the game but I highly doubt the average gamer/person will think that far. I was not scared/jittery/nervous/jumpy at any point during my experience mainly because when I saw the monster it looked like an emboar reject model. I thought the monster from the last game looked cheesy but this one just made me laugh every time I saw to the point where it robbed the game of the horror element for me. On top of being an inferior monster the AI on the pig monster is incredibly, I mean incredibly low. If you turn off your lantern or pick up a box (assuming you can pick one up because you can rarely interact with items in this game) and put it in front of your face the pig will sniff the air, turn around and walk away. It doesn't chase you, doesn't break down doors, it just leaves.  I may be coming across as a bit harsh but when trying to build on a previous success and use the same name/title when creating it certain expectations are put on it. That said this shouldn't have been called an amnesia title and should have been a standalone game. Overall their is nothing wrong with the game itself, its is playable and the mechanics work (though it is incredibly short). I wouldn't pay full price for this and give it a 6/10.			"

												What can I say about this game....? If you are looking for something like The Dark Descent, it isn't this. The atmosphere was ruined by the lack of inventory managment and sanity meter that you had to watch so closely in the first game. So it eased up on the pressure on the player. There was also no puzzles in this game. In the first you had to figure things out in order to proceed in the game, but without these obstacles it made the game far too linear. Now the jumpscares were fine for the first third of the game, but after you have your first real encounter with the monsters, they seem cheap and less scary then what was probably intended. I will say this for the game, there were two things I liked. Number one, the story. Most people that played Amnesia, played it for the scares. If you were one of the few that liked the story and gathering all the notes in the first one then yeah, this one is interesting. At first all the notes and diaries are out of order so it's all very confusing, but slowly over the course of the game you starting getting the larger scope of the picture. I personally found the plot interesting, but it was also very much like Doctor Who christmas special. By the credits you would think Moffat wrote this game. The real thing I liked about this game was the soundtrack. That I happily bought off of amazon mp3 and felt I got my money's worth. The game itself....not so much. Not with all the hype they put up about it for over a year of worths of delays.  Also the lack of ability to do custom stories makes it not really worth the price that is regular. If you absolutely want to play this game, wait until it goes on steam sale and then get it. Don't pay full price.			"

			A decent attempt at horror, The Chinese Room did mostly well with this attempt, however as a title in the Amnesia series it falls short of some basic expectations and comes off as a little...		

Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs: Not quite as scary or fun as its predecessor, A Machine for Pigs still is a well-made horror game. Its atmosphere, sound design and graphics overall are really well done and the story told by The Chinese Room here is quite interesting as well. For $20.00 USD you really could do a lot worse, and A Machine for Pigs is certainly great quality for its price. The short comings are the fact that it is part of a series and with that comes some basic expectations which are completely removed in this installment. You won’t be dealing with insanity, inventory, lamp oil, tinderboxes; basically you won’t worry about much in this game aside from the monsters. Your lantern never runs out of energy and puzzles are fairly easy because you can only interact with so much.  You can definitely tell they focused more on the story and background than on anything else since most of it is removed. The other minuscule annoyance comes from the frequency of notes in the game. There are a ton of them, the font used in-game is sometimes a pain to read (this comes down to the individual) and a large portion of the game seems to rely on these notes.  Overall, A Machine for Pigs is a decent horror game and a good first attempt by The Chinese Room, but as an Amnesia title it is definitely a step backwards and fans of the series will walk away wanting more. This is a bit tough since the game is of great quality for the price of admission but it comes as a tough full on recommendation for  fans, and newcomers would be better served to play the previous installments before playing A Machine for Pigs. -Middle of the Road from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "

												I don't get why people are hating on this game. I personally felt it ws beautifully crafted by the hands of a small group of clearly passionate individuals who wanted to offer a different, immersive, and story driven title with a backbone of suspense. No, you don't blow off the heads of zombies or exagerate your way through a maze of bullets and fire. This game isn't meant to be a typical, run of the mill shooter. In fact, the sole reason for a first person perspective is to offer a perspective from the protagnist. It really sucks you into a wonderfully dark world. I was on the edge of my seat throughout gameplay, never expecting what was going to scream at me from the corner or grind from above. The complexity of the machine you explore, followed by the well-written plot, crystal detailed graphics, and whimsical voice acting, makes this game a gem in todays market. I recommend it for anyone who wants an atmospheric and progressive story with a twist of horror and symbolism. This game will make you think and it will make your heart thump from time to time. Give it a whirl, it's really not all that expensive, and you will be supporting a wonderful team of people I feel should continue working on such quality content. As for those of you who played the first one, along with me, your in for a treat. The team defintley wanted to offer a different taste in the Amnesia universe. Your going to love it.10/10			"

												The Chinese Room did an excellent job creating a fantastic and truly horrifying experience.I feel the story was very well crafted. Reading all the notes and journals really shape up a pretty horrific tale.Gameplay is pretty much what you would expect from previous Frictional games. The only real big difference is no inventory system. So this time around you aren't running around collecting items and putting them in your inventory. Thats not to say you dont need to go find items though, or flip some switches. But theres definitely not as much of retrieving items.Theres no puzzles really either this time. Everything is a bit more straight forward. The game focuses primarily on telling a horrific story and using the environment to set fear in the player. TLDR?; A great horror experience.			"

												While Amnesia: The Dark Descent was a fresh gasp of air for the horror genre, A Machine for Pigs felt like a casualized knock-off of it's rather brilliant predecessor. I'd recommend it, if it was sold at at least half it's price. Fortunately for myself I bought it when it was on sale, so I got my money's worth.It honestly felt like a mediocre mod to the original Amnesia and I wish I knew better than to buy it. Examples to it being that way are poorly designed monsters, weak storyline, non-immersive gameplay and trivial puzzles. In the end, it was not at all what I expected to buy, it is advertised to be the exact opposite of what it actually is, and the trailer shows all (read ALL) the strongest points of the game while hiding the weak spots.I'd absolutely give it 4/10, I admit that my view of it is warped, but I'm sure that those bias are forgivable if they're based upon how much of an blast of fun the previous game was.EDIT: I also forgot to mention that by paying full price for this abomination, you're not only getting DLC quality, but also DLC playtime, grand total of which consists of 4 hours.

												I really enjoyed the plot and setting built by this game, and actually thought that it did a better job at story than the original Amnesia. It displayed a unique spin on madness, refreshing the usual plot of mass destruction found in such games. However the ""big reveal"" is quite obvious from pretty much the beginning and the mechanics of the game were a bit of a letdown. Where The Dark Descent added enough environmental interaction to make you unsure if what you were picking up was a part of the puzzle or just another box, A Machine For Pigs only allows for the movement of objects related to the puzzles, making it to be a tad predictable and linear. Otherwise I’d highly recommend playing if you want to sit back and enjoy the ride, especially if Steampunky science if your thing.  "

												I decided to not recommend this game as Amnesia the dark descent is a better horror (in my opinion). Although the story was what carried me through in this game it was more because I wanted to see if there was any references to Daniel, Alexander and Castle Brennenburg.Do not misunderstand this game in itself is a good horror and if you played this game as your first horror you'd most likely s**t yourself.. but after battling through Brennenburg this game feels underwhelming.

												Don't treat this like an Amnesia game, and I can guarantee you'll enjoy the hell out of this game.This is probably the best horror game I've played since...Well ever. And for reference, I've played Silent Hill 1-3, Condemned Criminal Origins, Alien Isolation, and System Shock 1-2.Graphics:Not the best in terms of optimization, but it makes effective use of late 1890's English Industrial architecture to create an incredibly grimy world. I honest to god felt the need to take a shower after playing this game. Textures are a bit inconsistent in quality, and the scenery changes are a little jarring. Effective use of lighting, even if it looks a little off.Sound:Incredible. Voice acting is great and the writing is likewise. Sound design is near-immaculate, nearly every effect fits the world and it's atmosphere. Music is fantastic.Gameplay:Minimalist. Doesn't feel like an Amnesia game in this aspect, as the original's point-and-click-esque gameplay has been stripped to the bone. No sanity meter, no lantern fuel, no inventory management, and the puzzles never really go further than ""bring object X to room Y about ten feet away every 20 minutes or so"". The linear nature of AMFP may turn off many, but it works with the story enough to not be too much of a problem. Not a whole lot of replayability. I played through two 6-hour playthroughs and felt kind of done with the game, I'll probably never play through again. The actual monster encounters are few and far between (easily countable on your hands the number of times you're actually in danger), but the few it does have are effective.Story:Grim as hell and with the best ending in a game since Spec Ops: The Line. Might come off as pretentious to some, and the pacing is a little bizarre, but it's definitely one of the highlights of this game. The atmosphere is brilliantly done, and by the time the game is over, you really feel like stuff happened and you were responsible, which is more than most games can claim.OVERALL:8/10Not recommendable to:People who think horror games are just for jumpscares and intense moments of fear. AMFP delivers a couple of those, but not nearly as The Dark Descent. AMFP knows what it's trying to be: a horror game. It's trying to horrify you a dark story and some really ♥♥♥♥ed up visuals and events, where The Dark Descent kind of fell flat. If you liked TDD for it's gameplay, go play Outlast or Alien Isolation.Recommendable to:People who liked Silent Hill 2 but hated its puzzles. Atmosphere is key, and both SH2 and AMFP have the best in the genre.			"

												A Machine for Pigs has an interesting story, the writing is creepy and the voice acting is mainly excellent. Unfortunately however that's about all it has going for it.The game is a big step backwards in almost all ways compared to its predecessor The Dark Descent. AMFP is ultra linear, puzzles have been almost entirely stripped from the formula and the interesting game mechanic of being unable to directly look at enemies has been removed. Gameplay survival elements such as healing items and oil for your lantern are also gone. The new enemies are almost comical in appearance and are rarely life threatening. What all this amounts to is a total lack of tension. Give the original a go instead for some proper thrills.			"

												The first Amnesia game was a very decent survival horror game. It had spooky environments, enemies, and overall a good story and experience.This game on the other hand takes away too much of the elements that were in the first game to feel like an Amnesia game. Inventory system is completely gone, no custom stories, looking at enemies doesn't drain sanity, and overall less scary environments and less scary moments. If you are expecting the same experience from the first game don't even bother with this game.			"

												I preordered this game hoping that it would be just as fun and immersive as the first one. Wow, was I wrong. I beat the game in under 2 hours the first time and then proceeded to play it two more times all the way through before uninstalling it. (I have 4 hours on record at this time). This game was simply too easy. They limited the things you could interact with to items that were significant to the puzzles or the back story. NOTHING ELSE! You couldn't even pick up a chair. To make things worse, out of the 5 or so encounters with the monsters, every single one of them was very easy to pass, seeing as they would only chase you in a certain (VERY small) area and couldn't even do things such as break down doors. Dying was also easily avoidable because it took the monsters up to 5 hits to kill you. If you still aren't convinced, they took away the oil lantern and replaced it with a lantern that NEVER runs out. Not only that, but you no longer have an insanity level, so run around in the dark and stare at the monsters to your hearts content. I wont go in depth with the story, but I will say that the ending was not worth the little amount of game time it takes to reach it. It leaves you with too many questions and includes a small twist that most people will see coming. As for getting this game yourself? NO! Never! Just buy the first one which is rich with replayability. Hope this helps!			"

												This game is bad. Reason why it is bad are the following-Story drags on to long. It feels uninspired, which makes it boring.I think it's pseudo-metaphoric. The narration tries to sound very enigmatic, but fails in the process.-Gameplay is a total lackluster. This game is completely on rails. Most of the time you are wandering in a straight line. You never have any real choice were you want to go. Don't be fooled by many doors you see on screenshots. Basically you move in a big corridor.-the monsters are only scary at first, only to become annoying later down the line, as you progress through the game. This is a problem with many horror games, however Amnesia the Dark Descent conquered this issue by showing enemies less frequent, which also helped in making the game more atmospheric. A good horror game does not need to have monster all to the time, just to be scary.-I regret buying this game, it's a complete joke compared to the dark descent. If you think about it, it sort of makes sense, since it wasn't made by the same studio. It lacks atmosphere, gameplay and choice. Everything the first game had to no ends.			"

												Take out the inventory,  sanity guage, limited resources (lantern has infinite fuel), immersive atmosphere, cut the size of the game into a fourth, and make the monsters look absolutely silly and you get this terrible game. The only thing going for this game is that the letters you pick up are much more disturbing and that the monsters stick around rather than disappear. It's predecessor also had some disturbing letters, however they actually had flashbacks associated with them to help add to them and emphasize the fact that your character had Amnesia and was regaining pieces of his memory, hence the name ""Amnesia"". This game did none of this. This game is dreadfuly disappointing.			"

												I've had this game in my library since it's initial release in 2013. Being a fan of Amnesia: The Dark Descent I had to own it but like a lot of games in my collection if fell to the wayside and was left unfinished on my backlog. Several years and a few hardware updates to my pc later one could assume the game would run brilliantly. Amnesia: TDD is still a reasonably pretty game but A Machine For Pigs has been nothing but a struggle to play at any kind of a consistent framerate. I'm running a GTX 960 with an 8-Core processor and run plenty of modern and old games just fine. Even while running an overclocked card and turning down all settings to a point where the game is running with Minecraft tier graphics the game cant even run a consistent 30 fps. I've tried Windows 7 Compatability mode as well as various other obscure fixes but no luck. Decided to play a game that looks far better graphically and has provided me no trouble at all so far. I can't say I know if the game was like this at launch however on my current system with Windows 10 I've had nothing but trouble. Save your time and money and replay the original or if you're looking for something new play Outlast like I've decided to. Consistent 60fps, excellent graphics, and real terror.			"

												Lost interest really quick. Buy Amnesia: The Dark Descent- Not scary (In my opinion)- No Challenge- No insanity bar- No lantern oil- Really repetative- Monsters take no skill to hide from.What sums up the game is you run around this big machine building/base/room thing, and pull a bunch of levers that make noise. I didn't bother finnishing it because I felt it wasnt even worth it.Buy Amnesia: The Dark DescentBuy Amnesia: The Dark DescentBuy Amnesia: The Dark DescentBuy Amnesia: The Dark DescentBuy Amnesia: The Dark DescentBuy Amnesia: The Dark DescentBuy Amnesia: The Dark DescentIt's so much better.

												Machine for Pigs is a fun and worthy successor to 2010's horror classic. It has some obvious problems, mostly to do with the linearity and lack of puzzles. Perhaps this was a choice by The Chinese Room, who made the snorefest ""Dear Escher."" On the other hand, it's not like the puzzles in Dark Descent were actually GOOD. So, if you're after the same thing I'm after--impeccable set design full of dark winding passages and horrifying creatures lurking just out of sight--you'll be pleased once again. In fact, this game has something that Dark Descent was lacking: a truly striking and effective story. It makes a surprisingly big difference, I found, grounding the protagonist's goals in a search for his missing children. And once you discover the true nature of the evil lurking in the tunnels under London, it will give you a lot more to think about than the rituals of Alexander ever did in Dark Descent.			"

												I went into Machine for Pigs (MfP) with a bit of static in my ears.  My friends who had played the game gave me a very mixed feel on the game, plenty of negative to go with the positive, so I went in with somewhat lowered expectations.  I played Dark Descent years ago, and the Penumbra trilogy more recently, and right out of the gate it was obvious that though this game shared the Amnesia moniker, it was not a Frictional endeavour.  The only Chinese Room game I've played before was Dear Esther, and as much flak as that game receives I found enjoyment in the atmosphere the developers were able to build into such a short experience.  MfP helps the developers carry on that trend, but it gives them much more breathing room.  The extended length (~4-7 hours depending on your hurry) plays to the developers' favor and shows they can make a full length experience with a beginning, middle, and end.  The world MfP builds for the player is as much a social commentary on recent human history as it is a spooky romp through underground, industrial revolution England with tons of pig-based imagery.  While the ties to Dark Descent are minimal and fleeting, MfP manages to stand on its own as a new narrative in a new setting with new characters and still be captivating.  However, if you don't listen closely to the various notes and conversations scattered throughout the campaign, things can get a little confusing.  Even after beating the game I found myself googling portions of the plot to get a better understanding of what had just happened.The main complaint I see/hear for MfP is that the horror pales in comparison to Dark Descent and I'm inclined to agree.  While Dark Descent terrified me from beginning to end, MfP suffers from the same issues as the Slender series in that after a certain point, prolonged exposure to the intiially ""mysterious"" creepies haunting you makes them significantly less mysterious, and minimizes their ability to inspire terror in the player.  However, I don't feel like it was Chinese Room's intent for the monsters to be the source of horror the whole way through the game.  Without going into plot spoilers, the narrative makes it a point to expose the monsters to the player to help make sense of the plot, and the horror stops being this abstract thing going bump in the night to an internal sense of fear and anxiety over the actions of the player.With that last statement in mind, I can totally agree with the Bioshock comparisons.  MfP is every bit as deep as Bioshock Infinite, without the paradoxical nature of the protagonist running around gunning down hundreds of NPC's for the sake of AAA gun-play mechanics.  So if you're interested in an Irrational-style mind-trip, MfP is the game for you.  Just don't go in expecting to be scared out of your wits the whole way through.			"

												It's like an extremely bad custom story for Dark Descent with many of the good elements removed. The only redeeming feature of this game is the increase in variety of locations and levels compared to Dark Descent, but is otherwise stripped of all qualities which made Dark Descent what it is. The story was strange (not interesting), enemies were not a challenge to avoid nor particularly bothersome, and the heart-pumping element of danger that Dark Descent so well induced is completely absent. This does not deserve the title of Amnesia and is not a game I would pay for given another chance.			"

												I recommended this game because it is good as a puzzle exploring narrative. Now did I want that? Not a single bit. I am literally forcing myself to play this game till the end which I am so close to giving up on. The ONE chase scene wasn't even scary and lasted for nearly 3 seconds. The monsters are just big pigs with human like traits. The game is more puzzle and search and find rather than horror. But the story is actually good.As a horror game 2/10It has the setting and all to have potential but is ruined by loading framrate lags and lack of actually threats. Also the survival inventory was removed and was replaced by an infinite fuel lantern and regenerating health for if you somehow get hurt. No laudenaum (sorry for my butchering of the spelling) or oil. Really not hard to ""survive"" in the game. Now in real life playing the game it is hard to survive through it because it is just so damn boring. (Buy Outlast!!!!)As a puzzle game 7/10Too dark to actually see have the doors you need to go to. I spent 30 minutes trying to find a metal grate door in an iron gate fence type wall. Constant walking around trying to find where to go and a lot of backtracking. But if you like a puzzle typeish game then go ahead and give this a try.But no matter the reason for buying this game do not buy it at full price. Wait untill it is on sale or heavily discounted.

												Got chased around by my own dinner - the crawling bacon. This sequel removes all the core mechanics that made The Dark Descent good such as the sanity meter or the limited amount of oil for your lantern and most importantly health. Machine for Pigs has regenerating health, infinite power for your lantern and no remark of sanity whatsoever.The game is creepy for the most part and ♥♥♥♥ those pigs, they are just as bad as the grunts from Dark Descent with their weird squealing nosies. It's not the Dark Descent but it's scary in it's own way but isn't really a good competitor to the previous game in the series. At the very least, it is different; it didn't redo all the scary things that Dark Descent did and it is obvious that the Chinese Room tried to make it different, but the thing that always annoys me is the re-used textures and objects from the Dark Descent.It's good, but could be better - definitely not as good as the first Amnesia game.

												In my layman's opinion, I would defenitely recommend this game for anyone fond of the genre. I played both games in the Amnesy series (""A dark descent"" (AdD) and ""A machine for pigs"" (AmfP)) and I completely enjoyed the ride in each one of them.Both games are similar in their mechanics, but not exactly the same. In AdD there are more puzzles to solve and things to interact with such as light sources or flasks, or to look after, namely health and sanity. Most of these elements are not present in AmfP which, all in all, made me feel it somewhat closer to a walking simulator than its predecesor. At least, for a good number of chapters in the plot from the beginning. However, I think Jessica Curry's score is, hands down, a huge bonus in this second game in the series. Both games really hit the spot in terms of ambiance, spooky effects and a plot that keeps you glued to the screen to the end. Besides, the fact that all you can do against wandering monsters is to avoid them (or run for your life when they actually detect you) really gave me the creeps every time I run into one of them. From this point of view, AdD is more effective in giving you gooseflesh. However, if you immerse yourself in the plot (especially by reading all the notes and/or diary entrances) and especially in the ambiance both games proved me to be a very rewarding experience.			"

Two, its primary objective is to deliver a story (though there are still some good spooks to be found).If you're okay with that, then A Machine for Pigs will give you a mature, dark, human experience to reflect on.

												I'm so very conflicted about this game. Like many, I came in expecting a proper follow-up to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. That game set some extraordinarily high expectations, none of which are fulfilled in this sequel. Where the first game provided an ample amount of terror thru the use of clever level design, interesting puzzle-solving and a haunting atmosphere, A Machine For Pigs decides to ditch everything but the atmosphere. You won't find any difficult puzzles in AMfP; in fact, I can only think of one time where I barely had to use my brain to progress thru the narrative. The rest of the story is largely an on-rails narrative, in the realm of an interactive novel rather than a video game. Having played The Chinese Room's Gone Home, I had a feeling that the follow-up to Amnesia: The Dark Descent would be more focused on story-telling. I had no idea how strictly that model would come to define the folow-up to one of video gaming's greatest horror tales. A Machine For Pigs is a beautiful narrative, enanced by moody lighting and an emotionally stirring soundtrack. Though I was very dissapointed to find that many features from the first game were removed - namely, the sanity meter and the necessity to manage resources - I still found this game enjoyable and satisyfing. My best advice for enjoying this game is to understand that this is NOT a sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent in any stretch of the imagination. It is a stand-alone narrative featuring entirely new characters and a new setting. The gameplay mechanics are severely lscking, even compared to the minimal interaction compared to the first game, However if you are looking to try something different, and enjoy a good horror story, then A Machine for Pigs is worth your time and money. Just not $20 of it.			"

												Like many who bought the brilliant Amnesia: The Dark Descent, I was hesitant to listen to the negative reviews of this ""sequel"" and instead opted to focus more on the positive ones and give Machine For Pigs a chance.  Boy, was that a mistake and a waste of $20.So much of what made the first game great is gone.  No longer is there an inventory system incorporating smart, fun puzzle-solving.  Gone is the sanity system, and with it much of the tension that comes with encountering foes.  And last but certainly not least, gone is the ability to explore and fully interact with the environment.  99% of the objects you encounter can't be interacted with, i.e. you can't open most cabinets, go off the beaten path, scour for interesting items that enhance the story, none of that.  I don't know where certain reviewers are coming from when they talk about how great the atmosphere is in this game.  When you're surrounded by the exact same objects as the first Amnesia game, yet you can't touch them or explore for some reason, it pulls you straight out of the game world.  Side note: I have a very powerful system which can run Amnesia: The Dark Descent at full settings at 60fps... it would seem that The Chinese Room didn't do a very job of making this a stable game on top of it all because this game runs like garbage.  It's hard to be consumed by the atmosphere of the game when you can barely do anything and it's glitching all the time.But on to the story.  Simply put, it's crap.  It focuses so heavily on the ""pig"" metaphor that after a while, you'll grow tired of hearing the word.  The voice acting is weak and the dialogue and scattered notes are pretentious.  The Dark Descent had such style and such a rich story.  This game seems to me like an uninspired cash-in.Listen to all the other reviews.  Stick to The Dark Descent and if you've beat that, get your hands on Outlast.  Both of those games will be staying on my hard drive whereas this one will be getting uninstalled and probably never revisited once I've finished it and feel like I got my money's worth.			"

												This game has absolutely no relation to the first Amnesia save for the timezone and one mention of Brennenburg castle. The nature of the game is predatory and fed off the hype of the first one. They could have gotten away with an inferior product - and they did. In a nutshell:++ Killer environment. Not that it was graphically superior, but it was nice to see a variety of locations unlike the stifled old castle in the first one.+/- The text lore is still there, but its not even text-to-speech anymore. The prose is needlessly complicated and overwrought. It adds nothing to the complexities of the characters. - Puzzles are mind-numbingly easy- Atmosphere is nowhere near as scary as its predecessor. Your lantern's light is infinite, most rooms are well lit- No inventory system- A note on enemies  they are practically non-existent. They show up in 3 areas in the whole game for less than an hour of the game.  - I might have rushed through it, but there were key plot points that were not elaborated upon, like  what happened to the children? What was the core relationship between the butcher and this so-called professor? If you're looking for something that could possibly live up to the Amnesia hype (in terms of spookiness and choherent story), look elsewhere.			"

												If you have played the first one, this one will come as a bit of a dissapointment. While the theme and the story are great, they have hindered many of the original game's key features.1. You have no inventory. You no longer need to scavenge and explore to find tinderboxes, oil for your lantern (now electric), or any of the items you need to progress. This was one of the best parts of the first Amnesia. There was a sense of helplessness and vulnerability when you had to find all of the parts to make a potion or to fix a machine while your lamp was running out. This game is incredibly dumbed down.2. Notes aren't voice acted anymore. Not that big of a deal, I know, but I really enjoyed all the extra effort that was prevalent in the first one when Daniel would read the notes to you, which made him seem more alive.3. The game just isn't that scary. Probably the biggest dissapointment of all. The monsters in the trailer and teaser for the game made them look terrifying. In reality, all they are are pigs that freak out and walk quickly towards you, and they are easy to lose. And there aren't even that many! The creepy and eerie factor that the story brought you is there, minus the jump scares.I really hope that they make a third that will really quench my thirst for the horror series, but for now, I think I'll stick with the first one.

												This is a very different game from the first Amnesia. That being said, I loved it. You have to go thorugh and actually READ all the stuff you find, because the plot is all in the finding of things. The freaking pig-people encounters are so much more stressful than any of the encounters from the first game, because these monsters chase you more (though they don't hit as hard and you can survive a few scratches). However, it feels less interactive, somehow, than the first game, and Mandus is far less sympathetic than Daniel from off the get-go, which makes me care less about what happens to him. And that makes it a little less satisfying than The Dark Descent. But it's still very, very creepy, and worth a play.If you liked the first story you'll probably like this one. The soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous, by the way.			"

												People saying AMfP sucks need to shaddup! It's not as good as TDD on most levels, but it's still an awesome game. It's a very different Amnesia from its predecessor but that doesn't mean it isn't still scary or has a good story, so skipping this is the most regrettable decision you could make in your entire LAIF!

												This game has absolutely no relation to the first Amnesia save for the timezone and one mention of Brennenburg castle. The nature of the game is predatory and fed off the hype of the first one. They could have gotten away with an inferior product - and they did. In a nutshell:++ Killer environment. Not that it was graphically superior, but it was nice to see a variety of locations unlike the stifled old castle in the first one.+/- The text lore is still there, but its not even text-to-speech anymore. The prose is needlessly complicated and overwrought. It adds nothing to the complexities of the characters. - Puzzles are mind-numbingly easy- Atmosphere is nowhere near as scary as its predecessor. Your lantern's light is infinite, most rooms are well lit- No inventory system- A note on enemies  they are practically non-existent. They show up in 3 areas in the whole game for less than an hour of the game.  - I might have rushed through it, but there were key plot points that were not elaborated upon, like  what happened to the children? What was the core relationship between the butcher and this so-called professor? If you're looking for something that could possibly live up to the Amnesia hype (in terms of spookiness and choherent story), look elsewhere.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is thematically fascinating. It's more of an interactive story than a game. There isn't any resource management like its predecessor, which may be less exciting, but it helps tell this game's story better. As such, it is a shorter experience, though satisfying once concluded. The only issues I had with A Machine for Pigs were the bluish haze/fog that many people complaint about, and the high temperature this game caused my GPU to reach. In spite of those issues, this is still worth playing through at least once for fans of Amnesia: The Dark Descent.			"

												 Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs in my opinion was extremely dissapointing. When i launched the game I was expecting a semi-challenging and scary enviorment but what i got was the complete opposite. I beat the game without dying and was only scared in the beginning. What I DID enjoy was the expertly crafted soundtrack and the deep story. The soundtrack perfectly represented the tone of the game. The story was deep and involving the only problem with it was that it cuold be confusing at times. All in all it was a dissapointing and mediocure experience if you want your amnesia fix plaay the first one. I would rate it 6/10.			"

												Amnesia is one of the few horror games I have played, and it met my expectations. A lot of the horror element comes from the suspense. Where you'll see the monsters next, crashes and clangs that echo through the world, and the music. Some of the horror is self-made. You don't see any threat, but you think it might be around the next corner. There are definitely a lot of moments where jumpscares or threats can make you want to scream, don't get me wrong. The plot is really well-done with a few twists that some may see coming. Mandus is traveling deeper into the factory complex and you gain a lot of the story through journal entries and recordings scattered around. You also talk to a mysterious man over the phones. Though some plot elements remain unexplained even in the end. I wish it was longer and there were more truly terrifying elements, but it was a good game overall.8/10			"

I tried Medium settings, max of 20 FPS, I plAYED ON THE LOWEST SETTINGS POSSIBLE. LITERALLY EVERYTHING OFF AND I GOT A MAX OF 22 FPS. THE AVERAGE FPS WAS 9. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS. LITERALLY ANYTHING WILL RUN BETTER. THIS GAME IS ONLY FOR PC YET THE PC OPTIMIZATION IS SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I WANT TO CRY. Not to mention the game itself isn't that great from what I played.

												I told them I was proud of them, and then fed them to the pigs.I went into this game taking any negative criticism with me to compare. Firstly, I was under the impression they sacrificed gameplay for narrative, which I had no problem with, but there was a lot of instances where I had to think on my feet and search for clues to solve a puzzle, which I'd been told were not that intuitive. Besides that, the major aspects of the gameplay, besides the puzzle solving, are maze-like segments where you have to avoid the pig men al a the old minotaur story from Greek mythology. I died my fair share of times at these parts. All in all I'd say it's pretty solid on the gameplay front.Now most of the game is set in an old victorian era factory, which may be my favourite period aesthetic-wise. The atmosphere is very well delivered. Not too many jumpy bits, it aims more for a sense of desperation and chlaustrophobia as you delve deeper and deeper into the machine, but from there on it falls short. The story is incredibly predictable. You can piece it together quite easily from just a few diary entries so the rest of the game is waiting for the inevitable. It was quite long too, for such a game. I've played my fair share of half-decent graphics indie games that just fell short of the 3 hour mark, but I got nearly 8 out of this.Now, I'm not gonna reccomend this wholeheartedly. If you want a game with good horror atmosphere without relying on gore or copious amounts of jumpscares, you should pick this up in a sale. Or get the first one, where the game makes you feel like you have much more to lose. Probably because you do, but I didn't come here to compare them. They're different games in their own right.			"

												Price bought: ~$5 (~$1 per hour)When: Winter Sale 2014What price is it worth: < $5 (<$1 per hour)I enjoyed the monsters, especially the first encounter with the final monster. That fight was a very different step up from other monsters as it was very unpredictable at times.Tension was there, however the tension moments that made the original Amnesia great were few and far between in this game.The story for the most part makes you read and narrate for you as you walk around. Difficult to get into the story as it does not engage you as much as Amnesia did.It is too easy. Your lanthern has unlimited supply, you have no hp bar, no inventory and no sanity meter. I feel that it could be because people complained too much about how difficult it made the original Amnesia. If it was it was not a good idea, and the difficulty should not be changed as a result of opinion.It is too short. 4, maybe getting to 5 hours. It is not worth the full price and should only be bought on sale.I enjoyed this game, but has no replayability (apart from final monster level). I recommend it however if it is on sale, not because it is an awesome game (when it is a medicore game), but so people can comapre to Amnesia and see how;a. Difficulty is what makes the experience, the more difficult the challenge, the more rewarding the conquest is of that challenge.b. An interesting storyline.c. The final monster fight.d. It does have it's share of tension, just not as much as Amnesia had.			"

												If you were a fan of the first Amnesia you will probably be quite dissapointed with this game. While the story is alright, not going to delve into details to avoid spoiling it for you should you come to getting a copy, the actual gameplay is a bit boring and clunky and just less fun than the first game, which I incidently played to near death, I've racked up over 100 hours playing all the decent custom stories I could find, which by the way this game doesn't have, well, not officially anyway there's no option for that, but I recon there are full conversion mods maybe I don't know, don't take my word for that. If you are looking for more Amnesia go for custom stories.			"

												It isn't scary.This is the biggest problem with this game. Yet interestingly enough, you don't realize it at first. I loved playing the first Amnesia game, and so I went into this game with the same mindset. Hide from the monsters, solve the puzzles, answer the mystery at the center of the plot. The game certainly starts like its predecessor. The atmosphere is spooky, and the game doesn't throw any overt scares in your direction at first, just hinting at the horrors that might await. Overall, this works really well. But here's the problem: almost none of the scares are real.What do I mean by that? Well, in the first Amnesia game, most of the time when you heard or saw something that could threaten you, that threat was real. There really was something to hide from. Your fear was justified. In MFP that's really just not the case. I can count on one hand the number of times I was truly in any danger. Most of the time the game plays some scary sound effects suggesting that a monster is nearby, but in reality it's just nothing. You can just safely walk your way through 90% of this game without a care in the world. It does take a while to realize it, because often you'll jump into some hiding place and wait for the monster (which isn't really there) to walk by, so you'll assume that you didn't see it because you hid, and not because there is nothing there in the first place.Really, ""just walking"" is unfortunately way too good a way of describing this game. I really feel that The Chinese Room were the wrong people for an Amnesia sequel. They just don't do interactivity very well, and in really weird ways too. For some reason there is almost not a single object in the game that you can pick up, unless it's a crucial part of some puzzle. I really just don't get this, given that in Dark Descent you could pick up and move most objects you found lying around. This change immediately just reminds you that you're in a game, which messes with the immersion needed to pull off a good horror game. Aside from the house at the start, the big sprawling levels are gone, and instead you just follow along a narrow path. The player just isn't allowed to interact with the world that they're in. There are almost no monsters for them to fear, there are objects that they can move without express permission, and there are no places to explore. In the end, this just reminds you that you're in a game, and lets you know that you're walking down a hallway with scary noises.			"

												This is not a sequel to Amnesia: Dark Descent. It is just another game in the same style made by the same team.A Machine For Pigs is not what I would call a game. It is a first-person visual novel.A Machine for Pigs is extremely well-written, just like Dark Descent was. The story is deep, intense, horrifying, grim, and gruesome. It tells a tale of a wealthy industrialist in the waning days of the 19th century who, wracked by madness and illness, does some pretty terrifying things. Through the game you discover the tale in bits and pieces as you play this man who has, of course, awakened from a fever-induced amnesia. You travel through the streets of London 1899 and through the halls and corridors of your estate and eventually, the titular Machine. You walk around with a lantern, solve very simple puzzles (put this thing here, pull this switch, pull this thing, open this door... that sort of thing), and avoid monstrosities called Manpigs. There is very little of the latter and a great deal of the former (that is to say, this game is basically a ton of walking through corridors). Just like with Dark Descent, I found myself thoroughly bored and just hoping for the next bit of story. I think I'd rather just read this thing as a short story. However, the game does serve up a phenomenal atmosphere, which is something a written novel could never do. The sound effects, the glimpses of the machine and its dark, dark work through bars, windows, and catwalks, the background screams and squishing of viscera, blood, fluids pumping through pipes, lots of breathing and flashes of electricity and steam venting all serve as a perfect backdrop for a tale that wonderfully captures Victorian horror; the steam, the feeling of Progress! Science! Wonders! Mystery!, the primitive but promising technology, and the supreme evils of Empire, God, and Man all set the stage for a deliciously darkthought exercise in what it would be like for this man as he descends into pure insanity. You really feel for him as he desperately seeks redemption for what he has done.I can't say I liked the game, but I did like the story. The pace, just like with its predecessor, was glacial, and that turned me off for months. Coming back to it felt like a chore, but I'm sure lots of people love games like this. It just ain't me.The graphics were good but not as good as Dark Descent. Almost the whole game takes place in endless dark metal corridors with lots of brass, pipes, steam, and dark wood accents. It gets really boring after a while.It's super easy to avoid the manpigs... even easier than the Dark Descent. In addition they got rid of the dumb ""insanity"" mechanic as well as stupid inventory management of oil and crap for your light. Now your lantern just works and all you have to do is walk through about five hours of this game to get to the end and get the whole story.			"

												When I saw this game advertised I was excited.  I loved the first one.  I eagerly started  playing and realized nothing was happening.  I did not encounter a dangerous monster until a couple hours in.  I even laughed at it.  I see people argue that this game has horror elements towards others that found it to be weak.  Abrupt loud noises and a flickering light while something runs by is not scarey.  If it does not cause you anxiety to walk around that dark corner without fear of having your face ripped off, it is not scarey.  This game was not scarey.  I roamed the halls generally care free with a flashlight that never died, health that would renew and a serious lack of danger to worry about.  It had some decent story elements, and a lot of detail went into the machinery, but the game itself was just not fun.  If you have not played the first one, please do not buy the 2nd.  I wouldn't want you to miss out on an actual good game because of utter disgust for ""a machine for pigs"".			"

												Keep an open mind when going into this game. If you go in expecting Amnesia: The Dark Descent 2 then you'll ultimately be disappointed, but if you approach it in the spirit of Dear Esther and Korsakovia with a side order of Amnesia then you'll be more likely to gain something from the experience. Very atmospheric, thanks mainly to the incredible sound design that sounds like something ripped out of David Lynch's Eraserhead and The Elephant Man. Plenty of scares, but perhaps not as much real danger or a sense of urgency as the narrative otherwise implies. The narrative is largely driven by notes and audio logs, so if you miss some of them (easy to do) then you may find yourself missing a few pieces of the puzzle.The end sequence is way too long and protracted (I found myself rushing through the last hour or so) but everything that comes before is well worth experiencing.

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is not so much a horror game as the previous Amnesia. It delivers a great atmosphere and a fascinating storyline but it did not really scare me. Rather, it was a creepy experience telling a sick story. It felt great to uncover the mystery of the environment and the developments happening in the background.Even though this is not as scary as the original Amnesia, it is a great game with a creepy atmosphere and great storytelling. The soundscape is phenomenal and keeps you immersed throughout the game.If the original Amnesia was too horrible for youm but you are somehow fascinated by such games, this is definetely worth checking out!

												I was very satisfied with this game on it's own merits.  Very creepy, very moody.  The sound design was absolutely perfect, and set the tone for the entire game.  When compared to it's predecessor (Amnesia: The Dark Descent), however, it can be dissapointing because of the removal of a lot of the difficulty that game was known for.  All survival horror elements have been stripped from the game.  No more sanity, no more limited source of light fuel, which all takes away from the strategy of the game and makes it more of just a ""Horror"" game, and that is why people are dissapointed by it.  The game is still VERY scary and worth playing if you like horror games, and there are moments of real danger and enemies that will kill you, and some very inventive puzzles.  It is the type of game that you need to just let yourself be immersed in the story and design.  Read every journal entry, and every book you pickup.  The story is well done and very interesting. My only real complaint about it is that besides the title and a few vague refrences to the Brennenberg serum, this game has very little to do with Dark Descent.  It may have been more well received by the public if amnesia and all references to it were dropped from the title and it was just called ""Machine for Pigs"".			"

												I supposed it's a fairly good game, but the first one was better. That's not why I'm not recommending it, though. I'm not recommending it because it never saves my progress, even when I hit ""Save & Exit"" or whatever it is. This has happened a ton of times, and it sets me back a great distance. I've loaded all the ""Load Games"" I have saved and none of them are where I was. Like today, for instance, I needed to turn down the graphics after making it to where I was before, I hit ""Save & Exit"" and restarted the game. Loaded it back up, and boom. Reset again. This makes like 20 times now. I'm livid. I don't know if it's a corrupt file or something, but I don't care. I don't know if it's happened to anyone else before, but it's irritating. Not recommended.			"

												As a huge Amnesia: The Dark Descent fan i must say this game was a dissapointment when it comes to the amount of scares in this game. But from the point of veiw of someone who focused on the game as a completley seprate game. The story was intesnse but had some weak points. The game focused to much around the primary monster and explaining the story of i than the actualy story of the protaganist. But other wise the atmosphere made you shiver and it has alot of unexpected twists that make you rethink things more than once. An overall good game.			"

												As a big fan of the Horror genre in video games, I really enjoyed this! I like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and this is kinda more of the same. In some ways, I felt like there was less to be afraid of in this game, but the atmosphere/story made it just as scary I think.Took 4.6 hour playing though and a comfortable pase. Definitely recommend for anyone who enjoyed The Dark Descent!			"

												If you played and enjoyed The Dark Descent- you will only halfway enjoy this title, as it delivers an atmospheric, immersive, and story-driven experience that completley lacks in gameplay and visuals. The only truly positive thing about this game is its attempts at drawing you in and immersing you in the experience. This only last for the 1st half of the game though, with the 2nd half being drawn out and muddled with the same two problems.First and foremost, TDD had enemies that were way more threatening in how they were utilised as well as their demeanor/appearance. The  pig-men  (SPOILER AMIRITE, it's not like this whole games story was obvious/cliche as hell) are practically never an immediate danger to you. A mad dash can get you through ANY encounter (  2 scares are just monsters chasing you down a corridor anyway  ). They also probably went with the first draft of the monsters design- the monsters are not scary. Sorry, pig squeals can only do so much when your big scary enemy walks around like a drunken pirate whose lost his peg leg.Secondly, a lack of world interaction and inventory/sanity/gameplay made for a super boring tour of an 1800s factory. There is no item management in this game, forcing you to be constantly immersed in the horror experience. So what is there to worry about, again? The game itself needs to back up the sense of dread the story is giving off- and it completly failed to deliver scary gameplay (Case in point #1). Not only is it difficult to die in this game, but it will give you FORWARD spawns like it's some kind of challenging FPS- or is it just that more walking would be just as patience-trying?			"

												A mediocre game at most. With somewhat good aesthetics through the intro and middle-part of the game, the only horror comes from the eery noises which don't come from anything, rather they just seem to get louder the further you get into the game. The monsters so brain dead that you can shine your (infinitely fueled/charged)  lantern at them while standing a mere few meters from them without fear of them noticing you, let alone chasing you (Which let me tell you, they are slow runners and you have an enormous sum of health) and when you escape the terrible puzzle mansion you descend into the factories and piston operation rooms which are plagued with the same problems listed before, and with a cameo from the water monster (from Amnesia: A Dark Descent, and by cameo, I mean cameo by the strictest definition) you are thrown into a... somewhat unique and interesting environment where a possible plot element is revealed to you (Spoiler, the amazing plot element that this is, they just give it up the second you leave this area, which is a few minutes long) - Major Spoilers Beyond This Point - and you leave the area which had great aesthetic and was really what the entire game should have been. Then you get out into the city (The Royal Army and any police just couldn't be bothered to head over there and stop the army of 20 pigmen that was ravaging the city) and you transition into the heart of the machine (Which just happens to be a non-hidden elevator in the middle of the capital of london right next to a subway where no one would have any difficulty getting to, and the only thing that would stop ANYONE from going into the elevator and into this machine would be a sign that said not to come in if you weren't allowed) and this heart of the machine is a giant... well... steampunk heart that somewhat resembles the place that Luke finds out Vader is his father in Star Wars (spoiler alert) and you activate it and are betrayed by the machine which is sentient... I think? It never really explains it at all actually. And then you start running through these sci-fi corridors and into a generator room that reminds me of the lightbulb room from Sly 2, when you're on the giant air ship. And for the first time you encounter the super electro pig that can teleport (ps it has tesla coils coming out of it's back, that's how you know it can teleport, and becaues you know, it teleports around the room) and then you do some more stuff and nothing exciting happens for a good 10-25 minutes and you find some room with a heart (who's heart? maybe your wife's? your child's? the machine's? it never explains) then you are teleported to a giant underground pyramid in which you climb up it forever (ps, behind, like directly behind it, like you just turn around and you can see it right next to you the catwalk leading to the pyramid master chief is sleeping in a cryogenics tube, not even kidding, well, it might not be master chief, it could be mr. house from fallout) and your FOV slides way back when you climb up it, and you see a bunch of canisters on the top of it, then three dentist chairs pop up out of nowhere and when you prepare to get a check-up some claws come out of nowhere and rip out your heart, which is the end of the game. Almost nothing in the game is explained at all, other than the reason you killed your kids, which is so they don't get killed in the coming century (the 1900s).			"

												Pretty disappointing actually...definitely not the same caliber as the original in pretty much every way. The puzzles are pretty boring and easy, the whole game is linear (whereas The Dark Descent had many rooms and the puzzles were pretty intricate). The gameplay is much more boring, the insanity meter is gone and there's no more inventory, meaning that there's no lamp oil or tinderboxes, making the game much less tense. The ambiance is still scary, but the enemies are more dopey than disturbing, which deflates the situation when you're being chased by one. The one saving grace for this game was the horribly disturbing but cool as♥♥♥♥♥♥story, but...it's 3 hours long. I think this game could've been so much better than it was, especially given the success of its predecessor. Not worth 15 or 20 bucks for a boring 3 hour story, maybe worth 5 if you really want it. 4/10			"

												I was very satisfied with this game on it's own merits.  Very creepy, very moody.  The sound design was absolutely perfect, and set the tone for the entire game.  When compared to it's predecessor (Amnesia: The Dark Descent), however, it can be dissapointing because of the removal of a lot of the difficulty that game was known for.  All survival horror elements have been stripped from the game.  No more sanity, no more limited source of light fuel, which all takes away from the strategy of the game and makes it more of just a ""Horror"" game, and that is why people are dissapointed by it.  The game is still VERY scary and worth playing if you like horror games, and there are moments of real danger and enemies that will kill you, and some very inventive puzzles.  It is the type of game that you need to just let yourself be immersed in the story and design.  Read every journal entry, and every book you pickup.  The story is well done and very interesting. My only real complaint about it is that besides the title and a few vague refrences to the Brennenberg serum, this game has very little to do with Dark Descent.  It may have been more well received by the public if amnesia and all references to it were dropped from the title and it was just called ""Machine for Pigs"".			"

												I didn't enjoy the first Amnesia at all, largely because the game mechanics were totally unappealing to me. I was excited that this game removed the sanity and the ""find the tinderbox"" mechanics from Amnesia, and also excited about this game's premise: A steam-driven clockwork hog-butchering city machine under London in Victorian times.Long story short: The puzzles are barely puzzles, the game avoids showing you the most brutal parts of what its suggesting, not in a way that's subtle but just in a way that makes me suspect they couldn't pull it off effectively. I very much liked what they were getting at, I just don't feel that they made a good game.Don't buy it unless you're WAY into steam-driven clockwork hog-butchering city machines under London in Victorian times, or it's like two or three dollars idk			"

												If you played the original this MAY be a nice revisit to the Amnesia story line. If you didn't and are looking to pretend to be pewdiepie like all the other annoying♥♥♥♥♥kids get Amnesia: The dark descent. It's actually scary unlike this installment. My main problem with this game is the gameplay is stripped to the bone. Your lantern has infinite light removing the need to scavenge like in the previous game. Your lantern also flashes when a monster is near so you get a clear OH♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ THERES A MONSTER IN THERE!!! The inventory is removed so puzzels consist of bring one item to the next room. That's about it. Not only that but I encountered a plethora of glitches including but not limited to broken levels, falling through the floor, locked doors that should not be locked, and monsters who can't see you.Also I thought the monsters were kinda cute and look silly when they walk.

												To be honest, the game isn't that scary. The atmosphere isn't as intense as other horror games and there aren't as many enemies which will kill you easily. This is more of a point & click adventure game with horror elements and it is no where near as scary as other games such as the predecessor (Dark Descent) and other horror games such as Five Nights at Freddy's and Outlast. If you want a true horror game then check those games out. If you want an adventure game with a fairly scary atmosphere but not a lot of threat then check this game out. Probably best to wait for when the game is on sale or in a bundle or something like that.			"

												Took me 9 hours to complete this game but it seemed much longer, especially the long drawn out ending. It thought it would never end. I only completed it for the sake of completing it, having gone past the 2 hour refund point before I was sure I didn't like it at all. In fact, I feel the need to take a shower to wash off the depressing residue it left behind. The game is graphically ugly, unlike Everyones Gone to the Rapture which is gorgeous. The controls are really clunky and the mouse has constant problems on the menu screen. I fell out of the world through the scenery several times, luckily without corrupting the save file (or unluckily since then I would have had an excuse to abandon the game). I had to edit the shader file to get rid of the horrible 'fog' effect which obscures everything on the screen forcing you to use the lantern pretty much all the time.The story is like a first draft of a rejected Supernatural episode and never misses a chance to smack you in the face with it's nihilistic philosophy. To say the protagonist is unsympathetic is a huge understatement and the time I spent with him was unpleasant and unrewarding. I couldn't wait for him to exit stage right. The worst thing is that it wasn't scary, just gross.I have to wonder if The Chinese Room was handed the script and the crap engine just to see if they could save it. They couldn't. The game they made after this one is so different in look and story that it's hard to believe they were made by the same studio. If their next game is like Everyones Gone to the Rapture then I'll buy it, but I'll never touch another Amnesia title again.			"

												Okay, I held the minority opinion in hating The Dark Descent (but loving the original Penumbra games from the same company), but Machine for Pigs is even worse. Even half the reviews from Dark Descent fans here don't like it.Here is 90% of the game:1. Walk around empty environment looking for a level/valve to pull to open up a door to advance.2. Every 5 minutes, an earthquake or meaningless ambient sound or pointless voiceover flashback will cause the screen to go blurry and slow your character to a crawl for a couple seconds.That's it. I'm not joking. That's almost the entire game. There aren't even any items, inventory, or resources to worry about. I would have been fine with this since that aspect of Dark Descent annoyed me, but they didn't replace it with anything interesting here. There are free horror Flash games with more depth and interaction.Even though I didn't like Dark Descent, at least there was  the interest in pushing forward in order to find out why your character was in this environment. You had amnesia with a note from yourself telling you to kill some man, and you spend the game finding out why. In Machine for Pigs, you have a plot that's pointlessly obtuse only to distract you from how boring it is. Your character wakes up and mumbles something about the children running into the basement where apparently you set up an industrialized slaughter house. Most of the notes and journals you pick up are confusing and worthless to sheddding any light on anything. They're just there to waste your time and try to trick you into thinking there's some DEEP MEANING to this pretentious naval gazing nonsense.Just worthless. HOW bad is it? I honestly think this might be a worse atmospheric walking simulator than Gone Home. Yes, it's THAT bad.			"

												I believe the majority of players, going into this game, were expecting it to live up to the original Amnesia title.  This is where they go wrong- Amnesia a Machine for Pigs is its own, original title.  While it relates back to the original, do not go into this game expecting it to -be- the original.  If you do, you will be disappointed.  If you do not, you will enjoy the experience profusely.  While the game itself is not inherently horrifying, I thoroughly suggest this title to any gamer with a passion for story, atmosphere, and philosophy.  The narration was immaculate, and the ending phenomenal.  When you enter this game, expect not a mere horror game, simply for the sake of a scare, rather, an introspective plot characterized by a dismal, Victorian setting and atmosphere.  I must say, as a gamer with an interest for philosophy and atmosphere, I ended up enjoying this game even more than the original, and I grew to appreciate the characters moreso than the original.  However, only play this game if you are willing to sacrifice the scare factor for other qualities.  It may not be particularly scary, but this game has rightfully earned its place as my favorite survival-horror title.			"

												Before I say anything, I AM one who played Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and I loved that game. But now onto my thoughts...If you want a fairly creepy game that has an interesting story and a good meaning and theme to the plot, this game might be for you. If you are here to get spooked and chilled to your core whilst exploring and playing around with your environment, this game isn't for you. Personally, it wasn't for me, but I can absolutely see the appeal that many people have with the game. I do not like the direction that was taken in this sequal (that being they removed the inventory system [limiting puzzles] and there is no sanity or oil management), but I still enjoyed the game nonetheless. That's a little scattered of a review so I'll sumarize. Is this game a good and interesting adventure? Yes, totally. Is this game a good follow up to Amnesia: The Dark Descent? No, not quite. Do I recommend? I'm going to say no, but I can absolutely see the appeal for this game if you just want a good experience.			"

												Compared to the original Amnesia: The Dark Descent, A Machine for Pigs is not as good by a long shot.First of all, the story is really far-fetched and unlogical - in a way that really takes away from the atmosphere and the tension. In the beginning, the ambient noises and graphics build a nice atmosphere which quickly deteriorated.The puzzles also are far too easy. Having left them out would have made the game better.In A Machine for Pigs, the balance of survival (light = sanity and risk of discovery, darkness = security and insanity) is completely missing. You can easily hide or run from the monsters, and apart from that, you can use as much light as you like.Don't buy this game. Play The Dark Descent or Penumbra instead.			"

This is more of a point & click adventure game with horror elements and it is no where near as scary as other games such as the predecessor (Dark Descent) and other horror games such as Five Nights at Freddy's and Outlast. If you want a true horror game then check those games out. If you want an adventure game with a fairly scary atmosphere but not a lot of threat then check this game out. Probably best to wait for when the game is on sale or in a bundle or something like that.			"

												First of all, this one was no where near as scary as Dark Decent! T_T So in that, I am disappointed. Especially since the teaser trailer was so bloody awesome. -.-This one had lots of jump scares, I guess... and most of them not even monster related.Took me about 6 hours to complete.Controlling for this game was very easy! Keyboard and mouse.Glitches and bugs? None that I encountered.Motionsickness factor: I suffered some nausea, so maybe play around with the FOV.Graphics... I had some gamma issues and the 'blue haze' on everything was bloody terrible. I found a fix for that by changing one of the save file fields to False... just google it.The story itself wasn't all that great.Would I recommend this game? ONLY ONLY ONLY if you are a huge chicken♥♥♥♥♥♥and scare very easily... otherwise... for you hard core horror game fanatics, I'd say play if on sale or if you are bored or simply pass it up. Sorry. T_T I wanted so badly for this game to be awesome.			"

												Before I say anything, I AM one who played Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and I loved that game. But now onto my thoughts...If you want a fairly creepy game that has an interesting story and a good meaning and theme to the plot, this game might be for you. If you are here to get spooked and chilled to your core whilst exploring and playing around with your environment, this game isn't for you. Personally, it wasn't for me, but I can absolutely see the appeal that many people have with the game. I do not like the direction that was taken in this sequal (that being they removed the inventory system [limiting puzzles] and there is no sanity or oil management), but I still enjoyed the game nonetheless. That's a little scattered of a review so I'll sumarize. Is this game a good and interesting adventure? Yes, totally. Is this game a good follow up to Amnesia: The Dark Descent? No, not quite. Do I recommend? I'm going to say no, but I can absolutely see the appeal for this game if you just want a good experience.			"

												If you are new to amnesia try the dark descent. This one is really bad if you compare to the first one and still bad if you take it alone... It simply doesnt deserve to bear the name of amnesia. I felt dirty playing this and I cant do it a second time... too boring (i played the first one countless time). I was not scared even once in this one. It is more of a atmospheric walking simulator with very few not to say without horror elements... it is too much pig oriented if you ask me... I was really excited to play this when it was release and let me tell you I hit a wall of disappointment soon enough. I was reading news about a second amnesia and wasnt able to wait played the first one again and again until its release...pre-purchased this one on steam and got screwed real bad.			"

												This game was definetly not as scary as the first game and it also got alot of bugs.The first real problem about this game is that it's got such an strange story and sometimes it makes very little sense, it also makes the whole idea of the game very uncomfortable.First game got an excellent idea of scary moments and lonely situations but this game doesn't make you feel alone in the same way.That crazy idea of making mutated pigs as enemies makes the game pretty damn cool but also sad...There is some really good sides about this game aswell such as the graphics and its still pretty damn scary sometimes.Buying this game is a pretty good idea if you liked "" The dark decent"" but you should be informed about the issues.7/10			"

The eye-opening, bitter reality of our society smacks you in the face (as well as a few goulies) as you play through A Machine for Pigs is meant to be the real scare; and it does not disappoint.			"

												One of my favorite horror games. It's not as scary as the Dark Descent but makes up for it with one the best stories i've seen in a video game thus far. I still find new things in the story that i didn't notice the first time and i've been keeping track of since release. Several instances in the game are truly frightning and i felt my heartrate go haywire. I was constantely on edge due to the excellent sound design and the brilliant voice acting made me keep playing even more. The dialogue in this game is fantastic. On the downside: the game is very short. I wish it was just a tad bit longer. But like i said before, most of it's shortcomings are made up for due to it's amazing story. I consider both Amnesia games the pillars of true horror with this one being the pillar of psychological horror. 9/10			"

												I supposed it's a fairly good game, but the first one was better. That's not why I'm not recommending it, though. I'm not recommending it because it never saves my progress, even when I hit ""Save & Exit"" or whatever it is. This has happened a ton of times, and it sets me back a great distance. I've loaded all the ""Load Games"" I have saved and none of them are where I was. Like today, for instance, I needed to turn down the graphics after making it to where I was before, I hit ""Save & Exit"" and restarted the game. Loaded it back up, and boom. Reset again. This makes like 20 times now. I'm livid. I don't know if it's a corrupt file or something, but I don't care. I don't know if it's happened to anyone else before, but it's irritating. Not recommended.			"

												Another entry in the Amnesia series, however this time developed by the makers of Dear Esther. Not really all that scary when compared to the harrowing experience of its predecessor, Amnesia: Dark Descent, or the pure terror of the recently released Outlast, A Machine for Pigs deals more in psychologically disturbing stuff than in-your-face boogeymen and buckets of guts.It's only halfway successful though, since I didn't really enjoy it as much as the other games I've mentioned. The story is intriguing, but the puzzles are way too easy and enemy encounters are few and far between. Graphically, the Frictional Engine is starting to show its age as well, however sound design and music are great.Overall, A Machine for Pigs is a slight disappointment, especially if you're expecting a ride similar to the original Amnesia.

I agree there is not a lot of innovation (actually, there is zero innovation) on top of TDD, I still found this to be an incredibly fun game that I invested around 12 hours into on my first playthrough (That's what steam is telling me, atl least. I'm fairly certain it was around 8ish hours, however). Bottom line, if you enjoyed The Dark Descent, I believe you'll enjoy this, as well, especially worth it if you can grab it on a sale.			"

												I told them I was proud of them, and then fed them to the pigs.I went into this game taking any negative criticism with me to compare. Firstly, I was under the impression they sacrificed gameplay for narrative, which I had no problem with, but there was a lot of instances where I had to think on my feet and search for clues to solve a puzzle, which I'd been told were not that intuitive. Besides that, the major aspects of the gameplay, besides the puzzle solving, are maze-like segments where you have to avoid the pig men al a the old minotaur story from Greek mythology. I died my fair share of times at these parts. All in all I'd say it's pretty solid on the gameplay front.Now most of the game is set in an old victorian era factory, which may be my favourite period aesthetic-wise. The atmosphere is very well delivered. Not too many jumpy bits, it aims more for a sense of desperation and chlaustrophobia as you delve deeper and deeper into the machine, but from there on it falls short. The story is incredibly predictable. You can piece it together quite easily from just a few diary entries so the rest of the game is waiting for the inevitable. It was quite long too, for such a game. I've played my fair share of half-decent graphics indie games that just fell short of the 3 hour mark, but I got nearly 8 out of this.Now, I'm not gonna reccomend this wholeheartedly. If you want a game with good horror atmosphere without relying on gore or copious amounts of jumpscares, you should pick this up in a sale. Or get the first one, where the game makes you feel like you have much more to lose. Probably because you do, but I didn't come here to compare them. They're different games in their own right.			"

												Amnesia is one of the few horror games I have played, and it met my expectations. A lot of the horror element comes from the suspense. Where you'll see the monsters next, crashes and clangs that echo through the world, and the music. Some of the horror is self-made. You don't see any threat, but you think it might be around the next corner. There are definitely a lot of moments where jumpscares or threats can make you want to scream, don't get me wrong. The plot is really well-done with a few twists that some may see coming. Mandus is traveling deeper into the factory complex and you gain a lot of the story through journal entries and recordings scattered around. You also talk to a mysterious man over the phones. Though some plot elements remain unexplained even in the end. I wish it was longer and there were more truly terrifying elements, but it was a good game overall.8/10			"

My main problem with this game is the gameplay is stripped to the bone. Your lantern has infinite light removing the need to scavenge like in the previous game. Your lantern also flashes when a monster is near so you get a clear OH♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ THERES A MONSTER IN THERE!!! The inventory is removed so puzzels consist of bring one item to the next room. That's about it. Not only that but I encountered a plethora of glitches including but not limited to broken levels, falling through the floor, locked doors that should not be locked, and monsters who can't see you.Also I thought the monsters were kinda cute and look silly when they walk.

												If you played and enjoyed The Dark Descent- you will only halfway enjoy this title, as it delivers an atmospheric, immersive, and story-driven experience that completley lacks in gameplay and visuals. The only truly positive thing about this game is its attempts at drawing you in and immersing you in the experience. This only last for the 1st half of the game though, with the 2nd half being drawn out and muddled with the same two problems.First and foremost, TDD had enemies that were way more threatening in how they were utilised as well as their demeanor/appearance. The  pig-men  (SPOILER AMIRITE, it's not like this whole games story was obvious/cliche as hell) are practically never an immediate danger to you. A mad dash can get you through ANY encounter (  2 scares are just monsters chasing you down a corridor anyway  ). They also probably went with the first draft of the monsters design- the monsters are not scary. Sorry, pig squeals can only do so much when your big scary enemy walks around like a drunken pirate whose lost his peg leg.Secondly, a lack of world interaction and inventory/sanity/gameplay made for a super boring tour of an 1800s factory. There is no item management in this game, forcing you to be constantly immersed in the horror experience. So what is there to worry about, again? The game itself needs to back up the sense of dread the story is giving off- and it completly failed to deliver scary gameplay (Case in point #1). Not only is it difficult to die in this game, but it will give you FORWARD spawns like it's some kind of challenging FPS- or is it just that more walking would be just as patience-trying?			"

												A mediocre game at most. With somewhat good aesthetics through the intro and middle-part of the game, the only horror comes from the eery noises which don't come from anything, rather they just seem to get louder the further you get into the game. The monsters so brain dead that you can shine your (infinitely fueled/charged)  lantern at them while standing a mere few meters from them without fear of them noticing you, let alone chasing you (Which let me tell you, they are slow runners and you have an enormous sum of health) and when you escape the terrible puzzle mansion you descend into the factories and piston operation rooms which are plagued with the same problems listed before, and with a cameo from the water monster (from Amnesia: A Dark Descent, and by cameo, I mean cameo by the strictest definition) you are thrown into a... somewhat unique and interesting environment where a possible plot element is revealed to you (Spoiler, the amazing plot element that this is, they just give it up the second you leave this area, which is a few minutes long) - Major Spoilers Beyond This Point - and you leave the area which had great aesthetic and was really what the entire game should have been. Then you get out into the city (The Royal Army and any police just couldn't be bothered to head over there and stop the army of 20 pigmen that was ravaging the city) and you transition into the heart of the machine (Which just happens to be a non-hidden elevator in the middle of the capital of london right next to a subway where no one would have any difficulty getting to, and the only thing that would stop ANYONE from going into the elevator and into this machine would be a sign that said not to come in if you weren't allowed) and this heart of the machine is a giant... well... steampunk heart that somewhat resembles the place that Luke finds out Vader is his father in Star Wars (spoiler alert) and you activate it and are betrayed by the machine which is sentient... I think? It never really explains it at all actually. And then you start running through these sci-fi corridors and into a generator room that reminds me of the lightbulb room from Sly 2, when you're on the giant air ship. And for the first time you encounter the super electro pig that can teleport (ps it has tesla coils coming out of it's back, that's how you know it can teleport, and becaues you know, it teleports around the room) and then you do some more stuff and nothing exciting happens for a good 10-25 minutes and you find some room with a heart (who's heart? maybe your wife's? your child's? the machine's? it never explains) then you are teleported to a giant underground pyramid in which you climb up it forever (ps, behind, like directly behind it, like you just turn around and you can see it right next to you the catwalk leading to the pyramid master chief is sleeping in a cryogenics tube, not even kidding, well, it might not be master chief, it could be mr. house from fallout) and your FOV slides way back when you climb up it, and you see a bunch of canisters on the top of it, then three dentist chairs pop up out of nowhere and when you prepare to get a check-up some claws come out of nowhere and rip out your heart, which is the end of the game. Almost nothing in the game is explained at all, other than the reason you killed your kids, which is so they don't get killed in the coming century (the 1900s).			"

												I loved the first game and played it with avid interest for what might occur around every corner.  This ""sequel"" takes away, literally, all the gameplay mechanics that made the first special.No item combiningNo managing your health vs. madness metersNo tinder boxes for creating lightA lantern with infinite lightNo real puzzles to solveThe game seems shorter, has an interesting premise but the outcome is predictable early on and the monsters aren't scary.  This isn't really to do with the types of monsters used but how they are employed.  There is a much greater sense of theatre, exploration and depravity in the first game.  Even the reason as to why things occurred in the plot is kind of..... lame.  For me this feels more like a galary of limited events, little to no survival horror aspects and suitable to truly scare only the faintest of heart.  My favourite and only truly redeeming quality is the soundtrack, the use of texture and tone is truly fantastic.			"

There is no sanity, you do not go insane, you do not panic... its well lit mostly and simple. It might be because I haven't gotten far but... I really see no danger in this game at all, its just a puzzle game.			"

												This game is really close to being one of the worst games i've played. It's a  2-3 hours walking simulator, with no exploration, plain stupid story and multiple technical issues.First of, It's not a horror. I've noticed attempts to scare me (I think ?). But enemies are hilariously bad designed, have nonexistent AI and completely broken animations.I'm serious, first time I had a good look at the enemy, I chuckled, because how stupid he looked. There is no real threat, 90% of the time enemy will run past you and vanish into thin air. By the way, once I saw an enemy just popping into existence. The ""scare script"" was so obvious, that before pulling a lever I looked at a place where they could appear, and BAM - He just spawned. There is also an invisible water monster. Because hey! It worked in Dark Descent, right ?Story is baaaad and boooring. Half of it is predictable as hell, the second half is just idiotic. Main hero is an idiot... at that would be all. There not much of it in this game. Gameplay is really simple. Hold W and walk through a corridor. You can't pick up objects, open doors, explore. If an enemy is chasing you, hold W and SHIFT. Sometimes you will have to pull a lever. That's... fun? Game will constantly force you to listen to bad voice acting. And while you main hero have an inner monologue, everything will blur and slow down (and your mouse sensitivity will change). It's really annoying. Also for some reason, everything have a blue tint. It doesn't make any sense. It will also, randomly lock itself to 40 FPS for a minute and then go back to 60. (I think it's autosave?)Music is decent.. at least some parts of it. Overall, it's terrible. Don't waste your time and money. If you are REALLY interested about it, go to wiki and read a synopsis of the story. It's 11 lines of text... "

												This game focuses more on the story rather than the horror. The previous game: Amnesia The Dark Descent, was an outstanding and terrifying game that created a new standard for horror video games. Therefore, the expectations for Amnesia A Machine For Pigs was very high. This game is not as good overall as Amnesia The Dark Descent, but despite that, it is still an interesting game to play. It introduces some new things that Amnesia The Dark Descent didn't have. And it does have some scary stuff in it			"

												I was very satisfied with this game on it's own merits.  Very creepy, very moody.  The sound design was absolutely perfect, and set the tone for the entire game.  When compared to it's predecessor (Amnesia: The Dark Descent), however, it can be dissapointing because of the removal of a lot of the difficulty that game was known for.  All survival horror elements have been stripped from the game.  No more sanity, no more limited source of light fuel, which all takes away from the strategy of the game and makes it more of just a ""Horror"" game, and that is why people are dissapointed by it.  The game is still VERY scary and worth playing if you like horror games, and there are moments of real danger and enemies that will kill you, and some very inventive puzzles.  It is the type of game that you need to just let yourself be immersed in the story and design.  Read every journal entry, and every book you pickup.  The story is well done and very interesting. My only real complaint about it is that besides the title and a few vague refrences to the Brennenberg serum, this game has very little to do with Dark Descent.  It may have been more well received by the public if amnesia and all references to it were dropped from the title and it was just called ""Machine for Pigs"".			"

												I supposed it's a fairly good game, but the first one was better. That's not why I'm not recommending it, though. I'm not recommending it because it never saves my progress, even when I hit ""Save & Exit"" or whatever it is. This has happened a ton of times, and it sets me back a great distance. I've loaded all the ""Load Games"" I have saved and none of them are where I was. Like today, for instance, I needed to turn down the graphics after making it to where I was before, I hit ""Save & Exit"" and restarted the game. Loaded it back up, and boom. Reset again. This makes like 20 times now. I'm livid. I don't know if it's a corrupt file or something, but I don't care. I don't know if it's happened to anyone else before, but it's irritating. Not recommended.			"

												As a huge Amnesia: The Dark Descent fan i must say this game was a dissapointment when it comes to the amount of scares in this game. But from the point of veiw of someone who focused on the game as a completley seprate game. The story was intesnse but had some weak points. The game focused to much around the primary monster and explaining the story of i than the actualy story of the protaganist. But other wise the atmosphere made you shiver and it has alot of unexpected twists that make you rethink things more than once. An overall good game.			"

												If you played and enjoyed The Dark Descent- you will only halfway enjoy this title, as it delivers an atmospheric, immersive, and story-driven experience that completley lacks in gameplay and visuals. The only truly positive thing about this game is its attempts at drawing you in and immersing you in the experience. This only last for the 1st half of the game though, with the 2nd half being drawn out and muddled with the same two problems.First and foremost, TDD had enemies that were way more threatening in how they were utilised as well as their demeanor/appearance. The  pig-men  (SPOILER AMIRITE, it's not like this whole games story was obvious/cliche as hell) are practically never an immediate danger to you. A mad dash can get you through ANY encounter (  2 scares are just monsters chasing you down a corridor anyway  ). They also probably went with the first draft of the monsters design- the monsters are not scary. Sorry, pig squeals can only do so much when your big scary enemy walks around like a drunken pirate whose lost his peg leg.Secondly, a lack of world interaction and inventory/sanity/gameplay made for a super boring tour of an 1800s factory. There is no item management in this game, forcing you to be constantly immersed in the horror experience. So what is there to worry about, again? The game itself needs to back up the sense of dread the story is giving off- and it completly failed to deliver scary gameplay (Case in point #1). Not only is it difficult to die in this game, but it will give you FORWARD spawns like it's some kind of challenging FPS- or is it just that more walking would be just as patience-trying?			"

												A mediocre game at most. With somewhat good aesthetics through the intro and middle-part of the game, the only horror comes from the eery noises which don't come from anything, rather they just seem to get louder the further you get into the game. The monsters so brain dead that you can shine your (infinitely fueled/charged)  lantern at them while standing a mere few meters from them without fear of them noticing you, let alone chasing you (Which let me tell you, they are slow runners and you have an enormous sum of health) and when you escape the terrible puzzle mansion you descend into the factories and piston operation rooms which are plagued with the same problems listed before, and with a cameo from the water monster (from Amnesia: A Dark Descent, and by cameo, I mean cameo by the strictest definition) you are thrown into a... somewhat unique and interesting environment where a possible plot element is revealed to you (Spoiler, the amazing plot element that this is, they just give it up the second you leave this area, which is a few minutes long) - Major Spoilers Beyond This Point - and you leave the area which had great aesthetic and was really what the entire game should have been. Then you get out into the city (The Royal Army and any police just couldn't be bothered to head over there and stop the army of 20 pigmen that was ravaging the city) and you transition into the heart of the machine (Which just happens to be a non-hidden elevator in the middle of the capital of london right next to a subway where no one would have any difficulty getting to, and the only thing that would stop ANYONE from going into the elevator and into this machine would be a sign that said not to come in if you weren't allowed) and this heart of the machine is a giant... well... steampunk heart that somewhat resembles the place that Luke finds out Vader is his father in Star Wars (spoiler alert) and you activate it and are betrayed by the machine which is sentient... I think? It never really explains it at all actually. And then you start running through these sci-fi corridors and into a generator room that reminds me of the lightbulb room from Sly 2, when you're on the giant air ship. And for the first time you encounter the super electro pig that can teleport (ps it has tesla coils coming out of it's back, that's how you know it can teleport, and becaues you know, it teleports around the room) and then you do some more stuff and nothing exciting happens for a good 10-25 minutes and you find some room with a heart (who's heart? maybe your wife's? your child's? the machine's? it never explains) then you are teleported to a giant underground pyramid in which you climb up it forever (ps, behind, like directly behind it, like you just turn around and you can see it right next to you the catwalk leading to the pyramid master chief is sleeping in a cryogenics tube, not even kidding, well, it might not be master chief, it could be mr. house from fallout) and your FOV slides way back when you climb up it, and you see a bunch of canisters on the top of it, then three dentist chairs pop up out of nowhere and when you prepare to get a check-up some claws come out of nowhere and rip out your heart, which is the end of the game. Almost nothing in the game is explained at all, other than the reason you killed your kids, which is so they don't get killed in the coming century (the 1900s).			"

												Another entry in the Amnesia series, however this time developed by the makers of Dear Esther. Not really all that scary when compared to the harrowing experience of its predecessor, Amnesia: Dark Descent, or the pure terror of the recently released Outlast, A Machine for Pigs deals more in psychologically disturbing stuff than in-your-face boogeymen and buckets of guts.It's only halfway successful though, since I didn't really enjoy it as much as the other games I've mentioned. The story is intriguing, but the puzzles are way too easy and enemy encounters are few and far between. Graphically, the Frictional Engine is starting to show its age as well, however sound design and music are great.Overall, A Machine for Pigs is a slight disappointment, especially if you're expecting a ride similar to the original Amnesia.

												I didn't enjoy the first Amnesia at all, largely because the game mechanics were totally unappealing to me. I was excited that this game removed the sanity and the ""find the tinderbox"" mechanics from Amnesia, and also excited about this game's premise: A steam-driven clockwork hog-butchering city machine under London in Victorian times.Long story short: The puzzles are barely puzzles, the game avoids showing you the most brutal parts of what its suggesting, not in a way that's subtle but just in a way that makes me suspect they couldn't pull it off effectively. I very much liked what they were getting at, I just don't feel that they made a good game.Don't buy it unless you're WAY into steam-driven clockwork hog-butchering city machines under London in Victorian times, or it's like two or three dollars idk			"

												Though a little different, this new installment of Amnesia is a very welcoming and fresh take on the horror genre. What it forms is a truly disturbing atmosphere and sense of unease without ever giving you too much of one thing, With it's superb environments, voice acting, music, sound effects, and mood it's not a game you'll soon forget.The Dark Descent was a roller coaster with a focus more on survival and evasion, A Machine for Pigs is a journey of disturbing monstrosity and intrigue with some of the familiarity of the first.

												This is not a sequel to Amnesia: Dark Descent. It is just another game in the same style made by the same team.A Machine For Pigs is not what I would call a game. It is a first-person visual novel.A Machine for Pigs is extremely well-written, just like Dark Descent was. The story is deep, intense, horrifying, grim, and gruesome. It tells a tale of a wealthy industrialist in the waning days of the 19th century who, wracked by madness and illness, does some pretty terrifying things. Through the game you discover the tale in bits and pieces as you play this man who has, of course, awakened from a fever-induced amnesia. You travel through the streets of London 1899 and through the halls and corridors of your estate and eventually, the titular Machine. You walk around with a lantern, solve very simple puzzles (put this thing here, pull this switch, pull this thing, open this door... that sort of thing), and avoid monstrosities called Manpigs. There is very little of the latter and a great deal of the former (that is to say, this game is basically a ton of walking through corridors). Just like with Dark Descent, I found myself thoroughly bored and just hoping for the next bit of story. I think I'd rather just read this thing as a short story. However, the game does serve up a phenomenal atmosphere, which is something a written novel could never do. The sound effects, the glimpses of the machine and its dark, dark work through bars, windows, and catwalks, the background screams and squishing of viscera, blood, fluids pumping through pipes, lots of breathing and flashes of electricity and steam venting all serve as a perfect backdrop for a tale that wonderfully captures Victorian horror; the steam, the feeling of Progress! Science! Wonders! Mystery!, the primitive but promising technology, and the supreme evils of Empire, God, and Man all set the stage for a deliciously darkthought exercise in what it would be like for this man as he descends into pure insanity. You really feel for him as he desperately seeks redemption for what he has done.I can't say I liked the game, but I did like the story. The pace, just like with its predecessor, was glacial, and that turned me off for months. Coming back to it felt like a chore, but I'm sure lots of people love games like this. It just ain't me.The graphics were good but not as good as Dark Descent. Almost the whole game takes place in endless dark metal corridors with lots of brass, pipes, steam, and dark wood accents. It gets really boring after a while.It's super easy to avoid the manpigs... even easier than the Dark Descent. In addition they got rid of the dumb ""insanity"" mechanic as well as stupid inventory management of oil and crap for your light. Now your lantern just works and all you have to do is walk through about five hours of this game to get to the end and get the whole story.			"

												Price bought: ~$5 (~$1 per hour)When: Winter Sale 2014What price is it worth: < $5 (<$1 per hour)I enjoyed the monsters, especially the first encounter with the final monster. That fight was a very different step up from other monsters as it was very unpredictable at times.Tension was there, however the tension moments that made the original Amnesia great were few and far between in this game.The story for the most part makes you read and narrate for you as you walk around. Difficult to get into the story as it does not engage you as much as Amnesia did.It is too easy. Your lanthern has unlimited supply, you have no hp bar, no inventory and no sanity meter. I feel that it could be because people complained too much about how difficult it made the original Amnesia. If it was it was not a good idea, and the difficulty should not be changed as a result of opinion.It is too short. 4, maybe getting to 5 hours. It is not worth the full price and should only be bought on sale.I enjoyed this game, but has no replayability (apart from final monster level). I recommend it however if it is on sale, not because it is an awesome game (when it is a medicore game), but so people can comapre to Amnesia and see how;a. Difficulty is what makes the experience, the more difficult the challenge, the more rewarding the conquest is of that challenge.b. An interesting storyline.c. The final monster fight.d. It does have it's share of tension, just not as much as Amnesia had.			"

												If you love Amnesia: The Dark Descent then you will hate this game. There is only about 3-4 hours of gameplay and the puzzles seem almost non existant. You're being spoon fed the whole way through the game and unlike Amnesias beautiful cousin there are only around 4 monster chases. It's extreamly dissapointing and it's a game that had huge potential but lets you down with it's short story line and minimal monster chases			"

												The most thought-inspiring story based horror game has made a new sucess.Alright. I'll admit it, the gameplay was MAYBE a 6.5 out of 10. But it wasn't SUPPOSED to be just like ATDD; Then, it'd  just be a custom story. No, I think this game was an act of love, trapped by an inferior engine that, if improved upon, could have made a worthy addition to the Amnesia series and personally gave me inspiration to write a 500-plus page story on a future where Oswald and the Machine joined forces, and tore the world asunder. It has yet to be published, but when or if it does, look for Amnesia: Rise of the Machine King.			"

												This is not a sequel to Amnesia: Dark Descent. It is just another game in the same style made by the same team.A Machine For Pigs is not what I would call a game. It is a first-person visual novel.A Machine for Pigs is extremely well-written, just like Dark Descent was. The story is deep, intense, horrifying, grim, and gruesome. It tells a tale of a wealthy industrialist in the waning days of the 19th century who, wracked by madness and illness, does some pretty terrifying things. Through the game you discover the tale in bits and pieces as you play this man who has, of course, awakened from a fever-induced amnesia. You travel through the streets of London 1899 and through the halls and corridors of your estate and eventually, the titular Machine. You walk around with a lantern, solve very simple puzzles (put this thing here, pull this switch, pull this thing, open this door... that sort of thing), and avoid monstrosities called Manpigs. There is very little of the latter and a great deal of the former (that is to say, this game is basically a ton of walking through corridors). Just like with Dark Descent, I found myself thoroughly bored and just hoping for the next bit of story. I think I'd rather just read this thing as a short story. However, the game does serve up a phenomenal atmosphere, which is something a written novel could never do. The sound effects, the glimpses of the machine and its dark, dark work through bars, windows, and catwalks, the background screams and squishing of viscera, blood, fluids pumping through pipes, lots of breathing and flashes of electricity and steam venting all serve as a perfect backdrop for a tale that wonderfully captures Victorian horror; the steam, the feeling of Progress! Science! Wonders! Mystery!, the primitive but promising technology, and the supreme evils of Empire, God, and Man all set the stage for a deliciously darkthought exercise in what it would be like for this man as he descends into pure insanity. You really feel for him as he desperately seeks redemption for what he has done.I can't say I liked the game, but I did like the story. The pace, just like with its predecessor, was glacial, and that turned me off for months. Coming back to it felt like a chore, but I'm sure lots of people love games like this. It just ain't me.The graphics were good but not as good as Dark Descent. Almost the whole game takes place in endless dark metal corridors with lots of brass, pipes, steam, and dark wood accents. It gets really boring after a while.It's super easy to avoid the manpigs... even easier than the Dark Descent. In addition they got rid of the dumb ""insanity"" mechanic as well as stupid inventory management of oil and crap for your light. Now your lantern just works and all you have to do is walk through about five hours of this game to get to the end and get the whole story.			"

												I played it way back when it first came out and just the minimalistic way they used was not good with the amnesia title. Especially without the custom maps feature the previous title had so you could make you own adventure but that isn't in here. The main story/only story is lacluster in the department of running from magic encounters or random encounters and the atmosphere was low too it was to ""bright"" and the fact the mechanics were shaved to a minimum was also another kick to the nads. In total this game was a bust without custom stories paired with lacluster mechanics. a solid 30/100			"

The game was a little scary, but not terrifying. I think this game was good for one play through, but I will not be playing it again.

												I don't know why this game is getting so much hate. I mean if you consider the story of the game, it is actually not that bad. However the reason being, I would assume, why most people dislike this is because of the fact that this game is way too short. Took me 3.6 hours to finish the game.I am glad I got this game during a sale and not on it's full price, I would have felt cheated.Anyway, I don't think this game is so bad, it is actually pretty fun at some point. Just make sure not to get this game at full price, if I were to leave a tip. Also if you want to get a horror game that will definitely not disappoint, get the first Amnesia game, it is amazing and for sure a wonderful game you will not be upset with.			"

												A machine for pigs. What can I say about it. This game cannot (and must not) be compared to the previous Amnesia game. For one, the two games are developed by two different companies, and the way these two companies created both master pieces, is similar YET very different. AMFP is more story oriented, has a great and creative story and makes you immerse in a world that is complete strange to you. I gave this game a 9 just because the game wasnt scary cause i believe the first game was way scarier) but because is unique, it shows that they put a lot of effort on writing it and this is why i loved it. Not a 10 because i dont believe the name should have contained 'Amnesia' in it... this is a very different game... anyway.. totally recommending this game			"

												Not sure what to think about this game. It was way too short to be anything else than a disappointment , but it has these incredibly emotionally strong moments where you feel powerless ,sad , disgusting, or infinitely human. The gameplay is absolutely nonexistent and you will never meet any kind of difficulty throughout the game, enemies being there only as a means to the plot, and they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly easy to avoid, and if you get caught, they take ages to ""kill"" you. Which is not even slightly punishing. The inventory and every other system from the first game has been removed. The story itself is a pale copy of the first episode's . To be honest, if you have played the first Amnesia, nothing in this episode will surprise you. Other than that, wait for it to be on sale for ~5 bucks. Because that's what it's length is worth.			"

												Amnesia: A machine for pigs, was something I expected to be a great horror game with a great story. It got delayed a lot, so I thought they were improving the game, but when I played it I was disappointed. The game is about hiding from monsters basically, but in this game there is not a lot of scary stuff or freaky things, you can barely interact with anything unlike The Dark Descent, The puzzles were dumbed down, and it took me roughly 4 hours to beat the game, so don't expect a long experience.  However this game has some good stuff about it, now while it's not as scary, it trades in scaryiness for a good story, the games graphics have also improved and look better, also the game has really good sound, the buildup with the sound effects freaked me out a lot and it sounded very realistic. However the game feels like a step down from The Dark Descent, maybe this is because The Chinese Room was involved, I really don't know. I give Amnesia: A machine for pigs a 6 out of 10, it just didn't live up to the hype, and it was marketed as a scary game. If you're looking for a scary game and haven't played the previous game, The Dark Descent, I recommend buying that instead of this one.			"

												While you may think this is the next best horror game from the boys (and girls?) over at Frictional Games, you'd be wrong. First of all, they sent this game's almighty creation kit over to the fine artsy peoples at the chineeseroom. ((in)famous for their previous game, Dear Esther) Second of all, it's not scary. Sure, there may be a slight tad of tension near the beginning and all, but midway through the game falls straight on it's face and becomes Walking Silmulator 2013. And in that regard, this game is the best Walking Silmulator of the year. With that said, the game still has an overarching atmosphere and top-notch writing. Which is great, because much like the atmosphere which is good and in-your-face, the writing is good and always-in-your-face-why-hello-there. You'll constantly be hearing Mandus write frequently in his wee diary about everything. From ""I pulled a lever!"" to ""I believe there is a monster near (there never is) #scared #omg,"" the sound of the game notifying you about his endeavors will strike the most fear into your heart. The monsters, unlike the first game, are non-existant. Whle this may seem happy to those who bought new pants during the first game, there is no tension because the game is WS2013. Straight line. So straight infact, I almost lost myself when I made a corner, only for the game to have a beautifully shokcing hand-arrow-pointy sign. Alright, back on monsters it is. They're weak. They're pitiful. Gadly though they're quite revolting, the idea of them is scarier than they actually are ingame- however, it is Mandus who should be weak and pitiful (well, I guess they can pull a Daniel AGAIN.) and instead you are Mr. Universe, who can take a hit like you ain't got no time to hurt. It's no wonder how (minimal spoilers to a dead ended room!) you can fall almost 30 feet into a shallow pool of poo and survive. (spoilers done!) Speaking of which, there is no gameplay. This should have been obvious before when I called it WS2013, but I'm going to point it out anyways, becuase unlike the other best Walking Silmulators out there, it doesn't let you do what you normally could on a walk. There is no inventory no oil no lighters no health and no sanity. Without any of those, exploring has no depth and beauty which can never match the first game. In fact, I beat the whole thing in 4-5 hours. Others claim 3 hours! They must be hacking. The no sanity part leads me to believe Mandus is alrady insane, but clearly he's sane, otherwise we'd be playing a game in which you jump on little brown animals, eat mushrooms and go into sewers for red plastic coins. Have I gotten everything that needs to be in a review? Hmmm. I think the review fits to a tee. And so, I'd like to talk about how I sweat throughout my playthrough. Not because of fear, but because of it being the best Walking Silmulator of the Year. WS2013 FTW, people. FTW. FINAL THOUGHTS- I recommend this game, as best Walking Silmulator of the Year. I think the chineseroom has created a new genre, and should be experienced by all as they are the genre defining people. Thanks for reading! Stay tuned, for I'll be reviewing The Stanley Parable next!			"

												After playing the first game my friends and I decided to check out the sequel. I have to say though, this one was pretty unwhelming for a horror game that should have easily lived up to its predecessor. The game is similar to that of the original as it sets you up in a large factory-like place in what seems to be the early 20th century. The game also lives up to its title in one of many ways in such that there are pigs everywhere. But that's not all! The monsters in this game also appear in pig form as well. Um... creepy? I originally liked it better when I couldn't see them treking through the darkness early on, but once I got to see them in the light they really didn't creep me out as much. The story in the game is an improvement of the original. Still, the puzzle solving in this game was a bit more interesting than the last as I got to work with machinery and figure out how to get form one location to the next. This game does creep me out in ways that the original did but not enough that I would like to give myself another good scare. The game as a whole is okay at best, but feels more annoying knowing that they put in effort only to have a good story and not follow up gameplay-wise. Get the game if you want, but know that you are giving up $20 to play a half-baked sequel that could have been more.			"

												While it plays like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, it's a different game. It feels much more linear, puzzles are simpler but more coherent with the world and story and this time around the story is interesting and proceeds at a good pace (slow but spread out, which is appropiate for this type of game). Sadly, to enjoy the best of it, you'll be reading a lot of rambling notes.It is NOT as scary as Dark Descent by FAR. However, I think the ending makes up for it, as the loose ends are (mostly) tied.I don't want to spoil anything, but I'll say creature design was hit and miss for me. Not this game's strength, even though the story wraps everything neatly. Map design is one of the strengths of this game, and that's what you'll be looking at the most.Give it a try, if you liked the original and would like a good story but could tolerate less gameplay.

												OOOOooo.  This one was a hard one to review.  Keep in mind I have never palyed the other Amnesia game nor the Penumbra games.For the first like 80% of the game, I was really only impressed with the nice graphics and way the game moved.  Allbeit, it chugged on my dated dual core CPU but worked okay once i set it at 720P.Even on my laptop A10 quad it chugged, so best to have at least an nice 3+ quad to run it at 1080P.   So, it looked nice.  BUT. It was becoming a walking simulator with a few spooky things here and there - a few jump scares ( thank god not too many ) and super duper easy to figure out puzzles.  If you have FOV issues, this will give you a headache,  it did me.  Could only play a bit at a time.  Now, then at the 80% I was thinking to myself - ""it's sorta nice with the well written story, just not really scary"".A lot of work went into this game, it's not just slapped together.  I waited for more.  And then....kinda past the point where you meet some actual piggies - and they don't really kill you as you re-spawn right about where you died - it started getting seriously creepy.  Not in the ""boo!"" sense, but storywise it did not turn out exactly how I had envisioned.  I won't spoil it.The mood changes as you get horrid scenes of death, massacre, waterfalls of blood!, chased from piggues A LOT, and then just the vile realization of what the guy is and what he did.  It's nota  "" OH. MY. GOD"" surprising horror feel, but you'll get a definte ""Man, that's like really sick. "" out of it.  And then the ending...i thought it was over, but kept going.  And I personally liked it.  It does not rush and not does stay to long in one area.  Well paced for what feels mostly like it was stretched a bit at the end.   You have to esacpe from certain clutches and sneak around Hitman style somewhat without any weapons...I liked that the most.  Puzzles, etc just kept me busy but I really liked sneaking rather than kill kill kill bang bang bang which is what most scary games involve ( Rez Evil 5 on up I am looking at you ).  It kept me going to the end.  So, for my $0.02 it's worth it...for $5. Honestly, a $20 price tag?  C'mon.  $15 would have been better to start.  $5 on sale for me was justified.			"

												Okay so I'm going to start things off with it's not a bad game. It really isn't. I pre ordered it the second I could and played and beat it on release day and it made me so upset at how short and ""non scary it is."" Well I decided to try the game again, in the dark, headphones on and the volume up, and I am horrified. This game isn't as scary as Amnesia: The Dark Descent (which is an amazing horror game that anyone should try.) but the game is still scary. It also tells a great and creepy story in such a short time frame (around 4-5 hours). If you're looking for the inventory system, oil management, and keeping track of your sanity, hell even messing around with the envirionment, it really isn't here in A Machine For Pigs. You can only interact with little things for puzzles (or chairs). The inventory system and the fuel management is gone. Which makes you not have to explore much (besides to do puzzles or find notes). That's one of the bigger gripes with this game is that they took too much away that made the original game what it was for a great story. That and the pig monsters, while intimidating, they really aren't as scary as the grunt, brute, or the suitors from the original game and the free Justine DLC.Overall if you're looking for a game that tells a great story while getting scared here and there, while looking through the beautiful world of AMFP, you should buy this game.If you were looking for the game to be♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants scary like the original and like having the inventory system and a more reason to explore you should still get this game just to witness the great story, but prepared to be slightly let down.8.5/10			"

												This game is often criticized for contravening from the Amnesia series in the regard that it provides inadequate scares and terror. But what people often fail to apprehend is that this game was meant to be alluring and unique, not because of its affinity to the horror genre, but because it provides a powerful and aesthetic message. 7/10			"

												I mean, I like bacon so I enjoyed this game, but if you have allergies or its against your religion then this probably isn't the game for you.I didn't really get the story, I think it was about a guy who turned his children into pigs and then ate them, yeah, thats pretty cookie cutter nowadays (I think its a lot like COD BO2, so if you like that then you will like this too) I did like how they tell most of the lore through mini games, so if you wanna get the full picture you got to play rock-paper-scissors and spot-the-difference. (it makes the exposition optional)Uh, not a lot of weapons in this game though, so the devs ♥♥♥♥ed that up, but they make up for it in the second half by focusing more on the RPG aspects of the game, so there is a lot of multiple choice.The biggest problem is in the multiplayer, seriously, it is NOT balanced. People can just use the starting weapon and rekk you (lantern is pretty good, almost as good as the TEC-9, but its spray pattern is all over the place)I also think that the game would have done better without the competitive mode (its not balanced at all)But yeah, over all its pretty good I'd give it an 8/10 Final thoughts : Where are my children?

												Best one out of the series, cant wait for more Amnesia games. This one is highly story driven and somewhat cryptic, soo if you dont want to use your brain and think about whats being said then dont bother, you wont enjoy the game. This is the best story from a game in a long time and truly a game for intellectuals, it really makes you think. Its very comparable to SOMA in this sense, id say theyre both equally great games, soo if you really enjoyed SOMA and its story telling, youre sure to love this game as well.			"

												I don't know why this game is getting so much hate. I mean if you consider the story of the game, it is actually not that bad. However the reason being, I would assume, why most people dislike this is because of the fact that this game is way too short. Took me 3.6 hours to finish the game.I am glad I got this game during a sale and not on it's full price, I would have felt cheated.Anyway, I don't think this game is so bad, it is actually pretty fun at some point. Just make sure not to get this game at full price, if I were to leave a tip. Also if you want to get a horror game that will definitely not disappoint, get the first Amnesia game, it is amazing and for sure a wonderful game you will not be upset with.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs is the long-awaited sequel to commercial, critical, and youtube success Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The original Amnesia was lauded for daring to put you in the shoes of a defenseless wimp in a legitimately threatening environment in an age where every top-selling protagonist was a linebacker with a machine gun for a di.ck. But that was the gaming environment of yesteryear, and now you can't swing your machine gun around the steam store without co.ck-slapping five or six pretenders to Amnesia's throne. The question must be asked, then, if a sequel to Amnesia can hold up in an age where it's not the sole poop-inducer of the day.	To complicate matters more, this isn't a true sequel but rather a spin-off of sorts made by The Chinese Room, who were not yet most famous for making Everybody's Gone To The Rapture because they were too busy being most famous for making Dear Esther. This definitely qualifies them to take up the Amnesia's mantle, as Dear Esther was a slow, psychological thriller in which the player slowly discovers that they've spent ten dollars on a bad poem and also Steam refunds aren't a thing yet. 	So then, does A Machine For Pigs succeed in being a worthy follow-up to Dark Descent? The answer would appear to be something approaching a yes, but that's entirely dependent on what that first entry was.	From a gameplay perspective, there shouldn't be too many surprises here. There are a host of environments the character must navigate, hiding and running from monsters and solving the odd puzzle in order to progress. The main difference here is that the inventory has been done away with, stripping away many of the puzzle elements that were so prevalent in the original. Puzzles are not completely absent, but the ones that survived the culling of item storage tend to be of the pick up object and put it in a place variety, as well as a few wheels and switches that need cranking. This difference may well be what draws a few people away from AMFP but in my opinion it cuts away the least fun element from the original, namely collecting a menagerie of sh.it that boiled down to a host of different shaped keys. “Ooh, a crowbar! I wonder wha- oh, it unjammed this door.” “Ooh, a bunch of different chemicals, this coul- oh, it dissolved the pink god-jam that was really just a door in a costume.” Those bits always felt too gamey and out-of-place in a game about surviving against the supernatural and uncovering the story behind your predicament, besides the fact that they seem to imply some divine level of prescience on the part of protagonist Daniel over what exact piece of bullsh.ittery will open the door. The keys are understandable, the monsters in Dark Descent are clearly anal about locking doors behind them, but how Daniel knows to grab the specific vials of deus ex formula before seeing the door they're meant to melt is beyond me. I know to do it because they glow in a very video-game like fashion, but if Daniel is really seeing the right items glow an off-blue we may need to acknowledge that Daniel himself was the pink jam-god all along.So yeah, A Machine For Pigs doesn't have those. And I like that about it.	The other major difference is the loss of the sanity mechanic, which honestly I find a much larger loss than the inventory. The mechanic did very little in the original, and besides some sound effects and a bit of a blur to Daniel's vision I don't think there was any meaningful impact on gameplay (some say that monsters find you more easily at low sanity, but I never found this to be the case). However, I found it endearing in a sort of Lovecraft-ish way, very reminiscent of those old protagonists who would go loopy at the first suggestion of anything supernatural. The little details that would change at low sanity was great, especially the paintings of Alexander that would go all after-effects ghost face. The refill of sanity upon completing a puzzle was a fun, cheap way to reward the player for progressing, and as a gamer in the 21st century I need pointless little rewards to give me that next fix. I can see why they would get rid of the mechanic, this is fundamentally a different kind of story than Dark Descent, but it's still missed. Writing-wise, this game is at least on the same level as Dark Descent. This is still the story of a man forced to come to grips with a past he no longer remembers, but where the first game focused more on a blur of general bad things Daniel had done, newcomer Oswalt is dogged by very specific crimes that work very well in the context of the Industrial Revolution. The game makes no attempt to say anything about the time period that wasn't done to death by the turn of the 20th century, but it's still a very fascinating, well-paced story that felt much more like an unfolding narrative than the original. Dark Descent had a lot of cool rooms and moments, but I never felt like anything important was happening and a feeling of progression towards a goal was sort of absent. Oswalt at least has a goal he's after, and the game is structured in such a way that not all of the narrative occurs before the actual start of the game. It's still about Oswalt learning about and coping with his past, but The Chinese Room seems to have realized that this does not exclude things from happening as you are playing as well. One level in particular stands out in my mind as the biggest point when the story pivots. Graphically, this game is exactly what you'd expect from an Amnesia title. Many of the models look directly taken from the first game, but there are enough new things to escape the common spin-off trapping of resembling a high-quality mod more than a standalone title. The monsters, completely unique to AMFP, are actually really terrifying given their concept and are unlike most I've seen in any media. Anyone familiar with the words directly proceeding Amnesia in the title should have some clue as to the identity of these beasts. Overall this game is of the same general graphical style and fidelity as the original, which is admittedly not great but often excusable given the game's strategic use of darkness in the player's surroundings.	The sound design may be one of the greatest strengths of the title, as the soundtrack enhances the ambiance through effective use of period-appropriate music that succeeds at being both mournful and haunting. Most of the game is still devoid of music, allowing you to hear the thump of the monsters moving around, the hiss of the machinery, and the glut of other fantastically off-putting sounds that the game throws at you. My one complaint is that a few too many of the sounds can be construed as monsters walking about, which I do realize was intentional on their part. It's just that, intentional or not, I feel like a dumbass crouching along the walls and travelling ten feet per minute because I'm not entirely sure that the game and I are vibing on what exactly a hoofbeat should sound like. I'm phrasing it as a complaint, but it's entirely possible that this ambiguity of noise enhances the experience for some people.Overall, this is a different sort of beast than Dark Descent. If you were a fan of the less gamey elements of the original title, this will sate the same thirst. It's definitely not for everyone, but this is one of the stronger entries in the spooky walk around genre.			"

												If you are new to amnesia try the dark descent. This one is really bad if you compare to the first one and still bad if you take it alone... It simply doesnt deserve to bear the name of amnesia. I felt dirty playing this and I cant do it a second time... too boring (i played the first one countless time). I was not scared even once in this one. It is more of a atmospheric walking simulator with very few not to say without horror elements... it is too much pig oriented if you ask me... I was really excited to play this when it was release and let me tell you I hit a wall of disappointment soon enough. I was reading news about a second amnesia and wasnt able to wait played the first one again and again until its release...pre-purchased this one on steam and got screwed real bad.			"

												A very pretty game, with a good atmosphere and interesting scenarios. It's impossible to rate this game without making comparisons to ""Dark Descent"", and I'm afraid I'm in the ""not quite as good"" camp.AMfP's story is just as good, but the gameplay has largely been removed, with just the occasional lever to flick or battery to put in a socket. Which is fine if you're only playing for the story, but can lead you to feel that you're just being led along and the game is waiting for you to set the next part in motion.And, I'm sorry, but unlike ""Dark Descent"" which I found almost too scary to play, I didn't find this one scary at all. Maybe you'll be different, but the pigs didn't do much for me. Sorry.It's still fun to work through, especially if you're a fan of immersive, story-heavy games.			"

												Being alone and secluded in the unknown is normally a tough thing, you can hear things, heart rate elevated can't think straight etc.The original Amnesia did a fairly good job in giving you just enough information you'd know you needed to fear something else, just what?A Machine for Pigs struggled to do this, I never felt the need to hurry or if I was in danger of being decapitated or losing enough sanity I'd throw myself through a window. A Machine for Pigs seems to rely heavily on audio, scratching behind your head, the whine of machinery or the occasional screams of pigs.The story itself is slow moving, it takes a lot of concentration to pull back the curtain on certain events and even when it is done the result is lackluster.If your a fan of the trying to explode your heart in your chest this one is likely to fail to give you the cold sweat.2 out of 5 chiliwigs			"

												I really cannot understand why so many people don't like this game, because I probably enjoyed it a lot more than any other horror game that's come out since the original Amnesia. The story is what shines the most, but graphics and audio are also pretty great. It was also very scary to me. Definitely not as scary as Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but in other ways I liked it better. For starter's, the way the story is presented and the fact there are actually parts of the story happening in A Machine for Pigs is in my opinion a plus from the first game which until the very ending was completely told in notes. Also, while you could just say the puzzles were lazy and simplified, I felt that the puzzles in this were better, since the first game has puzzles that would have you wandering around for a really long time trying to find an item or something, which just felt like unnecessarily stretching out the game time. So, while maybe not as good as the first game, the scares in this game are still some of the best out of every horror game out there, and in pretty much every other way besides that, I think this game was better than the first.

I know to do it because they glow in a very video-game like fashion, but if Daniel is really seeing the right items glow an off-blue we may need to acknowledge that Daniel himself was the pink jam-god all along.So yeah, A Machine For Pigs doesn't have those. And I like that about it.	The other major difference is the loss of the sanity mechanic, which honestly I find a much larger loss than the inventory. The mechanic did very little in the original, and besides some sound effects and a bit of a blur to Daniel's vision I don't think there was any meaningful impact on gameplay (some say that monsters find you more easily at low sanity, but I never found this to be the case). However, I found it endearing in a sort of Lovecraft-ish way, very reminiscent of those old protagonists who would go loopy at the first suggestion of anything supernatural. The little details that would change at low sanity was great, especially the paintings of Alexander that would go all after-effects ghost face. The refill of sanity upon completing a puzzle was a fun, cheap way to reward the player for progressing, and as a gamer in the 21st century I need pointless little rewards to give me that next fix. I can see why they would get rid of the mechanic, this is fundamentally a different kind of story than Dark Descent, but it's still missed. Writing-wise, this game is at least on the same level as Dark Descent. This is still the story of a man forced to come to grips with a past he no longer remembers, but where the first game focused more on a blur of general bad things Daniel had done, newcomer Oswalt is dogged by very specific crimes that work very well in the context of the Industrial Revolution. The game makes no attempt to say anything about the time period that wasn't done to death by the turn of the 20th century, but it's still a very fascinating, well-paced story that felt much more like an unfolding narrative than the original. Dark Descent had a lot of cool rooms and moments, but I never felt like anything important was happening and a feeling of progression towards a goal was sort of absent. Oswalt at least has a goal he's after, and the game is structured in such a way that not all of the narrative occurs before the actual start of the game. It's still about Oswalt learning about and coping with his past, but The Chinese Room seems to have realized that this does not exclude things from happening as you are playing as well. One level in particular stands out in my mind as the biggest point when the story pivots. Graphically, this game is exactly what you'd expect from an Amnesia title. Many of the models look directly taken from the first game, but there are enough new things to escape the common spin-off trapping of resembling a high-quality mod more than a standalone title. The monsters, completely unique to AMFP, are actually really terrifying given their concept and are unlike most I've seen in any media. Anyone familiar with the words directly proceeding Amnesia in the title should have some clue as to the identity of these beasts. Overall this game is of the same general graphical style and fidelity as the original, which is admittedly not great but often excusable given the game's strategic use of darkness in the player's surroundings.	The sound design may be one of the greatest strengths of the title, as the soundtrack enhances the ambiance through effective use of period-appropriate music that succeeds at being both mournful and haunting. Most of the game is still devoid of music, allowing you to hear the thump of the monsters moving around, the hiss of the machinery, and the glut of other fantastically off-putting sounds that the game throws at you. My one complaint is that a few too many of the sounds can be construed as monsters walking about, which I do realize was intentional on their part. It's just that, intentional or not, I feel like a dumbass crouching along the walls and travelling ten feet per minute because I'm not entirely sure that the game and I are vibing on what exactly a hoofbeat should sound like. I'm phrasing it as a complaint, but it's entirely possible that this ambiguity of noise enhances the experience for some people.Overall, this is a different sort of beast than Dark Descent. If you were a fan of the less gamey elements of the original title, this will sate the same thirst. It's definitely not for everyone, but this is one of the stronger entries in the spooky walk around genre.			"

												A very pretty game, with a good atmosphere and interesting scenarios. It's impossible to rate this game without making comparisons to ""Dark Descent"", and I'm afraid I'm in the ""not quite as good"" camp.AMfP's story is just as good, but the gameplay has largely been removed, with just the occasional lever to flick or battery to put in a socket. Which is fine if you're only playing for the story, but can lead you to feel that you're just being led along and the game is waiting for you to set the next part in motion.And, I'm sorry, but unlike ""Dark Descent"" which I found almost too scary to play, I didn't find this one scary at all. Maybe you'll be different, but the pigs didn't do much for me. Sorry.It's still fun to work through, especially if you're a fan of immersive, story-heavy games.			"

												Being alone and secluded in the unknown is normally a tough thing, you can hear things, heart rate elevated can't think straight etc.The original Amnesia did a fairly good job in giving you just enough information you'd know you needed to fear something else, just what?A Machine for Pigs struggled to do this, I never felt the need to hurry or if I was in danger of being decapitated or losing enough sanity I'd throw myself through a window. A Machine for Pigs seems to rely heavily on audio, scratching behind your head, the whine of machinery or the occasional screams of pigs.The story itself is slow moving, it takes a lot of concentration to pull back the curtain on certain events and even when it is done the result is lackluster.If your a fan of the trying to explode your heart in your chest this one is likely to fail to give you the cold sweat.2 out of 5 chiliwigs			"

												The scariest part of A Machine for Pigs for me was the beginning; not because it was actually scary, but because I was all psyched out thinking about TDD. After playing for a bit, I realized nothing was really happening, so I calmed down and stayed calm. I don't really remember much of the story any more, just that it read like someone took the ""scary"" creative writing assignment of a sixteen year old and turned it into a game. The ""reveal"" in the story was ridiculously obvious from the beginning, and I wouldn't have thought about it as a ""reveal"" except that I remember them making a big deal about it. You can't attempt a ""soylent green is people"" moment when every bit of narrative you provide is as heavy handed as opening a freezer and seeing a box labeled ""totally not people parts"". AMFP was such a disappointment.Even if it wasn't a let down, $20 for a game that has less than 5 hours of playability (and I actually explored as much as this walking simulator lets you), isn't really worth it.

												I loved Amnesia: The Dark Descent, so I had high hopes for this one. Sadly, my expectations were lowered in my time with it. Put in the simplest of terms, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is disappointing as an Amnesia game. As a story-focused adventure and modern horror game, it's recommended. It's a good effort from Dear Esther developer The Chinese Room, and the atmosphere is still much better than many modern horror games. It can still creep out and possibily scary you. But as a sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, an absolutely terrifying delight of a horror game, it comes up short in multiple ways. Many game elements were removed, including the inventory screen and Lovecraftian-inspired sanity meter. The inventory screen leads to overly clunky puzzles, while the sanity meter is a sadly missed feature that removes the balancing act between light and shadow. The game is also made somewhat easier by the lantern having an unlimited power supply and the complete removal of tinderboxes. Finally, while the story is nicely written, it seems to follow the same pattern of the story in Amnesia: The Dark Descent. This essentially boils down to the phrase ""not an Amnesia game"". While cliched, it is sadly true. It just doesn't feel like the original or like a game from Frictional Games. It's clearly a sort-of successor to Dear Esther, and it does work on that level. So, if you're looking for the horror equivalent of Gone Home or Dear Esther, then Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs will satisfy. But otherwise, you're better off with the first one.			"

												A superficially-twisted,  game of linear exploration punctuated by dull narrative - but scary, it is not. The gameplay is too simplified - no oil,tinderboxes,sanity potions, laudanum; No inventory at all. Mechanically, A Machine for Pigs deviates significantly from The Dark Descent, and this is where it's most disappointing. You want to throw that barrel ? Nope ♥♥♥♥ you mate. The only things you can pick up and throw are chairs. If you're a massive survival horror fan who wants to be made to scream, you'd  better look for another game (also no mod support in this one).

A Machine for Pigs strips away all of the elements that made the first game so nerve-racking and leaves the player with little more than a haunted-house experience where you simple walk from point A to point B with a few scares thrown in between (granted there are definitely some scary bits in the game, but not nearly as much so as the prequel).

												I remember playing Korsakovia and enjoying it. I remember playing Dear Esther and thinking it was neat. I played A Machine for Pigs and thought: How does this relate to Amnesia at all? Here's what you should do if you want a horror game: Go get Outlast. Here's what you should do if you want a TRUE sequel to Amnesia: Go download the mod The Great Work. That mod is more scary and actually relates to the Amnesia mythos. In The Great Work, there's the Orb, the Shadow, and sanity! In this ""sequel"" there is NONE of that!I hate kids. Except for Clementine from The Walking Dead because she was WRITTEN well. A game can't MAKE me relate or be sorrowful to any character without ANY ♥♥♥♥ing background. Not only that: the two kids were so poorly designed and in my face EVERY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ second that I knew not to care. What am I going on about? The main character has two twin sons who are CLEARLY already dead after 5 minutes of gameplay. (That wasn't a spoiler if you have half a brain.) And we're supposed to feel sorry for Mandus? ♥♥♥♥ that! I knew Dear Esther and Korsakovia were thinking games when it came to a plot, but you don't ♥♥♥♥ing do it half and half! You either go all the way like in those previous experiments or just a little like in Silent Hill 2 or Spec Ops: The Line!For it's credit, it has great sound design and there's two moments where I felt all ""EEEEK!"" but those were at the end. Nothing scared me in the least. The idea that the main character made a god from a machine (I THINK!) is neat, but there's just... I couldn't tell what was supposed to be real or... Ack, the story is just a ♥♥♥♥ing mess.This isn't a retail game. It's a mod for Amnesia with almost all the scary taken out of it. Like i said, go get Outlast. Outlast DOES scare you. Outlast DOES make you regret playing for 5 extra minutes. Outlast is the scary game for you. Outlast is worth $20. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is worth $5.			"

												A word that comes to mind is disappointment. After the success of The Dark Descent, I expected nothing but further improvement upon the Amnesia series. However, with Frictional games taking the backseat as the publisher this time and allowing The Chinese Room to take over, disaster struck. The Chinese Room have morphed this Survival Horror game into an interactive horror story. Unlike The Dark Descent, the few puzzles there are provide no challenge. The lantern is infinite this time around, however you do not truly need it anyways, as there are no real moments in the game where you are completely unable to see without it. There are no tinderboxes, as most of the game is lighted anyways. In fact, there is no inventory system whatsoever. The only real ""gameplay"" in this unworthy successor is walking around to find the next exit, and occasionally strafing to avoid a monster that this time around isn't very scary at all, since they are dehumanized and you soon start to feel sorry for them rather than afraid. Letting The Chinese Room take the wheel on this one was a huge mistake, as this is no longer a game, but a walkthrough with the occasional scary atmosphere.			"

												When you make a sequel, you usually try to exceed the expectations and raise the bar higher than your last game. You try to make it better in every way possible or just as good but with some innovation. This has none, in fact it takes a step back and goes into it's comfort zone of 2spooky. The story is meh, it's not terrible but it's not really surprising and very predictable. The fact they removed some major aspects from Dark Descent removes the SPOOKY factor, you can hide in shadows from AI who sticks to a path and easily sneak around them just making it more of an annoyance than something you should be scared of. It's short, Enemies are dumb, no puzzles, NOT EVEN SPOOKY, Ambience is okay.4/10 Would not buy.			"

You are chasing you phantom children as they dissapear when you vear around the corner.  Typical coding mechanics for a video game.  Been done hundreds of times before.  Moving on...I never played the first Amnesia.  Well that's not true, I played the demo a few years ago.  That game was MUCH scarier. Simply because you had a limited light source.  In a machine for pigs, your lamp never runs out and you can run for an eternity, never getting tired.  The controls are passable as are the graphics. Nothing next gen here.In conclusion, just play the first Amnesia. This game isn't scary, only boring. If you are having trouble sleeping, play the first hour of the game.			"

This game is nowhere nere as scary as A Dark Descent, the story is predictable, you can't interact with as many objects, there is no insanity mechanic you needn't collect oil or matches because you have an electric torch which never goes out but merely flickers whenever there is a monster nearby.Futhermore it took me about 3h20m  to finish the game which is roughly half as long as the prequel.This game was just overall dissapointing and you can tell that it wasn't made by the same people who created the amazingly frightening Amnesia The Dark Descent.Don't buy this game expecting a worthy sequel. I really regret preordering this game and would advise anybody NOT to buy this game.			"

												This game is such an improvement on the original. It manages to make the game much more playable by removing sanity and the inventory but still keeps a truely frightening atmosphere that keeps your gripped for hours.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, it delivers in terms of storytelling and atmosphere, with impressive use of symbolism and creative storytelling, as well as amazing audio effects and distinctive visual design to boost atmosphere. On the other hand, it isn't very scary or tense at all. Enemy presence has little impact, the player is rarely in any actual danger, and most enemy encounters are utterly unremarkable. It feels like enemies were only included because of an obligation, not because they wanted to deliver a horror game.Gameplay was dumbed down considerably, with many mechanics being removed and nothing being put back into the game. There's much less object interaction, the game is several hours shorter than the predecessor, and it's a bit more linear. Given the amount of delays this game had, I can see some people expecting more out of it and being disappointed. But, like I said, it's a mixed bag with both good and bad. The good does outweigh the bad, atmosphere and storytelling are what the game went for, and that's where it delivers. But it is a letdown as a horror game, and this cannot go unnoticed... or unpunished. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is yet another minimalistic, story experience on the resume of thechineseroom. They seem intent on making only these types of games, like Dear Esther. It's not a tense or scary horror game, and it's a letdown to the Amnesia franchise. It isn't truly an Amnesia game, it simply wears the badge. It could have been an excellent horror game, if thechineseroom wrote the story and basic script like they did, while Frictional Games did the actual gameplay.

												I loved the original amnesia so when this came out, i nearly died before i started. While i played the game, they kept the spooky atmosphere yes. But they had removed the sanity meter and backpack. I noticed differences throughout the whole game that wasnt from the original. When it was over and i beat the game i noticed problems that i will not say. If your gonna get this game, dont expect the same exact experience the original did. It still the same experience as a whole, but in a different way than normal.			"

												You awake in the middle of an industrious, brave England to the churning of an ancient machine under your very floorboards... and you can't remember a thing.It would be unfair to call this a ""sequel"" to The Dark Descent, because it sacrifices almost every aspect of it. A Machine for Pigs, sadly, drops a severe amout of gameplay to focus on it's story. Whilst the story is bold, dark and something that I have never seen before, the gameplay of The Dark Descent would have fitted into this new world the player is thrown into perfectly. The entire game is walking, a few stealh scenes and of course collecting Journal entries. This lack of gameplay isn't something I found bad about the game, just dissapointing. If you are one of those badass, hardcore gamers, A Machine for Pigs is not for you. It's much more of an interactive novel than a game, as it possses little or no hostility towards the player. You can take pleantiful amounts of beatings from a pig gentleman before you die, and with no way of checking your HP, this is yet another dissapointing factor of the game.A Machine for Pigs' strong point is by far it's story. It's one of those games that ""went there"" and wasn't afraid to tackle morality, religion and horror all in one story. The narrative is well paced, with slow but progressive acts seperated by scenes where the player is contaced by a mysterious voice via a phone call. This gives a rough idea of your progress, and what you can expect next. Despite how short the game is (Around 3 to 4 hours, 5 if you get scared easily) the narrative still leaves me satisfied, and the overall journey doesn't come to an anti-claimatic ending. Most of the story is told through journal entries, and without reading them you will be left stumped at the end of the game.Overall, A Machine for Pigs' story is what earns it a place in my heart. It's not everyone's cup of tea, nor did I think I would be mine, but I would reccomend it to anyone out there who is looking for a great, immersive story experience. But sadly, it's lack of gameplay and desierability to be different, leave the asking price a little too much. 7.5/10.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs was published by Frictional Games and developed by The Chinese Room and YOU WILL SEE AND FEEL the difference. The first Amnesia was published AND created by Frictional Games. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a great horror game, but not as great as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. This has several reasons:1. You have unlimited light2. No health is shown, but mosty 2 hits are enough to kill you.3. Everytime you meet an enemy, your lamp and the lights nearby start to flicker. So you will be warned if something dangerous is near you. That's the point I have to critisize. A horror game shouldn't warn you of horror things, it must surprise you! If I get warned all the time then I won't be so scared because I know some pig is waiting there. I want to move without knowing what awaits me in the next corner.4. No inventory for items, because you don't have to activate your brain and collect and combine different items anymore! -> 5. Really easy puzzles, you can't compare it with the first Amnesia.6. The story in Amnesia: The Dark Descent was better and a little bit longer than in this one. You just play a psychopath who has deep psycho-problems with himself... The whole game is about himself and his noob-life.But now to the good points:It is still a very good horror game. If you loved Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you will like Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. But the first Amnesia was a lot scarier and harder. Anyway, definitely a good game and I hope the next Amnesia will be developed and published by Frictional Games. :P			"

												Take what the first game was and throw it right out the ♥♥♥♥ing window.  They restarted from scratch and gave it their all, and this was the net result, pure astonishment.  It's still a horror but they REALLY leaned into suspense more this time to leave you on the edge of your seat the whole time until BAM it hits you, and they do it repeatadly until you want to cry in your bed under the sheets because you hate your life.  The Chinese Room entered to give some light on a new angle for a story line and absolutely nuked it like they did with Dear Esther.  The story itself was around roughly 4 hours and that was taking my time to absorb it all and take it in, maybe longer, not sure if I counted correctly or not but hey, just play it man.  The sound track once again plays a crucial piece wherein it provides such an environment around you that sets it as to where everything just becomes that much more intense.  The gameplay was solid, graphics were a little bit subpar in my opinion, seeing how they delayed it for about a year to fine tune it.  But the mechanics and physics and such were just fine, also they replayability is there like the first, plenty of things to see you didn't see the first time.  Frictional certainly knows how to wow a genre and they certainly nailed it hard again with this indirect sequal.  Overall i'd give it a firm 8.5/10 with the graphics really hindering what could've been more amazing.			"

												Amnesia machine for pigs may not be as amazing as the first game was but its still a damn good game. Just like the first you dont wanna progress through the creepy♥♥♥♥♥dark hallways and you never feel safe even with your back to a wall. They took away tinderboxes and oil for your lantern. As much of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥it was searchin for thoes tinderboxes and trying to see in the dark when you run out of oil i kind of miss it. It made it a lot more challenging. The puzzles in this arent so challenging either but the game succeeds in what I played the series for. It will make you jump out of your chair quite a few times. I give it a 8.5/10!			"

												A solid and fairly interesting story but lacks the tension, the memorabilty and the pants-wetting terror of the first game. Kind of inferior in almost every regard to the original aside from writing and voiceacting, both of which are vastly improved. The game is far closer to Dear Esther than to Amnesia: The Dark Descent and I genuinely can't recommend paying full price. If you're looking for a strong story I'd say wait until it's at least 25% off and if you're looking for scares avoid AMFP entirely. Try Outlast instead, which is far scarier.			"

												The first issue I had with the game was running it. Issues went all over the place with the FPS and the game was nearly crashing even with every setting at minimum or off. I have a computer that could run it just fine, so it's not my PC. Others noted this problem and apparently it's still not fixed, though somehow the game ""fixed itself"" after I tweaked some things in the game and on my PC, then deleted my profile and restarted. After that, it ran fine with normal/high settings... not sure why, because my final settings were exactly the same as an earlier test that didn't work.Besides that, the game looks good, sounds good, and plays well (once you figure out the FPS issue, somehow). The story is captivating and in some senses I think the game was more focused on painting a bigger picture with more details than the first game was. The first game had a decent story but it put some weird things together and ended on a somewhat odd note. This game did much better with its lead-up to the finale.But in terms of environment, it was nowhere near as scary. In some senses, I don't think I would dock the game too much for that. Yes, it's a horror game and it should be scary... but the story was good enough for me to continue playing. I was captivated by that and didn't mind so much that there were less horrifying places (like the prison from the first Amnesia).In the end, I think that the story of this game is much more memorable than the first game's, but that the first game's environment and areas are more memorable than in this game. Both games have their stronger points, but it would be nice to see a third Amnesia come with a strong story, lots of horror, and terrifying and memorable environments altogether.			"

												Developers need to stop outsourcing sequels, or you get abominations like A Machine For Pigs. Literally the only connection it has with the first is the new protagonist too has amnesia (with no explanation that I can remember), and the whole sub-plot about finding his (dead) sons kind of gets lost by the wayside as you stumble your way into an anti-climax.Do not buy this if you loved the first Amnesia.

												From master-piece to casualized cinematic experience. Frictional Games just showed us the EA way of ruining a game...While this game still retains the series way of making a great story arc, they yet forgot to add what made the first installment so famous...the gameplay, and the scaryness factor.This game got so casualized that you no longer have to worry about sanity, health and oil. You get an infinite supply of light, your health gets generated over time, sanity no longer exists so you won't hear the mindbreaking sounds of your persona grieving the situation that he's within, and the worst of all, the scary factor is that of a 3 year old getting scared by a person appearing out of a corner.Conclusion, they had all the potential, but decided to go after the pathetic new standard of video games, the cancer ruining video games, which is ""Cinematic Experience"".My metascore score would be: 50/100, great story, terrible gameplay.

												Is this a game? Seems most an interactive movie. It takes almost half of the game to encounter an enemy and even thereafter action doesn't grow much. Puzzles are mostly boring and very basic, they won't challenge you. Positive points are the atmosphere and the the way the story is slowly enveiled, slowly letting you in.			"

												As a stand alone game Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs could have been extremely successful, however the problem is that it is an Amnesia game. Amnesia was one of the scariest games ever made because of insanity, the interation with objects, being forced to conserve light, running out of oil and no longer having a light, & the custom maps that added many hours of game play.... This game however has removed almost all those features. While it still has the potential to scarer people, anyone going into the game hoping it to be like Amnesia: The Dark Descent will no doubt be disappointed. On top of this when I played this game I experienced an issue which caused my whole game to crash anytime I had to load inbtween areas (not sure if they patched it or not) but as a result any and all immersion was lost due to having to repeate some areas 2 or 3 times. By the time I figured out how to keep my game from crashing I was so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off witht the game that anything that would have normally scared me didn't even make me bat an eye. So, I would not reccommend this game because of the massive step they took backwards from Amnesia: The Dark Descent and because the the constant crashes I experienced.			"

												The short - Incredibly disappointing. Feels like one overwhelmingly long button-pressing sequence due to poor pacing, repetitive environments, and a complete lack of urgency. The long - A large part of the game is spent meandering around mansions and steam shops, pressing buttons, and waiting for people to stop talking about vaguely creepy things that you won't understand, and frankly, will completely forgot about until the next telephone segment. Puzzles range from simply pressing a button, to holding a button, and then wiggling the mouse a bit. Sometimes you have to find an object, and then put it in another, bigger object. Sometimes, twice! The story? I dunno, something about pigs? I guess it's a metaphor for people being greedy sharts, or something, but who cares? There are pig monsters, and they're too funny to pay attention to anything else.			"

												Developers need to stop outsourcing sequels, or you get abominations like A Machine For Pigs. Literally the only connection it has with the first is the new protagonist too has amnesia (with no explanation that I can remember), and the whole sub-plot about finding his (dead) sons kind of gets lost by the wayside as you stumble your way into an anti-climax.Do not buy this if you loved the first Amnesia.

												Mechanics exist for a reason. The sanity system in the original amnesia mattered because it tied into how the entire game worked but now you can literally run circles around the enemy and theres nothing stopping you. Not to mention the developers being completely different this time and that's not something to take for granted. This is a sequel to the game that started the indie horror boom that fits right in with the trash that sprouted up from the indie horror boom.Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is the Dark Souls 2 of video games			"

												Terrible sequel, one of the worst games I've played. Strips away all the interesting gameplay mechanics from the original (sanity, inventory management, stamina, lantern oil, puzzles, basically everything) and turns it into an extremely basic walking simulator with a bloated and incomprehensible plot that pales in comparison to the original. Developers are also huge a$$holes, smack talking better, far more talented devs on Twitter. If I could refund this I would. Garbage.			"

												This was tremendous. Yes, it's not as ""interactive"" as Dark Descent or as heavy on the explicit ""scares"", but there are other games for that. This is still very much a horror game, very much a fitting member of the Amnesia family, it just takes a different tack, and I'm really happy it did. It's weirder than DD, is much more interested in the world and thus HAS a more interesting world to show you. The narrative isn't what I'd call subtle, but there's a lot more to it than DD (though that isn't really saying much). I thought it was woven together really well, paced well, not reliant on infodumps but maintaining a good sense of mystery throughout. There are some fantastic scenes - especially in the latter half - and the sound design and soundtrack blew me away, really. There are some aspects I thought were a bit weak, but nothing I can mention in a recommendation and nothing that isn't made up for in spades by the game's strengths.			"

												Overall, I recommend AMFP and prefer it over The Dark Descent. The game and story struggle to overcome a number of problems that weigh it down a bit, but it is an ambitious game and I enjoyed it for what it is. I'll rate the gameplay and story aspects of the game separately.GAMEPLAY: ★★★☆☆The game significantly changes a lot of things from TDD, and those changes can be seen as both good and bad. Many steam reviewers appear to consider them bad, but I don't entirely agree. I'll address the pros/cons of the most common criticisms, starting by acknowledging that the game sets itself up for trouble just by calling itself ""Amnesia"" which leads players to expect gameplay matching TDD. So a lot of people are going to review it negatively right off the bat just because they loved TDD and it does not match that expectation. They probably should have called it simply ""A Machine For Pigs"" instead.The sanity meter no longer exists. A lot of people like the sanity meter and will not like this change. I think this is a very positive change, though, as I never liked the sanity meter---i.e. the ""fear level simulator"". If a game makes you feel afraid, then you should literally, in your own physical body, feel fear. If you do not feel afraid, then it is very silly for a game to then tell you exactly how afraid you are according to the fear simulation meter it has given you. AMFP has the audacity to let the fear speak for itself rather than telling you what is or is not a scary or sanity-degrading situation. If the game does something scary at you but it misses, then AMFP's lack of a sanity meter at least has the honesty to let it miss. And if it hits, then AMFP lets you feel scared in your true amount rather than attempting to assign a fear value to it on a meter. So while the sanity meter certainly was a game mechanic, the lack of it is a more brave and honest approach to horror, if you ask me.Infinite light. No more tinderboxes/oil. A common gameplay element of survival horror is the notion that there are certain resources useful for survival, but you only find a very limited amount of them, and they are in short supply, so there is always the fear of running out of those precious life-savers. Removing the tinderbox gameplay from the game removes a major gameplay element, but I have to say I didn't really miss it. Searching for and collecting tinderboxes gives you something to do, but light from the lantern was honestly never much of a survival advantage. Light is more comforting than helpful. AMFP opts to let you have infinite dim light for exploring but still flickers your light for scary effect when it wants to. Overall, I was okay with this.There is no inventory. This seems terrible at first glance, but it's no so bad once you realize they haven't so much nixed the inventory as translated it. For example, whereas before (I'm using a fictitious example here to avoid spoilers) you would do something like pick up a key and have it go in your inventory, then later select it from your inventory and use it on a door, AMFP has kept the same idea but put all of the interaction into the physical environment. So in AMFP, you would just physically pick up the key by lefting clicking it and holding, then carrying it over to the door while still holding it, then mouse over the keyhole, and the door unlocks. So there are still object-based puzzles. They just take a slightly different shape. This will annoy adventure game purists who like the fuzzy nostalgia of an inventory, but it's actually not bad. It adds a slight Myst-like quality to the game that TDD did not have.It sometimes feels like a walking simulator. This is something I've heard said of the game, and I half agree. There are DEFINITELY puzzles and some light mazing, but this criticism is correct in regard to how the game drops story info on you. There are definitely sections where the game makes you, say, walk down a long hallway while it arbitrarily revokes your ability to run and slows your walk so that it can force yet another audio log on you. You'll have to endure this more and more as you get into the final chapters. As a person who views audiologs as a cancer, I found this particularly irritating. Strange that they would also include audiologs for you to pick-up manually since they force-play another type of audio log on you half the time. (Not to mention all those diary pages littered everywhere.) But, as annoying as this was, I don't think it's fair or accurate to call it a walking simulator.OVERALL GAMEPLAY: Focuses less on mechanics like resources and sanity meters. It puts more of the emphasis on exploration (some light mazing in some places) and on environmental/mechanical puzzles (somewhat Myst-like). There are some semi-rare enemy encounters, but as opposed to trying to use stealth to sneak around them, the game instead emphasizes running away, and in some cases ""shaking"" your pursuer by taking circutous paths or fleeing their patrol area. Enemy encounters feel kinda ambushy and confusing. Enemy encounters and constant audio/text logs are this game's major gameplay demerits for me.STORY: ★★☆☆☆I'm only giving it two stars here, but not because it lacks good ideas. AMFP actually has some really interesting ideas. The thing that really hurts it, though, is that it has a serious case of too many cooks at the broth. I'll try to offer some generalized criticism without being too specific or dropping any spoilers.You start with a really interesting concept that is vaguely reminiscent of the murders of H.H. Holmes, which is interesting enough in itself, but then the game starts dogpiling ideas and loses control of itself. It adds in some HP Lovecraft type ideas involving mysterious ancient rituals, and then throws in some Marxist themes re: class warfare / economic justice, but then it drops those ideas and goes in yet a different direction, and continues on in this way---a sample platter of ideas. The idea and appearance of the monsters takes some inspiration from Frankenstein, but I must admit that neither the idea of the monsters nor the appearance of the monsters is particularly scary, despite them causing a moment of panic when they ambush you. Then you also have the theme of a man struggling with schizophrenia, but then at other times the game seems to be vaguely interested in exploring a steampunk version of HAL 9000, but not quite. Man-vs-man, man-vs-self, man-vs-supernatural, man-vs-technology, man-vs-society. AMFP's story tries to do it all and ends up being a jumble of half-baked ideas as a result.In addition to the story trying to do way too many things at once, it also insists on being cryptic. It wants to be cryptic in an intriguing way, but it's mostly just confusing. This is exacerbated by the way the writing even seems to contradict itself in some places in terms of chronology and also motivations. I won't spoil the specific plot point for you, but by way of analogy, how much sense would it make if Doc Brown saw Marty McFly's death in the future, and his idea to *save* Marty from his fate was to go back and torture Marty to death in 1985 so that he wouldn't die the normal way in 2015? SAVED HIM! You can expect similarly questionable ideas if you examine AMFP's story too closely.TLDR: The story tries to juggle a hundred ideas at once while maintaining an air of cryptic intrigue about itself. The result is a bit of a confused mess. HOWEVER: despite the shortcomings in the story details, the game's general atmosphere while exploring and solving puzzles is excellent.OVERALL: AMFP has an excellent spookhouse atmosphere and some myst-like puzzling. It is on these grounds that I recommend the game. However, prepare yourself for some stark differences from TDD and for a confusing, overwrought story with an identity crisis.			"

												This game is definately on par with the first game, with a few key differences to be noted before making a decision to purchase this game. Number one is game mechanics, get that out of the way before we go into more important stuff, there is no inventory so to speak, no sanity meter; there's not even really health as you regenerate automatically if you get hurt in any way form or manner. You no longer need oil or batteries or whatever to keep your lantern up, which can really remove alot of tension but sometimes in a horror game you just need tension, you can keep the lantern up the entire time you play the game basically after you find it. Now for the story.The story of this game is on par with Amnesia on an almost equal scale, depending on weither you are more favorable towards revenge driven or family driven heroes, ithey're both fairly developed, Mandus is much more outspoken than Daniel ever was, which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you would prefer to fill yourself into the character, he certainly has a personality that really shows itself over the course of the game. Machine for Pigs story is essentially more narrative driven than Amnesia.Overall I recommend you get this game if you already played Amnesia the Dark Descent, if you haven't played an Amnesia game yet, I recommend The Dark Descent before getting this one as there's simply a few references in the second game that lead back to the first and the horror is alot more -darker- there than it is here.

												So let me just get this one or two line summary out of the way first since it's probably a common question. In terms of atmosphere and story this punches Dark Descent in the face, takes its wallet, then pushes it down on the ground again when it tries to stand up. In terms of gameplay it's missing a few things. Including the high level of world object interactivity that made a lot of people fall in love with Amnesia and Penumbra, the inventory, the nightvision and the sanity system.This marks the part in the review where spoilers are risked. I'll avoid story spoilers but this is the sort of game that you don't want to know much about before playing as players of Amnesia and Penumbra know.The monsters, at least in the beginning, don't inspire the same pure existential terror that the Brennenburg servants did. Likely because they aren't as explicitly humanoid like the servants were. But that's okay since even by Amnesia standards this game doesn't focus on enemies. The game is actually better for it too. No doubt because the guys who worked on it are masters of atmospheric gameplay (they're the guys who did Dear Esther). This is also why I wasn't really hurt by the lack of barricading and things of that nature.Otherwise though it's great. Amnesia is a series that is special to me because it's one of very, very few video games that have actually creeped me out on a noticeable level. This one succeeded at a few points and quite possibly did a better job of it than the Dark Descent during one sequence in particular.The story as a whole is great. It's delves even deeper into the mind of a broken man even more than The Dark Descent did. Things get weird. I'll say that much. And it. Is. Glorious.I can't say that you'll like this if you liked Amnesia or Penumbra. Because again one of the major things that made me fall in love with those is missing here. But all in all as a horror game (seems like that is a diluted name these days doesn't it? Usually it's another word for ""jumpscare ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"") it's one of the best and in that regard I can recommend it heartily.I did a series on it for Project P here. If you haven't played it yet and plan to, don't watch it. I can't reiterate enough that you need to go into it ignorant of the journey ahead.			"

												I have not played much.  But it's got some bugs.Has serious mouse issues when not in 1st person mode.No allowances for getting stuck in places that make no sense.  (I had to quit becasue I could not get out of the bath tub.  Apparently I was stuck under the faucet.)Two semi major glitches in the first 20 mins combined with a rreally long wait for loading and...  I'll play this some more and I might change my mind.    But I can't in good concience reccomend a game that I have to fight with my mouse to get the pointer on the same side of the screen as the main menu.			"

												Started playing the video game. Great game let me tell you, full of spooks and scary skeletons. Really really good game let me tell you. Was playing it with my girlfriend I was, i had some fruit snacks beside me and when I did good in the game she would reward me. I ate some when she wasnt looking. When i got to the point in the game where I had to put the chemicals on the mixer and spin it everything was fine. Then apon approaching the door that I had to put the mixture on. It touched the door and then put me in the ground. One second later I was in one of the mixture rooms where you send the mixture on the shoot to the main room but the door was shut and i was locked in. Because of that I dont reccomend this ♥♥♥♥ing piece of shti game that shut on godzilla's nipple hair. Becase those ♥♥♥♥ing little pig tmnt's are ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and the ♥♥♥♥ing door with the ♥♥♥♥ing goo is ♥♥♥♥ing stupiud. and all and all this game is just, ♥♥♥♥ing stupi.d 11/10 ign			"

												If you played Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs before Dark Descent its OK, but after original game it's really step backward. less enemies and if so, its really ridiculous. No fear, unlimited oil lamp, no tinderboxes.. Predictable story and unsympathetic voice of main character. This game is good, but not excellent. And price is really high.			"

												Yes, it's nowhere as scary as the original game. Yes, it should not have been called ""Amnesia"".Yes, it's a very solid, subtle, rich and detailed thriller / slow burn horror experience, which is recommendable to anyone who does not need to wet his pants around every corner and can take in the finer (perhaps a bit pretentious) details of the storytelling.

This is Dear Esther 2, with completely non scary - and oftentimes comical looking - pigmen foes with a yawn-fest non frightening atmosphere and story.Get Outlast Instead, or better yet the first proper Amnesia game ‘the Dark Decent’.

												This isn't a bad game, except for it's mechanics. MFP has removed many Amnesia TDD mechanics such as conserving oil for your lantern (Now has an infinite use), The inventory, stamina (You don't lose stamina in the game, nor do you have any), and being able to pick just about everything up because why not? (YOU CAN'T PICK UP ANYTHING). The story is not terrible, but is poorly understood throughout most of the game, and personally I expected the sequal to be about either Daniel returning to the ruins of Castle Brennenburg or playing as Daniel's son left alone after Daniel suffered from (Amnesia maybe?) some type of disease, but this was truly dissapointing.

												Well this will definitely be a hard one. After finishing this and the first game back to back i'm having really mixed feelings about it. If you're looking for a good interactive story with a fairly well thought out plot you'll probably have a blast with A Machine for Pigs. If you're, however, looking for a successor to The Dark Descent with a similar atmosphere, gameplay and terrifying setpieces you probably will be sorely disappointed.+ The story told is by all means good.+ While different, the atmosphere AMFP creates is unique and foreboding on it's own right.+ Late 1890's London is an amazing locale for a game and in my opinion much more interesting than the castle in the first title.Aand that's pretty much where the positives end. The rest of this ""review"" will probably sound like a rant, so i'd just like to point out at this point that if you can get the game for 5 bucks or so i'd definitely recommend it as i enjoyed the things the game did good a lot. There are however some pretty glaring issues i just can't overlook and that really hamper the game from being really good.- They removed most of the gameplay mechanics from the first game, like, literally most of them.- No sanity meter.- No oil to refill your lantern, it now has it for an infinite quantity.- No tinderboxes to light candles.- No inventory system to collect items in, instead all the puzzles are done a la Half-Life 2 item dragging. (It sucks by the way.)- Since you basically don't have to deal with the darkness anymore, nearly all of the games spooks are handled via jumpscares. Gone is the near traumatizing atmosphere of the first game in which you really were ♥♥♥♥ed beyond imagination if you ran out of tinderboxes and oil.- About 4 hours long, which is about half the length of TDD. This could also be a positive because if it was any longer i swear to god i would have dropped it halfway through for the sake of padding out the game.- No puzzles. Yes, you read that right. Sure, there are valves to turn and buttons to press but they require absolutely NO effort whatsoever. I was kinda sceptical about the whole ""Walking simulator"" thing people have been throwing this game at but to be entirely honest it isn't all that far away from the truth.- The main antagonists of the game are not scary, like, at all.So yeah, i really can't give this a positive review no matter how hard i try. If you can get it for cheap it's definitely worth it for the story and some cheap thrills but that's about it. Even the modding scene is worse than in TDD because there are literally almost no mechanics to play with in the game.			"

												The much anticipated sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, falls quite a bit short. I have no idea what the developers were thinking. They removed the inventory, there is no sanity meter, no health bar, no tinderboxes to light candles and torches, very few puzzles, you can no longer pick up objects, there's no fun places to hide in, the monsters are hardly scary and become too frequent and casual, and your lantern is now electrical so you don't have to worry about oil. Basically, they took out everything that made Amnesia scary and intense. Not to mention, the whole game is only 3 hours long. I will say that it has one of the sickest plots that I've ever experienced in a video game, but other than that, there isn't much else. A few scares here and there and a messed up story, but it just doesn't even come close to the first Amnesia game in my opinion. Basically, it's just 3 hours of holding the W key while ocasionally pressing Shift to outrun the monsters. The game had some serious potential, but ultimately led to disappointment.My Rating: 6/10			"

												When I pressed ""play"" for the first time I really wanted to like this game. After all the reviews that I've read I was ready for everything and I wanted to approach the game with a free mind, enjoying what the game had to give me.But even so, this game has a huge flaw. It's boring.The mechanics of this game are quite non-existant. There's nothing you must do, no ability whatsoever, no thinking games or else. All the ""puzzles"" are senseless to the story, which is narrated ONLY by reading deluded notes and texts around the world. To understand what you have to do in a puzzle you have to read a text where the main character explains what to do and why... This to me is the hugest of the failures of the narration in this game. On the technical aspect, the architecture of the places is redundant and boring. It's the same room repeated on and on, with some sporadical steampunk machine in the way. There rooms make no sense, it's not like you could actually feel that the place is living, you can't identify a kitchen, a salon, a living room... there are a few, key rooms, and the rest of them is kilometers of ""what is this room for? why is there a chair here? what was the purpose of this place?"". This was exactly the same flaw I've seen in the previous Amnesia and Penumbra games, with the difference that the atmosphere that the other games created was so much superior that you literally had no time to think about the flawed architecture of the places. But here... you don't have much to do than run from corridor to corridor trying to understand what you have to do next or what is the path the programmers have thought for you.One last thing: complete darkness is not scary. It's fatiguing. If I have a torchlight in my hands I want to see where I'm going. Otherwise I'll just get motion sickness and eye strain. In this game all the lights are dead, they make no light at all, and even pumping up the gamma makes no difference whatsoever except painting a white coat all over the screen.Conclusion: catch it if it's in a bundle, otherwise there are better games to play out there.

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a masterpiece. A masterpiece of storytelling, a masterpiece of atmosphere, and a masterpiece of thematic depth and cohesion.What it is not, though, is a masterpiece of game design, simply because it's not a ""game."" No mechanical skill or special mental acuity are required to succeed. There are no choices to be made that affect the story or its conclusion. This is very much a spiritual successor to Dear Esther (it was designed by the same studio), with only superficial similarities to Amnesia: The Dark Descent.At its core, The Dark Descent was an old school adventure game, something which I actually didn't like about it. It was incredibly atmospheric, scary, and downright disturbing, but to me the puzzles served as a frequently annoying distraction from exploring the grim and compelling world laid before me.A Machine for Pigs almost entirely forgoes these game elements and transitions completely to the interactive fiction genre. And what a work of interactive fiction it is. Dear Esther was an extraordinarily well-crafted and moving experience, but AMfP improves on it in every way. The writing is masterful, weaving together themes of guilt, original sin, the duality of man, religion, and socio-political philosophy. The visuals are superb and nearly flawless, although I did find myself frustrated by the lack of reflecting mirrors and more naturalistic fog effects. Minor complaints to be sure, but ever so slightly immersion-breaking nonetheless.I must also shower composer Jessica Curry with the highest praise. Her work in Dear Esther was breathtaking and here again we find her practicing at the pinnacle of her art. Music is absolutely integral to the success of AMfP. Not only does Curry manage to underscore the emotional significance of each section perfectly, but every cue is also a brilliantly original composition in its own right. Search out Mors Praematura online to hear exactly what I'm talking about. At the risk of sounding overly effusive I'd have to say that this is soundtrack of the year (or decade!) material.In closing, I think Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a spectacular creative achievement and deserves to be experienced by almost everyone. Yes, it is unusual and is most definitely not a game, nor is it anything like Amnesia: The Dark Descent. As long as you are aware of these facts going in and are able to re-calibrate your expectations early on I guarantee that you're in for a deep, thought-provoking and one of a kind experience.			"

												Not necessarily a bad game as some gamers declared it. Quite contrary, this is one of the most atmospheric horror games. It doesn't rely on cheap scares or excessive gore, instead it will slowly get under your skin dragging you inside it's horrific storyline. Yet there is a lack of true paranoia and that claustrophobic feeling from Dark Descent that would really improve the overall feel. Still, the experience is spooky and the story leaves some interesting topics for discussion.The developers (TheChineseRoom) excelled with what they do best - level design and storytelling and I'd love them to continue their cooperation with Frictional Games. With someone else being in charge of gameplay and puzzles, that is.Compared to Outlast, Machine for Pigs is more cerebral and atmospheric experience. If you're looking for something more than jumpscares in a horror game, this is a series to play.			"

												An awesome sequel to an epic game. Amnesia: A machine for pigs takes you on a journey through a large factory complex set in victorian era England. While not connected to the first game, it certainly doesn't disappoint. The storytelling is yet again A* and the atmosphere is rich with fear and tension. Your children have gone missing and only a mysterious stranger on the end of a telephone is willing to guide you through the various warehouses, waste tunnels and mechanical machinery that will ultimately lead you to your little darlings, and your fate. Prepare your mind and soul for a harrowing night of intense chases, startling events and gruesome discoveries. Good luck, pilgrim. The pigs are watching...			"

However, unlike the prequel, this game is much shorter so make sure to drag each video for as long as possible when making your lets play of this game. That means, turn 4 hours into 8-9 hours.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs is a watered down, uninteresting bore with little to scares. Most elements meant to scare the player are heavily scripted. The game can hardly be called an ""Amnesia"" game due to the fact that this game almost nothing to do with The Dark Descent, which is a fantastic horror game.			"

And the most important, the puzzles in this game is a looooooooot easier then Amnesia: The dark descent, that makes it always fun!Ohhh, the monsters in this game ;) OMG!

But I have to say this one didn't scare me as much as the first I think its because I kept thinking how bad and scary the first one was I was expecting this game to be worse but it really wasn't. If you want to buy this don't think of the first game completely forget about it and pretend this is a whole different game it makes it better. But over all this is a great horror game! I recommend this defiantly to anyone who loves a good scare!			"

												This is a divisive game. A lot of people don't like it. A lot of people dislike Dear Esther too, but I loved that game. This was kind of like Dear Esther, though much more interactive, and three or four times longer. So even if you don't like Dear Esther, this game might still be worth a shot. It's not as scary as The Dark Descent, but it is more poetic and depressing, which is a good thing in my opinion. It definitely has its scary moments though. The horror in this game is little more subtle and existential. But there are still monsters, so watch out. "

												Sentient strips of bacon stalking you through darkened corridors with various forms of cutlery would have been creepier.Ok, after playing through all 3.5 hrs of this game (yeah, it literally is that short....and pointless, but more on that a little later) all I have to say is WTF!? So much doesn't make sense about this game that I don't even know where to begin. Granted, some of the scripting is rather colorful and quite morbid at times and some of the environments are ominous, but all that aside the plot essentially cannibalizes itself and ends up not making a lot of sense in the end.  So some guy saw some stuff in Mexico about humanity and the human condition in the present (1899 and thereabouts) and how cultures from the past apparently had the right idea with sacrifices and whatnot, and so this all gets him thinking that we are all just pigs...um....and that he needs to make a machine that turns us (I likely don't have this right, but after playing this you'd understand why) into manpigs - that doesn't give him the right to do the things that he did do and will do and does do...um...while you're(he) is playing through the game while trying to find his two sons (that he apparently loves though they were kept up in the attic).Anyhoo, the beginning in the house is probably the best part as it's so ominous and is vaguely reminiscent of the glory that was The Dark Descent (and that was throughout its entirety).  Sadly, that is one thing this game is not - an Amnesia game.  As a follow up game to TDD, AMFP is utterly pointless and shouldn't even have 'Amnesis' in its title.  It's way too short and pathetically easy on top of that (I don't understand how this game normally goes for $20 - even knowing I picked it up for less than $5 makes me feel like I was overcharged).  No joke, I only died twice, once by a manpig and it was cheap as it was unexpected and again when I got too close to a ledge and fell 5 feet to my death.  The puzzles really aren't even puzzles, rather, they function as environmental objects to interact with occasionally.  So yeah, this is not a 'thinking man's' game and the manpigs themselves aren't even that scary.In the end this just feels like a game that shouldn't be and the reality is that it would have functioned far better as a demo for a longer/more complete game than the end result.  DO NOT BUY unless you love games with pigs(bacon) and must own every game that has even the slightest bit of a horror element in it.			"

												I believe that the producers of the Amnesia series were suffering from amnesia when they made this game, because it is not even a shadow of The Dark Descent. This game does not grip you with horror the same way that The Dark Descent did. The enemies are slower moving, slower to attack, fewer in number, and weaker. The entire storyline was weak. If you, like me, enjoy a good horror game, you will not find it here.			"

												Great atmosphere and a few well crafted scares for the first three or four levels.  After this the game becomes a real chore to complete.  The early game does well to generate a mystery and horror around the factory, but once the story reveals itself a little it loses it's appeal and you find yourself racing through dank tunnels and dimly lite hallways solving banal puzzles until the anticlimatic end.  The game is short but still manages to outstay it's welcome.  I can't reccomend this game.  It promises a lot but ultimately doesn't deliver.  Might be worth playing through the first few levels if you can get it cheap, but ditch it once you get to the sewers.			"

												As I descended the lift towards the heart of the machine, it was nothing like I imagined. It was far more terrifying.I truly enjoyed this game. However, there is no denying that 'A Machine for Pigs' is not as strong as its predecessor. The puzzles are far too simple, necessary only for maintaining an added level of interaction with the world. And, there aren't as many 'risky' moment.In addition to this, a lot of gameplay elements from 'The Dark Descent' have been removed. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. The removal of many of these elements augments the game's focus on exploration. However, those elements are part of what made the puzzles in 'The Dark Descent' so strong, and the dangerous moments all the more frightening. And there are no new elements to bring everything together.That being said, there are many moments where 'A Machine for Pigs' shines. The atmosphere, created through the carefully crafted environment, nearly stands on its own. Surprisingly, the lack of enemies sharply increases the anxiety; Imagination is potent.The story is the strongest part of the game, arguably stronger than the original. 'The Dark Descent', while truly a masterpiece, told a story that was very cold and distant. In 'A Machine for Pigs', the story is uncomfortably, very human. Love and compassion are at the core of this story, at the heart of an impending madness. Painted sharply is a potent picture, not just about society, but also about people.As good as the story is, the use of complex words and language often makes it difficult to follow at times (I must admit that the use of this type of language is a perfect match for Mandus). However, the story shines during the moments that simple language is used in a precise and clever way, leading to some horrific revelations.'The Dark Descent' is a game where all elements came together perfectly, something that happens rarely, something that 'A Machine for Pigs' does not achieve. Despite this, I enjoyed it tremendously. For me, it is a worthy successor to Amnesia.			"

												Although the lore, story, horror elements and gameplay are not as strong as its predecessor, ""A Machine for Pigs"" does offer a good (albiet watered-down) entry into the Amensia series. The environment is a nice change from ""A Dark Descent"", and is generally as good if not better than the dreary castle of the previous installment. Despite the great setting, the puzzles throughout the mansion, streets, engine rooms, sewers and complexes are essentially wheel-turners and lever-pullers.Throughout the game, the notes and dialog honestly do a mediocre job at revealing the interesting world that you explore, leaving a lot of seemingly important things to the imagination, which can be a good thing but I don't think works well here. For every question answered, two more seem to open up. The monsters here are not as effective as they are in ""A Dark Descent"", essentially only giving us a few dangerous encounters. Even those encounters seem forced and almost cinematic. The plus side here is that the manpigs do fit the story of this game, and work well in conjuncture with the thematic ""Industrial-Aztec-Sacrifice-Meat"" elements of the game.Although my review might seem negative, this game still delivers a short yet sweet atmospheric horror stealth-adventure with decent lore and good imagery. I would suggest ""A Dark Descent"" over this game, but I think this still warrants a discounted purchase and playthrough if you're into atmospheric story-driven horror games.			"

												This game is one of the greatest pyshological horro stories I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. At its core, it is about a man trying to do the right thing and failing horribly. It is about what can drive us mad, how our best laid plans can turn on us, and the lengths we are willing to go for love. This is not a horror game, in the sense of truly scaring the player away from the screen. It has few jump scares and downright ""crap-your-pants"" moments, which is obviously a far cry from the original Amnesia, one of the scariest games of all time (one where I literally leapt out of my chair multiple times). However, this game is a different beast entirely, and well worth the attention of anyone who's into psychological horror and  storytelling and writing on par with the best movies and literature.It's honestly a shame this game was branded as a sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The only similarities I could find between the two games are that the main character has amnesia, has done some horrific deeds in the past, and... has a lamp. If this game were not tied up with the original Amnesia, I think it would have been much more positivley received.The game has done away with many of the gameplay mechanics that made the original such a terrifying experience. Your lamp has unlimited fuel this time around, so there are no more hurried searches for oil as you desperately try to conserve your remaining fuel. There is no sanity meter; your character does not go insane from staying in the dark, witnessing unsettling events (of which there are plenty), or looking at the enemies creatures. There is still some light puzzle-solving and exploration, although the puzzles are simpler (which might be a good thing, because I found a few of the puzzles in the original a bit contrived, which broke my immersion) and the spaces to explore are nowhere near as vast and open-ended. There are still enemies that you have to hide and run away from, which accounts for the meat of the gameplay (I even died a few times) although these encounters are not numerous either. So yes, the gameplay has taken a back seat to the story, but this is not all for the worse.These changes and simplifications of the gameplay make sense within the context of the story. A sanity meter simply doesn't make sense within the story of the game. Your character is already insane - he has witnessed and commited horrifying acts. Seeing a Manpig or two - or being alone in the dark, god forbig! - isn't going to suddenly send him further into the depths of madness. It would just be too ""gamey"" and break the immersion and the character.Since insanity is no longer an issue, it would then follow that there is no reason to have limited fuel resources, as the primary reason for your lamp in the original was to keep from going insane in the darkness. Thus, having limited fuel would only serve to make some parts of the game unnecessarily dark, which would be nothing but an annoyance - and a shame, since the art design in the game is so amazing.I would have liked to see more exploration in the game, yes. That is my one big gripe with it. Being able to explore a mansion and the immense factory and machine underneath at your own discretion - discovering the different places and parts and horrors in your own order and at your own pace - would have been much more disconcerting and haunting than following a mostly linear path, seeing everything the game has to show you precicesly when it wants to reveal it.So there is just enough gameplay to serve the story. And what a fantastic story it is. Much like in the original Amnesia, the story is told mostly through found documents and through memories that come back to the protagonist. This time around, there are also phonographs to be found, which are a welcome addition because the audio allows the player to hear the emotions in the voice of the protagonist. The writing in this game is excellent, just as it was in the developers previous game, Dear Esther. In my mind it is unmatched. The writing is smart, layered, gorgeous, and at the same time visceral and unforgiving. There is no end to the amount of the times people mention brutal acts, and blood and♥♥♥♥♥♥and child murder. It is like reading a great literary work, and interacting with it to experience this unforgiving world.I could talk about this game for days, but I have said enough. Clearly I think it's fantastic, and you will too if you love a good story and are fine with not having deep game mechanics. I can fully understand why it's not for everyone, but that's OK: it was never meant to pleave everybody. I have one last thing to say though: this game has one of the great sequences/set pieces I have ever encountered. It's called the Den of the Wretches, and it completely disposes of any suppositions you may have about the enemites in this game. It was one of the most haunting and unsettling things I have ever experienced. Be prepared.			"

												Amnesia: The Dark Descent was quite a scary game when it came out. To newcomers to the Horror Genre, or even the ones more facilitated to how it should be. It's atmosphere was amazing, slamming doors, creaks, sounds of death, and the latter. But for this game, it's different.When Frictional Games let The Chinese Room take hold of this, one of the few good things that came out were a very nice artistic appeal. Amazing graphics, and a slightly intriguing story(and I emphasise on slightly heavily).The thing is, the wandered away from the atmosphere, which is the heart and soul of the Horror Genre.They primarily focused on the complexity of the story, the contraptions, hiding places, I could go on.As soon as I was dropped into the game, I felt that I was being held along the game all the way. No helpful hints in-game to help me, but it was as if there were huge arrows pointing towards the 'complex' puzzles. This can be a nitpick depending on the gamer, for me, it is annoying to see this. But, this is just versatile to the gamers.Overall, this game isn't as good if you played the previous, but is quite nice graphics-wise. I say that Frictional Games should have worked on atmosphere and story, while The Chinese Room worked on graphics. It may have been able to be one of the few best Horror games of 2013.Rating; 5.4/10.0Puzzles; Not that much of a puzzle.Graphics;Very nice.Gameplay; Pretty goodAtmosphere; Not that much work put into it.Modeling; Nice "

												As an avid horror game fan, I really loved this game. All the elements I disliked from the original Amnesia game (the panic meter and searching for oil for my lantern) were removed for this game and I believe it only benefitted from it. It's very atmospheric, immersive, and uses every part of the game to tell its story. Even though it might be easy to guess the ending long before you reach it, the walk there is really fun and pretty scary. And, just for reference, it took me about 5 hours to beat the game, so you know the normal length.I highly recommend this game. :3			"

												It may be enjoyable if you have a pig fetish or if you try not to compare it to Amnesia: A Dark Descent. Gameplay is different in that it lacks an inventory and puzzle aspects and overall this game is too easy. There was only one moment where I had to reload. Sure, it has a creepy atmosphere, but I didn't feel overwhelmed or threatened at all. This is not good - in The Dark Descent, I was yelling, running and shaking - which was great!Would not pay more than $5.			"

												This game is one of the greatest pyshological horro stories I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. At its core, it is about a man trying to do the right thing and failing horribly. It is about what can drive us mad, how our best laid plans can turn on us, and the lengths we are willing to go for love. This is not a horror game, in the sense of truly scaring the player away from the screen. It has few jump scares and downright ""crap-your-pants"" moments, which is obviously a far cry from the original Amnesia, one of the scariest games of all time (one where I literally leapt out of my chair multiple times). However, this game is a different beast entirely, and well worth the attention of anyone who's into psychological horror and  storytelling and writing on par with the best movies and literature.It's honestly a shame this game was branded as a sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The only similarities I could find between the two games are that the main character has amnesia, has done some horrific deeds in the past, and... has a lamp. If this game were not tied up with the original Amnesia, I think it would have been much more positivley received.The game has done away with many of the gameplay mechanics that made the original such a terrifying experience. Your lamp has unlimited fuel this time around, so there are no more hurried searches for oil as you desperately try to conserve your remaining fuel. There is no sanity meter; your character does not go insane from staying in the dark, witnessing unsettling events (of which there are plenty), or looking at the enemies creatures. There is still some light puzzle-solving and exploration, although the puzzles are simpler (which might be a good thing, because I found a few of the puzzles in the original a bit contrived, which broke my immersion) and the spaces to explore are nowhere near as vast and open-ended. There are still enemies that you have to hide and run away from, which accounts for the meat of the gameplay (I even died a few times) although these encounters are not numerous either. So yes, the gameplay has taken a back seat to the story, but this is not all for the worse.These changes and simplifications of the gameplay make sense within the context of the story. A sanity meter simply doesn't make sense within the story of the game. Your character is already insane - he has witnessed and commited horrifying acts. Seeing a Manpig or two - or being alone in the dark, god forbig! - isn't going to suddenly send him further into the depths of madness. It would just be too ""gamey"" and break the immersion and the character.Since insanity is no longer an issue, it would then follow that there is no reason to have limited fuel resources, as the primary reason for your lamp in the original was to keep from going insane in the darkness. Thus, having limited fuel would only serve to make some parts of the game unnecessarily dark, which would be nothing but an annoyance - and a shame, since the art design in the game is so amazing.I would have liked to see more exploration in the game, yes. That is my one big gripe with it. Being able to explore a mansion and the immense factory and machine underneath at your own discretion - discovering the different places and parts and horrors in your own order and at your own pace - would have been much more disconcerting and haunting than following a mostly linear path, seeing everything the game has to show you precicesly when it wants to reveal it.So there is just enough gameplay to serve the story. And what a fantastic story it is. Much like in the original Amnesia, the story is told mostly through found documents and through memories that come back to the protagonist. This time around, there are also phonographs to be found, which are a welcome addition because the audio allows the player to hear the emotions in the voice of the protagonist. The writing in this game is excellent, just as it was in the developers previous game, Dear Esther. In my mind it is unmatched. The writing is smart, layered, gorgeous, and at the same time visceral and unforgiving. There is no end to the amount of the times people mention brutal acts, and blood and♥♥♥♥♥♥and child murder. It is like reading a great literary work, and interacting with it to experience this unforgiving world.I could talk about this game for days, but I have said enough. Clearly I think it's fantastic, and you will too if you love a good story and are fine with not having deep game mechanics. I can fully understand why it's not for everyone, but that's OK: it was never meant to pleave everybody. I have one last thing to say though: this game has one of the great sequences/set pieces I have ever encountered. It's called the Den of the Wretches, and it completely disposes of any suppositions you may have about the enemites in this game. It was one of the most haunting and unsettling things I have ever experienced. Be prepared.			"

												I never previously was a fan of amnesia, I kind of enjoyed watching gameplay of custom stories from some swedish youtuber. And when I heard an indirect sequel of amnesia was coming out, I wanted to try this game out as my first amnesia experience. This game in my honest opinion is a different amnesia experience than you expect from the first game, but that doesn't mean I find it terrible. There probably will be some disappointment if you played the first amnesia, but the graphics and atmosphere is pretty dark and creepy. There are a few jumpscares that will surprise you. It probably would be best to play the first amnesia for  a better horror experience, a machine for pigs is mostly a rollercoaster that you're just enjoying the ride for a little bit. If the developers were to incorporate a way to make custom stories for this game, then it probably be actually worth playing longer. No, this game is one time play thru, nothing special after your done with the game. It best just to buy this game off of a cheap steam sale than paying the full price, or buying amnesia: dark descent, a real amnesia game that you can pick up any object and fool around with to your heart's content. However, I did enjoy this game even tho I wasn't expecting certain things, probably if frictional games were the devs working on this instead of the chinese room, it probably would've ended much differently, but this isn't a terrible game, it's just a different amnesia experience than you would expect.

												As an avid horror game fan, I really loved this game. All the elements I disliked from the original Amnesia game (the panic meter and searching for oil for my lantern) were removed for this game and I believe it only benefitted from it. It's very atmospheric, immersive, and uses every part of the game to tell its story. Even though it might be easy to guess the ending long before you reach it, the walk there is really fun and pretty scary. And, just for reference, it took me about 5 hours to beat the game, so you know the normal length.I highly recommend this game. :3			"

												Pretty ♥♥♥♥ing  scary at points. Way better than the first amnesia which was just a bunch of confusing puzzles and easy to avoid monsters plus an assload of being completely lost. While this game was a little more linear and not having to worry about lamp oil it was much more focused on the horror aspect . Story wise it was excellent as long as you have a mind that is able to comprehend simple metaphors, as they are used highly throughout the game.  As you may think pigs is a ridiculous idea for a horror game, this game will prove otherwise.			"

												Alright, so you probably played the first Amnesia game if youre reading reccomendations about the second one, and as most horror game fans have by now, you may also have had the pleasure of playing through Silent Hill 2/3/4. Well done, youve now completely desensitized yourself game based fear-like emotions. Now what? Well you could always empty your pockets on an Oculus Rift, and im sure sooner or later most of us will, but once youve entered a stereoscopic 3d world, the most thats really going to do for the horror genre is let things jump out and say ""Boo!"" at you with an enhanced sense of depth and immersion. You could have just gone to a holiday attraction in late october for that. ""Oh was that a slightly tallish man in a suit? In the WOODS?! How will I ever look at suits or trees in the same way again? Oh, woe, now I see how little our lives really mean a this cold vaccuum of infinity!"" If youre as familiar with the tropes of horror as I am, you know that everyone who works in a mental health facility is either an inhuman abomination or involved in some sort of conspiracy to see how far the human mind can be made to suffer, etc, etc. THIS game takes place in a meat packing facility! A far LESS menacing meat packing facility than Rupture Farms of the Oddworld series. In fact, until the final hour or so of A Machine for Pigs, i was convinced I had it all figured out, so when it became evident that my presumptions were a bit ....off....I was still left to wonder what it all actually meant. My main complaint with this game is that the corner it seems to have cut is to not assign required reading material before allowing one to progress to the next stage. Instead of scraps of notes left lying around, the game should have had entire volumes strewn from room to room as if it took place in the Elderscrolls universe, because without a hell of a lot of explanation that the game makes no attempt to provide its most impressive and creative aspect, its storytelling, is likely to be COMPLETELY lost on an audience expecting to be required to ""survive"" a horror game, not take a world literature class. That said, no other games have really attempted to do what AMFP has attempted to do. PLAY IT, ITS GOOD. But you wont know why until youre ready for spoilers. Or maybe you are now, in which case read on:}SPOILERS BELOW] Not that the game give you enough information to realize this yourself, unless you are already well versed in Aztec mythology but Amnesia: AMFP is actually based on the struggle between Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca as is explained in great and lengthy detail by Reddit user Ahhuatl here with LOTS OF SPOILERS: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1mithv/were_the_aztec_involved_in_mass_sacrificecleansing/ccczjzm?context=3 "

												72/100 my hairy♥♥♥♥♥ So, what happens when you take the original Amnesia, strip out the intelligent puzzles, the lack of a sustainable light source, the health and sanity mechanics, and cut the game in half? You get Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. It takes balls to release this as a sequel, given that the game is shorter, less diverse, and overall less interesting than its' predecessor; and it furthermore takes balls to have released this at full price. I never finished the first Amnesia because I got too scared. I never finished this one because I ended up realizing that I was at the end of the game after playing for two hours, and also realizing that I'd played a mod for Fallout 3 that ended up being scarier, more mechanically complex, and more interesting overall.

If this game wasn't labelled as an Amnesia game, then it would have been a decent horror game and when it was released in the same week that Outlast was launched, this game does not compare to Outlast.If you're looking for a fun new Amnesia experience, then I highly suggest the custom (MOD) stories as these give a different storyline, whilst keeping the same concept of Amnesia The Dark Decent alive.

												If you have played the original Amnesia you will provably be disapointed. This game lacks the things that made its predecesor great. No exploration, there are plenty of doors but they are all locked, you are to follow the one and only path that will allow you to progress through the gamee, i.e. no side tracking.The flashlight lasts forever, there is no choice between blending with the environment at the cost of sanity (another mechanic that has been removed) or turn on the light but attract enemies. The new flashlight does not consume oil, you just turn it on and off whenever you want.The enemies are thrown in your face, there is no mystery surounding the monsters like there was in the original, you can see them through jails and other settings and that significantly detracts from the atmosphere.No puzzles, with the sanity gone so are the puzzles that helped you regain sanity when completed.Overall the game just feels like a preset path that you cannot deviate from and with the mechanics missing that I just talked about it's just not even half the game the dark descent was.

												A very disappointing sequel to the previous game. Even though it was published by the same company as the first Amnesia, it lacks several features. There is no item inventory, the lantern never goes out even though you have the choice to turn it on and off, there is little to no interaction with any objects, almost no puzzles and even the puzzles are all no brainers, and they completely removed the sanity system which also means there's no scares with low sanity. It took quite a long time for the first monster to attack you. The monster itself is not, in my opinion, all that scary. Looking at the monster doesn't make your vision blur nor is there the creepy noise when the monster spots you. There have been times where the monster would not chase me even if I came up to it. Overall, I did not have a satisfying experience with this game and was hoping for something much better.			"

												I felt very underwhelmed about the game, but I'll try and make as unbiased a recommendation as I can.Pros:The game keeps the same amount of atmosphere from the first game.-The level design is pretty cool, mixing pseudo-industrialism and victorian england together.-There's a nice chunk of backstory and fluff, both which I enjoy greatly.Oh boy, now for the cons:The constant blue tint when the game wants you to feel spooked gets incredibly grating, making it look like you're wearing blue glasses everytime something scary happens.-The way the games story suffers the same problem as Dear Esthers, often belting out incomprehensible ""2deep4u"" drivel that it tries to mask as dark and deep, which I guess The Chinese Room is to blame for.-The game is laughably short, taking a maximum of 2-3 hours to complete.-There's barely, if any, real puzzles in the game. Its mostly a walk forward, get blue tinted screen, get spooked, repeat.-The enemy design is a huge step down from the first game. I won't say what the enemies look like in AMFP, but the thing that made the enemies in the first game terrifying is that they only looked vaguely human, you had to look twice to understand just what was wrong with them. Comparing the AMFP monsters to the first games monsters makes them look sloppy and unconvincing.All in all, its not really worth the 15,99€, unless you're determined. Wait for it to go on sale.			"

												A Machine for Pigs was a pretty big let down. As you progress it quickly becomes obvious that Frictional Games had very little to do with this game besides lending their engine to The Chinese Room. The result is an experience that feels spiritually closer to Dear Esther and lacks any of the dread or intensity of its namesake. The most disapointing aspect of the title is how much squandered potential its premise held. In the right hands it had the makings of a truly disturbing psychological experience.  "

												It has the atmosphere one would expect from a game in the Amnesia series, but absolutely nothing else. It doesn't offer any of the complex puzzle solving like the previous entry, so it's mostly a game you experience by walking around and reading through notes and toggling unskippable in-game dialogues. A Machine for Pigs feels rushed and just took off in a direction that it shouldn't have gone. It's very short on top of all of the other problems, so it feels more like an expanded DLC than an actual successor to the original. I'd only recommend this game if you're looking for something to go through quickly on the cheap around Halloween time. Other than that, you can skip A Machine for Pigs. Stick with the original.			"

I love the projects The Chinese Room works on, which was the main reason that I wanted this game. I loved Dear Esther's focus on story, and A Machine for Pigs certainly comes from that same vein. Moody and creepy atmosphere? Check. Survival and horror? Not so much in A Machine for Pigs.			"

												Pros: Great story for you to explore and really cool envoirments again sound effects are erie as f*** creating real suspense and dredd. The monsters pig design is also expesially cool. IMO lack of inventory is better make running with objects when monsters around to solve a puzzle more terrifing.Cons: Your lamp never runs out of fuel so the darkness is not as scary as it was before. The monsters (from my experiance) are much easier to run from and in most instances you can out run them. On top of that you could nearly count the times you incounter monsters on one hand. You quickly become aware of when monsters will not be presant and some of the horror elements fade. Lack of custom stories is big negative, however i heard the porting all assets from A:AMFP to A:TDD.Conclusion: This game is not as good as the original, but the chinease room did crate a good game. Even with its negatives its story and atmosphare it creates are worth the retail price this game is running for. 7/10			"

												Total and unrivaled disappointment. Unlike its ancestor before it, this game carries with it no real horror, nor a good story to make up for it. The monsters that were ""created"" in this version are what the sci-fi channel would turn into bad movie in a heart beat. Along with that, the sheer amount of times you hear the word pig, and different ways of defining people and places to them is enough to drive someone insane. On a good note, the graphics were somewhat more crisp then the original, but not at its full potential. If I were to rate this game against its competition ""Outlast"", Outlast would beat Amnesia 2-1. Rated - 2 out of 5 stars.			"

												A good sequel to a great game. It definitely doesn't have the scare factor of the first one, but it isn't absent from this game. Very creepy rather than scary. It rids of the sanity meter and resources for the lamp, which only annoyed me in the first one so i'm not upset about losing those as others are.The puzzles aren't challenging(put a wheel here and flip a switch) and only get in the way of the superb story. That's the real heart of this game. Lame puzzles and being WAY too short(finished it in ~4 hours), it's still worth the play if you can get it on sale. It is NOT worth buying at $20, but I got it for $10 and i'm happy with it. Recommended.			"

												At first I was skeptical in comparing A Machine for Pigs to A Dark Descent, however, the game quickly made a name for itself. Though some of the more enjoyable mechanics were changed, the atmosphere of the ""epicenter of climax"" was phenomenal to experience. I loved the scale to which the plot drove--though at times the scripts were rather... odd in their content and comparisons. All in all, A Machine for Pigs is thick, deep, epic, and nerving. Great experience; and great story-scope.			"

												The controls and lack of object interaction makes it less realistic and more linear than the last installment. I also don't like the loss of a menu/basic item hold screen. Other than those issues the atmosphere is the scariest ever. Scarier than The Dark Descent and the Penumbra games. The clanking machinery in the background ... the lighting and weather sounds ... the atmosphere in this game makes it so much scarier than the enemies and story.			"

												If you've played the original you'll be very disappointed. Although the story is absolutely fantasticallly written with the skill of The Chinese Room, the mechanics of the original Amnesia game, which was the hallmark of the whole experience, have completely vanished. The scares get increasingly dull, the sanity meter is nowhere to be found and the lantern is BATTERY POWERED which means there is no more panicking about the dark looking for more oil. Although I commend The Chinese Room, creators of Dear Esther, for picking up such an ambitious title, their inexperience with horror games has cost them dearly. Do not believe the selling points on the store page. Although the game's story is indeed fantastic and horrific, the game does not at all stay close to the series' chilling roots. With important bits and pieces missing, I couldn't possibly finish the game. You will be wishing for amnesia after this non-frightening experience. 5/10			"

												This is the worst game of 2013. No exception. The long-anticipated successor to the original Amnesia: The Dark Descent fell flat on its face because Frictional Games decided to pass off the development of this game to The Chinese Room, a terrible indie studio that has made nothing but bad games.Where to begin... Well first of all, you can't pick up any items. Did you like making barricades to defend yourself against gatherers? Too bad. Not that you'd need to make barricades anyway, on the account that there are virtually no scares. If you are scared by anything in this game after playing the original Amnesia, I would ask if you also use a night light... and want me to check for monsters in your closet.Did you like opening your inventory? Combining items? Using tinderboxes? Managing your oil? Oh well. You have a lantern with infinite oil. Now if you use your lantern with infinite oil the entire game, and still manage to find yourself scared, please re-read the last paragraph.Not to mention that the plot is reprehensible. It's almost a copy of Dear Esther, which was also a complete waste of money. There is a final boss which is somewhat entertaining, but if you get that far in the game you probably stopped caring a long time ago.Altogether, I will say that the environment was beautiful, and gave a large pool of new models to the Amnesia custom story community. For the first time, a female model exists in the Amnesia universe, and you are not plagued with naked, uncircumcised men in every area.Unless you're into that sort of thing.			"

												This sequel is surprisingly shorter, in comparison to 'The Dark Descent'; which could be a let down to some people. However the quality graphics are more superior; the textures, shadows, lightings and the environment have been improved. Removing the Lantern Oil/Tinderboxes and the Sanity status personally didn't bother me; the story was by far the most prominent attribute in this game which makes it stand out. A Fantastic story. A Good game.  :)			"

												This is my experience with ""Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs"" in a nutshell: Walk along the right wall (using ladders whenever they come up), while you test and re-test all doors, levers, buttons, and so on, just to see if they work at all. :-PThis game is incredibly bland, as you just walk around, trying to figure-out what you CAN interact with, so that you can solve/trigger overly-simple puzzles/events. It doesn't even matter what you do in the game anyways, since there's no penalties for acting like an incompetent fool in the game. One example is that you quickly regenerate any health lost from being damaged. In fact, no matter what mistake you make, the game will act as if you never made the mistake at all. ""Oh, you died?... I'll instantly respawn you a couple of feet away at full health, without even taking away any past progress!""If you want a great ""horror"" gaming experience, then buy yourself ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"". You get to interact with so many things; and you have to actually pay attention to whatever is going on with the game, including the story (as it helps you solve fairly elaborate puzzles). Your resources are also limited; and you often get punished no matter what you do. For example, you go insane if you don't have a light source, but you're incredibly limited in the way of creating/getting any of them. There's even times where you need to avoid light, since you don't want enemies to notice you.			"

												Fantastic game, with very powerful and memorable moments. The critique that the gameplay is not very challenging is fair, you should really approach this game as an interactive movie and take the time to soak in all the little details and get immersed. If you want to sink in a man's personal purgatory you won't be disappointed. The core message is critiqued of being too soon revealed and too simple, that is a fair critique too. There are reveals, but not really any big twists. The beauty of the story is the elaboration and exploration of what you initially suspect, and by the time you see you already know. I can't recommend it enough, really. It is a brilliant work.			"

												its a good game but there are some things about it that just bugged me to all hell and that was the monsters; at the beginning of the game they were being built up like they were in the original amnesia and even had several indirect encounters during this time. as this build up started coming to a hault, and finally getting to my first official monster encounter, i found it to be scary as hell; i was ducking, hidding and even running in hopes to not get captured by the half man half pig creatures. It was all good until I took of something that made me feel burned; this ""something"" wasnt the controlls, atmosphere, or even the less than explorationg encouraged enviornment; it was the execution of it all. Please dont get me wrong, the mosnters were scary looking but when you find out that you have infinite lamp power, and no tension of preserving your resources the horror aspect dissapears very quickly and it turns into a very poor and downgraded version of the dark descent. i dont know what do really rate this game. if i could i would give it an average rating but seeing its a yay or nay system i will say that it will be good for people who have not played the dark descent			"

												""Disappointing"" does not even begin to cover it. The game is graphically average most of the time, the oh-so-praised ""cerebral"" story is a collection of utter illogical nonsense, and the voice acting combined with the text that has clearly been written by someone who has no feel for the language, no idea of drama and tension, made put down my gamepad and headset far too often. Thankfully, it is a short game, so it will be over quickly, and it has around 4 scary moments in it, so it is not all bad. AMFP also adds nothing the the established Amnesia formula, it rather takes gameplay elements away (no light/shadow gameplay, no inventory, no hub level design, ...), so you got amazingly little to do besides switching your flashlight on and off, pulling a handful of levers and pressing the forward move key. If it were not for the amazing ambient sound design, I would have uninstalled it after 20 minutes.			"

												A note before reading this review:I am, by no means, a frequent player of horror games. I am quite a wimp. Only rarely do I venture into the genre myself, mainly due to the abundance of games reliant on jumpscares to create the 'horror'. As one who greatly prefers psychological horror games as opposed to the rather cheap jumpscare variety, this was the main appeal of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and so this review is written by a player who had expected an atmospheric, psychological horror game in its sequel, Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs.Game: Amnesia: A Machine For PigsTraditional Rating: 5/10Recommended: YesFirstly, it is important to note that Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is pretty much only an 'Amnesia' title in name alone. While the controls remain perfectly similar to that of The Dark Descent, this serves as one of the few reminders of its predecessor throughout the whole game, save for the occasional reference to the original title in the story/lore. If you found the controls in The Dark Descent to be good and practical, it is the same in this title. If this is your first delve into Amnesia, you will find the controls easy to learn and manage.In terms of gameplay, however, A Machine for Pigs is quite limited. It essentially consists of the barebones of The Dark Descent - exploring your surroundings to find out how to progress, while hiding/running from any monsters that you encounter. You are defenceless - much like in the original Amnesia - and this serves as a source of the horror found within the game - if you're spotted by an enemy, there is nothing that you can do but run. While the essence of an Amnesia title exists in this respect, A Machine for Pigs feels quite lacking. There is no 'sanity meter' in this game, which served as either an excellent mechanic in the original, or a mild pain, depending on your preference. There is therefore no need to try and avert your character's view from disturbing events, or even any need to stay in the light to preserve your sanity. The lantern which you obtain very early on in the game serves as an unlimited light source, removing any need to scavenge for tinderboxes or oil containers to illuminate your surroundings. It feels like part of the horror is therefore removed - entering a new area with limited light sources would be much scarier than having an unlimited, portable light source. If you found it difficult to progress in The Dark Descent, or if you aren't great with puzzles, then you can find solace in the fact that the 'puzzles' in A Machine for Pigs are incredibly simple, easing your progression through the game.The atmosphere of A Machine for Pigs is sometimes unsettling, but not overwhelmingly so. It uses many tried-and-tested tactics of previous horror titles to create this atmosphere, so those who frequently play horror games will not find many surprises in the tactics used by the developers to unsettle the player. Indeed, considering my inexperience with the horror genre and the fact that I am quite easily scared, A Machine for Pigs did not really seem particularly scary to me. It is significantly less scary than its predecessor, so if you were expecting an escalation of the atmospheric horror found in the original, you will not find this in A Machine for Pigs. However, there were some rather creepy ambient sounds and pieces of music used throughout the game that could make you a little nervous, though these aren't particularly distressing. The music, too, fit the mood of the game quite nicely.The story in A Machine for Pigs definitely picks up towards the end - as you might expect, you begin with little-to-no memory of previous events and put the pieces together throughout the game. The majority of the story is told naturally throughout the game, while additional writings and pieces of information can be found scattered around the game's various locations, never far from the intended path. While the story was quite good, it was also quite predictable. Initial hunches (which I won't divulge) about a couple of aspects of the game's narrative were proved to be correct, which unfortunately removed any real chance of surprise from a narrative point of view. The game's ending was more satisfactory than the rather lacklustre ending to A Dark Descent, I found. However, it is a very short game, clocking in at around 4-5 hours at a fairly slow pace, including hunting down the additional notes throughout the game.To conclude: although the game is a step-down from its predecessor, I would recommend A Machine for Pigs if you wish to experience the story of the game and explore an additional sample of the Amnesia universe. As a horror experience, however, you could do a lot better. There is little horror to be found in A Machine for Pigs, even when the monsters are present. It is perhaps akin to dipping your toes in the water of the Amnesia universe - if you want to take the plunge, look no further than The Dark Descent.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs has a good atmosphere and a brilliant story. Other than the story, the game mechanics are same as from Amnesia: The Dark Descent with a few improvments. Inventory is removed and the sanity meter is removed which is a negative since they added extra fun to the game. The game isn't really scarry but at least there are monsters. The only thing that was truly scary was the water monster part. With a lot of diffrence from Amnesia: The Dark Descent, I still recommend this game because it is really beutifull. It runs smoothly and doesn't require a monster computer to run it. I'm sure you will enjoy the game!			"

												It has an interesting story in a way, but it's not nearly as good as ""The Dark Descent"". The monster itself isn't really that scary and there are a few things they take out from the original game, including an inventory system and limited oil. That means no items needed to heal, you simply just have to avoid damage for a while, letting you be more reckless than you should be. However, I don't believe it's a ""bad"" game it's just different and not as interesting in my opinion. I still had quite a bit of fun playing it. Since the two Amnesia games don't really have much connection story-wise though, if you're wondering if you should get this one, or The Dark Descent, I'd say definitely go with The Dark Descent. You're probably going to enjoy it more than this, not to mention you can also play custom stories made by other people after you beat the main game to give you more to do.			"

												'Amnesia: a Machine for Pigs' ditches the Lovecraft influence in favor of a more industrial setting, and it loses some of the horror and mystique in the process. There's really not a whole lot to do except wander the maze and pick up page after page of expository notes. But the story that those notes tell is much more personal,  directed, and tragic than the previous game.Full review on my blog:http://www.megabearsfan.net/post/2013/10/04/Amnesia-A-Machine-For-Pigs-review.aspx "

But so many people say why they don't like it is because it's a Amnesia game. But to me I'm happy it's Amnesia. I haven't even played the first game.

												Experience on Linux so far:+ SolidThe game:If you like any of Frictional Games titles you will probably like this. I will say, it's not as good as the original Amnesia, IMO, and you don't generally feel the same panic growing inside as you did with it's predecessor. I have not finished this game yet, nor have I finished the original Amnesia, but the reasons are different. With Amnesia I simply could not take it, I was mentally fatigued and had to take plenty of breaks to slow down my pulse. With this game, however, I just got bored after getting stuck a few times with no obvious way to proceed. Still worth picking up, I think.Score:3/5			"

												This game turned out to be a disapointment.  It's really nothing like The Dark Decsent expect for a small implied connection from a journal entry.  It takes away any real need for survival or need for actual thoughts on its puzzles.  The story line at first had a ton of potential and sucked me in, but as the game progressed it seemed like the developers got lazy.   I find it hard to believe that I can spend about 15 hours playing Dark Decsent on one playthrough and I beat this in less than half that time?!  I really don't want to discourage people from playing this; it's not horrible, but it just is disapointing compared to the first game.  There are some good jump scares and it has an interesting plot, but they really slacked off.  I really do wish I could have given this game a thumbs-up.  If you're looking for a game just like the first amnesia, this would not be it.			"

												As a massive fan of the original Amnesia this game at best leaves me wondering what happened. The original mechanics from the game are gone and at best I find myself running away from a giant pig with my latern on at all times. Sanity? Pfft the game takes that away and lets you keep yours because nothing in the game is scary at all. Light as a mechanic? Kidding me? That was scrapped as well since you can just keep your latern on forever. If you don't have your latern on the game doesn't even turn in to the old night vision that was present. The puzzles that the game used to have barely exist, if even at all, and I am having a hard time even finishin the game. Only way I could say for someone to buy this game is if they wanted an ease in to Dark Descent...			"

												Amnesia followed the rule of punishing you for looking at the monsters. Sadly, too many things were taken out that made The Dark Descent what it was such as the sanity meter, tinderboxes, oil, and health potions and instead replaced it with regenerating health and no inventory. On its own, A Machine For Pigs could have been a great game. But as much as we would like to ignore the ""Amnesia"" title, it must be considered a sequel to the 2010 masterpiece. If you're on the fence about purchasing this one, I would wait for a sale to pop up or for the flat price to be lowered.If there is one thing I need to praise this game for is the story. As much as I loved The Dark Descent's look into the sanity of a human desperate to save his own life, A Machine For Pigs takes this a few steps further and delivers a story, while a short 3-4 hours long, thankfully doesn't overstay its welcome and throws you into what I can only describe as a H.P Lovecraft story come true. Overall, I do recommend this game if you're looking for something that delves deeper into the darkest corners of humanity.			"

												Amnesia:  A Machine for Pigs is far more of a story-driven adventure than the first installment.  The developers have stripped away the inventory system, as well as the need to find candles and oil for your lantern, and focused entirely on telling the story of Mandus.  While I appreciate the thought that went into the story -- which is hard to comment on without ruining the game -- I found this installment a disappointment overall.  The puzzles (if you can call them that) were extremely simple.  There was no feeling of dread or genuine fright like in the first Amnesia game.  The unlimited oil in the lantern takes away from the experience, and having no need of inventory or most importantly -- the sanity -- leaves this game shallow in the end.  It was so easy that I only died once because of a geometry/clipping issue where I went through a wall and fell out of the game, into a sea of texture maps.  Rarely do you encounter any monsters in this game, and when you do, I few quick turns is all that is needed to lose them.  I applaud the voice acting, the score was decent, but the actual gameplay is no longer here.			"

												Everything already said here is true: ""A Machine for Pigs"" is disturbing and occasionally terrifying. The art design is often staggeringly beautiful, despite pushing the game engine to (or sometimes beyond) its limits. The story is awfully familiar and it suffers a bit from an excess of climaxes, but all in all the final scenes are satisfying.It's also not much of a ""game,"" more of a trolly ride through interesting set-pieces. There's a lot of puzzle-solving to be done, but it's the simplest kind. Some people consider the puzzles to be throw-aways, but I found them welcome breaks between ""long exposition"" and ""creeping around in fear of monsters,"" both of which are exhausting. In the end I'd say the balance of lever-pulling, storytelling, and scary-stuff-in-the-dark was well-done.Worth the money? For me it was. Polished? Surprisingly so. Gripping? More-or-less. Just don't expect any brilliant puzzles or any REAL narrative surprises. If you can enjoy the eye-candy and the pretty good yarn, you're set.			"

												An Amnesia that suffers from its title. A Machine for Pigs is a terrifying, hair-raising, dark adventure game developed by The Chinese Room in collaboration with Frictional Games. The game eliminates elements that were present in its predecessor as a move to increase immersion, and it works to a certain extent. No longer is the player desperately searching every nook and cranny for light sources to decrease their character's sanity and even their own. Instead what they are presented with is a more linear but story-driven experience. A Machine for Pigs tells a story that players can't help but want to find out more but at the cost of having to delve deeper into the increasingly frightening areas of the game. What A Machine of Pigs suffers from is its Amnesia title. The first Amnesia title, The Dark Descent set a new standard for survival horror-games, and thus the Amnesia title carries a big expectation. Many hardcore Amnesia fans may find this installment disappointing, as without a doubt they will compare this with the first title. A Machine for Pigs wants to tell a story, The Dark Descent wants you to wet yourself. Without the Amnesia title, A Machine for Pigs would without a doubt be an excellent horror game.If you love mystery, adventure but also want some ""squeal like a girl"" moments, A Machine for Pigs doesn't disappoint.

												If you're looking for a terryfing survival horror game, this might not be your best choice. The gameplay is quite weak, there is actually nothing to interact with, everything is glued to its postition. Also, the tinderboxes and oil from Amnesia: The Dark Descent were completly removed, and you can spend the whole time with your lantern, knowing that you don't have to worry about the danger that it might be turned off. The pigs aren't very scary, and the times they appear and really become a threat to you is low.But if you are looking for a game without jumpscares at every corner, but with a deep atmosphere, fascinating, cryptic storyline and beautiful soundtracks, then it is really worth the money. The game will really close you in, and throw you into a strange world, with an endless amount of machine rooms and dark secrets. The more you play it, the more you will want to know what happend to Oswald Mandus and his family. Think about what you want, and then decide. If you want a second Dark Descent, i would'nt recommend it. But if you want a dark, atmospheric game with a bizzare story, this is your best choice!			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is the sequel or the ""squeakquel"" to the original becuase it is literally the most dumbed down and streamlined Amnesia ever.If you have not picked up the first Amnesia, please do so. It is a fantastic work and one every gamer should play, horror fan or not. AMFP is... for those who are complete♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's not scary.The story although some consider better than the first game was predictable and followed the usual horror cliches. I do not find it better than the original as in the original you had AMNESIA. You had no idea what you were getting into and the story unfolded slowly and dilberatly so that even you felt morified of the things you wear hearing. AMFP doesn't have that. Its 3 hours.Music doesn't have Mikko Tameria coming back for the score, and this is ok because the music is pretty decent! Not too shabby and the choir is a nice touch! Sounds are SO good in this title. They pack a lot more bass and punch.As for actual ""gameplay"" there is none. Its Dear Esther with puzzles. And some added shock value. Gee. Puzzles are simple and require no brain activity. Inventory managment is gone, you dont have one. Lantern oil? Gone. No light managment. Its a ♥♥♥♥ing walking similator at his point. You do not feel grounded or invested at all. Esp. the second ""half"" which has you running from hallway to hallway from scripted boom noices.Oh the horror.The monester appears what? Like 3 times? And theres 1 10 second chase scene? Come on!!Honestly the only good comes from a non-silent protaginist and solid voice acting throughout.Other than that I'm sorry Chinese Room. Frictional had a better GAME in all respects. 5/10			"

												I had extremely high hopes for this game. I loved Amnesia and liked Dear Esther, but sadly this game hamfistedly (har?) shoves the sentimental prose of the latter into the engine of the former without utilizing any of the features that made Amnesia so tense and horrifying. The result is a dark muddy slog through an overly literal interpretation of the game's evocative title that's neither frightening nor satisfying. It's an interesting swing and a miss, but definitely a miss for me.			"

												For a company and game that claims it's all about atmosphere and story, this game lacks in both. Story tries to play off as if it's complex and mature but comes off vapid and hollow, filled with twists you'll see coming a mile away. The charactes are flat and would rather listen to themselves 'talk' (so to say) than let you enjoy the actual game or environment. You'll hear the argument ""it would be better without the 'Amnesia' title stapled to it"" and the sentiment is correct. Connected to the brand does it a disservice because you'll be expecting some form of quality that Dark Descent brought to the table. Machine for Pigs does not even come close nor does it really add much to the story it's a sequel to. But, if you are a fan of The Chinese Room or their previous works, such as Dear Ester, you might want to give it a try. If you're expecting to be scared to the bone then simply ignore this game. Also if you're not a fan of pseduo-intellectual story telling avoid this completely.			"

												I am really on the fence about this one. There were several things that I liked. I felt that the environment and settings were really good and the atmosphere was pretty great too. The main problem that i have with the game is its lack of side distractions. There is no oil for your lamp, or tinderboxes to collect and the journal pages were presented in a very way that didnt require much exploration to find. There was also no voice recordings for the main journal pages, which supports the idea that this title wasn't as well though out. That seems to be the biggest issue with AMFP. Everything feels really rushed. The only puzzles in the game are 2 or 3 fetch quests, The alchemy and logic puzzles of TDD are just not there. The stroy is really convoluted and kind of craps out at the end. Its not a bad game to catch on sale but is a terrible dissapoint ment for fans of TDD.			"

												Simply said: Put away the Amnesia from title and you have a game without complaints.The main pain is the lack of search for items which just forced you to crawl every last corner of the castle in first Amnesia. You wouldn't be even able to search for them here since they did put locks on about 95% of closets/tables.The story isn't anything extraordinary either, rather average but still enjoyable. The better part of the game were the graphic's stylisation (awesome industrial steampunk machinery designs), sound effects and music.. as usually expected from this game series.Atmosphere is not that scary as was in first game either, don't make me wrong, a few first Jump scares got me almost to change my pants but then it became kind of routine, common and expectable routine. That leads me to kind of short gameplay time which the average player will finish in no more than 6 hours, I am not even sure if I can complain about it because after getting beyond later half of the game it gets a little boring and somehow uninteresting.The game itself is rather average experience with nothing new to show us compared to previous Amnesia but still worth your time. Try it, then judge it. There is way too much of undeserved hate towards this game on Internets.			"

												How can a sequel with limited gameplay, fewer puzzles, and a linear design possibly make it on my recommendations? Keep in mind that I have played through Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and while I loved its abiliy to freighten me, it never did much of  anything else. A Machine for Pigs horrifies me through its sound design, its symbolism, and its beautifully written plot. It is unfortunate that some aspects have been removed; having no inventory and less interaction with objects does weaken this title. However, this horror game does something I've never seen in the genre. It forces me to witness the psychological behavior of its characters. It has a central dehumanizing theme to society that I can empathize with. In short, it is art. But it is not just art for the sake of being only for the artistic eye, it is a game that proves how it, and others like it, can be seen as a new artistic medium.			"

												I have to recommend that you DON'T get this game, not if you liked the first Amnesia and are expecting more. Gone are most of the game mechanics from the first game: hiding from abominable creatures, scavenging for lamp fuel, and choosing when to keep that lamp lit or deal with the eroding sanity effects of the darkness. All that is kept is the general mise en scene and the periodic acquisition of notes filling in story details. Sadly those details are so dripping with poetry and convultion that they rarely add up to anything making much sense. Visually the game is virtuall unchanged from the original and still seems to be using utilizing now ancient Source engine. Here too they've managed to strip away some of what the original game brought to the table by covering the entire screen with a procedurally generated fog that serves only to muddy every single view in the game. Even after removing the fog (via save file editing) it's obvious that The Chinese Room (in taking on stewardship of the property) misunderstood that ""dark"" means shadows and not, ""there's no strong light sources anywhere, ever."" I found myself squinting my way through the game's 5 or so hours and lamenting that I could never quite see what appeared to be a somewhat detailed and visually interesting world.I could have given A Machine for Pigs a pass for getting rid of the horror game play elements of the original Amnesia as a trade off for a deeper narrative experience, but unfortunately the game fails to succeed in this task. The end result is not quite Dear Esther and not quite Amnesia and sadly not worth your time.			"

												A Machine for Pigs is to The Dark Descent as The Omen is to The Exorcist. As far as horror at its most basic fundaments go, one could even say that it is ""merely"" unsettling as opposed to downright terrifying. That said, The Omen is my favorite horror film of all time as it is what I consider to be a class act, and what A Machine for Pigs lacks in immediacy it makes up for in spades with an industrial atmosphere that takes you to a place of darkness that feels hellishly real.The scares are more subtle, the story is better written, and the sound design is some of the best seen in the medium. Jessica Curry's score is instantly iconic and legitimately bone-chilling, setting off each of the game's virtual spaces with just the right accent of terror. However, if you come to the experience expecting The Dark Descent 2.0, you'll come away very disappointed, as A Machine for Pigs is shorter and more mechanically stripped down. It's also not as terrifying, as only the first enemy encounter is really effective, though I believe that this was the intent of developer The Chinese Room, as there was just no way the story could have been told as effectively if the enemies were designed and portrayed any differently. At its worst, A Machine for Pigs feels like a simultaneous step backwards in the gameplay department and evolutionary stride forward in storytelling within the medium, but at its best it transcends encompassing the sum of its parts and delivers a heightened emotional experience. If what you want is a good horror story with philosophical underpinnings and an eye and ear for real creepiness, then this game will fit that niche and then some.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is meant to be a second installment of the Amnesia franchise. However this time The Chinese Room were the ones developing the game(Frictional Games Published) and so it went an even more story driven route. The atmosphere throughout the game is dark and fits in with the story. Graphically it wasen't quite as polished as I would of liked. I found it difficult to see things myself even with the lantern and adjusting settings. Screenshots didn't show up properly because of this to. So it's hard to share how this enviroment really feels with people. The gameplay and controls is pretty much what I would expect from an Amnesia game but even more simplified. The sound and music quality is excellent and probably one of the best things for me in this game, aside from the twisted,kinda sick,story line. If you love story heavy games where it is more of a experience of what the story tellers are trying to say then one where you really heavily get into playing it you will probably like Amnesia:A Machine for Pigs. If your looking for a lot of action it's probably not for you.			"

												While this game does not live up to the premise of being just as scary as the first game regarding the constant terror of enemies around, this game still delievers a great and dark story filled with lots of atmosphere, great soundtrack, and the constant pressure of being followed. While you won't be scared with jumpscares often, you will still find moments where you will shake in fear. In comparison to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, this is a more story driven and atmospheric tale. If you love stories and puzzles, check it out. If you're just in to be scared by jumpscares and several enemy encounters, you should just download mods for Amnesia: The Dark Descent or buy Outlast. Still, a underrated game.			"

												   This game is the pure definition of horror.   A lot of people give this game hate, and I can understand why people might dislike this one as opposed to The Dark Decent. A Machine For Pigs takes away quite a few of the main gameplay factors from the first, such as the sanity meter, your inventory, and lantern oil (your lantern never dies out). A Machine For Pigs also is not as 'frightening' as The Dark Decent, there are FAR less ""fall out of your seat"" scares in this one, but A Machine For Pigs greatly makes up for all of this.    The horror in this game comes from the atmosphere and the story. It's no doubt one of the most atmospheric games I have ever played, and sometimes atmosphere subtlety delivers that dread and pit in your stomach that nothing else can. I have to say that the scenery is almost perfect, the lighting, the shading, the textures, hell all of it. Except for the water, but thats not a bother unless you're an uptight nitpicking jackass.   And as for the story, it left me speechless almost the entire way. It builds up fantastically. There were moments where I had to pause the game and process what I had just seen or discovered, and when the climax comes around it will leave you shouting ""what the ♥♥♥♥ is happening"" for 20 minutes straight, but not the confused ""what the ♥♥♥♥ is happening"" the in complete shock kind.    To wrap it all up, if you appreciate the more subtle and atmospheric scares, this is 100% worth playing. However, if you're hoping for the same gut-wrenching chases and scares like the last game, maybe pass. This one is all about suspense, atmosphere, and being as disturbing as possible. It's very difficult to compare the two Amnesia games because of the approach to scare the player, so I can't say which is better. But in my opinion, I give A Machine For Pigs an 8/10.			"

												Now, let me start by saying I do recommend this game. Whew, now that's done, let me tell you that I was sorely disappointed with this coming from the world of Amnesia: A Dark Descent. Don't get me wrong, the storyline was great and had sinister and grity tone all the way through. A haunting ending with beautifully erie sounds to keep you on edge all the way through with your dim lantern. That all sounds wonderful and great for a game right? Wrong! I'll explain. Now, as of this review, I've yet to see a Custom Stories mode. Not to say you can't mod it for one, but still, it made the first Amnesia replayable, so you can try out all the other chilly chapters yet unplayed. Another thing, Amnesia: AMFP took away the sanity meter. Now, the first time you play Amnesia: Dark Descent, and you even look at a monster, the music and the image effects are what spook you. Not to mention the creatures running after you and you know you're toast. This game...not so much. It lost that fear factor for me in playing it. I wasn't so scared to die and run around the corner, because I didn't lose my sanity to the brink where I was seeing faux creatures trying to gnaw my face off. The terror of cowering inside a closet as an atrocious sound was ripping away at the door to your little room is lost and forgotten. Moments like this made Dark Descent scary for me and adrenaline pumping. I digress. Overall, if you're a fan of the series or creepy tales, buy this. But if you want a replacement for your Amnesia Custom Stories, don't do it.			"

												Amazing, deep and emotional story with a great soundtrack. It doesn't really feel like an amnesia game but is still a brilliant game. 9/10 for me. To get that extra 1 there would need to be more monster encounters since they are quite rare but the great atmosphere and story makes up for that.			"

												I really enjoyed it, though the plot became a little too silly towards the end whereas it could've gone with a more subtle metaphor (as hinted in clauses like ""The world is a machine"", etc.). I played a little Dark Descent before getting and playing Machine for Pigs and started DD afterwards again. Though the simple terror of DD is not really present in MP, there is a lingering sense of dread in some of the parts which make the game pretty nice for a horror game (not necessarily referring to the parts with monsters in them; these are few) in a more subconcious way. It is less versatile than DD, though still quite atmospheric.			"

												Completed this in one sitting, I have balls of steel. Less 'gamey' bits than it's predecessor, plus IMO it's simply not as scary. However, the setting is intriguing; think of Cannibal Corpse album covers and you're not far off the mark for how gruesome and brutal this game's inventive backdrops can be at times. Given that this is the developer who made the critically acclaimed Dear Esther, this is probably too 'handholdy' and linear for some, especially in the latter half of the game. Knowing they'd potentially alienate a proportion of their fanbase, The Chinese Room were able to deliver an Amnesia experience with their own particular flair and style- what it lacks in terms of gameplay it compensates for with crushing atmosphere and an exciting Death Metal-esque setting. Recommended.			"

												Alright, so you probably played the first Amnesia game if youre reading reccomendations about the second one, and as most horror game fans have by now, you may also have had the pleasure of playing through Silent Hill 2/3/4. Well done, youve now completely desensitized yourself game based fear-like emotions. Now what? Well you could always empty your pockets on an Oculus Rift, and im sure sooner or later most of us will, but once youve entered a stereoscopic 3d world, the most thats really going to do for the horror genre is let things jump out and say ""Boo!"" at you with an enhanced sense of depth and immersion. You could have just gone to a holiday attraction in late october for that. ""Oh was that a slightly tallish man in a suit? In the WOODS?! How will I ever look at suits or trees in the same way again? Oh, woe, now I see how little our lives really mean a this cold vaccuum of infinity!"" If youre as familiar with the tropes of horror as I am, you know that everyone who works in a mental health facility is either an inhuman abomination or involved in some sort of conspiracy to see how far the human mind can be made to suffer, etc, etc. THIS game takes place in a meat packing facility! A far LESS menacing meat packing facility than Rupture Farms of the Oddworld series. In fact, until the final hour or so of A Machine for Pigs, i was convinced I had it all figured out, so when it became evident that my presumptions were a bit ....off....I was still left to wonder what it all actually meant. My main complaint with this game is that the corner it seems to have cut is to not assign required reading material before allowing one to progress to the next stage. Instead of scraps of notes left lying around, the game should have had entire volumes strewn from room to room as if it took place in the Elderscrolls universe, because without a hell of a lot of explanation that the game makes no attempt to provide its most impressive and creative aspect, its storytelling, is likely to be COMPLETELY lost on an audience expecting to be required to ""survive"" a horror game, not take a world literature class. That said, no other games have really attempted to do what AMFP has attempted to do. PLAY IT, ITS GOOD. But you wont know why until youre ready for spoilers. Or maybe you are now, in which case read on:}SPOILERS BELOW] Not that the game give you enough information to realize this yourself, unless you are already well versed in Aztec mythology but Amnesia: AMFP is actually based on the struggle between Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca as is explained in great and lengthy detail by Reddit user Ahhuatl here with LOTS OF SPOILERS: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1mithv/were_the_aztec_involved_in_mass_sacrificecleansing/ccczjzm?context=3 "

												I wish there was an ""utterly neutral option"" for reviews. Oh well.Now, I'm not a big fan of horror games. In fact, I'm a huge weenie. While playing A:TDD in a totally lit room with two of my best friends, I had to stop because I was hearing vague noises in other parts of the house that sounded like footsteps. This was after already having beaten the area with another friend, and knowing that there were no monster encounters whatsoever in the area.That said, Machine for Pigs did make me feel pretty scared, even from the get go! But it wasn't the same feeling as A:TDD. It felt... very linear. There wasn't a lot of exploration. No things to pick up, no boxes to stack out of nervousness, no fear of using too much light and therefore no fear created by using too little. There were no characters mentioned for me to care about, all the dialogue sounded pretentious and confusing... I didn't really care about where the story went.Now, that's said having played A:TDD.If you DIDN'T play A:TDD, I'm sure it'd be a fine game! It's visually pleasing and pretty interesting, but considering the hype it got from A:TDD, it just doesn't live up to expectations.So that's why I'm neutral. I didn't like it very much, but I don't feel I can judge fairly based on how much I liked A:TDD.			"

												This is definitely not some kind of carbon copy sequel to The Dark Descent. It feels like more of a ''Dark descent inspired"" kind of thing. The puzzles are simplified a lot compared to TDD, and I feel like the focus was put more on being scared to move to/from different areas to solve said puzzles. On that note, I did thoroughly enjoy the dread of having to keep going into the creepy hallway where you just saw that shadow. This game is INCREDIBLY atmospheric and I feel like that's really one of it's best points, there were only a few times when I was in any actual danger and yet I remained nervous through most of the game. (I recovered towards the end, when you do start getting used to what the game throws at you, and start to kind of Rambo it out)I think this game is mostly fun when it's scary to you, and you've got to be the right type of person to be susceptible to that scare. If you're really hard to impress on any kind of horror level you might get disappointed.If you're someone who has a thing for stories involving slaughterhouses this is a total hoot though.			"

												Maybe this game, or experience or however you want to designate it is not for everyone, but it's certainly one I appreciated. While shorter and less frenetic than The Dark Descent, I feel this is balanced by a better and darker story that deals with far larger themes than it's predecessor, an excellent musical score from Jessica Curry and a consistent atmosphere while still having a good few moments of panic. On the whole it's made a more lasting impression on me than its (also excellent, but for different reasons) predecessor. The only thing I'll say against it is that I'm not sure listing it at the same price as it's predecessor is the right choice; many have been disappointed by this game in terms of it's length and the streamlining of gameplay in service of its story, and I think that charging the same price for both games compounds the view that it's a lesser game; get it in a sale, though, and if atmospheric storytelling is something you enjoy, I'm sure you'll find something of value here.

												A highly anticipated title that had many grabbing for it only to have left them all in a rut of disappointment. What could have been a great game was instead a mere echo of the prequel “Amnesia: A Descent into Darkness” and lacked much of what made the original Amnesia so great. Much of the challenge was removed from the works, the lantern for instance no longer has a fuel source, and most encounters with the enemy are for shock value and pose no real threat unless you are terribly bad at knowing when to get down.Amnesia AMfP has sadly failed to live up to what it could have been but I am still curious to see what Frictional Games can do now.4/10			"

												I recommend this game with a grain of salt. :/If you love cinematic games; simple mechanics with immense plot, little interaction, and don't mind short burts of terror here and there, this is a game for you. If not, and you're looking for a brilliant horror successor to the Dark Descent, look no further and choose a different Frictional game, or another horror game altogether, because this game will only leave you fuming over the ridiculous $20 price.Not only that, but it's a very short game, and sometimes the game would have major game-crashing glitches. I couldn't finish the game until three months after I bought it, due to the need of patches Frictional Games/The Chinese Room sent out.Despite the frustrating crashes, I, for one, enjoyed the game immensely, with the wonderful plot it displayed, but I realize this is almost universally not a gamer's cup of tea. So be cautious about your purchase; wait until it's on sale, because you may be in for a bad time. Hopefully, Frictional Games will soar above this hurdle with their next piece.			"

												The game starts off fantastically with a great atmosphere and a real essence of horror. This is thrown to the wind swiftly as the player can easily predict most jump scares, and the atmosphere cannot carry everything. The monster's AI is terribly mapped, anytime one of them is anywhere nearby the light flickers and makes it far too predictable. If you have the itch for a horror game, do yourself a favour and skip this one. Outlast was fantastic however.			"

												I just beat this game and wanted to write this while it's all fresh! This game made me feel tense and uncomfortable, not scared, I know it's just a game, but when the game genuinely makes me pause for a second because it makes me believe I'm not quite sure if I really want to look around the corner, it has done a good job! That being said the gameplay is a bit minimal, no combat, not a ton of real life or death situations, but you never know when the real ones will come, so you are kept on your toes! Near the end of the game are the encounters where I felt they finally nail the feeling of truely being pursued, made me wonder why they didn't use similar encounters earlier... The story is highly recommended for horror fans, especially fans of Lovecraftian style horror. The story is the strongest part of this game to me, there is a lot of subtle wording in the notes which help make more sense of things, or at least more info for your own interpretation. The sound production is a close second, it really sells the atmosphere and overall creepiness! I read reviews comparing this to other games in the series, or by frictional, I avoided playing them first, without any comparision I'd say this is a pretty solid game, and I'm glad this was my intro game to the newer style of survival horror! Very recommended if on sale! I had just under 5 hours of enjoyment with this, but not sure if I would have spent full price... It's on sale now, if your reading this later, I'd recommend wishlisting for when it's on sale. More of an interactive story then a full on game, but for being an interactive story it's a really good one! Looking forward to more of these!			"

												So as someone who didn't like the first Amnesia enough to finish it but who does like thechineseroom's other stuff, I thought Hamnesia was somewhat better than The Dark Descent (I did at least see it through to the end) but substantially worse than Dear Esther or Korsakovia (which you should totally play if you can actually get it working in any existing version of the Source Engine if you want something they've made which does a much better job of creating an unsettling atmosphere...at least when it doesn't degenerate into a mess of jumping puzzles (which you should feel free to skip over with noclip)).Uh, anyway, Hamnesia. The writing's alright and the best part of it. I liked some of the ideas in it even if this isn't really my favorite sub-genre, but I think I would've liked them more if it weren't being presented in a game that's trying to be part of the Amnesia franchise, because that doesn't quite feel like the right framework for it, and it also leads to why many people who liked the first game seem to not like this one. Why would that be? They removed or heavily streamlined most of the things I didn't like from TDD, which are most of the things people who were fans of the game DID like, like lugging a bunch of stuff around to solve trivial puzzles, limited resources, and a much higher number of enemy encounters which took more effort to deal with/had bigger consequences. I understand why people like those things, and I even like them myself in some other games, but the way they were done in that game mostly rubbed me the wrong way for some reason, and I didn't miss them at all here. On the other hand, I also understand why people complained that it's too streamlined and there's not enough game left, but it's not nearly at Dear Esther levels.Getting back to the writing/story for a minute, while it did have some interesting ideas in it, it also didn't really go anywhere unexpected or that wasn't heavily telegraphed way in advance. I'm not really sure why so many people have complained that it's so confusing, because I kind of suspected most of what was going on a third to a half of the way into the game and was thoroughly unsurprised by anything after that. I mean, it's not the MOST accessible game ever, but the plot seems pretty straight-forward to me, especially if you've ever read anything similar before. It does feel like it drags on longer than it needs to though, which is kind of funny because I remember hearing people complain that it was too short. Go figure.			"

Sure there are some sketchy moments when im on the edge of my seat, but throughout this game that happened about twice. To top it all of this game turns into a walk forward simulator, and all the time to time fun grinds to a hault about a quarter way through the game.

												This is my experience with ""Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs"" in a nutshell: Walk along the right wall (using ladders whenever they come up), while you test and re-test all doors, levers, buttons, and so on, just to see if they work at all. :-PThis game is incredibly bland, as you just walk around, trying to figure-out what you CAN interact with, so that you can solve/trigger overly-simple puzzles/events. It doesn't even matter what you do in the game anyways, since there's no penalties for acting like an incompetent fool in the game. One example is that you quickly regenerate any health lost from being damaged. In fact, no matter what mistake you make, the game will act as if you never made the mistake at all. ""Oh, you died?... I'll instantly respawn you a couple of feet away at full health, without even taking away any past progress!""If you want a great ""horror"" gaming experience, then buy yourself ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"". You get to interact with so many things; and you have to actually pay attention to whatever is going on with the game, including the story (as it helps you solve fairly elaborate puzzles). Your resources are also limited; and you often get punished no matter what you do. For example, you go insane if you don't have a light source, but you're incredibly limited in the way of creating/getting any of them. There's even times where you need to avoid light, since you don't want enemies to notice you.			"

												I absolutely loved Amensia: The Dark Descent, so I had really high expectations going into this one. The story line was very interesting and the settings captivating; but this game was way too short to be worth its price. A must have for any Amensia lover, but only if it's on sale.			"

												This sequel is surprisingly shorter, in comparison to 'The Dark Descent'; which could be a let down to some people. However the quality graphics are more superior; the textures, shadows, lightings and the environment have been improved. Removing the Lantern Oil/Tinderboxes and the Sanity status personally didn't bother me; the story was by far the most prominent attribute in this game which makes it stand out. A Fantastic story. A Good game.  :)			"

												The controls and lack of object interaction makes it less realistic and more linear than the last installment. I also don't like the loss of a menu/basic item hold screen. Other than those issues the atmosphere is the scariest ever. Scarier than The Dark Descent and the Penumbra games. The clanking machinery in the background ... the lighting and weather sounds ... the atmosphere in this game makes it so much scarier than the enemies and story.			"

												A good sequel to a great game. It definitely doesn't have the scare factor of the first one, but it isn't absent from this game. Very creepy rather than scary. It rids of the sanity meter and resources for the lamp, which only annoyed me in the first one so i'm not upset about losing those as others are.The puzzles aren't challenging(put a wheel here and flip a switch) and only get in the way of the superb story. That's the real heart of this game. Lame puzzles and being WAY too short(finished it in ~4 hours), it's still worth the play if you can get it on sale. It is NOT worth buying at $20, but I got it for $10 and i'm happy with it. Recommended.			"

												Well, it's Amnesia, and it's not Amnesia. Those die-hard fans of the original game and the Penumbra series will find a lot to complain about here. Less survival, same-same horror, simplified gameplay, willl definitely peeve those who seek to single out the issues. But for the rest of us, anyone looking for a good, heart wrenching and spine chilling tale, you're in for a rollercoaster ride, a yarn to stay with you for long after you've seen it through to the end. A thumb and a trotter, for me at least.			"

												Expectations were set high for this game after the success of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Unfortunately they stripped the system down to simplify the game, watered down the puzzles, and relied entirely too much on jump scares. Expect to be chasing laughing children for the first hour or two in the game, and the fear is alleviated throughout the game because most enemies can't kill you, they will hit you a couple of times and then go 'poof' and disappear. The story was great, and the graphics and style of the game were phenomenal. Unfortunately, it's very short, and doesn't succeed as a horror game.			"

												Utterly terrifying, this game must be played wearing headphones in the dark...if you dare! The game mechanics are remniscent of 'Call of Cthulhu', as well as  the Penumbra series. Lots of skulking around in darkness trying to unravel a mystery which begins as a spooky piece of Steampunk, only to become darker and more visceral as you descend (literally) into the hellish depths. It may be a cliche, but this much is true...Not for the Faint-Hearted.			"

												Save this one for when its on sale.  While Machine for Pigs is overall enjoyable, with the tense atmosphere and disturbing visuals that you would expect from an Amnesia game, it pales in comparison to The Dark Descent.  To me it felt like a watered down version of the game I love.  Inventory, sanity, and resource managment are gone.  There is no where near the level of environmental interaction as its predecessor, which made me feel disconnected from the setting.  The fact the developers didn't even bother to make a difference in the console/PC tips (i.e. ""Press f or Y button for lantern), screams laziness.  It might just be me but I couldn't see a damn thing, with or without the lantern, even at maximum screen brightness.  My eyes hurt everytime I played this game. Very tempermental with integrated graphics chips.  7/10.			"

												I found this to be a very enjoyable game. Not so long you got bored with it but long enough for this type of game. The story is quite good if you take the time to read all the notes and properly observe your surroundings. It has very linear game play making it hard to get lost which works in this game as you dont want to walk around in circles wondering what you missed.There were some parts that made me jump but on the whole not scary as much as disturbing. Most of the puzzlles were reasonbly easy to work out. Its just a walking/running visual story. At first I wasnt grabed by the graphics but that became unimportant as the mood is set using good lighting and audio as opposed to highend graphics. (I am a graphics snob)Pro's-;            1. The game worked well with keyboard and mouse.           2, I enjoyed the story           3. Excellant lighting and audio           4. Easily worth 20 Dollars           5. Worked with eyefinity and crossfire without me having to trouble shhoot and I experianced no bugs           6. Good game for casualsCon's-;           1.There is no weapons or fighting, nor are there any survival needs.            2. There's no real fear of dying and if you do there are no consequences            3.Could have been scarier and harderI have never played the original so cant compare it to that, and I played it expecting it to be crap. It sat on my pc for quite some time before I decided to give it a go. Im glad i did. This is not the type of game I would normly play, but i liked it and would look at more games from this developer. Overall I got 7 hrs play for 20 Bucks. That equals a good deal to meIf your unsure buy it when it goes on sale you shouldnt be dissapointed, unless you truly hate having to read stuff in game.			"

												I was expecting this game very anxiously ever since I first heard of it. I pre-ordered it but didn't get to playing it only until recently. Despite the all-around negative comments and complaints I read, I decided to stay neutral and played it with an open mind and full immersion. The horror aspect (or lack thereof) was an incredibly huge disappointment for me, but the story was a worthy experience along with the atmosphere and musical score. Thus I recommend this game to anyone looking for an interesting and potentially immersive storyline experience.			"

												Updated recommendation...i have been replaying this again, as i did with the last chinese room game 'dear ester' because the second time around was a fair bit more enlightening and played out a bit differently...after doing this with amnesia a machine for pigs, i can say without a certainty that this game is not worth $20... as i stated in the first rec... it is well written, but suffers from a severe lack of challenging gameplay and instead feels like a creepyish dear ester story book on railsi have not been re-enlightened by the story, or have found any new notes, despite spending a good 5 hours roaming around the environments searching for hidden secrets... i only found one new drawer filled with a certain item, that is straight out of the first game.still, i will say i am less cynical this time around and started to enjoy the atmosphere a bit more... even if it does fall extremely short on my expectationshere is my old one:Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs3.0 hrs on recordlast played on Sep 10, 2013this is how long it took me to beat this game-no tension-no inventory-no real puzzles, only one button solutions to proceeding down a linear path-no monsters, well, none that pose an actual threat, they disappear in to thin air almost as soon as you see them-visuals are inconsistent quality and jar the experience-the game tiptoes behind you and claps its hands every once and a while to try to be 2spooky-resorts to images of children darting out of view, random audio only screamers, and paranormal activity style environmental sounds (ie: walking up to a violin and it magically starts playing music)-unbelievably short, it actually pisses me off that its only 2-4 hours long, i spent a lot of time just roaming around too, looking at things... so i didnt even rush-the game is extremely linear, unlike old amnesia where environments were more open, there is only one of these amnesia 1 like open environments in this game+it is well written+ending is pretty oki urge you to not buy this game on the pretense of it being called amnesia, its not 2spooky, and not actually a game, more like... a creepy dear ester, which isnt that bad... just not worth $20THIS IS NOT A FRICTIONAL STYLE HORROR GAME, IT IS A CHINESE ROOM INDIE STORYBOOK TRYING TO PRETEND IT IS AMNESIA			"

												Me being the fan that has actually played the first amnesia game. OK let's get to the point is not good, mostly because is has none of the elements which are actually used in the first game. 1 : Your lartern never runs out of light/fluid etc. 2. The monsters aren't actually as scary as they use to . . they're just ""spooky"" 3. The story of the game honestly made no sense to me at all and I personally think I'm not an idiot so bad story telling it's at work. And most of all the enviroment. . I did get some smalls scares here and there but in the first game it actually made you feel the coldness around each hall you walked through (dat water part) In other sense if you are fan of the first game you might like this one but if you're new to the series and know nothing about the first game. DO NOT BUY THIS. Is it will be  a waste of time for your, trust me. Just go ahead and buy the first game then give this one a try.			"

												You are the industrialist tycoon father of two sons. You wake up in a daze in late 1800's England, haunted by the voices of your children. You begin to search the rooms of your enormous mansion for them. You get a phone call. Your children are in danger. You must shut down the steam machine on your industrial complex to guarantee their safety.This game's storyline has plenty of twists and turns, while not as scary as some may hope, there are plenty of moments that will have you jump up in your chair. It is up to you to determine where your children are. You will learn the nature of their destinations, and will learn the true nature of the machine you have created. Who or what is the machine, and what role do the pigs play? You'll be surprised.While starting out rather slow and a bit frustrating at first, A Machine For Pigs has a captivating storyline with a rewarding amount of lore via random text scrolls. You'll enjoy searching the enormous complex for your children's safety, and will be pleasently surprised at the themes portrayed in this horror survival.At the end of the day, I think we will all have fun and enjoy some bacon the next day.....or perhaps not?!?!!!

												While A Machine for Pigs seems shorter in length that its predecessor it maintains the same level of immersion. The sanity mechanic and inventory system have been removed and you no longer have to worry about resource management. This seems to make the gameplay smoother, but removes the intense dread prevalent in the original game. Sound design is startling great and you hear every creak inside the labyrinthine machine you wander inside of. However, scares appear fewer and further between, and some classic horror tropes are used. Despite this the pacing of the game feels good. The writers have hit the mark with themes of industrialisation, exploitation and dehumanisation coming through very strongly. A few throwbacks to the lore and history of the original game are also included for fans.			"

												Fairly mediocre compared to the first Amnesia or even the Penumbra games. There are hardly any enemy encounters at all, the majority of the game is just completing puzzles while keeping track of the story through reading and narration. It feels much less about survival than its predecessor which isn't a good thing. Not a bad game, not an especially good game. 6.5/10 would be reasonable, maybe 7. It's also not a very long game, only took just over 3 hours to finish which was a bit of a letdown. It feels more like a simple adventure game than a horror game. Also, the lantern has been replaced with an infinite energy light and you don't have an inventory. Just sayin'.			"

Its an interactive story with occasional puzzles and a few places with monsters chasing you.A bit over priced - I would say this needs to be a $5.00 to $10.00 game based on how long, lack of replay, and few reasons to explore.

YouTube™ Video: Amnesia A Machine For Pigs review - Expensive first person horror story 

			Views: 174		

			http://cramgaming.com - A look at The Chinese Room's first person horror adventure, Amnesia A Machine For Pigs which is available now via Steam for £12.99.		

Amnesia A Machine for Pigs text review edit:To conclude, Amnesia A Machine for Pigs is an unusual gaming experience  that races the pulse in a more psychological manner as opposed to direct in your face scares, and with its excellent use of audio is definitely a game to play with headphones on and the lights off.  Despite a lack of pace, the game does a fine job of drawing players in, but the only let down here is that perhaps the entire premise of the main character is a little cliche.Whilst the execution is admirable, a lack of replay and overall length might deter some players and prevents the game from receiving top marks; it's also not a game that's going to universally appeal to all gamers. If you like a more subdued gaming experience, then this is worth checking out. If you're more hands on this might leave you a little unfulfilled. Whilst there's a very good game here at heart, the question remains, is it worth the price of entry. Perhaps, if you're a fan of horror adventure, but the reality is for the time spent, and lack of replay, the game is a little on the costly side where it might be more prudent to wait for a price drop.Score 7/10 - Review by Robert Cram			"

												It's quite simple: If you liked the previous Amnesia or Penumbra games, you should get this. It's not the same game but still good. It's best described as a mix of Amnesia: The Dark Descent and Dear Esther. No surprise, as this game was not developed by Frictional but the Dear Esther developer the chinese room.			"

												If you're expecting jump scares and the fear-inducing paranoia of Amnesia:TDD look elswhere.The best way to describe this game would be as an experiment int he Amnesia universe. This game is not here to shock or scare you as much as to disturb and revolt you.The focus here is clearly on the anrrative and this only becomes more evident as the story progressess.Some may be disappointed in the linear and simplified gameplay but, given the games goal, it is wholly understandable.What this game does have is a brilliant soundtrack and a truly harrowing narrative. Though many may find the complex vocabulary and long monologues to be the epitome of pretencion, if you can get over them there is a very interesting tale waiting to be told.tldr; Gradually goes from Amnesia to Dear Esther, great unusual story, lackluster horror and gameplayWould recommend if the story is enough for you, look elswhere for horror trills.

												If you want a horror game that has an amazing, well-written story, you should buy this right now. HOWEVER... If you want a really scary experience from being hunted by monsters, you're better off playing the first Amnesia.			"

												Imagine if you took all the worst parts of Amnesia: The Dark Descent and crossed them with Dear Esther, you get this game. The gameplay has been simplified, the layout is linear, lacks atmoshpere, the puzzles are very poorly intergrated into the environment (at least they are easy), the monsters and dark environments just make the game tedious rather then suspensful and the storytelling is very stiff.I was hoping for somthing far more impressive from Frictional Games considering their eairlier games such as the Penumbra series. Extremely dissapointing, I want my money back. Walking simulator/10			"

												I've played The Dark Descent from start to finish and felt it brought something new to the table (nothing great and overrated imo).  In all honesty, A Machine for Pigs was the first title I played from the series after being in awe from the visuals.  After 4 hours of boring gameplay and an ""ok"" story I was rather disappointed.

												I'd love to wr-write a review! Of course! Everyone's so crazy about this game! Flandre isn't that shy to write a review!!*Clears throat* Okay! Now listen to me ! I will give you a ver..*Chokes*I played the first Amnesia: The Dark Hellish Scary Doom Game That Forever Scarred My Life Descent for such a long time now, but mostly the custom stories. Thou the campaign was enjoyable as well, the community is lovely strong. A lot of people are basing their review solely in comparison with the first game. Nothing wrong with that. In any case, just a few points to keep in mind.I enjoyed this game quite a lot. I personally think that handing this to thechineseroom was not too much of the greatest idea, rather, Frictional Games should have done all the work, ALL, and they should have said NO DON'T DO THAT! AND THAT! BAD BAD! Removing elements (Yes I'M GONNA BRAG ABOUT IT BALHBVALH) such as the sanity was something TDD was special for, because it created tension, and so did running out of oil, and what am I gonna do with my life after it depletes, or what if I pass out next to that monster and he sees me and comes towards me then I just shut the computer off instantly, go to my bed and weep and cry ALONE AND FEEL MISERA-....*AHEM*.... that kind of tension is what made The Dark Descent special. You just had no idea what'd you do in that situation, and it was just frightful to be left without any idea on what to do next. At some points I just didn't even want to continue in The Dark Descent, as I was too nervous and scared. (Sh-shush baka, n-not funny).T-thou the staggering amount of effort given, and the interesting story kept me going and going for A Machine for Pigs. As suppose to the first one, the sound effects are very well done and much more vibrant, and I could say a little about how the game looks, as I felt it was a slight improvement, but that's it. I felt like I was still apart of the game, and not what some people say ""a walking narrator"". I am easily scared, VERY easily, so the monsters did their job just fine, and so did the lights flickering as they got near and I panicked and cried and screamed for my life. So in a way the fear also kept me going as well. The atmosphere was just brilliant!  So in the end, I enjoyed it, and had fun, and cried in fear. I don't use numbers, but if a grunt or pig monster came and asked me for one I'd immediately shout a 7/10 and then die, thou that really doesn't mean much to me. So, as a 'sequel' to the first game, The Dark Descent is far much superior, but A Machine for Pigs is still a Machine of Terror and dread to enjoy, yet could have been MUCH better. "

												An okay horror-survival game with a very good and immersive story. This game, unlike it's predecessor, is much more story based and so the elements of horror lack greatly in the mid-end game. If you're looking for a great story with mild horror and decent atmosphere, this game is your cup of tea!			"

												While many may find this game unsatisfying, I think that it has a great atmosphere and story, even if it is difficult to follow.  I was also decently scared by it, but others may not be as scared as me.  I reccomend this as a game that you should take somewhat seriously, because the story is the most important element of it.  Some games are for some people, though, and not everyone (as shown by other reviews) will like this game.  That's the way The Chinese Room does it. Finally, this game is not very similar to Amnesia: The Dark Descent in the realm of survival horror.			"

												Deeply atmospheric, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs takes a very unusual storyline and spins a tale of ever deepening darkness.  Venture further and further into the Machine for Pigs, and come to understand the bizarre mind of the twisted genius behind it all.  Philosophical and disturbing, this second Amnesia game may not have the frightening Chef guy in the dungeons, but it has something just as disturbing lurking about behind you, so beware.Highly immersive and enjoyable, though for a sequel, it fails to expand much upon the original Amnesia formula.

												The second installment in the Amnesia franchise is a testament to the idea that sequels can be good things! While the gameplay is similar to that of a haunted-train or haunted-house scenario, it doesn't loose the ability to pose a challenge. There is no inventory, and the lantern is electrical so you don't have to worry about finding fuel for it. However, not even that will offer much comfort as you descend into this games twisting storyline. Truly a very good follow-up to a great original idea. Four Stars.			"

Lot's of great atmosphere and horror in the beginning and middle but the last third toned down the horror a bit in favor of addressing the story.  This story is seriously disturbing and made me sick to my stomach, the whole expereince makes you feel that way.  I'd give Machine for Pigs a solid B grade.  If you love horror games, this is one for you.			"

												Good sequel to the first Amnesia, though not as long and not quite as scary. Follows the same formula as getting scarier with each level and reaching the peak in the middle, then it's not as scary anymore. The story is interesting with some twists to it. Overall a decent game that's worth checking out. Hopefully they add some extras to it.			"

												worst amnesia game EVER.thechineseroom ♥♥♥♥ed everything up i can not believe we had to wait another year for its release as the product itself is verry bad and why would fritionalgames work with such a♥♥♥♥♥♥devs who cant make a decent horror game exept for cloning this one from their first game: dear esther with just some gameplay stuf added from tdd, now lets start with the bad and the good stuf together. in the first parts of the game there was this good tension and being the feeling the pigmonster was after you but after some time and your first encounter you realize the pigmonsters arent such a great treat and the rest of the game isnt scary at all as at the beginning, also there is this infinite lantern wich you never ever needs to refil so yeah no oil and tinderboxes wich will make you not to scavenge in rooms because of this it makes it verry boring and the gameplay will feel repitive, the story about wo1 and mandus his children may be somewhat interesting but it doesnt make it a good game it was realy all that was good the story.also the narrator this machine who keeps talking to you just spams the entire story instead of finding some of the story trough the game (also the notes you find completely spams the mystery behind the monsters and other stuf), instead the machine just tells the entire story the ♥♥♥♥ing entire time (especialy at the part were the pigs attacked the town) it started to anoy me so much that it destroys the scare factor even more oow god let him stop talking, the lenght of this game is also verry short i know a guy who did a speedrun in this game and he completed the game in 3 ♥♥♥♥ing hours just horrible game length.there is also no inventory so yeah no more puzzles wich you need to take stuff with you, and if there are puzzles wich you need to take stuf with you then you need to hold it in your hands this gets once again repitive and boring as you mostly dont need to walk that far to complete the puzzle, there is also no sanity in this game so with other words you just can keep looking at the monsters the entire time without getting insane as for the health your health regenerate over some small time so there are no health potions in this game, but there is no danger at all so you dont have to rely on your health consider the ai of the pigmonsters are so stupid and they do almost no damage to you ether.and then we havent talked about the horrible ending mandus sacrificed himself at the machine by pulling out his hart so that the pigs and the machine......die? this is some biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t i ever have seen how dafuq would the pigs just randomly die or leave the town if mandus die how does that make any sense.final verdict: nothing but letterly nothing is scary in this game exept for the verry beginning, the story is just all thats good at this game it should have called dear esther:machine for pigs its purely a clone from dear esther itself with just the gameplay from amnesia, so if you are a penumbra and amnesia:tdd fan then dont buy this game because youl espect the unexpected what you never thought to expect.my score 4/10 :mehlet just hope frictionals next game (wich is purely made by them) soma will be good ones again.

												A machine for pigs does have entertainment value. I played the game from end to end (all 5.8 hours of it) and it was interesting to make guesses as to what's actually going on and getting more and more clues.However, that about sums up the game. You can leave your light on from start to finish if you wish and there's no inventory. The scare factor is 2/10 (the game features about 4 or 5 enemy encounters, but they're just anthropomorphic pigs with bad pathfinding, so when one appears in front of you, you lead them in a circle and continue (which is one of the problems: the game is almost entirely a linear walk through rooms, it never locks you in the dark with something scary or such). All puzzles are object fetching (reaching their highpoint when you have to fetch two things instead of one).I don't regret this buy, but it is more of a playable fan-fiction story inspired by Amnesia than anything else. ""The Dark Descent"" was much smarter about how it tried to invoke fear (eg. the water chase, the wine cellar, the vivisection room) and it had clever puzzles. Frictional Games should have taken this game from ""The Chinese Room"" in its current state and then built their own scares and puzzles into it because what I see could have been an excellent foundation for a real Amnesia 2.

												BASICALLY:  Poorly done monster encounters, but excellent atmosphere; would recommend ONLY if you have the patience to become immersed in games.  Grab it when it's on sale. If you love games with a dark, suspenseful atmosphere, look no further, 'cause this game definitely delivers in that respect.  Better than in The Dark Descent, IMO.  Of course, in order to find this game to be ""scary"" you will have to allow yourself to suspend disbelief and put yourself in the main character's shoes.  The horror almost completely relies on that.  If you just run though and don't look at or read anything, you're not going to get many scares.  There aren't that many monster encounters, and the ones that are included are very short (and frankly not well thought out).  Plus, the game is pretty short as it is (~4.5hrs for me).  If you take your time with this game, I'm sure you will have many thrilling moments.  Hopefully we'll see some extra content like in the previous game.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a pale shadow of the original Amnesia. The game's beginning sets the mood off by starting out in a creepy mansion, but it goes down hill from there. There are a few jump scares at the beginning which makes your heart race, but after that they become very lackluster. The game's monster is also rather lazy in design in my opinion, also, the AI for it seemed to be broken. If can chase after the monster and it just RUNS AWAY FROM ME, then it is simply no longer scary. I really wanted to give this game a good review, but with the lacking story and the not-so-scary monster, I simply couldn't give it a thumbs up.			"

												Not nearly as bad as a lot of folks say, just a case of severely misleading marketing. It's really, really nothing like Amnesia, and if you're going into it expecting that, you're going to be understandably let down. But, if you go into it for a weird, genuinely disturbing short interactive horror story set in the same universe, you'll probably dig it just fine. If you're in the market for something really different, give it a shot. If you're looking for a sequel, look elsewhere.			"

												Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a mixed bag. Did I enjoy my time playing it? Yes. Was it anywhere near as good as the first game? Not even close.The Chinese Room succeeds at telling a compelling story but fails utterly at the execution of tension and fear in many ways due to the removal of the ""gamey"" elements from the previous Amnesia. Gone is the inventory and any item management. The few puzzles that occur in the game are pitifully simple and that's really sad considering the original Amnesia puzzles weren't really that difficult either. Every enemy encounter is broadcast via the flickering of your lantern from miles away, making every scare there fall completely flat.The linearity of the game is also totally noticable. Amnesia did this too but they at least tried to hide it. A Machine For Pigs seems to revel in the fact that you can tell how linear it is. The belowground levels at least attempt the illusion of non-linearity, barely, but the outside areas are awful in this respect. I recall a specific sequence where I was funneled from small London building to small London building via a series of straight pathways bordered by fences. If The Chinese Room's goal was to immerse me by removing the video game elements of this video game, then maybe they should actually try to hide their game's linearity instead of playing it up.But by far, the biggest crime is the removal of the sanity meter. You can look straight at monsters now, and while they are indeed disturbing to look at the scare factor there is gone and there is no penalty. Frictional knew that showing your monsters kills the atmosphere and that The Chinese Room ****s this up is mindboggling to me.I could go on and on about why the removal of the original Amnesia's game elements is Awful and Never Should Have Been Done but it's been discussed ad nauseam at this point.TL;DR Since there isn't a ""meh"" or ""disappointingly competent, I guess"" button I've hit recommend, but with the huge caveat that it is inferior in every way to the original Amnesia, but if you're looking for a story being told in a fairly creepy way, this game is passable.It really shouldn't be using that ""Amnesia"" in the title. It's ""Creepy Dear Esther: the Video Game"".			"

												I've heard that this game isn't as good as the first one, and it's true. While I was skeptical about those claims, I went in with optimism and while I haven't beaten the game yet, what I have seen can be described as mostly interesting. I think it tries too hard to be scary and ends up falling flat after the initial scare. Yes, the pigmen can scare you when you first run into them, but after a while, it starts getting boring, tedious even. And there is too much story being put into it. You can ignore the notes and voxophones, but then you get confused as to why things are the way they are.Now, despite all that I still recommend this to everyone looking for something to play. It has scares in it, but the main selling point of this game is the atmosphere.The game uses lighting effectively and the sounds fit the scenes, nothing is really out of place. And the best part of the game is the ending. That's all I'll say to prevent spoilers.In short, although Dark Descent is the better one by quite a bit for horror, this one is highly atmospheric, and has an awesome ending. It's an experience that I've enjoyed greatly.			"

This is TheChineserooms first attempt at a survival horror game. all in all it was a great addition to the amnesia franchise, but a little advise for TheChineseRoom, if they ever decide to update the game with upgraded mechanics and making the story longer they should do it. Like i said even by it's current state A Machine for pigs was great but it also has a lot of potential to make it even better! :D I will now end this review with another tip to the creators. Please implement a custom story and a DLC for A Machine For Pigs, cause that would be SWEEEEEET! :D			"

												I say I would not reccomend this game, but only for this one enormous reason. The game appears, and is advertised as, as a horror game, but what you may find out an hour into the game.... (which is about halfway through the game. Seriously, it took about two hours to beat..... let that sink in.) ....is that there really is no horror. There are a few parts where you see something creepy or something chases you or you have to stealth past a monster that you can stare at as much as you want, so it doesn't make it hard to figure out what it's going to do, but that is it. Overall it is a very non-subtled story. It keeps forcing the main point down your throat like you're some sort of mo-ron that won't catch on to what they're saying unless they paint it on every wall in blood they just took from your bum. In short, this is a ""horror"" game that just doesn't deliver. If you want to play a game that is very slow and boring (so thank god it's short) then this is the game for you. But if you're a fan of The Dark Descent, then I will let you know now that after you beat it in two hours, you will feel cheated and bummed out. Terrible game.			"

												♥♥♥♥ing aweful. This game is a horrid♥♥♥♥♥♥stain on the Amnesia title. They took every memorable game mechanic from the Dark Descent and threw it down the toilet and said ""Hey! Let's just make this a game where all you do is walk and hear spooky sounds!"". I understand that Frictional Games is not to blame for this catastrophe; it was the Chinese Room that really♥♥♥♥♥♥the bed on this one. They even teased us with flashes from the previous title like the water-lurking Kaernk. I was excited to see it thinking there'd be another tense chase level but nope. Just a tease. One of the most important game mechanics was balancing your sanity by finding tinderboxes and oil to provide yourself with calming light from time to time. Not this time. You're given an inexhaustable lantern, that even flickers when danger is near (oooh how wonderful!) There are a few creepy moments but not nearly enough to make me even slightly nervous. My advice, you have twenty bucks you wanted to spend on this game? Go buy Outlast. Way more bang for your buck. This one's a flop and I hope Frictional Games never lets the Chinese Room touch his title ever again.			"

												Wasn't that scary in terms of horror, I've never played the original Amnesia so take that into consideration when reading this review. Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. The atompsphere was spooky but the monsters were far & few between & pretty easy to avoid. If you're expecting a survival horror game, this isn't it in my opinion. A lot of times it felt like you were just wandering around going through the motions, there was never that feel of danger. I did enjoy the game overall. Good creepy atmosphere, puzzles, music, and voice acting (mostly)			"

												Oh boy. OOOOOOOH BOY.This game has dissapointed me to the edge of tears. And I had so much hope for it!Let me clarify: Smooth game running? Check. Engaging story line? Gotcha. Spooky atmosphere? Yep. Scary? Well.....This game has almost every element as the original amnesia does, except the peril of dying, which might not seem that big of a problem, but in this game you feel more like a bystander that's just going through the motions rather than a man who is merely fighting for survival against a seemingly unassailable force. This game also seems to have a lacking amount of monsters. Boom said it. In conclusion, if this game was in no way related to its predecessor, I would give it a 10/10, but since it seems to try to ride on the coat tails of Descent Into Darkness and it so DESPERATELY wants to be it (but isn't) I have to not recommend to anyone wishing to experience the same level of gameplay as they did in the first one. 5/10			"

												Amnesia: A Macine for Pigs. Is a more story driven experience. It don't gives as much jumpscares, Like the last game gave us. But this game dosen`t need scares to keep  us interested, because the story is good written and the voice acting is marvelous. The enemies you are going to meet is pig humans. They are more of runing after you if they spot you enemie. The puzzles are more easy to handle to. I recommend you to try it out for your self.			"

												As a fan of Dark Descent, I was extraordinarly disappointed with this game.While the story was better fleshed out that in its predecessor, the removal of the sanity component from the previous game destroyed the horror atmosphere and rendered it so easy as to be laughable.I usually write longer reviews, but no more needs to be said about this particular product.

												Come on really! This game suck! This doesn't live up to horror standards in my opinion. Also, it's nothing like the first one there maybe a couple monsters, but really aren't that much of a threat. The water monster from the first one was terriffieing now the water monster was shown maybe two times at most and they just add electricity to make you run away from it.

												A highly streamlined experience when compared to its predecessor. Many of the mechanics were eschewed in the name of simplicity and focus on the narrative.The tone and world are darker and far more real than A:TDD. However, it wasn't as terrifying to play.The environments were lush, beautifully rendered/realized, and felt appropriate and real at all times. The sound design is fantastic, and the story is wonderful. Given the direction by The Chinese Room, it is easy to see why the focus shifted to the narrative over scares/gameplay.If you want to be creeped out and exploring a tragic, dark vision of late 19th century London, this is the game.Amensia (s) are more about story, the universe of the game, and the whole feel. The games take the time to pace things, and to allow you to fully immerse yourself in the universe they've created. The feeling of constant dread was much thicker in Amensia (s) than I ever got from any other horror game. Listening to the final plea of the antagonist in A Machine for Pigs, hearing the gut-wrenching emotion of the antagonist begging him to go through with activating the machine, just... What an amazing moment. The story disturbed me. I continue to think about it, and I revel in re-telling the story to others.That is what makes Amnesia different. It sticks with you longer than the ""Summer Blockbuster"" type horror of other games. When I leave the worlds of other horror games, they leave me as well.			"

												I'm not one of those people that bash A Machine for Pigs because it's not The Dark Descent, nor am I going to unfairly compare this game to Outlast. I for one, didn't think that just because The Chinese Room took out a bunch of features didn't mean AMfP couldn't have at least been an interesting narrative experience. No, I can't recommend AMfP because it fails miserably at even the low standards it gave itself.I understand this is primarily an interactive story, but I have to get a few functionality issues out of the way. First, the game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ I know I don't have the biggest, baddest computer on the block, but I should not be chugging, after knocking down all of my settings to minimum, at around 30 FPS just because there's some water and three or four light sources. And when you do get a good look at your environment, there are a few embarassingly pixelized textures. One of the caged doors seriously looked like it would fit in on a Playstation 1 game. That is NOT hyperbole.That said, the aforementioned lighting effects are great. The pigman models are good, even up close, and there are a wide array of colors. Especially when compared to TDD's 40 different greys and 62 seperate browns. The game also has some stupendous sound design. The music is incredibly ominous, the pigmen sound terrifying (moreso than the actually are, naturally) and the machinery hisses and creaks and whistles and bangs all to great effect.That's about all the praise I can give AMfP.Let's talk about mechanics: everyone knows they streamlined AMfP from TDD, but they didn't even do a good job of it. As it is, there is no sanity mechanic, so you can stay in the dark for as long as you like without penelty, and the pigmen can tell where you are if you keep your lantern on. Then you take into account that you're pretty much invisible when your lantern is off and you crouch-walk... So why would you ever turn your lantern on? I only did when I got bored. Boredom. Probably not what anyone is aiming for when making a horror game. Either always have the lantern on without penalty, or bring back the sanity meter.But what happens when you have a scripted chase scene or you turn your lantern on a pigman's mug just to see what will happen? Well, he'll probably get one hit on you, then you run, the pigman will get bored after about ten feet, and then he'll go back to patrolling. The entire game I only died once, and that was when a pigman chased me into a corner. I kid you not, it took a solid five seconds of me standing still for him to kill me and I was close enough to give him a smooch. For being such a horrible beast, he sure was nice enough to pause and let me catch my breath in between beating me savagely.But the story is what really matters! Did you like Bioshock 1? Good, because AMfP is pretty much the same thing, only way more convoluted. I don't want to give anything away, but whoever wrote this thinks that just because they obfuscated a few details behind some good writing, a lot of average writing, and some cringe-worthy writing that the two big plot twists weren't obvious after the first ♥♥♥♥ing level. Also I hope you like pig metaphors, because you'll be reminded how everything is pig-like at least once per level. HUMANITY IS PIG. YOU ARE PIG. I AM PIG. ALL IS PIG.The funny part is, AMfP, like it's patchwork pigmen, tries so hard to elevate itself into the pretentous realm of 'art-horror' but it can't escape the fact that it doesn't reconcile that with it's identity as a source for highlight videos on YouTube. Permiated through the game are attempted jump scares in the form of doors slamming, illusory segments, monsters scurrying in front of you... All of the clichés, and none of them work. For trying so hard to be different, this is the most predictable horror experience I've seen in a long time. And the camera shake... My God, if you think camera shake is scary, pick this up without hesitation. I swear, this game has as much camera shake as it does spoken lines of dialogue. In some levels your camera will shake three, four, even five times. If I ever see camera shake ever again, I'll go postal. Camera shake.So who do I seriously recommend this to? If you're a fan of 'haunted house' horror games, TDD and Outlast do it way better. If you want a smart and interesting story... You could also do better. AMfP wants to have something meaningful to say about humanity or utopian thinking, but because it has it's head so far up it's own♥♥♥♥♥and because it's bloated - bursting at the seams even - with all of the horror game conventions, all it can muster is a drawn-out groan, like a bad Frankenstein experiment.

												Around the same time that Machine for Pigs was released, the competitor horror title Outlast was also launched. I've made my feelings on Outlast clear because I was all too vitriolic about how absurd I found it to be. I don't want to praise Machine for Pigs too much. I think different people will have different reactions to it. There's an article that expresses my frustrations with horror videogames better than I ever could, and I'd encourage you to have a look at it if you're considering buying either game [Link: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/09/27/editorial-horror-and-a-maddening-lack-of-imagination/]All I want to say about Machine for Pigs is that midway through the game, I realised the true horror of the game wasn't a question of how the monsters came to be, but instead how much of a hand I, as the primary character had in creating them. The answer is perhaps more sickening than you think.			"

												Simply put they removed too many elements from the previous game like Sanity and need for oil. This made the game far too simple for me to enjoy,you could not ""explore"" like you could in the previos game,you were always sent on a 100% linear path with no freedom to do things as before like throw things into a pot of acid.All containers were sealed so you could not go and find many supplies and all around the enemies were nowhere near as frightening as the gatherers you faced before. on a scale of 1 to 10 on being a scary game i give it a 3/10,It had potential from the previous game but was stripped to the bare bones and made less fun and scary to more boring and tedious.

												Meh... And here's why. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, is compared to the original one, boring and not very scary. It seems to hold your hand way to much, forcing you down a korridor, not giving you many ways to explore by your own. And somehow the monsters are not all that scary anymore. They also removed sweet features like barricading doors to slow the monsters chasing you.Watch some videos before buying the game yourself, just to see what it's like.

												No, it isn't as frightening as the original Amnesia, and its significantly more minimal with respect to gameplay elements. It isn't as intensely frightening but it still is somewhat scary, and there are some fantastically disturbing scenes too.Where this game absolutely obliterates the original Amnesia is plot: Machine For Pigs has a fantastic story, confusing and not always easy to grasp, but extremely compelling nonetheless.I do think that some of the game's later levels are excessively padded (size-wise) but that's a minor issue.Overall it is worth the money and fans of the genre will greatly enjoy the game.

All in all if you have little to no self-respect and have already completed the first game and the rest of the games created in the similar vein, I suppose it would be ok to pick this up, during a steam sale for no more than $3.99.

												I just finished the game, and I have to say, this is one instance where the game critics got it right and the general gaming public has it dead wrong. The game received mostly positive, if not quite as much as much as the original, reviews, where the things missed from the original were pointed out but on its own terms were able to recognize it for its merits and what it tried to do. Judging by the negative reception from fans of the original, it would seem as though everyone was wanting ""Teleporting Naked Guys,"" a now-infamous jumpscare used incessantly by numerous Amnesia custom stories and are upset they didn't get that.So, no, it is in many respects not similar to the original game at all. But I disagree that this should not have been called an Amnesia title. It very much is a continuation of the universe established by the original and follows the atmospheric vision of the first game, albeit in a different direction. Some of the complaints I read are either exaggerated, missing the point or things I would not consider things that hamper the experience at all.First, the complaints regarding the gameplay: Chinese Room done dumbed it down! It is now a straight line from point A to B, they got rid of the sanity meter, inventory, the need to constantly refill your lantern, they screwed Amnesia up royally! First of all, yes, the game is very linear, but so was the original Amnesia, which itself had plenty of locked doors, clearly marked paths and limited exploration. Granted, I'll admit this is more linear, but not to the degree the complaints have read, I was actually surprised how much extraneous stuff there was to explore considering the criticisms. The mansion in the beginning, for instance, does indeed have mostly locked doors but there are other bedrooms and bathrooms to look around in, which don't serve to advance the game but to provide some texture for the setting. There were enough times where I found there was a path ahead of me, but also other paths I didn't check, and so made to sure to look at everything. Sometimes these lead to dead ends, sometimes an area where a new document can be found, and sometimes, yes, something important you need in order to keep going. Maybe it was a matter of expectations, and had they been different my attitude would change, but expecting literally a linear path with nothing on the side I found that far to be from the case here.The ""dumbed down"" elements. Well the first Amnesia wasn't necessarily a complex game to begin with, so the streamlining I don't think affects anything much really. Retiring the sanity meter I think was for the better. It was a nice mechanic in the original, but this isn't the same character, the same scenario. Tinderboxes, oil, this is not an environment designed around that, getting rid of it is fine with me, and taking out inventory is fine too, seeing how the inventory in the original was limited to either those survival items, or pieces needed to attach to machinery (that aspect is here, except now you have to carry it), or keys. If it isn't needed, then don't put it in. As much as I did love those aspects of Amnesia TDD I'm glad that this isn't just a complete rehash.""But,"" people say, ""they don't replace those things with anything interesting of their own."" I'd say it's more like they didn't replace it, because there was no need to. It still plays great, with decent if not completely brain-bending puzzles, and is also a game that looks great, especially for an indie title made to run on low-end hardware (like mine, although I will say I ran into frequent crashes between level transitions and had to constantly tinker with the settings up and around until I found a configuration that would let me in to the next level. ""Save and exit"" became quite the companion of mine), there are still plenty of interesting, sometimes unsettling sights, and the levels, especially as it nears its end, are quite spectacular to behold. I also must say I thought this had a better story than the original. Certain elements were predictable, but the way they were executed was what mattered. The first game's story had a couple of interesting twists, but mostly if you knew your Lovecraft you knew where the game was headed. The story here is more unusual, if confusing. The notes you pick up, describing some downright graphic and disturbing things with terrible implications about your character and the machine in question here, do shed light on the situation, but they are out of chronological order as you pick them, and not all of them are written by the same character, only context helping you figure that out, and as you discover the identity of the mysterious voice calling you, things take a turn for the downright weird and possibly apocalyptic. There is also a touch of sadness in the story as well. I won't spoil anything, but you'll arrive on that conclusion well enough. And also some careful observations about your surroundings during certain areas late in the game lend an identity to the pig monsters that is downright tragic.Oh, yeah, how scary is it? Many people say, not at all. Sometimes their entire reason for giving the thumbs down to this game is because it isn't ""scary."" This is what frustrates me most. To me, horror encompasses a wide spectrum of elements, just freaking you out is just one such thing. Dismissing horror automatically for not being scary and not looking at what else it tries to do is just short-sighted. A pure, enveloping atmosphere is most important to any kind of horror, the implications can be scarier than the experience, what DID or what WILL happen scarier than what IS happening, and so on. No, there are no freakish monstrosities in this game like the ever-beloved slack-jawed grunt of the original Amnesia. No, there aren't as many panic-laden chases through the dark until you find a nice closet space to hide. No, again, there is no sanity meter that you must keep on a tight balance. There are several sections where you must sneak past or run away from a pig monster, though they are fairly brief, and obviously a pig humanoid doesn't look quite as scary as the ""servants"" from the original. The water monsters are back, though the one scene you must run from them is also brief and not on the same level of sheer panic induced by the first game. But, to me, that is perfectly fine, the game I say is just as effective a horror game, but in a different way. I still thought the atmosphere of dread and detail in the dark, decrepit environments was as present as always, and the fear of a monster coming out any moment as well. But little things, like the lantern flickering to alert you to a monster, putting you in full panic mode (much more tense than if they were to cheaply teleport and scream in front of your face), the pig masks that constantly appear, the loud background squeal of pigs, all made for a nerve-wracking experience. But it's more the Machine itself, the things you read you and it have done, that disturb the most. It's Upton Sinclair by way of H.P. Lovecraft and it's quite staggering.Is it as good as the original? Maybe the original left a stronger effect on me, but these are two different games with their own merits. This is still a strong experience I'd recommend to anyone who doesn't have such limiting expectations.			"

												This follow up to the Dark Descent is very different, but still touches on some similar themes and elements.Mandus awakens in his mansion with no memories of what has happened in the recent past. It's December 31st, 1899, and he explores, eventually coming across someone on the other end of a phone line that instructs him to awaken differen parts of a massive machine.To say much more would be to spoil a lot of the elements that become clear in the story. But this is a game that mixes the abstract with the concrete, lending it an otherworldly quality despite being about something as steadfast as industry. It's a good story told well, although I have to say that the seling point on the Steam page of ""the darkest tale ever told in a video game"" is highly exagerrated, although it's still pretty damn gruesome and dark. It's a bit confusing in some ways, but by the end the overall picture of what's going on is more or less clear.This game does away with the inventory and sanity system of the previous game and places pretty much all of its focus on moving the story forward. If the dark Descent was a more traditional survival horror game, with invetory and health management, as well as a sanitys ystem, this is a much more story and atmosphere driven game, with little in the way of puzzles (any puzzles you encounter are basically just bringing object A to a certain spot or turning a valve, so they feel more like busy work than anything). In fact, this whole game is streamlined from the first. It's far easier, with enemy encounters being simple to get through.So while the Dark Descent might be a better pure horror game, this game is much more narrative driven, with a focus on moving the story forward. I guess this difference explains the mixed user reviews on Steam, but the story is wellexecuted and the atmosphere top notch, which makes this a solid play for horror fans.			"

												Seriously? Seriously... This is a horror game... WITH NO DANGER IN IT. At first the symbolism and relative dread could have carried this game, it certainly is the best thing the chinese room has put out. But that's just because those standards are the lowest you can find out there. You will soon realize that the symbolism wears thin, specially because it's completelly abused. The creepy children that at first look like they can have some sort of twist that makes for a cool narrative element turn out to be simply ghost kids, because that's what amnesia needed, and the god damn pigs AREN'T AN ACTUAL THREAT.I'm not kidding when I say that, if a pig catches you it'll simply carry you somewhere, not kill you, and they appear really scarcily too, meaning that there's nothing, NOTHING, to stop you, AT ALL. It's just a walking simulator, seriously, it's just another walking simulator. They also took away the sanity system, as you have infinite lamps and sanity refills itself incredibly fast so you won't need any potions, they also added regenerating health, because of course they did. Oh and there's also no inventory, because its not even needed, the puzzles are that basic and easy.But ok, lets measure it by THOSE standards... Well then it's symbolism is abused, its story is crap, it misses the mark in most narrative elements, its puzzles are trash, its attempts at scaring you are laughable once you realize that the pigs CAN'T KILL YOU, the ghost kids made me burst out laughing multiple times and even tho, to give credit where credit is due, the machine itself looks interesting at first and even seems alive in later parts of the game... THAT'S LITERALY THE ONLY GOOD PART OF THE GAME, and even then, I'm not talking about the whole thing, as in all the scenery, just the parts where the machine is actually active, which are not even 10% of the bloody thing...As its own thing it's bad, as an Amnesia game its dreadful. Disappointment is all that awaits those who dare buy this stupid thing.			"

												Yes, this Amnesia is simpler in mechanics than the predecessor. Yes, it is less scary. Yes, it is different. Is it bad? Depends on what do you expect. I played the previous one for a while, I think the game is very good, but it didn't get that grip on me to complete it. Now this... I was reluctant due to many hate posts on the forums, but then one of those posts just made me buy it. Too little combat! Not enough running! Crappy mechanics made worse by a good story! Seriously... Instant buy for me! So I bought it, and I'm almost at the finish line now, and I think that the experience was worth every penny.So what is Amnesia AMFP? Is it a horror game? Well, it can be. For me it was a very nice and creepy and jumpy and entertaining experience. Yes, the game is simple and slow. Most of the time you walk, look around, read the documents left behind, connect the dots as the story unfolds. There are a few enemy encounters and you can die, but it's not that easy. Most of the time the scare comes not from the monster leaping at you but from the story and atmosphere. It's not bad, it's just... different.If you prefer the action horror experience, where you do lots of escaping and constant threat, you will be bored. If you prefer the combat horror experience, running and gunning/smashing, you will be even more bored. If you expect Amnesia Dark Descent 2, you will be disappointed. Yet, if you can bear with a slow pace of the game and want to piece the engrossing story while traversing creepy locations, you might want to try this.			"

												I just finished the game, and I have to say, this is one instance where the game critics got it right and the general gaming public has it dead wrong. The game received mostly positive, if not quite as much as much as the original, reviews, where the things missed from the original were pointed out but on its own terms were able to recognize it for its merits and what it tried to do. Judging by the negative reception from fans of the original, it would seem as though everyone was wanting ""Teleporting Naked Guys,"" a now-infamous jumpscare used incessantly by numerous Amnesia custom stories and are upset they didn't get that.So, no, it is in many respects not similar to the original game at all. But I disagree that this should not have been called an Amnesia title. It very much is a continuation of the universe established by the original and follows the atmospheric vision of the first game, albeit in a different direction. Some of the complaints I read are either exaggerated, missing the point or things I would not consider things that hamper the experience at all.First, the complaints regarding the gameplay: Chinese Room done dumbed it down! It is now a straight line from point A to B, they got rid of the sanity meter, inventory, the need to constantly refill your lantern, they screwed Amnesia up royally! First of all, yes, the game is very linear, but so was the original Amnesia, which itself had plenty of locked doors, clearly marked paths and limited exploration. Granted, I'll admit this is more linear, but not to the degree the complaints have read, I was actually surprised how much extraneous stuff there was to explore considering the criticisms. The mansion in the beginning, for instance, does indeed have mostly locked doors but there are other bedrooms and bathrooms to look around in, which don't serve to advance the game but to provide some texture for the setting. There were enough times where I found there was a path ahead of me, but also other paths I didn't check, and so made to sure to look at everything. Sometimes these lead to dead ends, sometimes an area where a new document can be found, and sometimes, yes, something important you need in order to keep going. Maybe it was a matter of expectations, and had they been different my attitude would change, but expecting literally a linear path with nothing on the side I found that far to be from the case here.The ""dumbed down"" elements. Well the first Amnesia wasn't necessarily a complex game to begin with, so the streamlining I don't think affects anything much really. Retiring the sanity meter I think was for the better. It was a nice mechanic in the original, but this isn't the same character, the same scenario. Tinderboxes, oil, this is not an environment designed around that, getting rid of it is fine with me, and taking out inventory is fine too, seeing how the inventory in the original was limited to either those survival items, or pieces needed to attach to machinery (that aspect is here, except now you have to carry it), or keys. If it isn't needed, then don't put it in. As much as I did love those aspects of Amnesia TDD I'm glad that this isn't just a complete rehash.""But,"" people say, ""they don't replace those things with anything interesting of their own."" I'd say it's more like they didn't replace it, because there was no need to. It still plays great, with decent if not completely brain-bending puzzles, and is also a game that looks great, especially for an indie title made to run on low-end hardware (like mine, although I will say I ran into frequent crashes between level transitions and had to constantly tinker with the settings up and around until I found a configuration that would let me in to the next level. ""Save and exit"" became quite the companion of mine), there are still plenty of interesting, sometimes unsettling sights, and the levels, especially as it nears its end, are quite spectacular to behold. I also must say I thought this had a better story than the original. Certain elements were predictable, but the way they were executed was what mattered. The first game's story had a couple of interesting twists, but mostly if you knew your Lovecraft you knew where the game was headed. The story here is more unusual, if confusing. The notes you pick up, describing some downright graphic and disturbing things with terrible implications about your character and the machine in question here, do shed light on the situation, but they are out of chronological order as you pick them, and not all of them are written by the same character, only context helping you figure that out, and as you discover the identity of the mysterious voice calling you, things take a turn for the downright weird and possibly apocalyptic. There is also a touch of sadness in the story as well. I won't spoil anything, but you'll arrive on that conclusion well enough. And also some careful observations about your surroundings during certain areas late in the game lend an identity to the pig monsters that is downright tragic.Oh, yeah, how scary is it? Many people say, not at all. Sometimes their entire reason for giving the thumbs down to this game is because it isn't ""scary."" This is what frustrates me most. To me, horror encompasses a wide spectrum of elements, just freaking you out is just one such thing. Dismissing horror automatically for not being scary and not looking at what else it tries to do is just short-sighted. A pure, enveloping atmosphere is most important to any kind of horror, the implications can be scarier than the experience, what DID or what WILL happen scarier than what IS happening, and so on. No, there are no freakish monstrosities in this game like the ever-beloved slack-jawed grunt of the original Amnesia. No, there aren't as many panic-laden chases through the dark until you find a nice closet space to hide. No, again, there is no sanity meter that you must keep on a tight balance. There are several sections where you must sneak past or run away from a pig monster, though they are fairly brief, and obviously a pig humanoid doesn't look quite as scary as the ""servants"" from the original. The water monsters are back, though the one scene you must run from them is also brief and not on the same level of sheer panic induced by the first game. But, to me, that is perfectly fine, the game I say is just as effective a horror game, but in a different way. I still thought the atmosphere of dread and detail in the dark, decrepit environments was as present as always, and the fear of a monster coming out any moment as well. But little things, like the lantern flickering to alert you to a monster, putting you in full panic mode (much more tense than if they were to cheaply teleport and scream in front of your face), the pig masks that constantly appear, the loud background squeal of pigs, all made for a nerve-wracking experience. But it's more the Machine itself, the things you read you and it have done, that disturb the most. It's Upton Sinclair by way of H.P. Lovecraft and it's quite staggering.Is it as good as the original? Maybe the original left a stronger effect on me, but these are two different games with their own merits. This is still a strong experience I'd recommend to anyone who doesn't have such limiting expectations.			"

												<First of all I recommend you play Amnesia:The Dark Descent before playing this>Despite the fact AAMFP is a ""sequel"" to ATDD I find them in no way similar as far as gameplay, setting, and characters go.AMFP was designed to focus more on the details of the story and setting rather than the scares from the creatures you encounter, which is why it is one of my favorite horror games. The blunt truth is that ATDD was designed for the scares and only the scares which is why many Dark Descent veterans (such as myself) found AMFP very different than TDD. Here are some examples.1) Physical Scares2) Lack of custom stories3) Very different environments/monsters4) CharactersSince AMFP has no custom story option many such as myself play the game once and never launch it again, which is actually fine. AMFP is truely a masterpiece and I recommend the game to anyone who has played the dark descent or other horror games.9/10 "

												I think it could be a good game if they didn't have the Amnesia name to it, it just has too much to live up to. Lack of inventory means puzzles consist of ""carry this thing to the other room"". Electric lights and infinite-battery lantern kinda ruin the dark creepy atmosphere. And the monster (maybe there's more but I only got to one) feels more like something tedious to avoid than something actually scary. Maybe I'll give it more of a shot later, but as is, it's really disappointing compared to the first Amnesia.			"

												As I descended the lift towards the heart of the machine, it was nothing like I imagined. It was far more terrifying.I truly enjoyed this game. However, there is no denying that 'A Machine for Pigs' is not as strong as its predecessor. The puzzles are far too simple, necessary only for maintaining an added level of interaction with the world. And, there aren't as many 'risky' moment.In addition to this, a lot of gameplay elements from 'The Dark Descent' have been removed. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. The removal of many of these elements augments the game's focus on exploration. However, those elements are part of what made the puzzles in 'The Dark Descent' so strong, and the dangerous moments all the more frightening. And there are no new elements to bring everything together.That being said, there are many moments where 'A Machine for Pigs' shines. The atmosphere, created through the carefully crafted environment, nearly stands on its own. Surprisingly, the lack of enemies sharply increases the anxiety; Imagination is potent.The story is the strongest part of the game, arguably stronger than the original. 'The Dark Descent', while truly a masterpiece, told a story that was very cold and distant. In 'A Machine for Pigs', the story is uncomfortably, very human. Love and compassion are at the core of this story, at the heart of an impending madness. Painted sharply is a potent picture, not just about society, but also about people.As good as the story is, the use of complex words and language often makes it difficult to follow at times (I must admit that the use of this type of language is a perfect match for Mandus). However, the story shines during the moments that simple language is used in a precise and clever way, leading to some horrific revelations.'The Dark Descent' is a game where all elements came together perfectly, something that happens rarely, something that 'A Machine for Pigs' does not achieve. Despite this, I enjoyed it tremendously. For me, it is a worthy successor to Amnesia.			"

												Although the lore, story, horror elements and gameplay are not as strong as its predecessor, ""A Machine for Pigs"" does offer a good (albiet watered-down) entry into the Amensia series. The environment is a nice change from ""A Dark Descent"", and is generally as good if not better than the dreary castle of the previous installment. Despite the great setting, the puzzles throughout the mansion, streets, engine rooms, sewers and complexes are essentially wheel-turners and lever-pullers.Throughout the game, the notes and dialog honestly do a mediocre job at revealing the interesting world that you explore, leaving a lot of seemingly important things to the imagination, which can be a good thing but I don't think works well here. For every question answered, two more seem to open up. The monsters here are not as effective as they are in ""A Dark Descent"", essentially only giving us a few dangerous encounters. Even those encounters seem forced and almost cinematic. The plus side here is that the manpigs do fit the story of this game, and work well in conjuncture with the thematic ""Industrial-Aztec-Sacrifice-Meat"" elements of the game.Although my review might seem negative, this game still delivers a short yet sweet atmospheric horror stealth-adventure with decent lore and good imagery. I would suggest ""A Dark Descent"" over this game, but I think this still warrants a discounted purchase and playthrough if you're into atmospheric story-driven horror games.			"

												As an amnesia fan I am dissapointed in this game.This review is so late (insert joke here)Lets cut to the chase.Gameplay (6/10):The gameplay is more boring than scary, you will find yourself scrambling around the place looking for secrets and flying through closets and hidden walls like in the orignal amnesia game. In the orignal amnesia you used a lantern and you needed to constantly be on your toes so you can find OIL, once you ran outta oil you were so screwed that Chuck Norris couldn't save you. Now in this game you have a Flashlight, well what are the cons of the flashlight? What happens when you run out of battery. Well here is the awnser. Nothing! You just keep the flashlight you don't need battery or oil or some sort of thing. You just have a flashlight. A cool thing about it is that it flickers when monsters are nearby.. *ahem* ""Monsters"" which are all pigs, just pigs. nothing else but a bunch of pigs. Monster pigs.For fans of the old Amnesia games, if you buy this game the first words that you will say as you start up the game and see the main menu is, ""Where the ♥♥♥♥ are the custom stories!?"". Well there are stories but you need the first game in order to play them because all it does is just transfer all the models and stuff from 'A machine for pigs' and puts em' in the first damn game.GRAPHICS DERP DERP DERP I can't judge them yet because I havent played in a while.Killstreaks (0/10)I outran 5 zambie pigs and got no care package, like wtf.Also where is freedy banie n cheeka, i thi du fnv 4!!!!Bad game dont purchseakda			"

												This game is, fundamentally, a waste of time. It's superficially similar to The Dark Descent, but in its attempts to streamline the formula it ends up removing much of what made its predecessor so engaging. The story is competently written and presented, but the gameplay is very shallow and requires little more from the player than walking down corridors and occasionally solving a simple puzzle in order to continue. Gone is the resource and physical/mental health management from the first game, and gone too is the open structure of the environment. There is no scope for exploration in A Machine for Pigs, as its world is far more linear than The Dark Descent's castle. On a related note, monster encounters are similarly underwhelming. While Brennenburg Castle's monsters didn't actually pose much of a long-term threat, the pigmen of London are unable to match their Dark Descent counterparts in providing even the illusion of danger. All in all, A Machine for Pigs is a half-baked successor to what was, by all accounts, a refreshingly tense and atmospheric survival horror game. It might be worth a go if it's cheap and you're interested in experiencing a macabre story about industrial horror, but otherwise it not only brings nothing new to the table but in fact removes things that were already there.

												This game.oh my god this game.Don't think of it as a sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent (which is also amazing), but rather a new experience in the same universe.TDD was an absolutely frightening affair which was at times hard to play if you scare at all easily, but this is a whole other beast. Its monsters aren't as instantly unsettling, it's chases aren't the same speed, frequency or volume, and if you don't pay attention it could easily be just a few hours in a kind of spooky building.But this game is utterly terrifying. If you really pay attention, listen to the words, read the letters, hell, do some research, get on the message boards, there is a lot going on here. The Chinese Room is not only proving to be a very able development house, but one of the smartest videogame developers out there.  There's a lot of Lovecraftian games out there, but this is the only one that scares me as deeply as anything Lovecraft actually wrote. It's poignant, beautiful, seductive, manipulative, fever-inducing madness. If you just want a good scare, it's not bad at all. If you want to experience a story, it's absolutely brilliant.			"

Its sequel A Machine For Pigs, takes that and raises us pristine dialogue, more outside areas, and challenging puzzles. A Machine For Pigs shows us why The Chinese Room is the master of modern dialogue. A story reveling in its political and religious undertones, tackling issues such as greed, consumption, and revenge.			"

												This indirect sequel to the number one horror game ""Amnesia: The Dark Descent"" is outstanding. Developed by ""The Chinese Room"" and published by ""Frictional Games"" this game is absolutely horrifying and will chill you to the bone. ""Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs"" is a must-have for anyone who enjoy's the horror genre. 10/10!			"

 A Machine For Pigs differs greatly from  The Dark Descent to say the least.  It retains many similarities, but it takes on a completely different attitude.  When I began playing this sequel, I was expecting it to be so much more similar to the first  Amnesia title; however, I was soon to discover that the developers had created a completely new game with new intentions.  I found  A Machine For Pigs to be much more enjoyable than it's predecessor precisely becuase of the simplifications that were made, the largest of which is the removal of the inventory.The removal of such elements does not serve to make the game less enjoyable by any means---it makes the game so much less intimidating and so much less aggravating.  Even so, the game does tend to feel a bit like a walking simulator at times, which is not a terrible thing.  However, I still have the same problem that I have with  The Dark Descent:  the story seems like it would require one too many playthroughs to increase your understanding of it enough so that you can confidently say that you understand it.  It's definitely cool and definitely disturbing, but its delivery makes it challenging to accurately follow.  But hey, nothing wrong with a challenge. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is very good and genuinely frightening.  Fans of the first game will probably still enjoy it as I did, but if you're wanting a game that is exactly like the previous one, you're out of luck in many areas.  An awesome game that sits proudly on the first-person horror shelf.			"

												Finally a sequel brave enough to right the wrongs of its progenitor by completely removing both puzzles and enemies.			"

												Really wanted to like this game. Really did. That's not saying it's not a GOOd game, it's just i don't like it. Everything just seemed so off. Yeah, it's made by a different company then the first, yeah it has very basic ties to the first, but it's just nothing like it. The whole time iI was playing I tried to get myself in, immerse myslef, but I just couldn't. Whether it was all the jump scares one after another, or the fact that the atmosphere really didn't pull me in, or that I couldn't get myself to care about the story at all. WHether crawling the streets to get to the next building, or avoiding the{spoiler]piggies[/spoiler] nothing felt right. It's a good game. I recamend it despite myself not being able to enjoy it. because it does have it's moments.			"

												I sadly found this game dissapointing. While Amnesia featured really scary monsters, lots of physics and multiple endings, a machine for pigs takes a huge♥♥♥♥♥♥on all of that.The Physics? Gone. You can barely pick up objects. The only objects you can really pick up are objective specific ones. The monsters? Didn't scare me one bit. Probbably because they were pigs, and sounded like pigs. The story? Laughable and I found it quite stupid. Multiple endings? Nope.Get Amnesia: A Dark Descent. This sequel wasn't as good as the original. Its like Star Wars. Its really awesome at the begging, but then it goes all Jar Jar Bings on itself. Kinda like Star Wars.I was already expecting to give this a negative review due to the fact that it wasn't developed by Frictional Games, but by TheChineseRoom.			"

												The sad thing concerning Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, is that your appreciation of the game might be entirely based on your previous experience of Amnesia: The Dark Descent (or lack of) I expected the second Amnesia to be a ""same but different"" kind of survival mystery / horror game. And it was not. No real pressure is put on the player in this game (except at the end).  No oil or sanity management. No terrifying enemies. It seems that many things has been toned down to lift up the story.So. Is the story good ? Well, it's decent. It's disturbing at best. There is so much foreshadowing that you can figure out the whole thing (but that's good planting nonetheless). Most of it is told though notes, voice recordings, memory recalls, voice over and telephone... Unfortunately, I did'nt relate to the character and the thin gameplay wasn't helping.Except the sheer size of the ""machine"", there is to few intriguing level design. The puzzle are not always related to the plot. All in all, I found myself cruising through the level and reaching the end. Hopefully, the game was short enough to let me enjoy another one.			"
