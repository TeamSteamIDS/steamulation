												DisclaimerThis is a review from an Ex-Developer (Lead mapper for over 4+ years) who started development on the game well before the Kickstarter Campaign, before Early Access and worked all the way through to release and after to talk about my experiences with the company throughout my run here. This review in no way reflects upon the majority of the team, who are just doing as told but is more aimed at what went wrong and the ones responsilbe for the state of the game as it is today as well as how a large part of the community has been treated. Read one of the 9,000 other reviews if you want more specifics about the game and the gameplay.ReviewI've waited a long time to write a review on the very game I spent 4 years of my life working on. So why am I writing it now? Because I can no longer stand behind Tatsur0 and how he manages his own community, let alone the (non) managing of the game itself. Never have I seen a more hands-off approach in my life. I hope you guys understand he is not a developer. He might have been at one point, but not anymore. It seems instead of making games, he plays them now. ;) I couldn't count the number of times I have seen someone being utterly disgusted by how they've been treated both on the forums or reading the comments on the various reviews. It's just saddening. As one of the ex-devlopers it always hurt me to see people treated that way and how a lot of things have been so poorly dealt with, either it being the communication towards the community or just very poor decisions that have been made during active development.I take the communities experience and reaction incredibly personal because it feels that my own integrity as a developer and an artist has been dragged through the mud and I never have been able to really find an outlet and express how I feel or have felt. This review will be the last thing I will ever write about Contagion and I do it because I believe people should be aware as to what kind of developer they're spending their money on.Another reason I have held off for so long is simply because I feel that I put my own reputation on the line by turning against my ex-employer but I will say this. I do not hold grudges and I never ever speak ill of anyone. But when you spent this long on a project and devoted countless hours while neglecting your emediate family. My daughter was born during Early Access and I have been slaving away all the way up to release and missed a lot of that period that I can never get back.There's also another important reason I held back writing a review and that simply is that it's not fair towards the other guys that are still there. They work hard and they're cool guys and I just feel bad that this is the company they're stuck with. I hope by writing this ""review"" people will understand that only one person is responsible for the questionable reputation Contagion and Monochrome are finding themselves in right now.So, let's talk about the actual game. During Early access and on release I would say this game was amazing. The original dev team was so passionate about the game that's where I believe the success came from. Player zombies are pretty cool and I do find that they're certainly not underpowered. So many times I've killed an entire team by being sneaky. If you play patiently it's quite easy to catch one or two off guard. But it works both ways, players have such a fair chance to kill a PZ, just use your 911.The game has a few game modes, Escape, Extraction, Hunted and Flatline. Flatline came out after I was out off the projectso I never really played it. I'm not a fan of hunted much but I do think Escape and Extraction are a lot of fun and quite well balanced. Especially the maps I made, hurr durr. ;PI still remember when we were working on Extraction. I was working on suburbs at the time and getting the map ready for PAX Prime. It was the first time anything I made was ever put out there. The first time people would play something I made by large and I was nervous as heck. But I still remember how I felt when the game mode was playable for the first time. It was amazing, the thrill and the fun we had during that period was something you just cannot experience anywhere outside of development. When everyone's hard work comes together and you have so much enthausiasm going into it.When I joined RPD was quite far along in terms of alpha gameplay. I was blown away by it and it's still one of the best coop experiences out there. Barlowe Square was my answer to RPD. But I honestly don't think I could go through a development cycle like that again. That map took a toll on me for a short while but it was worth it.And then release happened. Well, if it wasn't for the technical part that where the game was officially released you wouldn't know it. I really wish I could get into this more detailed but I won't. All I will say is that this is where the momentum stopped dead in it's tracks. Big mistakes were made and it resulted in not being picked up by any of the larger review sites. No one was talking about it and this is where everythins started to stagnate. From active development to the community and beyond. It was a huge blow for us but helped us put things into perspective.And that's the sad part about Contagion. The way that development stagnated after the original team left. The game never became what it potentially could and this is something I also want to warn players against. It's just not finished. There are still numerous bugs that have been around since forever and I feel that's just bad decision making to not adress these.I also think that not having a lobby system at this point is unacceptable. I don't really know what this could change so long after release but I know it's rumored to be in the works, so I hope for those who play it, that it will come out not too long from now.I know this review most likely will be viewed as biased, or maybe giving the impression that I'm just sour about certain things that happened, and I won't lie, I am. But this is the most honest review I can offer without going into any in details. I just hope that whoever reads this will make an informed decision in buying the game or not. So, as I said this is the last thing I will write about the game. I had fun times and bad times, I just wish that in the end I could've been proud of it instead of having this bad taste at the back of my mouth... Please, just don't hold it against the other devs working on this game, only one person has the final say and that dictates the outcome of this product and it's updates.			"

												Ok so- I own this game. I have owned it a while. I enjoy it. But there's a ton of people posting negative reviews for stupid reasons. Up to and including: - Shooting zombies is very ineffective unless it's the head (Yes someone actually posted this).  I think too many people compare it to Left 4 dead and other similar games and it's a different experience. People also are complaining about the devs responses, when they leave up posts calling thier game outright trash, ect. ect. . I enjoy coop games, I really enjoyed SWAT 4, I enjoy Left 4 Dead, Payday, and I enjoy this. That being said here's a realistic pro / con list for you:Pro-Co oP is fun-  You need to share ammo. You need to share weapons. Health kits are super rare and you have to arbitrate who they go to.  You have to work together. -Immersion-  Rage zombies were never my thing. Nothing against them but to me the slow shambling ones are the way it's done. If your a fan of oldschool zombie movies- There ya go. It's got that feel to it. Voice acting-A lot of work went into this. It's not stellar by any means but there are two radials with different sayings for most of them. Top that off the characters will be louder or quiet based on certain factors (If the person is crouching or havent done any movements yet - the voice of character will be quieter than usual. If character took a shot or someone near by shot - they will speak loud. They will also speak loud when they were running for quite long time or there is action going on).  If someone goes down, they become a zombie and can call the horde and hunt down thier former friends. I always had a lot of fun with it and it helps with the immersion which is a big thing in games for me.-Modes-There are a fair number of modes for this game. I look at some of the games coming out nowadays like Evolve (Don't get me wrong I enjoy it, I play it, but it was too much for what it was) that are essentially one game mode stretched to thin. The same could be said about a lot of games, some would say it about this one, but at least they tried. I tested some of the other ones, none were as much fun as coop. Con-The graphics are dated-    This isn't a deal breaker for me but it is for a lot of people ""OMARGAWRD THUR GRUAFAX"".-The Co-op is unintuitive-    It's true, there's not going to be any Left 4 Dead highlighting of objectives. You have a cell phone that you check that tells you where to go / what to do. You have to actually figure it out for yourselfs, i.e. where the basement is, where the helipad (the roof) is, and so on. To the devs, this would really be my only gripe. Some things are easy to figure out, others can feel absurd. Play the police station and try finding keys the first time, you'll probably get the idea. I had friends drop this game just based on the fact they were tired of running around, sometimes dying because we couldn't find some objective. If you intend on playing coop, and new to the map- look up a guide of the map. You'll thank me. I'm not saying the Dev's should implement highlights, but something a little more informative with messages would vastly improve this game imho.-Not really a SinglePlayer Experience-  The story will be the same regardless, nothing grandiose. Just the same mission or surviving alone. This game is meant to be played with friends. I have heard that there are griefers online, and people have complained about it in the reviews. There are griefers in any multiplayer experience. It's not the dev's fault. Seen it in Ark, Seen it in Payday, Seen it in Left 4 Dead, Seen it- You get the idea. Hell any survival game with limited resources is begging to be griefed. So- Play with friends if it bothers you, or find a good coop server. I have personally never had the issue of running into griefers on this as of yet, but have only played on online servers a handful of times. Those times I did, people were greedy with ammo, and weapons, but didn't grief.All this being said, I would reccommend this game. There's still some things that could be added that could improve it, but if you're a fan of old school zombie movies like I am, then get it. Maybe wait till it goes on sale if the price tag is too high for you, but worse case scenario - If you don't like it well good news everyone steam has a return policy now. But play it with friends. All games are more fun that way, especially this one.			"

Posted: October 31, 2014
												I've played this game on and off and I feel like its time for a review after spending some of my time on this game.Summary:This is just your typical cliche zombie survival game where your basic objective is to survive (Duh!). You select from a handful of characters to decide who you want to be and go straight to business; shooting zombies and people. There are different modes in the game in which you can play: Escape, hunt, and extract.Escape:This is the primary mode that this game was probably built for. It is purely PvE where players come together to find a way out of a selected environment. There are different difficulties to test your skills in both individual and team gameplay. What I found really unique and interesting in this mode was that everytime you played it, it was always some what different every run. Your pathing to the ending of each map was usually different and this somewhat made the game mode fresh everytime. What I found to be a failure in this mode was that the ending of escape was always the same and my incentive to play again was minimal. There are no rewards for completing and it gets really repititive. Basically all you did was shoot zombies, find objectives, and get out. Another thing was how it could be absurdly difficult at times. Although this was also a reason as to why it was somewhat fun, a lot of the time you would find yourself back tracking to find missing objectives or paths to work your way to the end, all the while wasting ammo on zombies because you had no choice. Another thing was that players could turn into zombies if they were attacked or dead. I could see how dead players who turned to zombies could potentially create a left 4 dead PvP scene where teamwork is key, but the problem is that zombie players could single-handedly wipe out a whole team of players because thats just how strong and difficult a zombie player is to handle (I literally just walk in zig zags and no one could kill me and I would just kill them in like 5 hits). This adds to frustration of playing this mode as if looking for objectives while fighting AI zombies wasn't already a chore. My suggestion would to make this purely PvE and leave PvP for hunt and extract, which I will discuss about next.Hunt:If all you want to do is walk around and shoot people or be a zombies and kill people, this is the mode for you. It is purely PvP. Everyone starts out with a basic secondary weapon (handgun) and melee weapon and have to search for weapons that can be found in various areas across a map. While doing so, players will encounter eachother and kill eachother. But again, it can feel repetitive as the sole purpose of this mode is to just walk around killing eachother (Of if you like the classic camping you can do that too)  till the round ends with only 1 survivor or the round times out.Because of how the mode is set up to end, players are basically encouraged to actually camp if they want to win. This can really ruin the fun as some people play it for the action and interactions between finding eachother. You could go AFK in a basement and win the round by doing literally nothing because while you decided to sit like a scared child, other people were actually playing the mode as how it was supposed to be played; by finding and killing eachother. You will find out yourself about how the community may react to you camping if you decide to play this game/mode.Extract:This mode is probably one of the least favorable modes in the game. What you do is work as a team to find AI survivors and rescue them to a safe point. Although this sounds potentially challenging or fun, it is again very boring and repititive (in my opinion,  of course). There is no real goal in this mode because once you rescue the AIs, you are back to square one; Finding and saving AI's again. You will eventually find yourself leaving the game rooms as you die from zombies and ultimately boredom.Music/Sounds:What really shines, in my opinion, is the music and sounds of the game. It is very high quality and really fits the overall theme of the game. It creates an eerie feeling to the game when playing and is what really drew me into the game's atmosphere. Voice acting is great as well, although most of these characters are abit too grumpy and mad (For good reason probably).Graphics:The graphics in this game are good if not great. Theres really nothing bad to say about the graphics... Besides sometimes I would enter servers where the game was all choppy at times and looked like I was playing an 8-bit game with low FPS. Other than that, graphics meet basic/standard expectations.Weapons:There are plenty of guns/weapons in this game. Honestly, depending on which weapon you have, alot of them are pretty similar in terms of effectiveness. Although you'll probably find  some guns to be a lot weaker and useless compared to others ( F****** colt), it isn't really an issue to the game.Characters:The handful of characters as I mentioned in the beginning of the review, all have the same value in the game. There is no OP or weak character, it is all preference of how you want to look. Sadly, I would have prefered to be able to customize my own character or let the characters available to have stats so that it would fit people's preferred playstyles. In this game's case, your best bet is to be the black guy (No racism intended) because he best blends into the night and camouflages very well in PvP.Conclusion:   6.5/10 RatingUltimately, what really brought Contagion down is the repititiveness of the game. The replay value of this game is really low, as I have dropped and picked up this game on and off over the year, only playing it every few times a month when I was really bored. Content is slow to release and while there is a steam workshop for this game, there isn't much it has to offer because this game lacks strong popularity within the zombie fan community. You will find yourself picking up this game for about the first hour or so, and then immediatly dropping it if you have no friends to play with.Thanks if you actually read this long review. Although it seems like im not recommending this game at all, surely it is not the case. This game did have its great and fun values. But it only hit me ever so softly, and I feel that it can be fixed.Is it worth trying this game? Yes definitely, but get ready to drop it.Is it worth the money? No, I would recommend buying it on sale.TL;DR:  This game can be fun, but gets boring and repititive too quickly to really be worth its costs. I would still recommend trying it though if you can get it at a low price.			"

												I have been a long term Contagion gamer so feel qualified to write a fairly unbiased review. TL;DR Each of the reviews you see below praising the game but critcising the developers are accurate.  It is that simple.  Also, team killing is rife which completely destroys the gameplay and forces individuals to use the easier non-TK servers which quickly become boring.  The developers have also taken no action against the numerous trolls who use certain choke points in the levels to ensure that gamplay is stopped.   The game community is almost completely extinct largely due to the developers shocking attitude to their customers. LR;  When I first started playing Contagion last year the Developers were embroiled in a lengthy update process.  The community was disnechfranchised including certain individuals who had supported via Kickstarter and were still waiting on rewards.  I decided to let that slide and decide for myself.The gameplay is good with tense moments and very acceptable graphics using the CS engine.  To the developers credit some of the levels are huge, the biggest in the Steam library by some estimates.  Nice use of fire and shadow makes for interesting human versus zombie battles. Once killed a human player becomes a zombie and must attack and kill/turn the remaining human survivors.  However this creates a unique dynamic because once killed you drop your weapons and ammo.  Players naturally want certain weapons or more ammunition and team kill individuals to get it which forces the majority of the community to use non-TK servers which are far easier to beat because the zombies and objectives are easier to achieve with more abundant ammo.   Zombies are blessed with the ability to track humans, summon NPC zombies and direct zombie hordes.   Quite often the zombie players win if they are experienced and know how to ambush.  However if the humans are experienced then becoming a zombie is chore because the humans bunch at choke points...due to the fact that once a zombie is killed a certain number of times they become a spectator to the game.  So experienced players simply find an alley/corridor and wait.  They kill zombie attackers over and over forced into the alley until they become spectators then continue with the objectives.   The only way to win is hope that a new player is within the crowd and will make a mistake leading a gap in the team. Because of the dev attitude, the team killing and the trolling, the game's user base has dwindled and you will often see the same 10-20 people hopping between servers some of which alleviate their boredom through trolling the levels to make them uncompletable.  Examples include stopping people from using critical elevators or preventing NPC characters from being rescued by leading them away from the exit zones. Unofrtunately the user base has also dwindled in part due to the shocking attitude of the developer Tatsur0.  I had read numerous reviews on Steam and on the gaming press about his attitude to paying customers but disregarded them.  However as the updates dragged out from weeks to months to over 9 months it was hard to accept his constant refutations to customers.   In the end a bug-riddled update was issued with new maps but missing promised weapons, skins and game modes which are apparently ""coming soon"".  The developer response on the forums is always ""I promise nothing"" and ""Go play other games.""  People who criticised the developers were continually banned whilst trolls and team killers cannot be dealt with unless you supply video-evidence to the developers. During my supportive period I even wrote a lengthy strategy for the developers (I have launched several apps and work in App Development) about how to really engage the audience during updates and prevent users leaving.  It was so well received some of the gamers even said I should be hired.   The post was ignored with a response ""We don't have time to do any of that stuff.""   I shrugged that off and continued to pour time into the forums and the game.  My decision to exit the game came after Tatsur0 refused to acknowledge the fact that Windows 10 renders the game unplayable (no sound, stuttering).   After I flagged this and asked how many users were planning to take advantage of the free Windows upgrade my topic was flagged as spam (under the heading ""Not relevant to Contagion"") and the response was ""Users know we don't support Windows 10 so Valve handle refunds.""  I cannot in good faith recommend that new users devote any kind of time to a game whose community has almost disappeared despite being a pretty good game.  I honestly hope the Developers learn how to deliver a better customer service experience to the community that keep them in business.			"

												First, I have to say that this game could be awesome. But in fact, it's ""just"" really good. It clearly doesn't deserve that amount of bad reviews. You just need to train yourself in the solo play mod.Alright, this game  got a complete unbalance in all subject. I will told you the pros and cons [even the neutrals] from this game. Better make a list :Pros :+ Really good graphism [considering it uses the Source Engine].+ Character concept and particular stories.+ Weapons choice.+ Sound quality and nice soundtrack.+ Extraction gamemod.+ Splitscreen available [another controler, execpt the keyboard, required].+ Workshop.+ Steam cards and badges.+ Voice acting [considering the budget they had to do it].+ Add-ons very good compatibility.+ Zombies health which requires to shot at the skull everytime.+ Escape gamemod.+ Extraction gamemod survivors auto-debug if they're stuck in a wall or an object.+ Realism.Neutrals :~ Phone [realistic but causes map bugs in Aurora Extraction].~ Tips [they're not useless, but they could be better].~ Extraction gamemod survivors pathfinding, speed and aiming.~ Doors and fences system.~ Character handling.~ Somewhat expensive, you'd better wait for the Steam Sales.Cons :- No specific tips for the players making their very first game.- No online teamwork [as this game requires].- Riot Police zombies. ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)- System temperatures.- Gameplay bugs [survivors stuck into shelves....].- Phone map massive bug during splitscreen in extraction.- Badly programed ladders.- Very hard to handle melee weapons.- Zombies' exaggerated hits anticipation against the players.- Teamwork isn't possible considering you become a zombie when you die.- Achievements difficulty.TL;DR : Do not leave this game after playing a few seconds, it requires to play a lot of time to understand the engine, the bugs and usefull tips to win a game. I only play in splitscreen with a friend or in the solo mod. You should really play the solo for atleast 15 hours to train yourself and understand the subtlety of every game mod.Thanks for the ones that read till the end. Here have a hug.

												This is a draft review, I'll rewrite this word-hurricane later, treat it like a blueprint.The game is late by about 8 years in terms of graphics, animations, gameplay and just about anything else you could name. It costs about $20, but for that you get about 3 coop maps and... 3-4 PvP maps. That's it! The game modes do not differ greately, except the coop ones of which there are two and they get boring rather quickly. Maps do change, but the routes are easily remembered, there are about three variations for each coop map, but if you ask me an occaisonally open door that was closed before does not make much of a difference, the tasks are varied but like I said only change twice or thrice per map.But this isn't even the biggest problem. The worst flaw of the game is what is meant to be its selling point. The devs have made the multiplayer system so difficult and broken it is impossible to join your friends server (trust me I've spent 4 days trying every single solution on forums). The only way to do so is to download third-party programs like Hamachi and I have no intention to do that since I've had less problems joining in a 1999 System Shock 2. The devs are aware of this problem, but they don't want to fix it. Trust me, as I have spoken to them and they say they are denying any bit of constructive criticism. I think they are hinting at that ""rent a server"" feature instead. Pay-to-play? No thanks. And if you don't want a server and just want to play with your friends, be aware that numerous people will join as zombies 5 minutes before your escape in a 30 minute map and eat you and your friend alive, and they will pick your server out of about 500 empty ones available, yeah the community is nice too. (A link to the discussion: http://steamcommunity.com/app/238430/discussions/7/540743212111472871/)This game is in development hell, essentialy you are buying about 5%-10% of what is promised. For this price, there has to be something like 50% more weapons, a campaign mode, 15-20+ maps, a working multiplayer, less bland characters that only differ slightly in voice and hand textures. But more than that, it should be somewhat playable because the balance is broken hopelessly (I'm talking about coop, since nobody buys these games for PvP), three guys vs. three zombies is an impossibility. In fact, one zombie player against 5 survivors gives the zombie about 70% chance of winning, as I have never seen zombies lose unless it's near the very end of the map. The maps are confusing, the directions are seriously broken, people spend 30 minutes trying to fight off zombies looking for an escape truck just to find it half-way through the map in a random detour.""Realistic"" zombie games were the talk of early 00's and many mods were made for a number of them, some were free and more complete than this. If it came out then as a mod, I'd download it and spend maybe two nights for fun, but to pay for something like that in 2014 - no thanks.The fact is, the game is hopelessly overpriced and late and devs need a reality check. It has no point and no outstanding feature, you begin to wonder as to what the actual point of makiing it was. It isn't realistic enough to be the Arma of zombie games, it's not arcade enough to be for ♥♥♥♥♥ and gigles like l4d, it doesn't have much content to brand it as something inbetween these two zombie extremes. My verdict - the game 's like a random bored zombie that won't even chase you after you poke it, you can just walk past.If you do not believe a single word I've said, look at the percentage of people that have got the easiest achievements for this game. It's in the decimals for most of them, because I'd bet this game is ""enjoyed"" mostly over LAN by devs and their friends, and anyone like myself who likes to buy random stuff and make reviews knowing even before the purchase what the game will probably be like anyway.A little edit: there is a positive review up on the site, that is more popular. It was not removed, although it is early access, unlike reviews by Mantis and other people which were outright banned. Although I might see the logic that it was perhaps, not entirely about the game and more about the attitude of the development team, they were stating an opinion and so should not be banned. I don't see the devs removing the positive Early-Access reviews, so this is hardly fair.P.S. A few months later, upon mentioning my review in another negative one focusing on developer attitude I got a friend request from the developer himself.

												Contagion had potential.  Unfortunately some of the developer's seem to have thick skulls when players are making complaints or suggesting feedback.Not only that, but I mean how long have we been waiting for this free DLC that has missed its promised release date, what, 3 times now?  Pretty sure its been going on for over a year.  I'm under the impression that there's crap for organization and these developers have their priorities elsewhere.  Don't buy this game at full price, wait until its on a 75% off sale if you want to get your moneys worth.edit: If you do purchase the game don't get your hopes up.  You'll rarely see updates or adequate dev/community communication, and you'll be playing with a dwindling/near non-existent community.			"

												At the time of writing this (11/2/2013 ), Contagion is still currently in beta form.With that being said....Contagion already outperforms most triple A title retail releases. With it's addictive game modes, dead on gameplay and rock solid servers, Contagion is already putting some life back into the into the online co-op survival horror genre laid out by classics such as Left4Dead and the Killing Floor.Running on an optimized Source engine Contagion's graphics are sharp, smooth and alive with death around every corner. From the lighting effects in the dark corridors to the reflection effects seen in mirrors, lakes and puddles the developers have created a world filled with atmosphere. Yet, the sound in Contagion is what will immediately draw you into it's world. Each echo, gunshot in the distance and glass under foot will immerse you into this adrenaline filled horror show. Each and every thing about Contagion screams instant classic!I have never written a review while a game was still in Alpha or Beta form but, the developers created an experience that I can't get enough of and I wanted to put any questions to rest as to whether or not you should purchase this now while in Beta or after the final release.Although I wouldn't consider this my final review, I will absolutely recommend Contagion to everyone here on the Steam platform. If you've never been part of a Beta release and the excitement that goes along with being a part of a successful title in the making or if you always wanted to say you were there from the beginning before everyone else jumped on the bandwagon before it became a household name.....This is your opportunity!!!I 100% recommend purchasing Contagion in Beta form or otherwise. I go as far to say you'd be crazy not to. Trust me as the title states this game is contagious!!!Contagion Beta (V2990) review 9.2/10!!!Buy this game!!!			"

												Please note that this Early Access review is not a substitute for a comprehensive bug report.Contagion is the zombie game purists have been waiting for since they first cracked open ""The Zombie Survival Guide"". For me, that's about ten years. For ten years I've waded through a horde of zombie games. Nothing emulated the raw feeling of isolation and cold that a gunshot in the distance or a scream or absolute silence can bring. We're all familiar with Brooks' original canon for zombies. Only headshots kill them. Eat flesh until they can't. Only sensory organs that have not been decayed or destroyed work. A moan causes others to moan, and they are attracted to the sound like a foghorn in the night. I never felt like I would truly find the zombie game that emulated this canon so perfectly. First there was Dead Rising - a close contender - followed by Dead Space [which opened a whole new can of worms] and Dead Island, which underperformed in basically every aspect. Left 4 Dead left a hollow feeling, mowing down thousands of zombies in a few hours seemed not worthwhile. Even DayZ left a bitter taste with its focus on player interaction and intense PVP, zombies were a secondary addition to the game and in their state of bugginess and all-out failure to function were hardly a threat to be feared for all but the newest players.Finally, though, finally. From the ashes of Zombie Panic! Source comes a developer prepared to emulate and yet transform the genre. Erasing waypoints with Google Maps on a cell phone and slaughtering the idea of overpowered zombies by balancing their frailty with disguise and scarce ammo, this game is reaching for the stars.Contagion performs in ways I never thought I would see, genuinely. It strikes feelings of sudden and intense panic, a moan can send my heart pounding in my ears, praying it would be silent so I could hear which direction the zombie was coming from. A gunshot can bring hell's fury itself down on your head, while boarding up windows and doors can buy you time to escape. Zombies' interaction with the world largely seems to be directed by line of sight and various audio cues, which gives them a shambling and confused appearance. A slight trigger can send Zack coming at you, but a bullet in the wrong place can mean a bite, and a risk of infection. Incentivized by kill count and bragging rights, a human infected is unlikely to share this information with his teammates for fear of being shot on the spot. A group of humans prepared to fight off a horde of 50+ shambling corpses can easily be dissuaded by a misaligned headshot tearing off the jaw of a zombie and inspiring panic in the squad. A misplaced shotgun round can result in legless zombies crawling under the horde and into your lines. Brutality, free-for-all, and all out panic. All of it rings true of the first days of the Zombie apocalypse, and all of it brings a warm feeling of nostalgia to my heart, and hopeful eyes for the bright future where the Zombie genre isn't filled with crafting games, 8-bit indie♥♥♥♥♥♥ and quick time events.Even the zombie player gameplay has merits. A helpfully designed ""camouflage"" button allows an inept player to disguise himself as he views his zombie in the third person and have control assumed by the AI. Moaning loudly can draw a horde, and in turn the moans of those zombies draw more, which can be lead to the human's hideouts and used to swarm them. A biting function has a high chance to infect humans, and watching your former counterparts murder each other for fear of infection in their hideout is rewarding in its own regard.I've never been so happy to realize a game was early access. After about 30-40 hours, I can easily see myself growing tired with this title and passing it into novelty, but it was well worth the 3$ spent. Call me nostalgia-blind, but there's so much potential content to see from these developers, and I'm very excited to be along for the ride. 18/10, buy this and buy it for all your friends. This game will make history, and if it doesn't, I'll eat my shoe on livestream.			"

												My opinion. The audience for contagion is and always was limited:Players today are use to tripping over ammo/health, auto save/quick save features and a minimap. Challenge frustrates/bores these types of gamers. Not saying we are all this way but there certainly is a percentage of this type. I have heard many people complain, especially on barlow and biotech escape, that the game sucks because they are not being spoon fed where to go next. Contagion involves some degree of thought and their are a number of people in this world that are unable and unwilling to use their minds. A trolls paradise:The escape game mode is one of if not the most popular game mode... and its a trolls paradise. From TKers, to Griefers, to Trolls. This completely ruins a new players experience and in many cases pushes seasoned players away also. While vote kick would be a bad solution its a very poor excuse not to have addressed this problem. There are system that could be built to improve this aspect. Even a ""report player"" option from in game would do a great deal to improve this situation... yet, here we are YEARS later and nothing has been done. The devs wont even put the current precepts for reporting a troll into an easy to create thread and sticky that thread so the community has the knowledge and tools to police itself. No friends allowed:Playing with your friends in an online co-op game should have been a major consideration but players are forced to jump though port forwarding hoops to play exclusively with their friends. This becomes an even bigger problem when a seasoned player tries to introduce a new player to the game and has no place to do it. Mix in a bit of trolling and its hard to get friends and family excited about this title. Yet again this is a problem that is just now, supposedly, being addressed after YEARS of stagnation. Poor Server DiversityThere once was a time when we had map and game mode specific servers. If you wanted to play the police station on escape hard all night long you could do that on one of the hundreds of official servers. At the time I repeatedly asked for a Biotech-Escape-Server (if even just one) I was ignored and now we have even less server diversity than we had in the past. Hundreds of servers with only slight variations. Poor Stability On both the client side and the server side this build of the game is NOT stable. Too often you get into a great game with a bunch of great players only to crash yourself or have the server crash and dump everyone. Depending on time invested at that point many players just sign off in frustration. This has been reported over and over again without any official recognition of the issue. Bugs, Bugs and more bugs. Not only are their a number of bugs... they are never addressed. With the new DLC 6 months ago there are now more bugs than ever. -Holiday content 6 months after Christmas-Poor zombie pathing, stuck zombies and dead spots -Zombies that AOE attack when agroing doors. -Zombie that hurt you through doors and-Doors that insta explode if a opened on a zombie?-Doors that get stuck partway-Sights/accessories that disappear from the Remington shotgun -Shotguns that ghost fire 2 rounds when only actually shooting one projectile. -Hang on round restart bug on some of the escape maps-Bleeding ceilings-Doors that are not able to be interacted with for seemingly no reason. -Zombies that starve to death once they get stuck-Textures and Assets that don't load correctly Now we were told that after the DLC we would return to regular updates which many of us interpreted to mean regular patches like way back in the day. This position is now said to mean regular updates as in posts but even that is not being done. GW was introduced to this community as the new voice of monochrome. He promised to update us regularly on the progress the team is making and as of today has not made a single post on progress. He is either bad at his job or their is no progress to report. Monochrome wont confirm one or the other. Bad or Lacking Mechanics-Gun bashing is worthless, it should be used as a way to either pin a single zombie or to try and keep 2 or 3 zombies at bay hoping hoping to kill a 4th before it reaches you or have players kill them while your the bait. Instead it serves to merely annoy a zombie before it hits you.-Zombies do not have weapon-specific deaths, so you don't have satisfying finishers on enemies when you use a shotgun or use certain melee weapons, They just sort of faint in slowmo after headshots.-Zombies do not try and bite you. They don't grab you, instead they just flail at you hopelessly until you die. It would have been good for a NMRiH style struggle to get a zombie off you in time, the more injured you are the more difficult it would be for a tense surprise encounter.And that leaves me to the final problem. Broken promises, twisted words, and possible lies. No one knows why contagion is not being worked on other than the developers. Its clear we are not returning to regular updates. No progress is being reported and many of us suspect they have broken their assurance that the development of Project Ageless will not affect the development of contagion. People do not like being disrespected in this manner and it has created a very negative community. One can only make positive suggestions and be ignored so many times before they just go on the attack. This feeling in the community is also driving players away.			"

So yah spend 20 dollars to play like 5 maybe 6 maps on a few different playlists. You'll get bored. The only updates on the news is about them going to game events like they are a big game industry. This game gets a 5/10 in my view.			"

												I really enjoy playing this game's multiplayer.Unfortunately, I can't. At peak hours there's next-to-no players, unless you want a 250+ ping connection to Russia or you want to join the only other one player trying to play Extraction, who will without fail always be a child with a microphone and no parental supervision.The gunplay leaves a lot to be desired; the animations are stiff and the movement is poor. The maps are very easily abused, with a number of easy-to-reach for human spots in the free-for-all mode (hunted) that make playing as a zombie post-mortem ever more unbearable. I really, really want to enjoy this game. And I did when it actually had players, forever ago. If you have friends and you can buy the 4-pack on sale, it's a blast, but if you're a solo player (like me) that wants to join random online public games, you're out of luck.			"

												(This review was written during early access beta 11/25/13)For an early access game, over all very good.Pros: mazing unique gameplay and revolutionary game modes and maps. Amazing multiplayer with 8+ slots in servers, allows maximun co-op potential. Over all impressive game, I for one am very exited to see whats next in future updates such as: new guns, maps, and game modes. Which leads me to the cons sectionCons: First of all this game is not finished, so if you can't stand bugs every now and then, then wait for the full release. But this game does have its fair share of bugs such as slight graphics and model glitches. Nothing unbearable. This game currently only has 4 maps, a hand full of guns/weapons etc. so nothing major when it comes to variety at the moment. but like i have said before, this game is definitelly not finished and is updated regularly so there will be lots more maps and weapons.My rating would be a 8.5. I would bump that up to a 9.2 when the bugs get patched and new maps and guns get added.Over all review is that I would most definitelly buy this game if your looking for a fun co-op fps/zombie survival game to play with friends and can wait for updates and put up with bugs. Keep up the good work!			"

												WARNING: DEVELOPERS FALSELY REPORTING AND FLAGGING ANY AND ALL NEGATIVE REVIEWS FOR REMOVAL!Most notoriously boring game I ever had the displeasure to buy at a sale. There's only a handful of say, 40-100 players in total playing this game and every single one you meet is an instant bandit. While the game is advertised as an ""open world roam around kind-of"" title, there's invisible walls and indestructable windows around every corner while also having every single objective be a giant clumsy obnoxious script of 1. spawn zombies and 2. make zombies walk to objective to subside people with some kind of challenge. How does this become a challenge, you ask? Well, by handicapping people's ability to navigate of course! Walking at a snail pace is an understatement because the developers have also gone out of their way to give every single character a severe case of asthma, only being physically capable of jumping maybe 3-4 times before having all organs collapse. The health system is also depressingly shallow as I have to witness personally by the first 15 seconds of me playing this game as I shot a guy in the torso 6-7 times with my pistol as he was attacking me just to get insta-gibbed as a bullet graced my head.Yes, you heard that right. Everyone spawns in with GUNS (not just pistols but rifles as well) and plenty of ammo with there being about 700 different servers to choose from while the zombies are also incredibly scarce and barely a threat, even with the constrictions being thrown at your mobility. Unless the zombies decide to pop out of nowhere and spawn in your buttocks, you will simply not find the ability to care about them. To put it short, this game is like Day Z without the scale, immersion, or the moral conflict of murdering and robbing others.But If I had to pick the worst sin of this game, It would be that there's no Halloween update. Yes, that's right. They didn't scrap enough care together to even bother squeezing in a pumpkin here and there and for that, I can only shake my head in shame as the developers are well known to PERSONALLY ban people that criticize their game on Twitter. Yup, give their game criticism and they can 'lawfully' deny you using the product you purchased on here on Steam.			"

												Note: I had given this game a negative review after playing it for about 5 or 6 hours initially.I feel this game is hit or miss as a whole; it is not for everyone. It's really important to know what kind of zombie game this is before going in a game and expecting fast paced zombie killing. It is entirely a mix of fast paced zombie shooters mixed with the occasional waiting around to hold out.If you are the type of player who enjoy constant shoot'em ups not having to worry about an ammo count and slashing your way through thousands of zombies... then go play Left 4 Dead. This game is not for you.However, if you enjoy games that require teamwork, conserving ammo, scavenging for supplies and using the limited resources around you then you should give this game a shot.I have found that the community in this game is alarmingly small, but the players have been surprisingly nice. The few that do play regularly will go out of their way to help newer players to expand and enlarge the community with more people.Every gun and melee in the game has a certain feel to it, and I guarantee there will be at least one that can cater to your liking. The zombies lack a little diversity when it comes to the aesthetics, but have pretty unique ways of moving around and sneaking up on the survivors making gameplay pretty interesting in the long run. PvP mode is available which creates an even more intense and horror-filled experience added to the gameplay.And hey, there's free DLC coming with this game soon... so that's always a plus.Paying $20 for this game still does seem a little pricey to me, the amount of content offered seems to fall a little short of the price. Maybe buy the game when it goes on sale. Contagion really favors a more strategic crowd when it comes to fighting zombies, includes mature players and pretty decent graphics for a HL2 modification overall.			"

												I rarely play co-op anything. I'm as much a loner in games as I am IRL. With that being said:This is a great great great game! I suck at FPS, like really bad, but I LOVE zombies, so I buy just about every zombie game that looks worth while. I'm disapointed with some of them, say ""meh.."" on a few. But this one is great! As previously stated, I suck, so I played it on easy mode. I was expecting to just walk through the whole thing a few times and get the hang of it before upping the skill level.Well, I discovered that this game is so well balanced that even in the easiest mode, there where still just a few more bullets available than there where undead. The only way to survive was to use everything available and creep forward slowly. You can't go on a rampage and you can't get careless or you will die.Graphically, I'm impressed. At first, I was kind of put off by the chick player characters. The Skyrim Nexus has spoiled me. However. I soon realized that it didn't matter because all you see is their hands. The environment though - beautiful.The music is stellar. It seems to flow seamlessly with what's going on in the game and it definitely sets the mood. It's that rare kind of music that you ""feel"" whether you want to or not.Zombies and items are very well placed in game even though they seem to appear in different spots each time I played a level. The stiffs can and do get the drop on you because they can be sneaky. Plus, they can climb fences quickly, crawl under things and through holes. Many times it was dead silent and I turned around in a dark room to shine my flashlight in the face of one. I think I pooped a little.The only bug I found (04NOV14), and I'll explain why I point it out, is that zombies cast shadows through walls sometimes. I am thankful for this and so are my pants. I point this out because it was the ONLY bug I found. Indi games are typically more pollished (in my experience) than major titles anyway. But this one is really, really nicely done. Not a single CTD, no magical things happening, very very very little clipping (zombies breaking down doors).. When I bought this game, I bought a finished product, and I'm thankful to the developers for that.I'll definitely be playing this game for a long time to come![To the developers] Wonderful job people! Really. If you make another game that sounds like it's even remotely up my alley, I'll buy it without question! (Even if it's not, I'll use your game to give the genere a try.)			"

The release of the Contagion SDK might change the amount of content available for this game, but right now it is seriously lacking. The description of the game on this store page just sugar coats and exaggerates everything. Initially the game itself is fun. It gets boring quickly with there only being a few maps total and even fewer co op maps. The game goes on sale for $5 sometimes, I recommend this game at that price (especially if you go into it with friends). Investigate and watch some gameplay before you take this negative review to heart, you could really like the game.			"

												A clunky zombie survival horror game with extremely delayed patches and DLC that had been promised, with numerous developers leaving the company and with a manchild developer falsely banning people from the games steam forums for expressing discontent with the games current state and the development cycle. As for the game, it is dated visually, has extremely bad movement controls, has really bad gunplay, and allows for easily exploitable maps in which most people just camp in one spot. Also, the player counts at peak times are abysmally low (lower than 50 sometimes) Avoid like the plague.			"

While the game could be so much fun, the reality looks different. Most people on the servers are too stupid to understand the gameplay mode, for example:  taking a look on the mobile and evacuate each other together would be smooth, but no, people barricade somewhere and shoot each other or empty their ammo to be eaten in the end. Shame really. There schould be more structure and goals that pop up cleary for everyone to know. As for what it is a multiplayer only game i would not recommend it based on the ppl that are playing it right now. save your bugs and get  L4D, way more fun imo			"

												Spending nearly 2 hours on a single mission, most of which is spent pixel hunting for keys or other items to progress, only to be slaughtered by a monstrous horde of zombies (because you spend more time reloading than shooting) is not fun in any way.  The flashlight looks horrible and is barely functional.  Other players' flashlights blind you for no good reason because of the poor lighting effect.  If you are in a small room (which is what 90% of the game consists of) your flashlight is as good as useless.Moving through doors is sometimes challenging because of horrible collision detection.  Shooting zombies directly in the face with a shotgun from 1 yard away can sometimes miss.Don't buy for more than a few dollars.			"

This breaks my heart because I know that a team spent many many manhours trying to make this into a cool game. I really wish it was a proper successor to ZPS. Coming from around a thousand hours in ZPS, I was attracted to Contagion's ""Escape"" mode and I played this mode the most. There are other modes, but they are generally bland copycat ""afterthoughts"" that are done better in other games. Escape is the only mode that enticed me to get Contagion. However, Escape has numerous fundamental game design flaws that permanently gimp its gameplay. To illustrate, it's best to walk through a typical Escape game:  ""Escape"" generally begins as a co-op mode with up to around 8 teammates. Initially, you're playing against only NPC zombies. However, the NPC zombies are completely boring to fight against. You either have boring citizen zombies that die to a single headshot or you have uninspiring bullet-sponge riot-armor zombies. I couldn't find any engaging strategy to defeat these bullet-sponges except repeated shots to the noggin. Therefore, the NPC zombies are more of a chore to fight through.  Even though players soon find that the NPC zombies don't post much threat, the level design, itself, will kill them (either literally or figuratively):  There are simple ""no no"" level design decisions like the the frequent use of ladders. Since Contagion is built on Source, ladders are horrific and will literally get players killed without any zombie involvement (Even Valve wisely prefers to not use ladders in Source). When I completed Camp Whitner for the first time, I was led through by an experienced player (see showstoppingly confusing level design below) and he literally stops at one point to say, ""Watch out, this ladder will kill you."" I knew how Source ladders worked and carefully navigated down the shaft. My other inexperienced teammate did not and was instakilled by fall damage. The experienced player obviously knew about the trouble from that stupidly unnecessary ladder. I'm not sure how the developers could have so much experience with Source dating back to ZPS in 2007 and still not know that ladders are terrible level design.  There are also situations where the macro-scale level design pathing is so bad on certain maps that new players will just quit out of frustration. Maps like Barlow Square on Escape prematurely appear like easy-to-navigate ""sandbox"" urban ""city"" maps (awesome! right?). So at first you might go, ""oh cool, that gun shop is a couple blocks west of our position. Let's make our way in that direction!"" However, you have ZERO navigational liberty and you are FORCED onto a 100% LINEAR path due to miles of chainlink fence that procedurally block every path except ONE. This might only be ""bad"", but it moves to ""terrible"" when you find out that the dynamic path is often obscurred and basically hidden. If you are a new player that isn't aware that there's exactly one path to move through the map, then you will quickly get confused, then frustrated, then you'll quit. This happens on a painfully regular basis. The zombies don't end their fun - it's the map's level design that does that.  Furthermore, there are micro-scale level design issues. The latest example is one that I just experienced this morning. I was trying to beat Montclair with some equally inexperienced players and we got to a military medical base in a park. After easily clearing it of boring NPC zombies, we walked past a locked gate and we were told to go find the key in the park. We didn't know what this ""key"" looked like, but we combed the park nevertheless. We came up with nothing, yet we kept looking for what felt like hours. It got so desparate that the player-controlled zombie started trying to help us find it. Eventually my only living partner turned into a zombie as a result of a random bite and I just quit to end that pitiful match. This is one example of how needlessly frustrating this game is. Stuff like this is simply unfun.   But if you manage to get through all of those inherent level design flaws, then you'll notice that player-controlled zombies are frighteningly unbalanced. It gets so bad, that some experienced players intentionally die at the beginning of the match just so they can single-handedly destroy their former teammates before they can even get through the first couple objectives. How in the world can it be so unbalanced?  It's almost impossible to hit a player zombie as compared to an identical NPC zombie. I've heard players claim that player zombies have unique hitboxes. My hunch is that the game has poor networking and it's normally masked by allowing NPC zombie hits to be credited only clientside (versus player zombie hits that must be validated serverside). Either way, this is a very very very noticeable phenomena and it makes player zombies very difficult to deal with.  Oh and player zombies can ""dodge"" as well. The experienced ones know that if their head stays unscathed, then they can tear through a group of players, so they spin, duck, jump and do all sorts of stupid moves to turn themselves into a walking killing machine. That's not fun. This is not a featured capability. There's no tooltips or tutorials that explain all of the intricacies of this maneuvering. That tells me that it isn't a designed feature. And since it ruins entire Escape servers, I say it's an exploit that is unpatched two years after release.  I really drive home hard enough that this is a frustrating game to play. If I hadn't dropped a thousand hours in ZPS, I would've abandoned it long ago. This game does not play like ZPS. It's something much much worse and that breaks my heart.			"

												This game was fun (if sparse) in Beta form. I loved the gameplay and feel, but the full release actually seriously downgraded the graphics and character models, and movement feels much worse now. I innitially was very excited for the ""Escape"" mode and played the 1 map they had to death and back. On full release there is.... 1 more map. Actually, it is the same map as a Beta one, just repurposed for ""Escape"" mode. The difficulty setting means nothing as far as I can tell. On normal I had a lot of ammo I thought, but died miserably about 20 minutes later after finding little more than a box of pistol ammo and an old shotgun with a couple rounds in it. As for the horde of 100+ zombies outside that will follow you no matter how far you run or hide from them, they tore me to shreds moments later. This brings me to another fault of the full version. NO ammo (and I have yet to have a single melee weapon spawn) or FAR TO MANY zombies. There is no balance since the undead can auto track and lock on to you.As for my skill, every shot (minus one or two when a zombie stealth sneaks behind me) is a headshot. MOST of the time, this is a kill, and other times it takes 4-5 shots to the head to bring one down. Still, if the game lets me have a good run and the hit boxes are in my favor I can get 99% single shot kills. Still, I run out of ammo and end up being swamped by a horde despite checking every nook and cranny for guns and ammo.Character models now look TERRIBLE! Seriosly, there is something badly wrong with their faces and the textures/models seem to be between Half Life 1 and 2 for quality, while the zombies all look good still. Gore is alright, but the zombies make NO NOISE at all when they walk and make the exact same noise as a door breaking when they die/fall.Before the ""full release"", I would have rated it a 8/10 with high hopes as it only needed more maps beyond the police station. Now? I would say 2 or 3/10, and that is being generous.			"

												I've spent 6.1 hours on this game and it is really fun, but it isn't worth the money. Games like No More Room In Hell and games like it have done much better in the zombie aspect and have been free to play. I wouldn't recommend this game. Especially for the price.			"

												Pro's- Interesting map designs.- Large variety of weapons from .45acp revolvers to 5.56mm AK74u's(why, i dont really know?) to wrenches and remote detonated IEDs.- Unique ""phone"" feature provides players with information in objective modes and serves as a method of awareness in Hunt/PVP by giving the player the ability to ""text"" other players in supposed bluetooth range, setting their phone off and alerting player and zombie alike to their location/direction.- Ammo can be scarce, creating a survival atmosphere.- Player zombie feature is interesting (although frusterating in Hunt/PVP gamemode).- Can be fun with friends, PVP and PVE alike, but frusterating or boring without.Cons:- Small, less than friendly community of asshats.- Hackers frequent the games small server list.- Poor weapon balancing, seemingly made for hackers with aimbot as all weapons are 1 shot headshots (except for the 9mm pistol) and atleast 4 shot kills in the torso with Assualt Rifles against players. Coupled with horrible weapons spreads after a few shots, you can spray an entire MP5K magazine at a player down a hallway then get killed by your enemy on 1 shot.- Co-op mode is tedious and feels more like a chore than anything else.- Zombie AI needs some serious work, they'll run in circles or get stuck underneath desks and other times detect you even though your behind them a mile even though you can walk pretty close to them up close and not get noticed 40% of the time.- Inactive workshop community. You can find some very cool looking (and some immersion breaking ones if thats what youre into) weapon texture and model replacements on the workshop, but to my knowledge nothing has been posted in atleast several months.Not really worth the money the devs want in my honest opinion as most people play Hunt and are generally very rude, while the few who play co-op mode (which needs massive improvements on map progression i feel) either troll or dont communicate/cooperate at all.

												Contagion is an action FPS involving everyone's favourite fictional creature, the zombie. Your aim in every match is to survive as long as possible and in some matches survive long enough to get an evac and if you're unlucky enough to be killed by the zombie horde you become one of them with the goal of killing the survivors. With ammo and weapons being very hard to come by how you use your ammo is of upmost importance.+Nice graphics+You get to play as survivors and zombies+There are quite a few characters, each with their own backstory+Quite a few different weapons, ranged and melee+You can board up windows and doors to slow down advancing zombies+Good soundtrack+Headshots are one hit kill apart from on riot zombies, headshots are very satisfying+You can play singleplayer or mutliplayer+Workshop support-Gets repetitive quickly and with no progression system it has very little replay value-Hardly any players online-Zombies don't look great, they're basically just grey humans covered in blood-Some of the maps are very confusing-Some maps don't have melee weapons so you're screwed if you run out of ammoVerdict:6It's a fun zombie game but with little replayability this game is only worth getting if you're playing with friends and you get it on sale.El K.

												The lack of connectivity between players is really just the tip of the iceburg for this game. In this day and age it should be easy to connect two players together for an online session but this is a game that falls very short on being able to offer a reliable way to play with your friends. Yeah we figured it out after three hours! It still says that the developers did not take proper steps to offer reliable connectivity.Overall the game feels like a low quality mix of L4D and [enter generic shooter here]. The co-op is tedious, we were constantly feeling like the game was work and not a game at all. Made us wish L4D had scoping because that is all this game offers over that game.			"

												I used to give this game praise for it's design, but ironically, the more I play, the worse it becomes. Design-wise, the game is good, but the lack of people playing and the harsh death penalties make it no fun anymore. Here's how it goes:When a game starts, you are human. When you die, you turn zombie. Here's the bad part, when you die 5 times in a round, you go to spectate mode. No way to respawn, you don't get to come back until next round! GAMES NORMALLY LAST 30 MINUTES!!! That's half an hour to wait before you get to play again. You may be thinking ""oh, ill just quit and rejoin"" Nope, the server remembers you so it wont work. You also may think ""I'll join another server."" Well, the game is basically dead. At any given time, there's maybe 3 active servers per map. So technically, there's more servers than people. So unless you want to play alone, there's no point.Also the devs censor the reviews so they get higher placement on the steam store searches. Just goes to show you what scum they are.			"

												This game has a lot of potential but the developers sadly could not take advantage of that potential and left the game with many annoying and game experience breaking bugs and glitches.The game had a huge potential and hope when it came to modding community but sadly the developer broke workshop at some point and didnt fix it for a long time which resulted in the very few modders that it had, to leave and never come back, as well as potential new modders were driven away from it.Developers didnt fix the issue with creating Private games, you wont be able to connect with your friends on Steam if you unless you do mumbo jumbo with your router ports or use virtual LAN software like Tunngle. Shame that a game sold only on Steam cannot take advantage of Steamworks...As for the main attraction of the game, ZOMBIES, they lack variety, there is of course more then 10 skins (or even 15) but still you get situation where 3 exact looking zombies attack you and overall you have a feeling of fighting an army of zombie clones.... sorry but a zombie game which has slow pace, should at least 50. Plus animations are pretty bad.I would recommend the game for it pros as it has quite few, but I cant seeing how developer has stopped support and the game is left to root I cant, the reasons stated above are just not acceptable to recommend the game			"

												Negative aspects: The player community simple isn't large enough. There are typically no more than 50 people in the WORLD playing. Additionally, player zombies are extremely unbalanced and ruin co-op modes. When human players die in any game mode (co-op or PvP), they become zombies and wreak havoc on the remaining survivors. The fact that they make little or no noise, can move sporadically (combined with bad hit boxes), can lead and command up to 15 AI zombies, and have many respawns with no wait timer make them almost always unstoppable in the end. They should really only be in the Hunted game mode.I also dislike that you cannot view the server list while already in a server. Further, you cannot even vote to kick/ban players or even to change the map.Positive aspects: The developers put very much detail in the maps. There are many pathways and hidden areas, requiring exploration (and teammwork if playing co-op). The game also succeeds in the horror aspect, especially in Hunted mode.			"

												+ eerie atmosphere+ good, fitting music+ slow, undead zombies (like in the old zombie movies)+ good maps+ slow, objective based gameplay (patience, ammo conservation and focus on objectives are essential)- bugs (i.e. game crashes, bad player zombie hit detection)- performance problems on some maps- terrible weapon balance (stock pistol 1-hits all zombies, no need to use other weapons)- maps are too long (when you lose connection or the game crashes, up to 30min of progress as surivor is lost)- only 2 zombie types: the standard zombie and the rare riot zombie (just a tougher version of the standard zombie)- lots of griefers who ruin games and devs don't do anything against them- some parts of the game are unfinished, i.e. many animations are very basic Contagion had a good start, but devs lost momentum and now the game is in an unfinished state with lots of bugs. Also, griefers are a big problem. They have many ways to ruin a round (camping, teamkilling, hiding objective items, etc) and rarely get banned for it. In its current state, i can only recommend Contagion to people who like slow paced zombie shooters.			"

 more polished than the game itself.I wish change my review with a thumb up, i bought OST DLC to support them hoping they will give us a more proper patchfinding and especially gunfight /melee combat overhaul as well.


I will stay tuned..

												I remember when they launched this game 3 years ago. It was a game with potential. In its best days this game was really good, even in its beta version. Now, after 3 years without playing it, I see that it is absolutely f*ucked up. No one is online, if you find people online there will be 14 or 15 people. it is full of bugs (I think it has more bugs now than when it was launched) and it is not funny anymore. It is like a bad mod of NMRIH, which is really good, is similar and is a free-to-play. 3 years ago I would recommend this game, now I tell you DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY, devs abandoned the game.

												I would recomend this to anyone who likes LFD1/2 DayZ and No more room in hell.Its an 8 player coop game with differnt game types: escape, hunted, extraction, panic, spread over a number of differnt maps and the devs appear to be adding more quite regularly. This game is alot slower then something like LFD, head shots are key to killing the zombies and if you get a bite from a zombie you can turn into one which can make things alot harder for the survivors. (its also ALOT of fun) It can get crazy with lots of zombies and scary when your the only survivor left trying to make it to the end.The only negatives to this game are the lack of players: sometimes it can be hard to find a good server but that is also getting better. Also if your new to the game starting out can be really confusing, there isnt anything telling you where to go exactly, you do have a phone that will txt you when objectives are complete but that is about it. If you like coop zombie games get this! its well worth it.			"

												I mean, this game was kinda buggy and clunky from the get go, but it was still fun. Now, it's pretty much dead. I can rarely find players outside of a few maps on a few modes, the rest is pretty much deserted. It's a shame, because with more polishing, this could've been decent. The only thing that keeps me coming back now and then to this game, is the Hunted mode, which is pretty fun. You know, standard PvP with a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of zombies all around, you die, and you're a zombie yourself. Barebones, but sort of fun. The devs are pretty much incompetent, and by this point, you're better off playing No More Room In Hell.			"

												(disclaimer. This review will not review the actual game, it will review the inactivity and my personal thoughts about the game's state) Oh sweet, sweet nostalgia. I remember this game, back when it was active. It was an amazing game honestly. I still get the temptation to visit it in hopes of some kind of activity. I know I'll be disapointed. I know I'll waste my time waiting for it to load, but I'm going to try. Maybe something lucky will happen and I'll find some people to talk to. This game is to inactive to be fun anymore. Oh wait, I forgot I uninstalled it. I remember me and a few other survivors grouping up in one room hoping we could survive the swarms of walkers. I remember playing with friends on this game. It was good but not anymore.			"

												I tried to like it, I really did. I found some enjoyment for the Escape missions to an extent, but the lack of direction turned me off. In some missions you just wander around aimlessley, hoping you're going in the right direction. The Extraction missions are awful, to say the least. The survivors not only shoot at each other half the time, they also are stationary in shooting the zombies and get killed about 80% of the time because they don't know what 'fight or flight' is. The animations are not really the best, but I understand its really difficult to get those right. They REALLY need to fix the bug where survivors clip through the fence when rescued, as they aimlessly wander until you get your next objective. This can get them killed and you fail the mission even though you rescued them. Its fun to play with friends, but don't expect anything magnificent. Only recommend in VERY small doses.			"

												UPDATED at 05 MAR 2014 with an actual changes. Some work is being done as gibbing on zombies, breakable doors and even one more map is released. However melee combat for humans is FYBAR. It's just even more horrible that before. I don't get it why they refused to use HL2MP default model and put something self-made. As soon as zombie get's in a melee range it's impossible to hit it either with pistol/revolver or with a melee attack - it just jumps around you. Same applies to a situation when you are out of ammo - melee weapon will cause more troubles because you think it will work. It won't, sadly. It's broken for 5 months long since initial beta release and haven't changed a bit in a positive way.-----Quite a let down for a team who created Zombie Panic: Source. Graphically it looks fairly good for an ye olde Source engine and custom sound engine does it's work really good. There are only 4 maps for now: one is co-op objective and three for Hunted (deathmatch) game mode. Also there is a extraction game mode but it's getting old pretty fast. So does the whole game.   But the problem is not in that there are few maps, rather strange recoil and jittery 3-rd person animations. The major problem is that word 'boring' does not fully describe playing Contagion as a zombie. While some features (like glow and outlines are being added) are being worked on, lack of features like mini-map or zombie shortcuts/paths for faster map navigation making that experience painful. Try playing on objective map as a zombie and you'll want to leave server quite fast because hanging around mindlessly over a huge map is not fun by any means. If you somehow find a way to survivors you have nothing extra that makes player controlled zombie better than a AI zombie. But being a human is no better. Somehow, Monochrome made a co-op game without most co-op related features. Really, all you need your buddies for is to carry a key? In fact, a some kid could get one and do not know it, so co-op progress will halt as other players even do not know who got a valuable co-op items!   Lastly, developers do not fix critical bugs and adjust game play mechanics as fast as I'd like to see in a multiplayer only game. They do regular content updates (like Halloween and X-mas updates) thought.   As for now, it's hardly a game I'd recommend to anyone due to it's gameplay. It's really gets boring after 2-5 hours of play. Pretty picture, neat sounds and randomized fences/ locked doors alone just can't keep the gameplay up. Zombie Panic: Source is still a much better game. And it's free. P.S. I've backed Contagion on Kickstarter and played the game before most other players. I will update my review tone if anything will change in a positive way.			"

This review is for the Release Version!tl;dr version:Though there are some issues with zombie pathing and balancing, the value you're getting at $20 is excellent considering there is Workshop support coming soon and that the devs are commited to bringing releasing free DLCs with new guns, characters, maps and even game modes.Should you get it? if you like a challenge and prefer realistic gameplay, definitely.Pros:- excellent gun mechanics with realistic ballistics, penetration, recoil and decent weapon sounds- atmospheric- varied game modes (pvp, coop and survival)- solid replayability on the escape maps (you actually get completely different endings, paths, objectives and loot spawn locations, unlike L4D2 that just makes loot random and the odd door here and there)- challenging (you can die quite easily if you're not paying attention)- good bullet detection in pvp and not a lot of lag either- several characters to choose from- good graphics (still the Source Engine, but the lighting is very good indoor and the weapon models are very detailed)- a good variety of weapon types (melee weapons, sidearms, SMGs, ARs, shotguns, a sniper rifle, a crossbow and explosives)- weapon animations are very well made- devs are easy to reach to and helpful- official modding support (SDK)- upcoming Steam Workshop integration- upcoming free DLC- frequent updatesCons:- melee play feels clunky (still a lot better than DayZ though, but less fluid than Dead Island)- pathing issues with zombies (has improved a bit since the alpha, but there are still issues, especially with doors)- escape objectives are not very clear and can lead to a lot of head scratching at times- due to the dynamic nature of the escape maps, balancing is hit or miss at times (you can either get quicly swarmed, not find enough ammo or end up with a riot zombie that blocks you and that you can't kill quickly enough)- no option to control the volume level of the characters- graphics are inconsistent in outdoor areas (some areas are detailed others not so much)- few zombie models and only three zombie ""types"" (slow, fast and armored)- fairly limited number of maps - zombie animations can get stuck when in ""roam mode"" where you see the zombie continue to try and walk when he has an obstacle in front of him (happens a lot less since the last updates)- crossbow bolts sometimes can't be retrieved (not sure if feature or bug :) )- zombie clipping can occur (especially near closed doors that have to be activated by a switch)- learning curve can be steep as there is no dedicated tutorial (this has improved since they've added tooltips post-release)Personal opinion:Personally, I've followed Contagion since their kickstarter and jumped aboard fairly soon after they got on steam and had the chance to see them build upon the game, adding new content, fixing bugs and improving the experience. The dev team is comprised mostly of the people that worked on the excellent Zombie Panic Source mod for HL2 and while the production value of this game is very high compared to some other indie titles, they are a small team with a limited budget.Arguably, for $20, Left 4 Dead 2 offers a ton of content and replayability in a solid experience; so does Dead Island and State of Decay. Also, for $10 more, there is DayZ, which is pretty much an MMO in terms of what you can do in the game world, the huge scope, vast arsenal, customizing and rich PVP experience.However, I feel like it's unfair to compare Contagion to similar zombie games like Left 4 Dead, Dead Island or State of Decay that cost millions to make.I believe that if we continue to show them our support they will also continue to add content to the game, fix bugs and perhaps even come with new game modes or features, similar to what they did for ZPS.As of 10.05.2014, they've released several updates, an official modding SDK, have revamped the zombie sounds and have promised to release a new escape map, free DLC with new characters, new guns and a new game mode, as well as Steam Workshop integration.

												Please, for the love of God/Allah/Buddah/Satan/Microsoft XP Paperclip, do not buy this unholy mess. It was fun with friends for all of about a half an hour before we realized how absolutely clunky this POS was. The controls are far from fluid, the animations are trash, there are a grand total of two maps for what should be one of the game's main modes, and the amount of enemies are kind of disappointing for what should be a zombie apocalypse. Buy Bad Rats 5 times instead and send copies to your friends. At least you'll have a good laugh after that one instead of crying.			"

												A zombie game.  When I played it, I loaded into a map set in a suburban neighborhood.  I climbed onto the roof of a garage, where I was safe from harm.  The game regularly told me that there my fellow players were dying.  Was I supposed to help them?  Or kill them?  A little bit of a tutorial to the game modes would go a long way.I played a few more rounds, and won or tied all of them.  I guess you're supposed to kill your fellow survivors.  It's still bad.  The last round I played went for 10 minutes and I never saw my opponents, and it ended in a draw.			"

												This game really feels unpolished to the point that the gameplay is a little baffling.  Note that I'm just playing the co-op mode, and the perspective is based on that:-Objectives are written in a first-person perspective, relying on character knowledge the player doesn't have.-Equipment is scarce to the point of being bizarre.  Sure, you don't expect there to be ammo lying all over the place, but things like melee weapons are just as scarce, despite every location being littered with items you could use as a melee weapon.-Characters often comment on using itmes on doors that aren't supposed to open, leading you to frustratingly use keys on each and every door you come across to find the one that will finally open.-There's next to no feedback on the weapons and the type of ammo they should be using.  Sure, you'd expect  a bunch of strangers to not necessarily know everything about weapons they find, but it really doesn't feel like the intention of the game, considering you get the names of all the guns.  You don't have any feedback on the ammo you pick up either - how much of the shotgun shells do you have when you don't have a shotgun?  Your guess is as good as mine.-Melee doesn't have the kind of impact you would expect - especially with something like a Sledgehammer.  There's no real feeling of force when you attack someone with a large weapon - leaving the whole experience rather unsatisfying.It's not unplayable or anything.  It's just really bizarre.  While I appreciate the slower, careful pace compared to a game like Left4Dead, the lack of polish really gets in the way of a really good time.Shame too.  There's potential here.  This game really should still be in early access.			"

												This is another game where I wish you had a third option besides just yes/no. But since I do not think it's a yes then I have to choose no. This game has way too many flaws to recommend which is a shame because I think it expanded on Left 4 Dead by adding different types of game modes and being able to ADS. The biggest problem with the game is that it crashes all the time. If you finish a game and decide to switch to another server ""crash"". If you are waiting for the next round ""crash"". It crashes at least once every game session I have with it. I have friends who play and it happens to them also. The other problem are bugs/glitches in the game. For example, in extraction mode survivors can get stuck and will not move, even if you tag them to follow you. I've had this happen on numerous occasions. Other times they just get stuck on ladders and you have to go all the way back when you realize they're not following you to tag them to unfollow then tag to follow again but take a different route so they don't get stuck on ladders again. Another problem with extraction is the route to lead the survivors doesn't always show up on the phone. So you're left wondering which way to go. Then there are glitches where you get stuck yourself and basically have to kill yourself to get free. Other issues are gameplay issues. There is no mini-map. I don't have a huge problem with the concept of not having it except you have no idea what to do and where to go on a bunch of maps. The hints on the phone aren't helpful. For example on Roanaoke PD there are a couple of escape routes in the game. I'm not going to give anything away except that once you find the armory it doesn't tell you what to do next so you're left roaming around until you get somewhere that triggers the next hint. Obviously after you've played it you now know but for new players they'll have no idea and this is a long play session map. It's just annoying. If there were at least arrows or something to point you in the right direction that would be helpful. While I do enjoy playing this game with friends, I think until some of these major issues are fixed I can't recommend this game. Some of these have been complained about for a long time so odds are this game isn't going to be improved. If you get it on a cheap sale it might be worth it otherwise there are better zombie games out there.			"

												Contagion is a standalone game from the team behind one of the most popular Source Engine mods, Zombie Panic: Source. This title features team-based gameplay and multiple gamemodes including Escape (objective maps), Extraction (defense), and Hunted (PvP). While it's execution on these game types is good, I'll be focusing my scores mainly on the Escape gamemode - which is the co-op objective maps.This is a great game to play with friends, and offers variety on maps in a similar way that the AI Director does in Left 4 Dead. The maps are semi-randomized each time, including different items being in new spots and you will have different tasks to complete before escaping. For the most part, the game itself is fairly intense and very moody. Especially when your fellow survivors have turned and are now on the hunt for your tasty, sweat-soaked flesh. Yum. However, sketchy hitboxes and some jerky animations will yank you right out of the immersion. It's entertaining indeed, but it loses it's shine rather quickly. While it's a good game, it just seems to be lacking something that Zombie Panic: Source had. I can't quite put my finger on it.Overall: 78%Concept: 79% - Co-op zombie survival will always be enticing, despite being overused.Visuals: 82% - Beautiful destruction, but some mucky textures & wild post-processing.Sound: 80% - Eerie atmosphere mixed with moans is nerve wracking, but repetitive.Gameplay: 75% - Creative in some spots, though generic and rather choppy at others.Entertainment: 78% - Excellent when friends join, a little old if you're on your own.

												Ignore your friends, don't buy this. If you liked Zombie Panic: Source, go play that. Don't support these guys. It's terrible. There's clearly money and effort put into everything in this to try to elevate it above being a source mod, but none of that matters if the core gameplay is bad. Popping zombies in the head with your pistol is fun for a while, and tense as it's not easy but I am being serious when I say there is nothing else there to the gameplay. Guns are scarce to a point where you more luck into a playstyle than you do choose how you want to play or adapt to what's going on. However, ammo is plentiful and melee weapons are so dangerous and inconsistent they are useless. There's a barricade tool, but it's only useable for certain areas and useless the rest of the time. There's cool ideas, but none of them are implemented well. Not one. I have played an♥♥♥♥♥ton of zombie games looking for good ones and I want this one to be good. But jesus christ the devs have been asses on the forums, the  game has only gotten limited support since release and it doesn't look like it will be turning around any time soon.Go play Zombie Panic: Source or No More Room in Hell. Both are better and free. Somehow No More Room in Hell comes out feeling more polished, despite this having a budget. If you really want to defend this game, you can talk to me in the commments, but jesus christ I have no idea how you sado-masochists do it.It's not that fun, it's not scary and it's not scary enough to justify the core gameplay not being fun.

After it released and reviews weren't that favorable, I waited and picked it up in a bundle. Its not a bad game, but the trailer made it look like something more than it is and that's disappointing. I wish it had an actual story as the trailer looked to have. The gameplay is like every other generic FPS except with zombies, but it isn't that good. The controls aren't as responsive as they should be, graphics/animations are just ok and the sounds are well, not that great either. I wish that I could recommend, but Contagion just isn't worth your time or money.			"

												Honestly I wasn't hoping for much when playing this game, just wanted a fun zombie shooter that I could play with a friend. It didn't need a bunch of bells and whistles, I just wanted it to be fun. Unfortunately the few times I've played it has been either boring, frustrating, and/or tedious. The ammo seems to be a bit random, the first playthrough was fine. The ammo was a little scarce, but as long as you played slightly conservatively it wasn't a problem. The last 2 times playing the ammo was basically nil. I spent most of the game just running around the zombies because I didn't want to waste ammo (or using a bat)....and yet after 40 minutes of playing, my friend and I had only picked up 3 ammo total. Funnily enough one of the places we had to go to was a gun and ammo shop that we were supposed to ""stock up"" on to prepare for the level...and yet there was only one thing of ammo and every single weapon at the place had no ammo. That kept happening, I picked up 7 or 8 guns in a row  throughout the playthroughs which were ALL out of ammo and nothing to be picked up. It just became frustrating.Another big complaint I have is that the maps are generally quite big, yet several areas have absolutely nothing in them (besides zombies). There are lots of deadends and places that just serve no purpose at all other than to make the map look bigger. You have to search for a single item or location, yet the maps are so big that it just feels incredibly tedious making progress/finding items in the game. You go to one location, are told to find said item, have to go to the other side of the map to grab the item, then go back to the inital location to activate it or trigger something, and so the cycle continues. Then in my most recent playthrough my friend and I were stuck for about an hour. We couldn't understand how we were possibly missing something, had gone through every single room and location at least three or four times. Finally we googled a walkthrough, and turns out that a door that was supposed to be triggered opened just didn't work. It glitched out for some reason, we rewent through the steps (that we previously had done correctly) and nothing would fix it, so we were just about to quit out of the game...when it crashed. That basically sums up how well my experience has been when it comes to Contagion.			"

												This game feels like a Half-Life mod. It's absolutely not worth $20. There are only 6 or so maps, and half of them are long big maps, and the other half can't really be considered ""maps"" at all because they're just a single house or two and you hold out against wave after wave of zombies. Yawn.Overall, the game just feels unpolished, like not a lot of effort was put into it. After about 3 hours, I felt like I had seen everything there was to see. It's also pretty misleading. Their intro video mentions how ammo and guns are found in logical places - no they're not. Wrecked humvees will have gun cases and crates strewn all around with no ammo/weapons (you can't open anything except doors) but go into a women's bathroom and you'll find sniper ammo in the sink. There's lots of random nonsense like that which completely takes away the immersion and survival aspects the game claims in it's marketing.So overall, a pretty disappointing game. It's not terrible, and if you're playing it PvP with a group of friends, you can get some laughs out of it for a few hours. But it just feels like a mediocre Half-Life mod. Your lights have an annoying ""camera grunge"" effect that we couldn't figure out how to turn off. The animations don't seem to have any blending, so they look awful. Your arms that hold the guns look strange and contorted, very unnatural. It's just a mediocre, unpolished game. I don't recommend it.			"

Looks great, plays great but falls shortI bought this game on sale at 80% off, but I ended up still being dissapointed.Pros:+ Great graphics+ Level design is good+ Objectives are decent+ A variety of game modes+ Co-op, always a plus for me+ You can play as zombies too+ Different characters you can play asCons:- Has a low playerbase- Community isn't great- Combat leans more to guns- People don't work together in games- Difficult due to bad teamwork of most players- Hordes of zombies just seem impossible to survive- Melee weapons need pin point accuracy to be effective- Objectives need to be better shown and directed, annoying to have to check the phone all the timeMy Opinion:I wanted another great zombie game to play, I like zombie games where you get objectives and have to make your way from A to B. I love No More Room In Hell and Left For Dead 2, I've tried other similar games and now I've tried contagion. I wasn't fond of it, looks and plays nice but the players and combat bring it down.			"

												This Game has actually quite good gameplay and can be alot of fun, but there is 1 thing that makes the game nearly unplayable. Hackers. I played this game alot, mainly hunted nearly in every Game there was a hacker, The game runs on source and its really easy to hack and alot of people do it. If its just aimbot (getting oneshot by a SIG Pistol all over the map) or wallhack (people always knowing where you are). Reporting them is hard, you need tons of evidence and complicated things like stuff from the console you just cant get when you arent prepared, getting someone bannend is way more complicated as it should be and nobody of the people i reported got what he deserves (doesnt matter how much video evidence i had) So if you want to get aimbotted all the time and than be taunted by 14 year olds with anime pictures.This is your game.If you are interested in a game with fair play you should rather go play Quake or something else.

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a really bad zombie shooter game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere are only a little bit of resolution sizes available.You can choose between fullscreen mode, Windowed mode or no border windowed mode.There is a game volume slidebar available.There is a music volume slidebar availalble.There is a sound volume slidebar available.You are able to turn on the subtitles.There is a voice volume slidebar available.There is a brightness Gamma Slidebar available.You are able to change the controls on the keyboard or mouse.There is a sensitivity meter, For scope and also for ironsights.You are able to play the game with a controller.There is local co-op available.About the game.You can't loot bodies or Pick up Knives in the kitchen or any kind of bag. In fact, you are very limited on what you are able to pick up or open things. Zombies are able to hit you from a distance, but you are not able to hit them from a distance. They can even hit you, even if they are not facing you and it feels too much as  ""left 4 dead"". but without SPECIAL INFECTED.You do can kill zombies that are behind a door.  I do like that a phone knows where you are going and is able to talk to you all the time. (not really i dont like it). Zombies are moving already to a location that you are about to walk to. not like braindead following you... So if you move to left they will also move to left. ON THE EXACT SAME TIME!There is a difficulty level available.Zombie animation is very stiff.There are many characters available that you are able to choose from. Each with their own weapon perk.Game is okay and boring on the same time,Radius of the grenade is weird.Poor graphics.There are different game modes and objectives.Melee action is almost impossible without getting hurt yourself. Dark atmosphere is okay, good enough to turn your flashlight on.Other things.These are not zombies - but infected because as they are able to climb over things.You can see shadows from the zombies behind the wall. So that you know there is a zombie behind the wall.You are very limited on what you are able to do and that is one of the reasons what ruins the game.Let's Try video:

A lot of the available servers are gonna conflict with your game maps, so no playing for you. Want to play with your friends only? forget it... you will either have to pay to get a dedicated server through a button in the actual game or set up a bunch of stuff on your ports and firewall. Games shouldn't make you work like this, or make you mess with ports like this... its unsafe for the unsavy.The developers here have a lot of work cut out for them right now... it's unplayable at this moment.

Posted: May 17, 2015
												The base gameplay disappointed me. Progressing through the game's levels seems to alternate between insta-killing every zombie running at you with headshots from a mile away (this works with almost any weapon, so there's really no point to carrying other weapons aside from using the separate ammo) and being swarmed and quickly killed in tight quarters by either a huge swarm that spawned in thanks to an ending sequence or one of the armored zombies.There's extremely little in the ways of avoiding/stealthing/distracting and the melee combat has no weight at all (zombies will continue to run at you at full speed while you attack them, so you'll just be constantly running backwards while slowly chipping away at their health), so I never felt like the game gave me any choice or variety.The netcode was a problem in the majority of servers I played (leading to unreliable combat), the player zombie mechanic is frustrating rather than an interesting challenge, and there's almost no mechanics that reward or even acknowledge co-operative play. Medical supplies or other interesting items that could be used to help other players are extremely rare, and covering/protecting teammates is mostly a non-problem in the linear campaign levels, where you will most likely be funneling everyone, including the zombies, through single doorways and alleyways to be shot/slapped with your gun.I wanted to like this game from the start, when I bought it on early access, and I love the art design, but it all feels wasted in one of the blandest zombie/co-operative games I've ever played. I don't think anything short of a complete redesign of the game mechanics could get me back into this game again.EDIT 11/28/15:I have a lot of changes to make to this review, such as looking at some of the newer maps and some of the content I missed. I'll start on the revisions when the 'Flatline' game-mode has been released.			"

[Skip to the verdict if you want a short summary]What is contagion?Contagion is a first person zombie horror game created by Monochrome LLC and running on the source engine in which you play one of eight characters who have to survive in a zombie ridden world. At the moment there is four main gamemodes which are Hunted, Escape, and Extraction. In hunted you experience tense Pvp battles with players online whilst at the same time fighting off zombies and scavenging for supplies and ammo. In escape you follow objectives sent to you via an ingame phone to escape (as the name suggests) the area you are currently in. This is my personal favourite gamemode for an atmospheric horror experience! And finnally: in extraction you have to help rescue Ai by taking them from one side of the map to the other via a Gps on your in-game phone.The loveThe main thing I love about this game is the atmosphere; every second and every turn is an intense moment. Most of my time playing this game I spend with my heart beating rapidly as I brace myself for a zombie encounter. This atmosphere is mainly brought on by the difficulty which comes from the random infection chance when hit from a zombie meaning any damage could be fatal and also the scarcety of ammo. The maps in these game are truly amazing. The game feautures a system which randomizes the map everytime so you will be experiencing a new adventure with each playthrough. Aswell as this the maps feauture tight spaces and lots of corners which adds a cloustrophobic ephect of if you see a zombie: your more or less going to have a heart attack. Whilst talking about the maps I feel the need to mention the amazing soundtrack and also sound effects used within the game which make up for the mediocre voice acting. These two things combined mean that you will feel as though you are actually there walking through those tight halways listening for the rumble of a nearby zombie. The graphics on this are what I would expect for a game of this type; not astounding but they dont need 4k graphics to give me a true horror experience. Moving on, within the options menu we have a wide variety of options to customize our experience and to provide the needs of those with a microwave computer, which is what I would expect for a non-port. A small mention I am going to give because I think it could be a good feauture but hasnt been used to its full advantage yet is the workshop support. This alows people to make custom maps and zombies which could bring the horror to a whole new level. So far not much good content has surfaced but I have high hopes for the future. Now onto the multiplayer side of things: you can join a random hosted server via a search from the main menu after selecting your desired map and gamemode. This means you can either play co-op or the mode named hunted in which players converse in heart renching pvp battles and fight to the death. I feel this gamemode is a really nice addition to the game but I feel it is lacking some larger maps. The main thing that seperates this game from other zombie games though; is the infection feature. This means that when you get hit by a zombie there is a chance of you becoming infected and being a zombie. Signs of this is the noise slowly distorting and the colours on your screen slowly fading. This adds a really cool aspect of the game which gives you the choice of whether to tell your friends that you are becoming infected or sneakily bite them while they are not looking! I feel this adds a new dimension to the co-op  gameplay. Also if you die during a game you will respawn as a zombie which I think is good because it rids the game of a boring spectator mode. Time to talk about my favourite feature in the game: the co-op. There is nothing more fun then hoping intom a game of escape with my friends and experiencing the horror together. It also adds a lightheartened twist to the game. Finnally I am going to mention that a free Dlc has just been released containing a new gamemode, some new maps, charecters and weapons. I think it is good that the developers are still supporting their game and I hope to see more things like this in the future.The hateSomething I dont like in this game is theHud though this is mainly prefrence and is not game breaking. I just feel that the Hud feels like some 90's shooter and isn't very polished. Mainly the wapon slots in the top right corner. But as I said tis is just preference. My main problem with the game is the terrible Ai. It is truly unpredictable: sometimes the human ai will walk into walls and sometimes they will do as meant. Sometimes the zombies will chase after you and sometimes they will stare into space. I just feel this ruins the immersion and otherwise perfect atmosphere. Another problem is that the deddicated servers are not very reliable and thematchmaking is pretty appalling. This can be avoiced by sticking to hamatchi co-op like I do. But I feel like I am missing a big chunk of the game witrhout hunted which would be hard to play on hamatchi unless I had alot more friends. Something that is a minor problem is the lack of story. I say this is minor because the game doesnt really need a story because all you really need to know is that you are getting away from the zombies but I just felt like a small chunk of the game was missing for me. Another thing that isnt really bad but some people could find bad is that the game is very slow paced and you are not just running at hordes of zombies with a chainsaw. Im saying this could be bad because some people may expect this from a zombie game. My final complaint is a few small bugs such as when you scroll down the texts on your phone by left clicking: you cant scroll back up. These bugs are minor and can probably be easily fixed so Im not to salty about them.The verdictContagion is an atmospheric zombie horror that will have your heart beating rapidly but dont go in expecting a fast paced run and gun. A definite buy if you have a co-op partner.Love:+Atmosphere+Co-op multiplayer+Difficulty+All around good graphics+Options+Worshop support+Infection+Free contentHate-Bad dedicated servers-Hud-Bad Ai-Some bugs-No story7/10Thank you for reading, if you enjoyed don't forget to:Join my curator group!Visit my website![axlshack.wordpress.com]Watch me on youtube!

												Contagion is going on the right way for a FPS zombie survival game. From the same founder of ZPS, it's worth to try out this COOP game, even better with friends! One free DLC is coming soon and will bring good improvements to the game. Currently with 5 game-modes (Objective; PVP; Coop Extraction and two familiars from ZPS) and 8 different type of characters to choose; including more than 12 types of weapons.The maps are pretty well made and I known for sure it takes time to create a master piece like that, each rounds the objective and other paths can change on the area, doors can be locked and you must find another way etc. You must walk around to find the items to unlock the paths and complete the mission to escape and win.For now, I recommend to play this game with friends, you can check out some populated PVP/Objective servers; but for a first try, you should do 'objective' to train your aim and see all the commands for your first experience.TL;DRGood co-op game (8 players and pvp servers with 16); free DLC coming in January 2015 with good improvements on the game-play; new animations, weapons and characters and future Linux support! Recommend to play with friends and truly worth it to buy in this price (75% off).Have fun!			"

												I probably won't purchase anything made from Monochrome after buying this game. It was suppose to be the 'Spiritual Successor' Zombie Panic! Source but fell short. Contagion isn't going anywhere with the developers pretty much abandoning the game, and the population is suffering greatly. I wanted this 'Spiritual Successor' to succeed... but that never happened. In more important news: No More Room In Hell is free and NMRIH2 is in development. ;)			"

I guess to put it in short form, don't expect anymore future updates in the near future and the overall player base is pretty low, but you can play it in single player if the player base were to suddenly disappear. It's still pretty fun and is an interesting take on zombies, but there is no way anybody would recommend Contagion for full price since the amount of content is way too low to even consider it. For $5 or less, I'd say go for it.			"

												Pros:-Different take on a zombie killer is a breath of fresh air.-Players' ability to be common zombies is definitely another breath of fresh air.-Workshop support, and by extension, modability.-To make up for the difficulty of hosting games over the Internet (details below), it does have rather decent single-player gameplay.Cons:-Seems to need a powerful computer and graphics subsystem to play, i.e. something more powerful than even L4D2 needs.-No lobby to gather friends or other players in.-Woefully lacking network support that other Source games have makes it really difficult to host games over the Internet.  Needs either Hamachi, NeoRouter, Evolve, Tunngle, or router/firewall portforwarding/port unblocking wizardry to work at all, let alone well.-No Linux dedicated server.  Most dedicated server establishments are built on Linux owing to the expense of getting a Windows license, not to mention the fact that the best place for a Windows system is behind a heavily-fortified firewall.-In light of the above, the price on a game this modern might scare off others.  Were this in GoldSrc, I'd give it a pass.  Not this time.A mixed bag, but the best time to pick up this game is when it has a very steep discount applied to it, i.e. during seasonal and ""special event"" sales.  Until these deficiencies are addressed, my thumb goes down.			"

												Until they fix the horrible navigation, I can't recommend this... unless you enjoy running around aimlessly for literally 10 minutes at a time without knowing where the hell you're supposed to go, that is - because that's what you're going to be doing most of the time in this game.I realize the intention was probably to make it intense because you need to find out where to go and need to explore, but it's frustrating instead.I just quit a game where we tried to find the objective for 15 minutes straight, with 8 people, until we decided getting eaten by zombies was a better fate than slowly getting bored to death.Don't get me wrong, except for THAT, it's a good game and can be intense and lots of fun, but since you're just aimlessly running around for the other 2/3rd of the time, that one thing ruins it and makes it not worthy of my time, and probably not yours.tl;dr fix navigation or gtfo			"

												There were a bunch of negative reviews regarding Contagion when I got this game, but it was only $5 and it LOOKED really cool. So I was like, ""all these people are crazy, this game is going to be dope"". Please do not make the mistake I made. Contagion has some really cool ideas and concepts, but the execution of those ideas and concepts is rather disappointing. The game has potentional, but at the moment I urge you not to get this game, and certainly not for $20. Glad I only ended up wasting five bucks instead of four times that.			"

												Contagion is another game in a long line of zombie apocalypse games. It doesn't seem to bring anything new to the table as far as zombie shooters go and when I tried connecting to a game server there didn't seem to be a lot of people playing. I tried on 5 separate ocassions to enter a queue for Any random game and waited for over 5 minutes for another player to join. Visually, it doesn't look much different than other zombie survival games such as; 7 Days to Die. I was really looking forward to picking this game up and trying it out, as I happen to be a fan of the zombie/apocalypse genre; However, I was left completely underwhelmed and a little disappointed. Perhaps if more people play this game, the wait times will improve and make it worth the time to play, but for now, I can't recommend this title. I will check back on it another time to see if things have improved, as they do seem to be handing out A LOT of keys lately, but for now, thumbs down.			"

												Contagion is a zombie game that offers you several game modes and maps to explore and survive the rise of the infecteds in game modes such as Escape and Extraction. The gameplay is relatively slower paced in modes like Escape as compared to other zombie games like No More Room in Hell and Left 4 Dead 2. In Hunted mode, you're placed with not just the threat of zombies, but also your fellow survivors trying to hunt you down. Not to mention, you can also play as one of the zombies when you died as a survivor, hence providing you the ability to command other zombies to hunt down your former survivor friends. Furthermore, you can also play as a cockroach instead of the typical and boring spectator camera.Pros:*Devs did a great effort in producing a game with an apocalypstic atmosphere with the great use of lighting and eerie background music.*Offers many game modes and several maps to survive.*Every time you play Escape and Extraction, objectives are shifted which provides you with unique pathways to explore the world of the living dead.*A large variety of weapons to choose from.*Instead of waiting for the game to finish after you died as a survivor, you can play as a zombie.*You can play as a cockroach instead of becoming a boring spectator camera.*Has steam workshop to customise your game.Cons:*Some guns seems to be unfinished. e.g. when unloading the Remington 870, the racking sound of the pump cannot be heard, unlike the Mossberg 590.*The Scar-L's suppressor doesn't actually reduce the noise effect of the gun on the zombies, but rather attract more zombies.*Some melee weapons have their sound misplaced in the animation, especially performing a stealth kill on the zombies. e.g. baseball bat.*Lack of updates and new contents for the game which the devs had promised.*Some maps such as Barlowe Square can be a maze in game modes such as Escape, which can be hideous sometimes when you try to complete an objective.*Some maps such as Roanoke PD has a bug where you can sometimes hear the helicopter's sound on the roof even though it has not spawned yet. Likewise, when you enter back into the police station building after the trip to the roof, the roof environment sound can still be heard.*When you spawn into an Escape game, you start at the beginning of the map, regardless of how many objectives other players had completed. This can be annoying when you try to catch up to other survivors.*Has a bug where zombies can sometimes get stuck in some places of the map. Such as windows or furniture when they're spawned.All in all, I still personally enjoy this game regardless of the unfinished contents, bugs and lack of new updates. Its still fun to play with your friends and a game worth a try if you're into zombie, horror and survival games.Rate: 6.5/10			"

												Many of my friends and I are into zombie co-op games, so naturally Contagion is one of the titles which we would try on. Before I begin on descirbing the game itself, the first thing I would like to mention is that the number of people on my friend list who has the game, which is 21, is higher than the number of total players currently in game at the time I am writing this review. So, unless you can find yourself a good team (this is an 8 player co-op zombie killing game), please be prepared to face zombie hordes yourself. There will be one or two players in certain servers, but they will most likely leave half way or rambo about and turn into a zombie before you can realize what is going on. You will be real luckly if you can meet a quality player or two in any server. Truth to be told, this game has seen better days in terms of player count. There are some merits to the game itself. First of all, as a realistic zombie apocalypse co-op game, the game is rather well-made, graphically speaking. The game itself uses the source engine, so expect something along the line of Left 4 Dead. The game mechanism is rather simple and bare, so as to make sure that you don't get too much on-screen help. There will only be a health and stamina bar; you can carry 4 items of all types, some essential in solving in-game quests; you will only be able to see the silhouettes of items when you go near them. Realism, so yes, that's all you get. The enemies are simpler as well, as there will only be two types of zombies, one the normal ones where you can kill with a bullet in the head, if you are able to place it there accurately that is. The other is a ""riot police"" zombie, which soaks a lot more lead before you can kill it. Bullets are as scarce as they are sacred in the game, so think before you shoot if you can help it. Oh and you won't have a crosshair so you will need to depend on iron sights unless you are using a shotgun. Having said all that, the game itself is really not bad, though there are major problems elsewhere. Firstly, this game has a poor finishing. In the game I was playing before writing this review (and left because I was alone and I got overran halfway), I was pushed down a ladder by a zombie. That wasn't the problem, the problem is that, after being pushed down and suffering some dammage, my gun model disappeared! It won't be much of a problem if this is another game, but do not forget that Contagion does not offer any corsshair. So, what happened is that, I can't use my iron sight because the model has disappeared! The problem was solved by switching to another item (a card-key) and back, but shouldn't this bug be fixed at some point? Also, I have had issues with map skins. I was playign an official map and all reflective surfaces (and glasses) turned cyan after I did some alt-tabbing. You will know that vision is real important in this game if you are familiar with it, and it is not a simple matter of being irritating when glasses turn into solid cyan. If you can't see what's behind, hordes can close in a lot easier. Trust me, it's fatal. And did I mention that zombies tend to get stuck a lot? Yeah, though I am not complaining. Also, let's not forget that Contagion has an extremely weak game community. There's just a handful of players here and there, and there really isn't much of a back-up community to support the game. Not much custom maps, same old boring official maps with the same quests again and again, it gets repetitive. There are some die-hard fans, though most of the players I met are those who came back after a year or so to clear everything again, and then leaving it to gather dust in the vitural game shelf. I am one of them.So, my final words will be that, do not get the game unless you know what is going on and what you will be expecting. You'll most likely enjoy a lone adventure for an hour, maybe with a random teammate or two who has 300 ping, and then grow bored with it pretty soon. Nothing too fancy about this game that is worth the money.			"

												This game has everything a player would want; The inability to climb fences, shove zombies, or do any useful damage with melee weapons.Who wants to be human with such superpowers?I did like how zombies didn't spawn forever. They did frequently glitch through doors and struck me as they phased through. Who am I kidding?, that is another one of their powers more than likely.			"

												Don't buy it. It doesn't work well on Windows 10, and it looks like it never will. Apparently the developers don't care about their costumers. They are not going to fix game breaking exploits nor handle trolls. I didn't have fun playing, just disappointment. My money was thrown at people who don't deserve. Hope it helps someone to not waste money, there are a lot of better games that need support.			"

												It's not that the game is bad but rather it's simply bland.   As I type this it's on sale for $5  and it has been cheaper  even here on Steam when I bought it for $3.74   it's also been similary priced on the humble store for $4.    So know that the game has and no doubt will be again cheaper if you're on a tight budget.   The standard asking price of $20 is absurd though and is clearly priced high soley to make it appealing during large Steam sales.The game has two major modes.  One being a Co-op where you have to advance through the map doing objectives while trying to not become zombie lunch.  This mode is the best the game has to offer but it's not great.   The generic gameplay  gets old quite fast so hopefully whomeever you are playing with (and god help you if you actually bother to play alone) better be a rather amusing friends.   Otherwise once you play a map once there is little reason to ever play it again even though objectives are  somewhat randomized each time.     The game is terribly easy except if one of you actually manages to die.   If that occurs they get a few zombie lives and  this is where diffaculty steps up, player zombies are a actual threat and likely your team will be wiped out due to them in many cases.   This also causes trolls to get themselves killed to disrupt the game as early as possible.  These types of players are not overly common but do exist.Then there is the PVP mode which is just god awful.  It mostly consists of players trying to camp  and a few being brave enough to hunt the others down.  The phone can be used as a method of  playing hot and cold  which will give away other players positions.  Why do you have the numbers of everyone you are trying to hunt? Who knows, but while this may sound like a neat feature it also serves as a warning to the camper that the threat is coming.    Again with the majority of players prefering to camp this causes the brave hunters to often die because killing 4 campers one after enough tends to get you shot a few times during the fire fights.  It's a terrible game design.   Likewise however if you die you become a zombie and can try to get some  brain flavored revenge.... or cheat...  You see the game has another issue when friends play together it doesn't take long before they realize the zombie can help their buddy human.   So lets say the human is camping in a room with 1 entrance  the zombie can sit just outside and call NPC zombies to gather keep calling them keeps the zombies with him making  a zombie protective shield  for thier friend and attacking any player that comes and you'll know their coming because they will no doubt be using the noisy phone.     Beyond game-play  the sound is generic, and the graphics are heavily aged because they decided to go with the Source engine.  A great engine sure even more so in its prime but we see other indie games looking better or having unique art styles to comensate this just once again decides to be bland.    There are just too many games today to choose from that do this genre better, some of them even free like No More Room in Hell.   So there's no reason to buy this game at the end of the day.   You're reading this review during a sale right?  You can do better for your $5.			"

												This game is so very difficult and cruel. Best to host your own game and disable player zombies, or you will fail, fail and fail again. With the right players it's very fun.The game is highly objective based co-op in the vein of Payday, and it's also a bit like l4d, but a bit more in the survival sim genre. Ammo will run out if you try to kill everything. Death is permanent; there's no revivals or respawns to see here. It's not always clear where to go; you have to figure it out, and the map will change each time. One map in this game is as long as a whole l4d campaign. If you fail, you start over from the very beginning. Did I mention it's hard?			"

												//Updated with responce to Awesome-oFirst of all, when I bought this game it was in beta stage. However, there was no indication of game being not finished.I was actually hoping to see the complete release version when I was buying the game without ""Early Access"" warning (which they removed because, apparently, beta equals release).I find this to be misleading adverstment and a foul play to trick players into buying this game and this is a one huge reason to consider twice before buying any other possible titles published by Monochrome.Animations are hideous, sounds are acceptable and gameplay is basicly boring and repetative.Oficial hosted servers feature the difficultues above normal as rarely as dragons borns to this world and, believe me, normal difficulty is not challenging at all. Yet the game allows you to host your very own little server with ability of minimal management of it.Game still develops, but yet again - I was hoping to play a bloody complete game. Therefore, I do not recommend to buy this game or other future possible titles of this publisher just because of the way they treated the steam community with this one. Also, what is going on with ""indie"" being placed on every single title published by amateurs?Indie is not an indicator of how developers were poor while developing the game. Indie is not about consuming the fast food while developing your little toy. Indie is not about begging the community for money at kickstarters or whatever.Indie stands for independence. The ability to manifest your very own and your very original view on something in your game. Contagion was contaminated with community at alpha. This is not an indie game - developer depends on playerbase.This is just bold daylight robbery.Awesome-o, your comment is very inaccurate and is full of false and misleading information.The game is no longer in ""Early Access""I know, right? That is the main point of this review.the animations are really good because they utilise the source engine effectivelyNope, they are not. You can take a look at cinematic SFM release trailer as a sample of animations and I really doubt that a living being is able to perform such oddities. In game reloading, moving and head bobbing (which failes to turn off when turned off in options for some reason) are awful. With same success I may ""utilise the whole collection of my crayons effectively"" to draw a doodle on my wall.This game will always be ""in development""And I really hope that it will be in development for, at least, two more years.Full release and exit from the Early Access status usually means that all or most of planned features were implented in game. A good developers adds the minimal ammount of bugs to this checklist as well.This is clearly not a case here. I own this game for few months already and I keep receiving 250MB-400MB updates from time to time.This game is crawling with game breaking bugs.The day I bought this game I had no sounds at all available in game, which was reported by many other users as well.In same version survivors were able to climb on the weapon's shop on Barlove Square, where no zombie could reach them.In same version survivor could be trapped inside the objective without ability to leave it in rescue game mode.In same version zombies had 8 audio files, which makes approximetly 20% of current zombie sounds.In same version boltcutters/keys failed to drop from the deceased survivor, which made it impossible to complete the escape game mode.In same version it was possible to delay the infection by allowing the zombie to bite you again, while pressing the movement button.Does not sounds like a good experience, eh?Some of them were fixed in recent 200MB patches, some are still available for experiencing and dozens of new ones are added each patch.Bloody hell, they are still adding the maps (which are very few for now) and game mods after the ""full release""!Contagion is and always will be an indie game because the devs published the game themselves.Your definition of indie game is poor and incomplete.Assassin's creed black flag is indie game then because it was developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft.

Posted: October 8, 2014
												Bought it at early and still haven't regret it. The game is a nice zombie survival shooter, even though it has it's share of bugs and glitches it still offers a great experience. Story=======The story is a little fuzzy when you start, you pick from a group of survivors and shoved in the middle of a zombie outbreak.  In most game modes you are given instructions through your phone by a unknown individual helping you escape the area but of course you need to complete certain tasks let it be taking out a fire to holding a location for a bit. There is of course a few pieces in some of the maps that hint what is going on, as more content comes out the more players will understand or piece together a story about the zombie outbreak.The developers have also started a comic series free on their site to tell more about the story. It's rather interesting and shows a bit more about the outbreak. It's worth the read. Gameplay=======The gameplay breaks down to modes  and humans vs zombies. Mode 1 = EscapeThis mode is pretty much the story driven type, as you start the map you will be thrown at the start location , from there you follow the text messages on your phone and complete tasks that will lead to your freedom. However there are a few twists, for one if you play online anyone that is killed will become a zombie creating a hard situation to deal with as they are a bit faster and annoying :P , second the objective path will change each round for example one route will have you go through a gun store to the gas station where the next round will get you to enter a threatre and push towards the bank. This randomness adds a bit more fun and reply value to enjoy.Mode 2 = HuntedYour shoved in the middle of a free for all. All humans are against each other nothing else matters, ammo is everywhere as well as guns so go out and murder your fellow humans because hey the world is over anyways. Remember though ...everyone you kill will become a zombie that might end up helping you become the last survivor or could be your undoing and lead to your demize.Mode 3 = Extraction You are randomly thrown to one of many spawn locations on the map, you may be with fellow survivors if you play online or by yourself. Your mission is straight forward head to a random location which you will find npc survivors needing help, you need to hold the location for a set amount of time then extract them...just remember the further you complete the objectives the more zombies start spawning at the next location one and anyone that dies will become a zombie and are forced to try and stop you from saving those npcs. Mode 4 = PanicI can't say much for this one as I haven't been able to find a room for it. It looks rather interesting. Humans vs Zombies =Human players have the ability to use melee weapons , guns , med kits and special items such as bolt cutters and keys to progress their story. Humans also have the ability to instant kill zombies with their melee weapon if they sneak behind a zombie which is nicely shown with a kill animation. Humans also have the ability to turn into zombies if they take enough damage or meet the random chance of luck.....as time passes your screen will become grey and your sound will become very quiet until the final moment of your scream in which you turn into those you have been killing this whole time. Zombie players are nothing special, they aren't L4D special zombies where they take damage or dry hump the survivors to death. When you think about they are very weak, one shot to the head and your dead. However player zombies do have some abilities, one is roar which allows you to call near by zombie npcs to your aid, they will follow you and also you can give them a waypoint to charge. Zombies can also jump, crawl , break down doors and grab players biting them and giving them a chance to join your rank by infection. Overall=====The game is something different , at times it does feel like the mod No room in hell which is a good thing. The concept and direction of where the game is aiming is awesome however there are many issues such as zombies getting stuck to players abusing broken mechanics such as throwing keys or cards under desks or objects that will force players to a halt as they can't progress forward . The story is also non-existence until the comics came out but then again what zombie game really has the full picture as the concept of a zombie outbreak is always based on the idea of pure chaos and pieces of information which does work out. Should you buy it============For coop = Yes it's rather fun and enjoyable For singleplayer = Not really worth it as it becomes very dry after the second run.For PVP = if you can get into the 20 player servers it can get pretty crazy and fun. But if your just going for pvp and not big on coop then might want to wait until a sale day. Final Remark:My fellow survivor decided to be a jerk by taking all the ammo for everytime of weapon even the ones he didn't have....so I decided to show him the reason why not to be greedy by dragging a mob of zombies into one room which killed me and then grabbed another mob and fellowed the survivor....the end was rather enjoyable as he finally understood that a bathroom wasn't the safest place to hide during a zombie outbreak.

												I've played this game for some time now, and I've changed my mind quite a bit. At first I thought it was a great game with addictive gameplay, but somehow it just died. Rather than fixing bugs the devteam seemed to focus more on a new map. Would I recommend this to you? No. The animations are horrible, there's still no lobbysystem and it's just full of glitches. If you really want to try this game, buy it on sale for a maximum of 5$. Over and out			"

												Pretty decent Zombie survival game,it could use some tweaking to make it more enjoyable and maybe a few more details to it could help improve the lifespan of this game. Its great to play co op but its has some side effects to it.Overall its a great game but not for the base price it sells at, Its better to buy it on sale for around $3.00 which i think is a more suitable price for this game.

												-Review for release version-First off, I have no idea why this is getting so many negative reviews.  This game is hands down one of my favorite video games *ever*, and not without reason.  I'll split this review into three sections:The Co-op Game ModesCo-op is IMO, one of the weaker aspects of the game, but even then manages to be pretty good, if co-op is your thing.  Extraction is my favorite of the two team modes, where you must find survivors hiding in their homes, defend them from zombies, and get them to the edge of the quarantine zone.  The sheer number of zombies pressing in on whatever stronghold you happen to be in is enough to cause panic at the worst of times.  Add the zombies ability to climb into the mix, and often you'll watch a friend as a hungry mouth stretches through a window to bite him.The NPC survivors are admittedly not the brightest, but it's nothing game breaking.PVP- The Hunt I know that Contagion is primarily marketed as a co-op game.  Do yourself a favor, and play the pvp.  It's the best.  Playing with friends makes it better than the best, weather you team up and destroy the opposition, or just save a bullet for them.  The gamemode is last man standing, with players scavenging for weapons and ammo while hunting each other and avoiding the undead.This mode is a beautiful mix of stealth and combat, chasing and hiding.  Each weapon has it's own niche, and even the weaker ones are often so cool that you can't help but use them.  You are forced to make choices on the fly as you hunt your prey, but do your best not to be trapped by the roving hordes.  Any gunshot alerts the dead to your location, and players can easily deduce it too by watching the movement patterns of the horde.Headshots are always an instant kill, with the exception of the sig, which is an instant kill 90% of the time.  Choosing between spraying with your assault rifle or taking a careful shot with a crossbow to avoid making noise is the lifeblood of this game. General gameplay I struggled not to mention most of this stuff throughout the rest of this review, as it factors into everything else.  Too make it short and to the point:Melee- Simply amazing.  Swings take chunks out of zombies and snap their bodies in the direction of your blow.  Make sure to aim for the head.  Against players, one hit is usually enough to down them, but it's difficult to get in close.Gunplay- Each gun has a perfect feel and balance based on it's type.  Admittedly, in the beginning I thought the hit detection was off, but then I realised the the recoil has more of an effect than I realised.  Taking your time for that perfect shot is super-satisfying.  Again, zombies lose chunks of flesh, skull, and brains as you shoot them.  You can even blast their legs off.Explosives-  Deserves a seperate section, despite having only two tools, the grenade and the IED.  Both are VERY powerful, in a good way.  If you aren't careful, you'll end up killing yourself.  Zombies caught in the blast will often lose their legs but survive, so watch for crawlers.Gore-  As mentioned multiple times before now, the gore is exactly what a zombie game should have.  Skulls break, arms are chopped off, legs get blown into nothing.  As of the latest update you can even decapitate zombies.Rating- 8/10, only critisims are that the game needs more maps, and slightly better co-op.  You will not regret buying this game.			"

												Pros- Teamwork is encouraged.- Solid gameplay mechanism.- Each stage has a random direction (paths, items and objectives), offering some replayability value.Cons- Too few maps in each game mode.- The idea of being a zombie after death defeating the co-op purpose.- Humans vs Humans is rather nonsense.- The highest difficulty is too ridiculously hard (Even with teamworks).I give this game, 7/10			"

												It is a really good game and it is also very realistic. The only issue I have with it is that the weapons spawn randomly and one time I searched the only building in this one map and I only found nailguns. Which don't kill zombies. Also the view isn't  exceptional so I have a hard time navigating buildings, expecially when its very dark and I am on a time restraint. I really like this game and I really like the idea of it, its just that its hard to survive a zombie apocolpse blind, but confident the barricades are still up, and this is enough for me to not enjoy this game as much as it could.

												After almost two years and over 200 hundred of hours of gameplay, I can not recomend this title to anyone else. The community is mostly dead and many of the things promised by developers have not been added. I do enjoy this game at times, but your hard earned money would be better spent on a game that has a community and developers working on it. Graphics are generally smooth, there is a small choice of weapons that can be very glitchy at times, players like to troll by becoming a zombie, inconsistent nerfing of zombies, and much more. Overall, besides the levels being somewhat random in the pathing, there is nothing else you will be missing here. I bought this game for a dollar when it first hit the scene, I suggest you wait for a sale of the same magnitude. This game is definately not worth 20 dollars. There are other zombie games worth the twenty, save it for them.			"

Surprisingly, this game played Much better in the early access beta stages. I'm not sure the Devs even bother to play their own game, because if they did, they would easily find and fix the various minor issues that spoil the potential of this game.			"

I'm not sure what's so difficult about giving players the ability to party up but that's a sure sign of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game when players can't easily play with friends.Pros:- Zombies, I always like zombies- Varied game modes which allow players to fight each other while also running from zombies.- Weapon varietyCons:- Garbage controls. Other than classic WASD first person shooter controls it just feels clunky- Matchmaking- Hitboxes are odd when dodging zombies and attacking players			"

Contagion tries to combine co-op and versus simultaneously, which on paper sounds great but is executed horribly. With player zombies zig-zagging and crouch spamming to dodge bullets combined with the abhorrent net code, versus is a chore. Sadly co-op gets old fairly fast as well.5/10 "

												This game offers some of the best coop online play. With 5 current game modes featuring Escape and Extraction requiring cooperative team work, Panic Objective and Panic Classic for Survivor vs Player Zombie team pvp, Hunted for Open PVP, and soon more game modes. Each map features multiple paths for the play through and numerious and variable weapon drops. Every week more and more user made maps are getting added to the Workshop and the Developers are adding 3 new maps by the end of the year with more coming next year. The comunity is very active and most experienced players are willing to help new comers learn the ins and outs of each map and game mode. Easiliy one of the best indie games on steam right now.			"

												Contagion is a first-person, cooperative multiplayer that takes various approaches and scenarios of a zombie apocalypse into a video game. Contagion is a sequel (?) or a spiritual successor (?) to Zombie Panic: Source, which is a free multiplayer mod.  Does the game stands apart from other zombie games? Is it worth playing? What about the replay value? Let's find out. Contagion has a problem on standing out from other zombie games. There is no uniqueness or distinct flavor for this game. Escape Mode is one of the most common gameplay feature where you (and your friends or other players) have to do objectives while trying to get to the extraction point and not being killed on the way there. Escape Mode does have a ""moderate"" replay value, but most of the time is wasted on backpedaling to an old area to get something or do an objective. This leads to quick boredom and it kills replay value. This mechanic seems familiar to Left 4 Dead's AI Director system in terms on what items are located (along other things), but to go back to a cleared area to do an objective is a bit, odd. In the other hand, Escape Mode can be enjoyable if you have a group of friends to play with (and if your friends really enjoy it). Escape Mode seemed to have died out very quickly and that gameplay feature is the most popular one. Try to play PVP mode? Good luck on that. The main problem for Contagion is that the player population is very low and the daily numbers are abysmal based on Steam Charts. Contagion does have sale promotions on the Steam Store to get other gamers to buy the game (as it was shown in Summer, Halloween, Autumn, and Winter Sales), and the results varied. Overall, Contagion is typical, bland, and certainly identical to other zombie games. Contagion was in development for a good amount of years and doing a Kickstarter to help ""fully"" develop the game is in question that the reader or gamer would have to judge for themselves. A summary...1. Is the game worth $20 or regional equivalent? Definitely not. 2. Are there updates and DLCs for the game? As far as I am concerned, there was a DLC recently released as a update (and it is free). However, the time span between updates are terrible. 3. Replay value? It varies from ""moderate"" to downright dreadful.4. Sale price of $5 or less (including its regional equivalence)? Your choice. For me, it is not. I would not recommend it unless you are an avid gamer who likes zombie games. It's a buyer's beware, and take serious accounts from pros and cons for the game from different reviewers.  "

												I have thoroughly enjoyed this game so much that I wanted to write a review. Let me start off by saying there are PLENTY of zombie titles on Steam for around the $20 pricetag, except none of them deliver as much as Contagion does. This game is so much fun to play, even if you decide to play escape mode alone, it's still a blast to play. This is my go to zombie game every time. The graphics are great, I have no complaints there. They really do a great job in the graphics department. It's just so pretty and smooth. The guns each have there own feel to them, you don't feel like you are using the same gun like in most games. The game modes are some of the best, you can play escape mode which is more objective and obviously you do the objectives to get to the end to escape. The best part is its all randomized so you never play the same objectives and can throw you for a loop just when you think you know what to do. There is Hunted mode which is PvP based and is so much fun, there aren't any Panic servers I don't know why but I haven't gotten to play that game mode. Extraction is very challenging, especially if anyone died and becomes a zombie, you really have a tough time and adds to the suspense. The very fact you can be a zombie is huge in this game, they do it right. If you die too many times as a zombie though you will stop respawning and you become a spectator which can really bum you out, Only negative thing about the game is that. I love playing all the game modes however, and there are plenty of people to play with. They really emphasize the headshots in this game, and if you dont you will run out of ammo SO fast and you will die. I have nothing bad to say about this game, and the developers are still working on this amazing game and are about to release a free DLC to us buyers with 2 new maps 4 new guns and more. You will not regret buying this game, it is a blast to play.			"

												so, up front this game tries to do what L4D does, only realistically. depending on the difficulty, you can have A: plenty of supplies/minimal zombiesor B: you get two bullets per player and only headshots can kill the massive endless hoarde of zombies. the inventory system does help to promote teamwork as you can only carry 4 items at a time. this includes healthkits, keys, flashlight, and weapons. sharing is caring in this game because you will run out of ammo. the accuracy of most weapons is a bit..touchy, but overall a headshot is a guarenteed kill. just be careful because every hit from a zombie has a chance of infection (server preference) and once a player zombie spawns, the difficulty cap starts to kick in.because of the accuracy issues of the weapons + the sometimes laggy servers, player zombies have the run of the field and most other players will give up just to restart the round.maps are usually a form of escape mode or ""hostage rescue"" where the players work to get from point A to point B with certain map variations (randomly generated objectives or closed off paths which force going a different way.) as much as one would thing this would help with the repetitive nature of the game....it doesn't. you'll still be doing the same thing over and over, but in a different path. the game is probably the most terrifying when played solo, but it's also the most difficult if you don't know what you're doing or where to go. speaking of navigation, all you get is a phone giving you a general location to move to and a waypoint marker that has a hot or cold proximity counter. the instructions aren't always clear so get ready to be lost and confused for your first playthrough. objectives and instructions are given through a sort of text message system by one of the player characters (or just texting yourself solo) while realistic, it can be distracting to try and read your phone while being attacked.there is a multiplayer versus mode as well, which is a deathmatch scenario with zombies thrown in for fun, but those servers are hardly ever populated.overall it's an ambitious title that tries too hard to be realistic. you'll enjoy it for about a week unless you're a true co op zombie fan.

												I don't recommend the game, not because it's ""bad"", but because it's mediocre. There's nothing really special about this game to recommend it to anyone. I got it on sale, and it's given me about 20 hours of moderate fun, so I'd say I'm satisfied. Don't pay any more than $5 for this.Pros:- It's fun to shoot zombies- The Sig Sauer is really fun- The flashlight looks great- Boarding up a house and then shooting zombies through doors is really cool- Big levelsCons:- Zombies are only really affected by headshots. Contagion prides itself on being more realistic, but a .45 ACP to the chest will slow anything down - as it is, anything other than a headshot is wasted ammunition.- Guns sound bland, except for the Sig Sauer. I really wish game developers would take field trips to gun ranges to hear what guns actually sound like, rather than just relying on movies.- Too much bullet spread. If guns were as inaccurate as they are in this game, nobody would use them. I pointed a rifle at a wall about 20 meters away, didn't move the mouse, and fired five times, waiting enough time in between each shot for the rifle to settle down again. I checked the wall and there were five different bulletholes. At 20 meters, you should be able to put a round in the same place all day long.- It isn't cognitively demanding at all. If you try to take it slow and be smart, you'll be disappointed, as every encounter ends up being a non-stop headshot fest.Overall, I think they could've done better. It feels like it's in Early Access, or something that might have once appeared on XBox Live Arcade. Underwhelming stuff.			"

												Great idea, poor implementation and little to no support from the developers. This game had potential, but nobody updated it. Core gameplay is fun for about 30 minutes and then it's just boring. Guns are hard to find, and when you do find them, they usually have no ammo. Zombies are impossible to kill unless you aim for the head. Melee weapons are very dangerous, especially around your own team.There is no system to report cheaters or trolls. The multiplayer is almost dead and the few who do play are experienced players who show no mercy for new players - meaning you would get your♥♥♥♥♥beat every time you bothered playing.Play another zombie game. This one isn't worth your time. If the developers wont put any time into improving this game - why should you try playing it?			"

												My review for this  game a while ago was far better and intuitive than this one is.But that is because Ive had this game since day 1 and it was A MAZING when it was released. Im not kidding, the whole concept of a ultra-realistic permadeath zombie game was fun (Dont you ♥♥♥♥ing mention DayZ. We dont talk about DayZ.). Thats what this game was advertised to be in the first trailer.Now all I see is a game that is using new updates and content to try to revive a community that they failed halfway through their Early Access period. Seriously. Lack of content, udpates, and everything. I supported this game even after that happened but nothing has changed since then but content amount. Yes, this games good with a few pals.But when I look at this game I just see a game trying to make its supporters forget the fact that they werent thought about earlier on and I dont feel like I should endorse that kind of treatment.But to those who do find enjoyment in this game, I applaud your persistence cause you certainly have more confidence in this studio than I do.EDIT: I've recommended this game to a few friends since Contagion has gotten better reviews lately and slightly more work put into the content. We'll see how it goes. Don't play this without friends, though.			"

												Barely got a chance to play this game before entering a PUBLIC serer and being asked to leave because it was a private match as were most servers in the game, overall a very unfriendly community. The game is really just not finished the preview makes it look so much better than it is, the graphics are atrocious and there is few options for a server (Especially with anti-cheat). I did not enjoy this game a single bit though I didn't play long I didn't need long to find that the game just wasn't at all what I was expecting it to be. My advice don't waste your money until these guys work out the bugs, fix the graphics, and maybe the community shifts to a more open and diverse community.			"

												The game is...okay, by zombie standards. Nothing super impressive. See a zombie? Kill it. Oh! See another? Kill that one, too. Its the usual run-of-the-mill zombie killing fest we have seen on the uprise the past few years. Graphics are a little dated, being Source and all, although Source is indeed a friendly engine, they should have waited for Source Engine 2 to come out. Animations are very stiff, even for a zombie game. Zombie motions seem generic. Although it could be a placeholer for more intricate animations later on, so it is tolerable. Its small details that are easy to overlook. Glitches with holding certain weapons/items are apparent (Wielding a fire extinguisher like a shotgun, for example, or the third person melee swing animations never matching first person animations, which causes hit registration problems in online play, only. Single player is unaffected to my knowledge)The sound quality is grainy, unfortunately. The Moans/groans of the zombies can sometimes (about 40 percent of the time) overlap, causing a sound that is akin to flies buzzing in your ear. Most of the time, though, it is drowned out with gunshots and player dialogue. The Player Dialogue, though, is limited at this stage, although there is much room for improvement. Certain situations like finding weapons could in the future have callouts (Like ""Hey, shotgun here if anyone needs it!"" Or ""Pistol ammo, here!"" Or something similar, since most of it can be overlooked by mistake by players that are not as aware) Now, one feature that I would love to see would be a voice feature to attract zombies. Picture, if you will, a scenerio where one player has very low health, most of the team can escape, but this one guy, one good hit and he is gone. He could use the last of his life to go on voice chat and use his actual voice (through the computer microphone) to attract the horde towards him, thus allowing the rest of the team to get to safety (Make an achievement for this, perhaps, too?)DLC Announcements for this game were announced mid to late 2014, and were pushed back, I am certain there were reasons beyond what has been stated. Maybe so, maybe not, is that our concern? No. Things happen. It is a part of life.There are some issues with voice chat, although, from the developer response, it is from the limitations of the Engine itself, not to any fault of theirs. Solution? Use TeamSpeak or another outside client, seeing as this game was more meant to be played with friends, rather than total strangers.All things considered, the game DOES have massive potential that has yet to be tapped into! Tatsur0 and group, I apologize about any misunderstandings before, and I wish you the best of luck in the future of Contagion! I will change and add to this review as the game develops. I cannot wait to see what you have in store for us!			"

												Contagion, the game I love the most.This is my review on a little game called Contagion.  It's had alot of work put into it and I find it to be my faviorite game. It may not be the game I give a reword on for being greatly put together, but it sure has become adictive. TO A PERSPECTIVE(NOT IMPORTANT)Contagion is one of those games that you'll meet intresting people on. Mostly people from diffrent contrys who don't know what your saying like Gemens and ""Vikings"" but people all the less. Contagion was released in the time of zombie games, and was one of the most inhabited by diffrent races looking for a good goul game to play.  I started playing when my brother bought me the game when on sale. I found myself trapped in a dark place the first time I played it. Surrounded by people saying things like (UNCIARR) and (TOLLA CARBIAC TUE?) I was realy confused. Then one day I found myself a translator, someone speaking both english, spanish, and german! He guided me through the small frazes that they used and most important tought me how to survive the harsh world full of sludge monsters that ooze blood when you shoot them. I was and still am young at the ""video gaming experience"" so at every sight of one of the monsters I felt myself fill with cold shivers. But then when I learned the game everything came to a stop, than rewinded and made me what I think is a ""pro player"" and am now playing this game more than any other. Anyway on to my review.GAMEPLAYContagion fits into a catigory of a ""Team Work Game"" meaning you usualy in most of Contagions gamemodes need to work together. It has a survival of the team and not a survival of the fitest feel at most times, and is enjoyable with friends. They have fixed most glitches from the first time I played and it feels to run nicely. It has a fair amount of gamemodes with their own original touch to them. New maps would be great, as their are not that many courently in the game.PROBLEMS/GLITCHESThis game seems to have grown from the first time I played it in that it does'nt seem to have many glitches. Yes, ocasionaly you will find a zombie stuck in the stairs or a zombie to be walking on water like it was Jesus, but overal I havent seen many at all in the last few hours I've played. COMBATEThe combate in this game is dull, it seems to lack what its potentual leads on to seem in that its worse than it seems. Trying to melee a zombie easily is imposible, but it does make up for this with its smart takedowns ability. The weapons are great and fairly acurate to what it would seem like when firing in other first person shooters. At times the zombies melee is a bit to fast for the player and thier speed is a bit to out of hand, but besides that it seems ""ok"".ABILITY/LIMITSThe graphics are quite decent for a game like this, and then running first person view animation is fantastic. REPLAYABILITYIts diffrent gamemodes alow it to be played many times, and since its all different depending on what kind of team you get or what kind of weapons you find, it gives it lots of replayability. No glitches rune it making it very playable, and in the next year I could find myself dropping time like a bomb on this one game.ONLINEThe servers can be played on very easily and even with bad internet you can still play it quite well. The other players on it seem to be very kind and acceptable, especialy considering you don't know what they are saying most of the time with thier strange little accents.REVIEW I gave this game 88.9/100 on this game because of its replayability and online formate.

												I’ve played most of the zombie games recently available. Contagion is easily my favorite. The only other game that comes close is the Nazi Zombies series. As an adult gamer, I don’t have much time. I play at least once a week with my friends online. We use a mumble server. Voice chat is absolutely necessary as teamwork is insanely important in this game. You will not be able to run off by yourself and survive. I have a dedicated private server. Which is easy to set up and lets us play without trolls or kids. We prefer the coop “escape” mode.The best thing about this game is how brutally hard it can be. Head shots are the only practical way to kill zombies. Ammo is so scarce every single shot counts. It is common to be down to your last two or three shots with zombies on your tail. You can run away, but eventually you will have to stand and fight. Finishing a level is very satisfying and a real accomplishment. The levels are enormous, but well laid out. Some game modes do not have a map, so getting lost is possible.  Once you learn them you will not get lost, as most are fairly linear. The downside is that there are not many maps. The game needs about twice as many maps as it has now. A few people have released maps via the workshop. While most of these are very good, there are not many and few people play them. "

												Reminds me of Left 4 Dead a bit. Pretty cool feature when you die you legitatimely become a zombie as well. From working with team mates to killing them!. There is various types of modes. I always enjoy a good hunt or escape personally. I would def recommend this to anyone for 15bucks!			"

												For anyone in SOUTH AFRICA:The game has potential and I would love to recommend it as a whole, but unfortunately the lack of local servers makes lag a real factor to consider and hosting a multiplayer game seemed to just result in bugs and friends not being able to connect.HOWEVER, for those of you in OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD: This game has a great concept and it looks like it could be a lovely co-op game, with anyone that dies joining the zombies to try and kill you off. It really does look fun and the graphics are decent. I, unfortunately, can't say much beyond that.Ultimately, my friends and I had to refund it because we were always 500ms behind everything always. Such a pity really, it could have been the start of a beautiful love affair...			"

												Good concept but ruined by severe issues (headshots are sometimes broken, you can't get rid of weapon auto-switch, shotgun shells have no cinetic effect, you can shoot 6 shells of remington  in a riot cop at point blank, this has no effect at all... no push back, no impact on gear, just some dmg that you have to stack to kill him).This is really poorly executed and is just one example among huge amount of flaws.Add lags and desynchs, rubberbanding in some servers and your day is complete.Games suffers of major flaws that come to ruin your gaming experience.Badly optimized, bugged like an alpha stage.Overall : not bad and original concept but too much issues. The co-op aspect of game is really good and will require constant teamplay if you want to succeed.That also means that playing with random teams can rapidly become a real bad game, no fun, restart another random s.h.i.t.game, rinse, repeat.. Or better option : swap to fun game.Anyway, despite the really good idea and atmosphere the game produces, the almost constant issues that I meet ruin the fun.Very good idea + bad execution = I can't recommend.4/10			"

												Uninspired gameplay with boring mechanics, inconsistent difficulty that spikes quickly from yawn-inducingly easy to cheap instant-infection-sprinting-laggy-zombie-player impossible as survivors die(PVP in co-op?), obsolete guns(rifles when 2 smg or pistol headshots kill, shotguns when zombies shrug off bodyshots like plastic airsoft pellets), levels that drag on, etc. The only servers that arent usually empty are the pvp deathmatch ones, which shows how attractive the co-op gameplay is.Don't bother with this one.

												At first this game seem to be a worthy investment. It throw out of the window the arcade, repetitive and boring gameplay that standardized L4D; focusing on speed runs from point ""A"" to ""B"" slicing and gunning through hordes of zombies and ""specials"", just to arrive to a ""safe house"" full of weapons and ammo, and repeat the same thing two or three more times in order to finish a map. Contagion focus it self on cooperative gameplay, management of resources (weapons and ammo), map exploration in order to find those resources and find a one of the three randomly generated scape routes. The gameplay is a ""relistic"" survival zombie game, were only head shots kills zombies, attacks from them cause infection and ammo is littely found.The problem is, the game has bugs since it early access like zombie pathfinding, charcters skeletons, animations..., there is no lobby and kick system, to play multiplayer with your friends only you must have your own server, there is only a few maps to play and to make it worst there is no modding community fix that. There characters are lifeless and boring, they only swear bad words and that's it. L4D is FAR MUCH BETTER in that aspect and also in the maps.Contagion has good mechanics, but L4D has better characters, better maps and better modding support. A great zombie game would be the mix of these two games OR a remastered first person edition of Resident Evil Outbreak.			"

												So I had this game gifted to me as soon as it came on steam early access on sale for $5 around December 2013 played it for an hour before giving up and uninstalling. Recently I got a week ban on CSGO and was looking for something to kill time until my ban ended. I played this game again for about 7 hours of May 2015 and there were plenty that has changed.Improvements From Early Access:Loading Times:When this game first came out, the load times were absolutely horrendous. Taking 2-3 minutes to even load a map and 30-45 seconds to load the opening menu. Now using the same computer at launch, it takes 10-15 to load the menu and a minute at the most to load the server.Improved AI:The ai survivors in the extraction mode at launch were basically potatoes. They would follow on command but were unarmed and didn't react to zombies. Now survivors are armed with basics weapons, usually a pistol but I have seen them armed with a shotgun and now react to the zombies.Cons From Early Access:Community: Originally this game and all it's servers were packed from its kick starter hype, finding around a 100 people on 15 servers just on the first tab while I was browsing. Now in May 2015, I can find around 10-20 total in all the occupied servers. What I've seen through steam forums is that monochrome has lost most of its original team, and that promised DLC and kick starter backer bonuses were never delivered. Currently at the moment this community is so small I practically play with tr same guys every night and I practically know everyone's first name and basic information.Regular Review:Just playing as if I had no knowledge of before.So loading this game for the first time again in a year I decided to run a game of Hunted, a game mode of up to 16 people surviving in an open arena until there is one. Unfortunately there was only one occupied server with around 10 people playing on the same map (Aurora States). So I spawn in, the map is a dark zombie overrun surburban neighborhood, and I start with a pistol a baseball bat, and some ammo. I hear the moans of zombies and gunshots in the distance, and quickly run to a nearby house and hide in the garage. I think some of the zombies on the street heard me as I hear the front door starting to break, suddenly machine gun fire breaks out and I hear someone enter the house. Suddenly I hear a player enter the house, because it has irregular footsteps and I hear their flashlight flick back and forth. Paralyzed I aim my gun at the door waiting, as the man is going door to door looking for supplies. Then I hear a crash of the window glass breaking and a hail of gun fire and the screams of a man dying. Probably unaware that anyone else was in the house, he opens the garage door where I immediately pump his body with lead. There I stood, looking at the loot of the two men, with an ar15, a revolver, grenade, and around 80 rounds of ammo. This was the most heart pounding zombie experience I've experienced in a zombie game, including DAyZ Standalone and No More Room In HellPros:Sound: The guns in this game sound fast, and powerful but not too much where it overdoes it. The rhythmic beat of the small caliber mp5, to the thundering sound of the remington sniper, sound responsive and fluid.Controls: Controls feel semi-realistic blending the arcade like movement of hl2 and the movement of Insurgency is the best way I can describe it. However you can see your ammo count, see a stamina bar, and see your health which makes it more of an arcade kind of feel. Infected:Zombies react to noise and sight very well in this game. Run across a street into a home spraying an ar15, and you'll get a horde surrounding you within minutes. Also a very cool element is that everytime a zombie hits you, you have a chance of getting infected, where your screen and sound will blur and turn muffled until you turn. However I wish there was a way to revert it or slow it down like the pills in No More In HellCons:Characters: There is no story in contagion per say, but all of your selectable characters have a ""backstory"" which consists of a paragraph description in the selection menu. How am I supposed to even care about these characters when there's no reason to. Also they have no personalities whatsoever and all have the same 18 or so lines in the quick command bar and don't even seem to know each other. Overall worst cast of chaarcters in a video game, don't even know their names to criticize them individually.Weapon Balance: The weapons in contagion especially the melee weapons are extremely unbalanced. How can a zombie take a full swing from a fireaxe, and live but die from 1 hit on a Kabar Knife. Melee weapons are a joke, and if you find one you should immediately drop it. Okay now you might say, balancing melee weapons is difficult. Well look at No More Room In Hell, a similar game also based on the source engine. In that game, there are heavy swings, which take time to load up and can decapitate zombies, and fast swings which usually don't do anything, both are dependent on the weapon you're using and how much stamina you have left.Melee weapons aside, the main weapon you'll be using are the guns. However these are horribly unbalanced especially against zombies. I haven't played enough to see of it makes a difference against players in hunted, but here every gun can one tap a zombie with one well placed headshot. Whether it's a high powered sniper, or your 9mm starting handgun, it all feels the same. Also there doesn't seem to be a bullet dropoff damage, as I can get kills with a colt from about 30 meters away with a headshot. Compared to no more room in hell, .22 or 9mm ammo takes 2 headshots to connect, meaning you'll need to use .45 or higher to get a 1 hit headshot.Music: Bland, forgettable, don't even remember how it sounded most of the time. No contrast either? Always stays at the same volume except in a loading screen when it starts to fade out.Lack of Maps: Maps are very limited, and the community is fairly dead, so no new maps are coming out to play on via modding workshopLack Of Map Change or Vote Kick: Servers seem to be stuck playing the same map over and over with no way to change the map,meaning once you beat a map, you just play it again. So that means everyone is stuck playing one extraction server on Aurora Estates, and escape on Roanake PD. Also we can't vote kick any trolls, and with a severe lack of community, I've never seen a server admin who could helpLevel Progression:Playing a coop map such as Escape on Roanake PD is especially unfriendly for new spawns. Instead of placing a checkpoint t to spawn new players, they spawn right at the beggining, leaving them up to 3-9 objectives behind everyone else which is something that should've been fixed a long time agoOverall:Pretty average zombie FPS with some cool ideas but poor execution, and the community has suffered from it in terms of number, and overall support for this game. Score 6/10Would reccomend buying if $5 or less and to buy in a bundle to play with friends Would recommend playing No More Room In Hell-Better Weapon Balance-Active Community-Active Modders With Maps (ex. played on the walking dead prison) "

Review as of 8/11/2016TL;DR Only recommending if you have friends to play with, otherwise it's boring/dead (no pun intended)OverviewContagion is a Zombie survival game with an emphisis on gunplay and spooky areas. The game itself plays very well, and is actually pretty fun. It contains many different modes which I will further go into detail nowEscapePlayers must work together to complete all the objectives and escape. Objectives, items, and pathing are random, so each play through is different. Any survivors that lose their life along the way will return as infected and must eliminate the remaining survivors before they complete the objectives and escape. This is esentially the story mode, as there are some events that happen and much of it is scripted.HuntedThis is a PvP game mode where the last survivor standing is the champion. Supplies are scattered throughout the map randomly. On death, much like Escape, you turn into a zombie with the goal of killing all other players. ExtractionPlayers must work together to protect civilians and help them escape once the rescue vehicle arrives. Once you approach the location of the civs, zombies will start hording around the house. You must use the supplies at the location to defend yourselves from the zombies until the rescue vehicle arrives.Escape is my favorite gamemode because it has the most story!ProsCreepy atmosphereFun gunplay (for the weapons that are there)Not too easy (like L4D2)WorkshopConsDevs abandoned the gameWorkshop is mostly just phone backgroundsNot many servers with people in them (not dead, but there's just not many people playing)Few weapons "

												The game itself has some potential, its fun to play with friends and can be fullfilling to do alone. But the game lacks content. The game could be a good one and worth the money if it had more maps, more gamemodes, more weapons, more zombie variations and better music for background, weapons, environment and zombies.The game also lacks any form of character customization. If you are not going to put that freedom in a survival game then atleast build up a nice storyline around the present characters maybe even with their own pro's and con's.beside all this the game can be fun for a little while when played with friends but eventually (around 1- 3 hours) it's get really boring and you know any bush and tree in this game. My message to the creators:- make improvements to the sounds in this game- try to add 4-8 new zombie models (atleast), more is always better- Add new weapons and ways to modify them- more maps, play with heights like walkways and tunnels. make a scary shipyard with huge rusted boats. make a map that you are inside a giant mall with several floors with shop you can go into and small rooms in the back ect.- more game modes. if you make it fun to have several things to do you will automatically play a game much longer, its that simple. there are ALOT of modes you could think up that would fit this kind of game.overall score (5 stars max):2 out of 5 starsI hope they will keep working on it and will add in new stuff to make the game better and worth the cost of the game. Hopefully they will not screw their buyers and ask money for additional DLC.			"

												I was following this game when it was annouced for the first time back in the day.I was hyped about it and i couldnt wait more for it, when it came out on kickstarter i was amused, but sadly i couldnt afford for backing monochrome back then.When it was released on steam i had the moneys so i bought it and i noticed it changed a lot compared to the alpha videos on the official youtube channel.So heres my conclusion, these are my pros and cons about this game:+ Its a spiritual sucesor to ZPS, so you can feel it has a little bit of it, it even has a Panic gamemode which tries to be faithful to the original mod+ Hunted mode is the gamemode that i spent a lot of time playing it back then+ I like games that needs cooperation, and the matches i have been back then i encountered with people that was very communicative with the players and started helping each other.- Now theres no activity on the servers, looks like the game is already dead.- Flatline mode needs some fixes, like other stuff in the game.- I have experienced some bad optimizations on the framerate on other pc's/laptopsWell, if you liked ZPS you definetly need this game, but i suggest you to organize a match with some friends because its rarely to find a server full of people to play with.

												I really want to love this game but you can't even play all the levels after installing (missing textures). The modes are good and the game had a lot of potential but the bugs are too harsh and the game still feel like early access. All of that could have been forgiven and I would have given a positive review but for the killing blow... the game has been abandoned by the devs. Yeah there was an undate towards the end of last year but that 5 months after a previous update and it’s now very late March, so another 5 has gone by.Actually, the real killing blow is the dead servers. If you want to play it now, you better have some friends who want to play it too.I wanted to love this game, I gave it more chances than any other EA I have purchased but as it is now, I can’t recommend it at all, to anyone. There is nothing this game does that another game doesn’t do better, heck, there aren’t even and combinations of factors that this game has that other can’t do better. That didn’t need to be the case, it just needed to not be shelved by the devs.			"

												  Early access had me interested because I was pretty skeptical at first. ZP:S was something I had a personal disdain for, but playing this back when it first got EA'd had me pretty well hooked. Then I stopped, couldn't really find occupied servers that didn't have 300-400 ping, and overall got pretty annoyed with exploits that left me DED.  Came back recently to see the new DLC and maps, still wasn't all that blown away, or even entertained. Would be alright if zombie players didn't crouch-spam their way to victory, or even had people to play with. Not even my friends want to bother re-installing it.   Oh well.			"

												A cool take on genre on paper, but executed kind of poorly. Game is made on the roots of HL mod: Zombie panic .Slow romero style zombies, limited resources such as ammo, scavenging gameplay. Escape and extraction modes are what in my opinion make this game feel unique. Feels there could be done more with the source engine, though the game looks great.Not sure if worth the full price, but you get your moneys worth on sale.			"

												This game adds one more in the zombie genre with a fresh air of real survival, giving you no more details, like a real citizen in a real outbreak would be, so nothing of a crosshair, hints of where you have to go and a very limited inventory.This makes the game a bit more harder, the only thing you got to really know what to do it´s your phone, and it´s not quite informative as you would like.The most important thing, the game itself is a slower phased Left 4 Dead and more dangerous, because if you got surrounded by a horde, you can say you are already dead and also, the game relies in a heavy multiplayer support so if you are going to adventure alone, you are going to have a hard time, even in the easiest difficulty.In conclusion, this game is a good choice if you have another 3 friends willing to acompany you, but if you don´t have´em, don´t bother, the game is almost dead and there are some bugs here and there that will make you swear now and then.

YouTube™ Video: Contagion: Impressions 

			Views: 640		

			Contagion: Impressions Today we talk about Contagion, a first person zombie multiplayer game. It may seem like a Left for Dead clone at first, but when you get into the game, you'll start to see it's...		

Above is my impression of the game.Contagion at first glance might seem like Left 4 Dead, but when you get into it, it's actually very different from the L4D series. Rather than a linear map, or run and gun game play, Contagion features an open map level design, and conserving resources such as ammo is key to your success. The game can get hectic with 8 player multiplayer and will involve some discovery by the player to progress through the game. It still has a few rough edges here and there, but overall it's a pretty enjoyable experience. Pros:- Open world environments- Co-op or PvP game modes- Interesting player to zombie game mechanics- procedurally generated objectives and item placement Cons:- Open world can leave players lost at times- A few bugs and quirks that still need ironing out- Zombie game play lack luster after a couple of tries			"

												OH MY GOSH!!! ONE OF THE BEST ZOMBIE GAMES EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!! Ok ok here it is. It really dose not have a story line.But one of the most realistic zombie shooters out there and besides killing zombies you get objectives from a random guy of your phone.I call him greg anyway.It is better than Dead Rising which I am a huge fan of.But you should get it if you love first person shooters and zombies. I rate it 10 out of 10.			"

												I'm surprised at how well the features have been implemented into this game! It took me quite some time to pluck up the courage to buy it and I'm not regretting it. The game looks good and plays well, there's plenty here for you both offline and online. Being able to control the horde as a zombie is a big plus!!! The level design is pretty impressive both gameplay wise and art style! And the game boasts some great shaders at work, game really looks great!My only real crits are:Melee attacks feel very slow and restrictive.Some game modes once the ai zombies have been cleared out of certain areas the game can feel empty.No Soundtrack DLC (I know there's not much music but I'm really in love with the main menu and loading music, would buy!).The game is often on promotion and its worth picking up fo sure!

												I do not recomnend this game if you enjoy Fast Paced Zombie games. I spent the only time playing this game as a Zombie. The most horrible, boring thing you could do, and it seems that unless you're a very good player as a human, you will be stuck playing a Zombie for a very long time. Zombies have small abilities which allow you to track the other humans, command zombies you've added to your group and such. However, a single shot to your head will reset you a real far way away from players and the footprints that you're supposed to follow bug out a lot meaning unless you have learnt the map, finding your way anywhere is a struggle. This game really is for the die hard zombie player, if you're looking for a game to pass the time, find something else, something fast paced with an easier learning curve.			"

												Rather boring with little opportunity for teamwork and little direction for the player. 'Escape' is slightly better than the other game modes (at least you are told where to go) but there is little incentive to play, so it gets old quite quickly. Mechanics are a little stodgy with melee attacks in particular very hard to execute.This game had some nice ideas but ultimately falls short of being an enjoyable survival game, servers also seem pretty sparse with not that many people around, though I suppose it depends on the time of the day.

												If your looking for a true zombie game this game is for you! This game does use common sense. Such as i have bolt cutters so now i can use it to cut locks. Game does require team work, without teamwork, your team will slowly die off. Ammo can be used quick so only use it when you need too. Can only kill a zombie one way in this game, 1 bullet to the head, or a melee attack to the face. This game was really enjoyable playing with your friends. I found myself 2nd guessing if my friends who told me were not infected were infected.

												Me and my flatmates used to play this game for hours almost every night. We regarded it as the best zombie co op game ever apart from the occasional crash and all was well. Go to play it again after the last few updates. OH MY GOD. What the hell have you done to this game? It now crashes constantly to the point where it's unplayable, the characters now swing their guns all the way from side to side when you look around, which really puts you off - not to mention. THE AIMING. It takes a full second just to point your gun, so basically by the time you're aiming at something other than the floor/ wall and pulling the trigger, the zombies are already gangbanging your face. If you switch weapon while shooting and then switch back to that weapon the game crashes. The zombie ai is now so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that half the time they either don't notice you whatsoever or run in the opposite direction. The revolver is now an utterly pointless piece of junk - it aims slower, shoots slower and reloads even slower. The textures are all bugged out (mostly on the high graphics settings) and basically, the game no longer runs smoothly or even really works. I feel sorry for all the people who paid full price for this, but at least we only paid $5 on sale. Even so, I feel ripped off, and thoroughly depressed. At least I got in over 100 hours while it was still a good game, but seriously devs, you suck. You ruined this game, absolutely ruined it. I miss it. I miss wasting hours doing headshots and pretending it's the apocalypse with my friends, and I want that back. :'(			"

												I have found this game incredibly fun and fulfilling, even with the more limited content available. The slightly slower pacing compared to a run-n-gun zombie shoot-em-up is refreshing as you have to actually scavenge for your ammo and supplies and, especially on harder modes, conserve as much as you can. If you like cooperative play like I do, the escape and extraction modes are fun, especially if you find a good group of people. In escape, you have to navigate a level with some objectives and obstacles that rotate through a couple different scenarios, and in extraction you locate NPC survivors, hold out for a time against hordes, and then escort them to a drop off point. As with any online game, you will probably get in several games with people that aren't as cooperative or skilled, but when you have a good team it's very fun. If you favor competitive play, there's always hunted and panic modes. Hunted is your basic pvp, where players killed become zombies and when there's two left, all NPC zombies charge at the two remaining players. In Panic, one player begins the game infected but may not know it for a few minutes, and the only zombies in the level are the player zombies, while the first player zombie respawns as a SWAT zombie. Human players have to kill the zombies a certain number of times, or survive for like 20-30 minutes to win.All in all, I got the game on sale for $5, and I would say it's the best 5 I've spent in a long time. Yes, some graphics aren't as up-to-date and some animations can be wonky, but it's not distracting to me at all. I would recommend this game even at the 20 price if you think this sort of thing appeals to you.			"

												This game is about survivors and zombies. Typical. First-person shooter, focused on surviving rather than l4d-styled zed slaughter, thought amount of zeds you need to kill is pretty high. What does this game offer: - mostly possible to kill zeds with only headshots or explosives (body shots will deal quite little damage, melee mostly effective on head too);- @40 minutes long maps (varies depending on knowing map, amount of players etc, good team can run escape in @20);- multiple game modes: Escape: follow 1 of 2 possible routes in zed-infested areas to escape; Extraction: find survivors and extract them; Hunted: pvp, where you kill other players (and then they spawn as PZ and try to kill others too); Panic: objectives (player zeds and survivors only, like escape) and classic (1 turning into armored zed and taking down others survivors, till noone left or zed life/time out). Shame, but almost noone plays it now - thought it's kinda quite funny mode; Flatline - currently in beta. This mode is somewhat between NMRiH survival maps and Killing floor: zombies come in waves and you need to fight them off. From NMRiH there are traps in map, from KF - shop between rounds (shop is take what you can, no money required and items are rather unlimited, but seems anything dropped in shop area being wiped out).- 4 difficulty levels, which influence amount of zeds, their attack power, friendly fire, amount of guns and ammo spawned on map (however, PZ lmb attack seems to deal constant damage for any difficulty - only bite [rmb from behind] might be affected in terms of damage, since infection chance does increase);- Equipment: few guns to shoot (3 rifles, 3 auto rifles, 2 explosives, 2 SMGs, 3 shotguns, 3 pistols for 2 types of ammo summary, bow and crossbow) - some even with flashlight attachment, and melee weapons to swing (ineffective unless fully charged head hit or special takedown from behind). Also, sometimes other equipment(gasmask and pocket flashlight you cannot put in pocket xd, wielder for making barricades at doors and windows, keys and keycards, fire extinguishers and boltcutters);- few mods from workshop (mostly - damned useless anime background for phone);- upon death/infection - turning into player zombie and hunting survivors down (or being killed by them and then being roach-spectator after few tries);- decent graphics;- only english as supported language;- zombies: casual, a bit faster, armored (no headshot and backstab instant kill) and player zombie. Sometimes, when ppl cannot use shotgun properly(or going for achievement), crawling zombies.- cards and achievements (atm no achievements for finishing new maps yet);- dedicated official servers for each map and mode, as well as some private servers;- after a while, it's a bit bothersome to play all over the same maps - but it's issue for all games;- not big number of players online - many note this issue, thought i rarely cannot find ppl to play with.Personal opinion - game is somewhat between L4D and No More Room in Hell: alot of guns and ammo for them, alot zombies you need to kill, but mostly only headshots can bring them down and melee isnt 1hit. What i find disappointing - ability to carry 3 assault rifles (98 bullets in) + 150 bullets for them + smg (30 bullets in) + 150 bullets for smg when u`re average Joe without much of pockets and backpack (NMRIH is free zed game and has nice solution for this 1 issue, but has oldest graphics, which is focused on mostly avoiding, not killing everything). Still, for teamwork and shooting zeds game is sufficient enough.However, do note, that you need to train ur skills to land headshots and playing with random people is sometimes.....annoying. If you have some friends you want to play this game with - then it's good, since having team w teamwork can save the day.special note: promised by devs, ALL dlcs and updates are free. So far i have this game - true. Recently they've added few maps and guns and going to add flatline mode.As for soundtrack - well, typical, but when they published it - on-date owners got it for free. Also, it's much cheaper than in other games.			"

 The most underrated zombie game on steam. Contagion is an excellent zombie survial FPS which is fun and requires skill. I was very supprised by the amount of negative reviews for this game is it defientley worth around £10 for the hunted game mode alone. The other game modes are a bit hit and miss, however hunted is a unqiue multiplayer experience which should be played by anyone who is a fan of zombie survial games. In addition I would even go as far to say Contagion has provided me with more enjoyment than more popular games such as Left 4 Dead due to the rewarding gameplay and zombie being a much bigger threat. The graphics are also defientely worth mentioning, when playing on max settings it is amazing how impressive they are. The best looking game I have ever seen on the source engine by far. Don't get me wrong the game isn't perfect but it is definetly a 7 or 8 out of 10 (Especically for steam summer sale price of £3.75). A must have for fans of the zombie survial genre don't be put off by the negative reviews.			"

												This is great game to play with a group of friends.It has a lot of various gamemodes to change up the game a little from time to time. While it is a zombie game, the fact that you can play as the zombies and such after you've died in, for exaple, the 'Hunted' gamemode. In this gamemode you start out as humans and fight to be the last man standing. There's a lot you can costumize if you've created your own game for friends. Like the fact that you can either turn into a zombie and try and kill the remaining humans after you've died in the 'Hunted' mode. Though you can also choose that after the players die, they turn into a disgusting cockroach. I personally found it quite fun, and would strongly encourge getting it if you want to have some fun with your friends in the zombie apocalypse.			"

												PERSONAL RATING 7/10RECOMMEND FOR CERTAIN PLAYERS BUT NOT ALL, READ CAREFULLY! Contagion is the closest thing to being the game equivalent of traditional “George A. Romero” Zombie apocalypse…or max brooks zombie survival guide setting…or the walking dead…you get the picture. Slow, hard to kill…zombies. My review will touch on aspects I feel focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the game. There are plenty of both trust me.GRAPHICS AND ATMOSPHERE-the good-The visuals serve well on initial playthroughs. I honestly felt helpless and weary what could be around the next corner. The stark contrast in environmental lighting made good use of my flashlight. All of it  makes a trigger finger really twitchy. Weather changes with rain in some maps adds nice ambience too.-the bad- My only complaint that the exterior parts of some maps lack of variety, changes in lighting in procedural sort of way could remedy this. Much like the ever changing maps on each walkthrough can stir up silent dread awhile longer. After my first 10 hours or so even on solo play-throughs, the fear diminishes pretty quickly. PVP GAMEPLAY-the good-By far the strongest aspect of the game, players will be served PVP modes on ALL game types. Died as a survivor during escape or extraction mission? No worries, you’ll always have a guaranteed turn as the member of the undead. Cut loose and wreak havoc and fear on your friends and enemies.The game mode Hunted, is specifically catered to this. You can start a game with a group of survivors or a player controlled zombie. Gunning, mauling, and devouring each other till the last man standing wins. Of course, even if you’re killed it’s only the beginning.  Zombie gamplay is present in this mode as well.Even though I fall in the lets say…..%10 of the gamer population that does not enjoy pvp, I’ve actually had fun…given that the company wasn’t too obnoxious or a bunch of hate mongering trolls. Mind you this pleasant experience only occurred once in my 24 hours of total game play. But hey…if you enjoy trash talkin and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥some one off over the mic or text.…this game definitely for you.-the bad-Now for the downsides…. If you’re not big on player versus player….you’ll hate this game. A gratifying experience is slim. The best way to try to enjoy this of this is to wrangle up a group of friends and some how make a private server.  Even that’s not STRAIGHT FORWARD OR FREE, AS IT SHOULD BE.CO-OP GAMEPLAY-the good-When surviving with friends (and at very rare times random players) that have a good sense of teamwork, CO-OP in contagion is tense, gory, and suspenseful  fun!  It requires a lot more thought and planning. Running in with guns blazing has its place but doing it all the time will doom yourself and your fellow survivors….which in most circumstances you DO NOT want…trust me. I admire this pacing cause it’s more of a thinking man’s game.When player synergy is possible reaching extraction points and claiming victory is quite gratifying in a “high five” sort of way.-The bad-9 times out of 10, your co-op mission will fail when joining public games.  Too many things can go wrong such as…. -Having to deal with being lost for long periods of time if joining mid game -Players that join mid-game as zombies can quickly spoil your chances of survival- Uncoordinated player survivors will slow progress to a crawl.-Confusing or vague clues for reaching the next objective The pvp aspect has too much of a presence in co-op gameplay, even if you create or join a server that disables the “infection” or “player zombie” feature. Once you’re dead…you’re out. There should be a optional “left 4 dead” feature that appeals to PVE players, such as being incapacitated into a “bleedout” status. Other players could be allowed a window of chance to aid comrades to their feet when health is depleted, at least for a limited amount of times before death. This would give a nice set of balanced options for PVE and PVP, more appealing across the board. At the moment this game unfairly leans to the latter. SOLO GAMEPLAY-the good-If you wish to truly experience terror and what it means to be prey, initial walkthroughs of extraction and ESPECIALLY escape mode on your own will certainly deliver…. Most likely only skilled players will be able to accomplish this, and victory is so very sweet when you’re able to run screaming toward your escape. I’ve only been able to pull it off twice in each game mode, but man it was thrilling. -The bad-Replay value on your own is basically zero… Even with procedural map generation, throwing yourself at the similar set of objectives the second time around is quite boring and a tedious chore. If a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, this is it… contagion highly depends on group game play to be anywhere near fun or even approachable the second….third….time around. Most likely there’d be never be a forth….If you really want this game to have staying power in your library, bring friends....and some how your own server.... >:(MULTIPLAYER OPTIONS-The good-Contagion is well suited for those looking for PVP for public lobbies. Pick a game mode, join a pub server and you’ll shooting or munching on other players in no time. Nuff said.-The bad-Okay so….-No “friend only” lobby option-No direct private server options-Servers for RENT are available on contagion….-Free private servers can only be created via 3rd party programsWith aspect like these, contagion still feels like a mod and not a developer’s fully released game. Lacking intuitive or direct access to people not accustomed to modding or pc gaming. -FINAL THOUGTS-If you’re looking for a great combination of zombie survival and PVP gameplay, definitely grab a copy.For players that have a strong affinity for co-op fun and thrills..... should think twice though….if you have a dependable group of friends and a means for creating your own servers, then it’s worth a buy.If not….stick to l4d2.

												Hello!So I got this game after watching a Let's play of RoosterTeeth like a year ago. I don't play this game with friends and I've only played Escape mode. I enjoy playing because it's challenging. You get a very limited amount of ammo even on normal difficulty so you need to make every headshot count. Zombies are a bit buggy sometimes, like staying crouched, suddenly moving at a rapid speed, just wrecking you so you get massive aimpunch and aren't able to recover or in very special occasions simply not dieing. I like the variation in armory like having a Scar 20 or a M4a4 (if I'm not mistaken), revolvers or colts and also crossbows and compound bows!Some positives and negatives from a solo player perspective:Pro's:- Challenging- Great maps- Great assortiment of guns- Good voice acting (altough sometimes repetitive)- Maps last between 30mins to 1 and a half hours- Objective rotations (sometimes objectives are different than the last time you played)Con's:- Buggy AI (zombies stay in a crouched position, don't die or simply demolish you)- Flashlight is too bright!- Objectives can sometimes be hard to spot or hard to get to- Accuracy of weaponryAll in all, great fun game, but if you expect top notch quality it might not be something for you. For €10,- I feel like it was a investment well spent.Thanks for reading my review! :)			"

												I think in my opinion this game isn't worth £15. This game still suffers from a few problems even though there are some fun bits in this game. I mostly played the Hunted mode because i enjoyed it the most. Hunted mode is where you go around and try and kill other survivors. If you die then you become a running zombie and try and hunt other survivors. But as soon as it comes down to the last few survivors, it becomes a game of hide and seek. which on a very large map can get very annoying.  I found some glitch spots where you can not get hit from zombies and stay hidden throughout the match. Even some hidden spots where the zombies night vision cant see you.I find that people who start with a SIG than the 1911 have the advantage becuase of the longer clip size and that finding ammo for the SIG is easier than the 1911...or maybe i just suck with the 1911There isn't many maps on this game. Even though the items and map changes a bit each round. I find that it isn't enough for a game that costs around £15. its an okay game but It just needs some fixes and more content. If you're a zombie lover then you'll proberly like this, but i'd give it a miss.			"

												This is the game where you learn one or two levels, fall in love and end up ONLY playing those levels. With that said you will love them! Mine was Bio( Monsanto) tech where we questioned why officer workers have full auto mp5's. I remind you that Monsanto's genetical research is unregulated and fully realizes the threat of zombies or cancer chicken fingers. Arming your workers with submachine guns actually saves on life insurance premiums. The game is great and worth it. Make sure you play with friends you can trust, and not ammo nazies or trolls.  "

												When I first saw the project several months ago, I was very excited about its release.  After purchasing it for $5, I feel the price represented the game accurately, about what you'd expect to see in a gas station bargain bin.  A bunch of my friends that play l4d2 purcahsed it during the same steam sale, and we played it togeher once for less than an hour. We tried it again a few days later but couldn't stand more than 10 minutes of it.  When over 12 people all quit a new game that quickly, a consensus has definitely been reached.  We never made that mistake again.  The lack of details in the graphics and the overall gameplay makes it feel like a graduate student's final project.  The screenshots on the store page are very flattering.  It had some great ideas, but last generation graphics combined with confusing gameplay and lack of features and maps killed the game.			"

												A very bare bones zombie game with plenty of atmosphere and tension which ends up not actually leading to much aside more of the same. Once you've played the game for roughly, fifteen minutes? You know what to expect for the rest of it. Feels like an unfinished, abandoned project of some variety... it probably is. :PHelp yourself to a cringe-worthy comparison I just thought up: Contagion is similar to having questionably good sex which falls short of any form of climax you initially desired, leaving you feeling dirty and just wishing none of it had ever happened in the first place. I hope you enjoyed any sort of imagery I may have created in your head. :)			"

												This has to be the most disappointing game I've come across in a long time. I don't understand how it's gotten positive reviews up until now. The concept is great and the trailers make the game seem that way too. However, once you're in the game, it's just a painful road of confusing modes, horribly done controls, and extremely laggy servers (unless you pay to have one hosted, which I refuse because the game isn't that good anyway).The worst part about this is the lack of tutorial. You are tossed into the middle of extremely annoying zombies and are praying you remember the controls. Dying is a huge punishment since it spawns you as far away from anything as you can. Memorizing the maps is extremely difficult and if you're not spending hours upon hours of figuring that out, you're screwed.I do NOT reccommend this game. I had hope it was go ing to be good, but unless you can pay for a good server and have an highly updated computer, you're not going to have fun. They spent way too much time on the graphics of the game and very little on the actual game play. Horribly disappointing, avoid it at all cost.			"

												Contagion is a zombie game with a good portion of realism. It uses the source engine and allow us players to create custom maps which I love it so much. GamemodesThere are many game modes out there but no tutorial so you are better off by watching the trailer first to get to know about the gamemodes before you get confused will all the new features. For example if you had enough with coop, you can play against other players in a level filled with the walking dead. Main featuresThe main core in this game is that the zombies are slow and they won't die so easily if you don't shoot his brain! This is very important because headshot differs from brainshot here so aim it carefully on the forehead where the brain is located! There is also the infection rate which can be very high depending on the difficulty. One of the unique feature is to turn into a zombie which will happen when you are infected or when you died. Your new goal now is to kill all the remaining survivors. Playerzombie are faster than normal zombies and can roar which makes the zombies follows you. You can command zombies to different places and the blending ability is a skill that will turn you into a regular ai zombie as camouflage until you stop the blend mode.Furthermore the ammo and weapon spawns are all randomly located, the same thing happens on some objectives in escape mode too which boost up the replayability greatly.The gore system in Contagion is pretty well made. If you have a sharp melee weapon you can cut off almost every bodypart from the zombie. If you cut off a leg they will turn into crawlers. Cutting both arms will disable their ability to attack. All the wounds will be displayed even on shooting. You can even do finishing melee moves if you manage to sneak up behind a zombie.OVER 1000 hours!? WHY THE THUMB DOWN?Because I tried everything to keep this community together and keep having faith on this company for two years, but, alas, without luck. I'm a hobby level designer and created the custom map HotZ and I'm also currently working on another project for Contagion called TWZ. The development of HotZ took me almost one year and until now it received regularly updates. Seeing how everything is going downhill due to the bad decisions of Monochrome is incredible frustating and sad for me since I invested a lot of time and effort for this game. I met a lot of nice and helpful people when it was still active but now I just reached the limit. Seeing the people who I know leaving one after another makes me very sad.UpdatesSadly even with all the gamemodes the content seems to be rather small since the whole core team left Contagion and that speaks a lot about the image of Monochrome. The company promises free DLCs but due to those critical hiccups it got delayed pretty long and there is still a lot to do. Even though Monochrome manage to release some new content, it does includes a few  gamebreaking bugs that has been there without any hotfix. Currently this company just stopped listening and responding to the community completely and with Tatsur0 ignoring any post regarding to his own game Contagion... is indeed the worst thing that can happen to a game.CommunityThe community is much smaller than before and it keeps decreasing due to the lack of updates and communication with the playerbase. There is also almost no support when it comes to custom content. That's why we don't see any map related content in the workshop which is quite a shame. The mentioned community interaction on the forum is just a promotion on Tatsur0's (CEO) twitch channel that has very little to do with interacting with the community itself where it really counts.ConclusionThere are many zombies games in steam that focused more in action than on the survival aspect and the consequences unlike Contagion. Contagion is a game that has a deep learning curve which makes the game so special...BUT sadly, the game feels kinda unfinished and filled with a lot of minor bugs. The lack of updates with sloppy results and the lost of the core developers certainly crippled the community to death.Well, think twice before you buy any games from this company but if you really wanna buy it then do it on sale and don't forget to try out my custom map :)

												Contagion follows Zombie Panic (the old hl mod) story and features. Just by saying this you realize this is a game with a community older than 10 years. The fact that when you die as a normal player you become the enemy, a zombie without any of the l4d shenanigans, it's its strongest mark. In my opinion it's one of the best Zombie fps games out there and the devs are one of the most dedicated I've ever known.			"

												Contagion is a wonderful game, but there are some disadvantages that are sort of disapointing :/. #1(Disadvantage:Zombies in Hunted Mode)When you really just want to play with your friends on random maps like with the ""Hunted""mode, it can be fun but dayum it gets really, REALLY annoying. Zombies are actually the annoying ones because they're just everywhere, plus with just one gunshot you attract almost every zombie in the area. If there was a mod that would remove them(zombies)the game would be amazing so then the plaers wouldn't have to worry about zombies killing them.#1(Advantage:Zombies in Hunted Mode)When you get killed as a Survivor you turn into a zombie, the undead can climb walls, roar to basically call other zombies, and attack survivors from behind which if completed to do that the survivor that has been biten will then turn into a zombie in a short but long amount of time. Anyways if there were any players(survivors) camping somewhere, the zombies could attack them killing the survivors so then no one else would have to wait a long time to become a survivor(Every round everybody becomes a survivor just a fyi). But still ZOMBIES ARE JERKS!#2(Disadvantage:LAG)Frag not Lag is a fricken lie for this game so don't believe it -.-. You absolutly have to change the texture settings to medium. If you don't have to do that and can be kept on high with barely any lag, then you my unknown friend is lucky!#2(Advantage:LAG)I HAVE NO IDEA! Or probably you can get past crap easily with less things being able to hit you.#3(Disadvantage:Ring Ring PICK UP THE LOUD RINGTONE!) Okay, in the settings it gives you a choice to what type of ringtone you want. SADLY, all the ringtones are loud and can attract survivors that want to kill you, or zombies that want to eat your flesh. Vibrate is the best one cause it's quieter and doesn't have a long ""tone"".#3(Advantage:Ring Ring, Troll Ring)Ifyou want to troll keep using the loud ringtones, it'll attract players to come to you and zombies. If you know that you wont be able to take down a player cause they're camping somewhere, do a few gunshots and use the ringtone. The stupid thing about that is that the zombies will be coming for both of ya'll. The ringtones can also tell you where other players are by listening for the tone. But warning they cann also call you!IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS OR OPINIONS JUST TELL ME :3, sorry if you didn't like the review or thought I didn't type enough but hey I just felt like reviewing something.

												It's a great concept, executed rather well. The problem comes from other players, who will frequently run ahead to either get themselves killed to grief on the survivors (as it's too easy playing as a zombie - more on that in a bit), or just to finish the map before anyone else, often leaving new players lost and confused.Additionally, it's far too easy to play as a zombie.  Zombies have four times the survivor's sprint, and can duck faster than bullets fly in order to avoid headshots.  Speaking of which, headshots are the only way to kill a zombie, which is fine, but not so much when a shotgun at point blank doesn't even make them stumble. Zombie players will often simply hide around corners, waiting for a player to walk by for a single swipe - hoping to get the RNG on their side for the infection chance.All in all, the game has the potential, but until zombie mechanics are changed to balance players versus zombie players, don't get this game unless it's on sale, of unless you have a group of friends and a closed server (or enough friends to fill a server by yourselves).

												This is a decent game with a lot of potential but in its current state, its pretty bad. Playing solo can be fun but thats about it. The multiplayer is stupid, its fun until people start getting turned to zombies. Then they stop you from going anywhere and the fun is sucked out. Its like a play on left 4 dead that didn't work. Infection is about the dumbest thing in the game. You get hit once and you have a chance to be infected, with no way to cure it. The Server system in the game is also pretty broken. You try to connect to a server and it could give you a variety of errors. Not to mention there is no way to tell what difficulty you are joining on unless you specified for a certain one. Maybe in the future this could be a good, enjoyable game with friends or alone. But as of now, Its not great.			"

If you want to know what the game feels like, it's like a mix of Left 4 Dead and Splinter Cell, its tactical, but extremely fun and has alot of great moments, Everytime you play this game it feels like a new experience.

												This game is really good, but there're no updates since 2015, it has some bugs and clunky mechanics I would love to recomend it, but the game is dead. The game is playable, but the controls and mechanics feels really unfinish, like if they never actually test it, zombie players have so much advantage since aiming is really hard, if a zombie player move in zig-zag and jump or crunch, it's almost imposible for a player to kill it and zombies have like x4 times the stamina of a player, for new players this might be frustrating. Melee weapons are really hard to learn to use, first, if you have a fire axe and a zombie has 1 arm, you would expect to at least have some range advantage over the zombie, but no, since zombies don't get pushed by melee weapons, you can hit the zombie and if you don't move quick enough he might hit you too, I'm not saying this is ""imposible to master"" but it feels like I'm triying to fist fight a zombie, ho! and melee weapons hits use your stamina, so you can't spam swings, but zombies can run and attack.The other thing that bothers me a lot is the GUI, it's so unfinished, if you're playing with a friend or two and any of them turns his/her light on, then it's really hard to aim, the light cone is really strong for other players but not for the one using it so if someone aim with light to the zombies you might have a really bad time aiming to the head. Light bouncing while playing is another big problem in long term, light reflects from ground like if it was a mirror, so is often really hard to ""look around for things"" since you can't actually see the things in the floor, This might or not afect you depending on your eyes, but for me, I can't play for more than and hour or two, because of the light effects.The game is overall really good, the ""real aspect of the game"" is really good made, like the limitted ammo, health and resources, the ambient is really good and it makes you feel that you're there escaping from real zombies, but the lack of content and the high price (9.99 usd at the moment) makes it a bad game, they could easily make it a good zombie game, with a simple tutorial, campain mode with a little back storry in game and easy to host co-op game, charge 2.99 usd and make it a great indie game, but they didn't...

												Great game, love the feeling that some of the ""story"" based Escape maps give. Its something I wished the Resident Evil franchise would always embrace when they started adding multiplayer. Headshots are super satisfying and its a great change of pace compared to faster games like Left 4 Dead.With friends, the game gets elevated to a whole new level. I can't recommend it enough!			"

												This game is still in early development, so if you dislike bugs and glitches, id recommend staying away from this game for the meantime, However once it is released, make sure you buy it!From my experience so far, contagion is honestly one of the best zombie/survival games i have ever played, you have to stay together, or else you may become lost, and if you get attacked, you have a low chance of survival, this game is very fun to play in coop mode, and if you have some money and are considering buying this, do! If you want to know what the game feels like, it's like a mix of Left 4 Dead and Splinter Cell, its tactical, but extremely fun and has alot of great moments, Everytime you play this game it feels like a new experience.

												I have not put much time into this game YET, but so far it is a really fun game solo or with friends. If you are a shooter and zombie lover this is the game for you. I really love how random this game is; you can spawn in a ok location with great weapons or a poor location with bolt cutters. The only down side I ran into so far is some of the maps seem more like a puzzle than a fun zombie map. Overall this a great game. Buy it.			"

												It has a lot of potential. I got it for $3.75 during the Autumn sale and after 30+ have zero regrets about that purchase. It's a lot of fun, especially with friends.EDIT: 100+ hours now. Game is released and there is workshop support for community maps, plus several new maps and modes added since beta. Devs have said that upcoming ""DLCs"" will be free and will add several new maps, modes and characters. Get this game, it is awesome!EDIT EDIT: This game has been out for years now and in my opinion the developers do not understand the meta or what makes their own game fun. My review after 350 hours is that while I enjoy this game very much it has a lot of problems and never had enough players to justify all of the game modes the devs keep trying to add. I recommend picking it up during a deep discount sale if you enjoy Source Engine multiplayer games and zombie themed stuff like I do. Do not pay full price.			"

												Escape: If you've played any of the original Zombie Panic: Source modification, you know escape mode. You and a number of friends play as human suvivors (for now) of a zombie outbreak, having just retreated into the lobby of a deserted and overrun metropolitan police facility and you have to work together and make your escape from the building. Along the way you scavenge for ammunition, tools and supplies to help you overcome the challenges of the facility. As your friends fall, they turn into Alpha Zombies, able to sprint, climb, and jump with abilities normally outside the capability of a Zombie (more akin to a 28 Days Later infected, or an Alien in AvP). Able to access some areas inaccessable to the human players, the quest for survival becomes more difficult as time goes, and the number of Alpha Zombies rises and surpasses that of the remaining humans. The escape route is randomized, keeping the map fresh for many play throughs.Hunt Mode: A well done tense stalking simulation, where you and a number of friends begin as humans scattered amidst a zombie infested suburban community, cul-de-sacs and all, or a quarantine research tent complex deployed in a local municipal park. Each round you must outlast the rest of the players to be the last one alive, whether through pacifist evasion, cooperative efforts, or active negation (killing the other humans Hunger Games/Running Man style) - and as the players fall, they become alpha zombies, just as in escape, making the game progressively harder as time goes on.Two key factors of both the above modes is that the maps themselves are large (in the virtual square footage sense) and structurally randomized in some sense, doors / pathways open in one round may be blocked, locked or closed off in the next - fires and other phenomenon are randomized somewhat as well - keeping the levels fresh for many play throughs. Additional, resource placement (ammo, weapons, tools), is randomized throughout the level as well - the shotgun you found on the receptionists floor may not be there the next time.Contagion uses the Source engine as well, so the movement and feel of the game is on par with other Source games I've played, keep that in mind if you're finicky about those things.My Wishes:   1) While there certainly would be work involved in rebooting and refining a dozen or so maps available for Zombie Panic: Source, I think the effort should be made. I remember several that were quite excellent that I'd like to see make the jump into new & revised Contagion versions, especially with some of the new mechanics granting the classics some new (undead?) life.  2) There needs to be a mechanism to allow unlimited & a selectable number of zombie respawns in Escape mode - sometimes when the randomizer hands the humans a large amount of ammunition and better weaponry early in the map it's impossible for a small number of player zombies (if any humans die at all) to provide much challenged to a well armed troupe. 3) There needs to be voting mechanisms for the usual - key settings, map change, kicking offending players, etc.I haven't played much of the third mode, Extraction, where you must help Counter-Strike-esque ""Survivors"" (I still call them hostages on VOIP in game half the time) hold out in a house until extraction arrives, then escort the survivors to the extraction point, and then a new house gets chosen with more surivors, repeat. As in the other modes, as players die they become Alpha Zombies, making it more difficult to protect the AI survivors. The zombies seem to swarm the hold out point, so a successful strategy I've seen a lot use it to sprint in quick, get the hostages, er survivors to follow you, then run out of the house with them to another part of the neighborhood until the extraction arrives. As the survivors escape, they toss out a pittance of ammunition and the occasional weapon. Since you can only enter the house activated as the hold out point, equipping is rough with a full set of eight or more players, and the escaping survivors don't provide enough resupply (by far) for the mode. I don't know if there's a fixed number of survivors to rescue, or if it just keeps going until all the players / survivors die - just haven't played enough to know.			"

												I played this game for about twenty hours since the sale I got it in 6 months ago. OPTIMISATIONThe first thing I will point out is that the game is greatly optimised unlike most of the zombie games I have encountered recently. I use a amd processor in case your wondering. GAMEPLAY its essentially like left for dead with two differences, you can have a team of eight players and zombies are stronger and less numurous.ZOMBIESthere are normal zombies that can be taken down with headshots and then there is only a one special zombie which is one with a suit of riot gear.GRAPHICS I think they look nice for a indie game, textures are great and lighting makes the game look more realDIFFICULTY it is actually difficult to complete a map in a game starting off, most games have a infected setting turned on so a single scratch can result in a player turning into a zombie and become a enemy to the other players. COMMUNITY majority of players I have encountered in this co-op game are pretty cool and co-operative however you get some rotten apples every now and then. this includes people who hog weapons and ammo and team killers in freindly fire servers who  decide to blow up a pack of C4 in the middle of a group of freindly players. MAPSthe maps change of objectives each time you play them, there are about 5 good maps in this game for the escape (campaine mode). I had fun completing all of these maps.MODS loads of neat customisation mods available  "

												I tried to like this game; I really did. I bought it and convinced my friends to do the same. I'll detail a bit about it below:The premise is pretty cool - imagine a L4D where saving bullets matter and your friends become zombies when they die. The lack of ammo becomes a bit tedious at times; but it didn't really bother me too much. We found it to be annoying that your zombie friends keep respawning over and over, though. There are not very many people online - its not fun trying to find a game.Replayability is basically zero - this game gets repetetive FAST. I'm talking everyone-got-bored-before-we-even-finished-the-first-game fast.everything is a bit clunky - guns dont feel right when you are shooting them and core mechanics feel cheap. Graphics are not very good, AI is no good, zombie mechanics are a bit dull, and the game is just overall below average in pretty much every day.good idea; bad execution. I would not recommend this game to anybody. Sorry boutit "

												Really good game for those of you who like zombies.Great Survivor vs Survivor action, aswell as several Co-op modes vs both AI and Player Zombies.Hunted - S vs S based mode with Player Zombies aswell. You spawn in a random location on the map, and your objective is to stay alive the longest. Scavenge the abandoned houses along the way, but beware - hitting B as a human brings up your phone, and you and other players can see who is close aswell as get a buzzing noise when hitting the trigger. If you die you will respawn as a zombie and your only task is to bring down the remaining survivors. Last survivor alive wins the round.Escape - Band together with friends and strangers in this Survivor vs AI / PC zombies. Your phone will let you know what objective you need to accomplish and your main goal is to escape from the map. Weapons, ammo and items will be found along the way. Make sure you check every corner as they are sometimes hidden or you need to progress further to unlock the areas they are in.Extraction - Survivor vs AI / PC zombies where your goal is to follow the GPS on your map and find survivors held up in houses. Once you reach a holdout point, vast amounts of zombies will begin spawning, so share your ammo and your weapons with your friends, as each member of your team that gets killed will come back as one of the ravenous corpses coming to eat you. Round ends when all survivor packs have been extracted, or the zombies kill either all Player survivors or NPC survivors in a pack.Panic (Objective) - The P:O mode was taken from the spiritual prequel Zombie Panic! Source, another game worth picking up as it's free, and features a strictly PS vs PZ combat zone, where the survivors need to complete the objectives much like in Escape.Panic (Classic) The original game mode from ZP!S which just like the Objective mode features only player combat. Survive the zombie rush. Zombies have limited lives and the first player to turn becomes the strong Riot Zombie.Happy hunting and good luck surviving!			"

												This game promises way too much, and it doesn't look like they are gonna deliver anything better than this unpolished game.It says 'unique characters', but for me they look all the same. The few lines of 'background story' to each character is everything you get.In the trailers, they NEVER mentioned that we are gonna get small confined maps full of zombies that can spawn just from anywhere, and only a handful of 'survivors'.In a co-op mode, there is no storyline. Just random situations in the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ maps. just a 'go here, find this, go there'-like objectives. Firearms are limited and zombies come at you in endless numbers. It's the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t every round. They say 'Every round is unpredictable' ; well that's not true. You run around, fight zombies by unrewarding and boring fighting mechanisms, and you get to the end 'somehow'.Perhaps they wanted to make a zombie sandbox game. I thought that's what this could be. I was wrong.As mentioned, the maps are small. Each map is EXACTLY the same every round. In a deathmatch game, those with best camping skills are rewarded.If you walk around fighting zombies, guys will come after you and kill you. One blow from a zombie is enough to make you into a zombie. Better you camp with your back to the wall, and wait for the brave freeroamer to come in and get killed by you.I can see what they wanted to make. In their imaginations, this was the best realistic zombie simulator.But it's mediocre, really. I'm a zombies game fan, and I know that 'Left 4 Dead' is an unrealistic, arcady and funny game with running zombies. But it had at least enough variation - even without that 'completely unpredictable' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t - to keep me entertained for many many hours.I can see they tried. But Should that be enough? I don't think so. I won't say don't buy it, but don't believe what they promise. Keep down your expectations. You won't need them.But all the features that could have been good, are only half done.

												(Final version.) Dont get tricked! This game aint worth it. Dunno where to begin. When I first bought it it was on sale, and was in beta I thought they gonna change a lot of stuff in this final version, and yet nothing has been changed. It is even worse! First of all resolution. Whats up with the reso issue. I can only see full text (descriptions in option menu) in 640x480? or 800x600. I dont know if that problem is only because of my configuration. Game itself has poor content, with just a few available maps it gets boring pretty quick. Third, full of glitches. If u pick up weapon then select mobile u will drop weapon but the trick part is u gonna drop weapon like 20 meters God only knows which way u have to guess it which is pretty unplayable esspecially when u are in the dark, getting chased by the hordes.All in all my opinion is that this game worths around 5Euros. Everything else is wasted money.			"

												Maps are huge and there's lot of objectives to follow in the best mode which is Escape.  You are free to roam around some of the map but have to complete certain tasks to enter into new areas and eventually find the exit.  Each time you play a level there are different objectives and routes.  Along the way you must scavenge for guns, ammo, keys, and other items that will help you progress.  In survival mode you have to last 20 minutes and can use a nail gun and wood to barricade yourself into a building.  The graphics and sound are extremely well done and the guns feel powerful and accurate.  With some friends playing co-op this game really comes into it's own.  8/10.			"

												When first playing Contagion, I thought to myself, ""Oh a slower left 4 dead"".  And while that might be true, Contagion is also a lot more.The game is still in ""Early Access Beta"", and so far it is shaping up to be quite promising.  My favorite mode is ""Escape"".  You need to work with your team mates, watch each other's backs, and... escape.  The slow pacing adds to the sense of dread and paranoia that will hit you while you scavange for a few more bullets and try to find the way out.  The smart phone your character carries provides objective updates and on some modes a map and GPS directions.Reaching the end and escaping is highly satisfying after the methodical gameplay and teamwork you need to use to get there.  Once more maps are added it will only improve this great game even more. This game is well worth the price of entry and a steal if you can get it on sale.			"

												Man this game is pretty expensive for a game that is so bad.Level design is terrible and combined with the very little and vague information it gives you most rounds are 90% wandering aimlessly.Most of this game is just walking around like its DayZ even the different gamemodes except everywhere you go is a locked door or dead end.Honestly go play No More Room In Hell, it's very similar to this but far far better and its free.

												Contagion is a neat little game, Best described as ""dayZ light"". If you like the concept of dayZ pvp and loot but don't want to suffer through a ""simulator"" that requires large amounts of time investment and forces you to eat/drink and walk extreme distances then Contagion is worth a try. This game also has a coop mode that is basically Left for dead but with more players. Players must get from one objective to another and find gear along the way. One cool thing about contagion is that when you die you spawn as a zombie until the next round. This means that if you are infected or die early on you don't have to be taken out of the action. The PVP mode is basically a free for all. Everyone spawns around a pretty large map with a pistol and compete for gear. You can choose a building and board it up to create a little hideout. Its pretty intese when dozens of zombies are trying to bust into your little fortress. When you die you respawn as a zombie for a chance to get revenge on whoever killed you. As a zombie you can gather hoards of NPC undead and direct them toward the survivors. This game features a nice variety of gear. Everything from Crossbows to machine guns and plenty of melee weapons. Also the devs continue to add gear and maps for free. Only a few nitpicks with this one: Some maps can be difficult to navigate in coop. You can sometimes get lost especially if you aren't sure what to do next. Also some servers have zombie players disabled. This means that if you die you will respawn as a cockroach until the round ends. I suggest avoiding those servers unless you really hate those pesky player zombies. Also the population of the game can sometimes die between steam sales and content updates.... Only a few servers to choose from in those scenarios. Overall this game is really cool because you get the intese PVP that dayZ is known for but without the open-world grindyness or low framerates that dayZ subjects its players to. Contagion runs on the source engine so the framerates are high on a variety of system configs. The graphics aren't anything special but the game still looks great. I give it a thumbs up.			"

												After playing a few rounds and really hard trying you get really quick into the game the controls and everything is very simple too. The problems is you often meet hackers in that game i experienced it often in game. Speedhackers and others take a bad influence. The community is ok in Coop in vs Mode its another story.I hoped for a good game in this one i hope to find a lobby where arent any hackers or crybabies so far  The thing in Contagion is there are many game modes which i will try but when survivors should kill each other theres a high chance that hackers will be involved there.So far Survivors vs Survivors is a No. If you play with survivors together its a yes. greetz Akaya			"

												Ever want to try your hand in being in a Romero-type zombie world? This game gives you that chance. Theres no special infected fluff, or crazy unloading buckets of ammo into zombies. You have limited ammo with what you find, you are being hunted by human survivors, as well as zombies. They give you a false sense of security that they shamble, but after a few shots fired, they swarm just like out of a movie.This game gives you that creepy atmosphere that no place is safe, and there is no safe room, its you against them, and staying still means death. Stay on the run, find friends, and for God's sake only fire when absolutely required. If you happen to find an enemy player nearby, give him a call, hopefully the zombies answer for him =)			"

												Heh, this is going to be a long review. It is not going to be all-out dissing the game, but there are ups and downs about this game. I know it is in beta but the game seems to be centering around tasks. It might just be me noticing this but the animations are a bit choppy, zombies will randomly dissapear, and the zombie's animations are a bit odd remarking their savage behavior. What I mean is that this game needs more time, I think the game shouldn't have been released at this time, giving it's condition. Yes, the game is almost stable, but I think that if they put more effort into the zombie's animations that will fill up that space. Moving on to the players, the melee weapons are hard to get used to, due to lack of damage, making them complayely useless. This game is relying too much on the guns side. Unlike NMRiH (No More Room in Hell), the melee is actually usefull, the Contagion team needs to add Critical Hits, and the ability to sever limbs. The players animations confuse me between weak hits and powerfull hits with melee weapons. I think that they need to show the player charging up their hit, and then releasing it upon the enemy. If the Contagion crew wants some inspiration, I recommend these games to light a spark: L4D 1&2, NMRiH, Project Zomnoid, The Dead Linger, and  7 Days to Die. I know this review was long and I hope the Contagion crew reads this and might get inspired or get notified of these glitches or problems, I will update if I come across anyhing.			"

Zombies can take out a human in nearly 2 swipes and the melee attacks with an Axe and Hammer feel like youre hitting zombies with a wiffle ball bat. Clear headshots dont always register on my fast internet connection.  Humans cannot jump over small fences but a zombie can?

												I cannot say this game is the best I've played in a while, but it is worth trying out at least. There is at present a limited number of options for maps at the moment (a situation I expect to change in the near future), but from what I can tell the map quantity does not need to be high. It offers a dynamic gameplay so that each playthrough is unique. The maps lock certain ways and unlike others each time, which is unique unto itself. The fact that players who die come back as zombies makes the game that much more fun. It is somewhat limited in scope, however. The physics are not as polished as some other zombie games, and there are only two kinds of zombie to face - regular and armored. The player zombies act as 'leaders' for the horde only in that they can command them; they do not have enhanced hp or special abilities. However, the games modes included do make up for the seeming lack of variety or polish. Hunted is effectively a deathmatch with zombies thrown in for flavor, escape is the classic left for dead style run through, escort is the typical escort-style mission with zombies, and panic is a simple pc v pc human v zombie deathmatch mode. Another plus is the survival-style limited resources provided. Every game mode, no matter the type, forces the player to constantly scavenge for ammunition and equipment, which is how one would imagine a zombie apocalypse to play out. Over all this is a decent game, though if you dislike the survival horror genre stay away. Ammo conservation is paramount to survival here.			"

												Contagion is survival horror at its finest.  Lurking around every corner are walkers that could potentially bring a survivor down on their own, making each encounter all the more terrifying.  Hordes of the infected have the capacity to overrun groups of survivors, making cooperative play all the more important when it comes to this game.  All in all, contagion is a fun zombie experience with a lot to offer and will keep you on your toes, whether you, yourself, are alive... or not.			"

												As of 12/27/2013 I am writing this review.  This game has a lot of promise, but the game needs some serious patch work to make it more enjoyable.  Zombies can take out a human in nearly 2 swipes and the melee attacks with an Axe and Hammer feel like youre hitting zombies with a wiffle ball bat. Clear headshots dont always register on my fast internet connection.  Humans cannot jump over small fences but a zombie can?  Humans cannot shoot through some window glass on houses but a zombie can smash through.			"

The gunplay can be a little bad at times, but it's fixable. And I haven't tried this yet but there's a split-screen option where you can use a controller (xbox) and play with a friend side by side on one screen, if this works it would be the first PC game I've played like that. All-in-all, it's a greea game with great potentail.			"

I used to play Zombie Panic: Source ALL the time and I loved how it wasn't a realistic take on zombie killing and it wasn't too cheesy either. It allowed for a lot of fun memories with people who just wanted to have a good time. I never seen that in contagion. No one in contagion ever seemed friendly at all. Even their ZPS classic mode in contagion didn't add up. It has nothing to do with ZPS. The only thing that is even similar is just the carrier roar and even then, it's not the same. Stupid.   I just hate how this game killed an already amazing game. I know a lot of people seem to enjoy overly realistic games, but for me, games are supposed to be an escape from reality.

Some guys wanted the ability to disable player zombies, some guys wanted to get rid of the AI-zombies.What did the devs do? Both.

They don't, otherwise I would've been gone a long time ago.Now, onto the actual review.This game is hard, and I mean ridiculously hard. That's one of its charms.It's a survival horror game that forces you to work in order to master it, a lot like the original Resident Evil games.Ammo is scarce, navigation is difficult, and zombies are strong.Eventually though, these 3 problems fade away as you begin to conserve ammo, learn the maps, and aim for the heads.It's a game that punishes you for stupid mistakes, but every time you do something right, you'll feel like you've accomplished something.It's a love-it-or-hate-it type of game, and it's one that I personally enjoy.

												I hear alot of people with negative opinions about this game. Though it is in development I already think this game is amazingly fun, and I'm sure I'm going to spend alot of hours on it. Like alot of games, this game takes just a little bit of getting used to. It may seem difficult at first, or the controls may seem weird(I always change mine to what fits my playstyle) but if you give the game a try I'm positive you'll have some crazy adrenaline filled moments that will have your palms sweating. If it is going to be your first time playing, I highly suggest you play a coopertive mode such as Escape or Extraction. If you play a pvp mode on your first time you might get a little frustrated from dying by more experienced players. Once you have a hang of the gameplay and find yourself a friend or two you'll quickly find that this game could potentially be one of your most favorite games.			"

												I bought this game when it was in Early Access, and man, if you hadn't bought this game yet, you are missing out on a ton of stuff.I will now re-tell the first time I felt frightened, Ahem:""Sir Bond finds a house of to the left of a courted road, and asks himself, 'Does this beauty have a beast?' At that moment, a hail of sniper rounds flow around him like it was liquid rubber, and he scurries into the house. Without knowing, a dead ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ walks up from the basement and hides upstairs. Bond then goes down into the basement, scavenges any planks and nailguns he could, and proceded to board the house up with mouldy wooden boards. He then heads upstairs to find out what the scratching was at the window, and the sudden crackle of glass on the floor. He looks out the window, sees more bullets fly by him, and procedes to board the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the window, as his life really did depend on it. But as he was boarding the window, that same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, sneaks up behind, and bites him in the neck. He then kills that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and heads down into the basement and waits, as well as crying, as more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s start breaking down the barricades. At that last moment, he pulls out a gun, and fires a .357 round into his skull.""			"

												this is simply the best zombie survivor game ever made for co-op, hands down, I have played left 4 dead, dead island etc but they all suck compared to this, simply because this one is not so demanding, looks fantastic, has an advanced lighting and effect features without necessorly using much of graphic power, uses a source engine and above all the zombies are natural and their damn right scary!, and guess what if you die to turn into a zombie and hunt the living. the original price is fine but 5$ is simply a steal, although I won`t be able to play it at the discounted price cuz I don`t have money in my wallet. so I probably buy the game somewhere else and activate on steam or wait for another deal.

												First of all, I would like to say that I've been a fan of Zombie Panic! Source, It was my favorite steam game, I've played years of it and when I heard about Contagion I got super excited for it.In the weekend they put the game for a free weekend and on deal, I played the trial and fell in love with it, After a while I bought the game and I'm not dissapointed, A big thank and congratulations to the developers for making such a great game.This game is similar to Zombie Panic! Source so you'll get almost no problems with understanding the game's gameplay.So basically there are various gamemodes and maps, Each map with it's own objectives and each mode with it's own point.For a start I would suggest trying out ce_losmuertos (Escape : Los Muertos)From what I can tell it's the easiest map out there.Talking about the game, You at the start are a survivor, And there are other zombies/infected that are out there trying to stop you, There are many actions that you can do when you are a survivor or a zombie, Which is great and balanced.The game has some realism, So you'll get tired after sprinting (Yes theres sprinting!) for a while, Jumping and you have no crosshair, So iron sights are a very useful thing here.For zombies you can roar, Use your zombie vision, Blend (Activate a CPU to play for you) and command other zombies.If you think you'll let zombies hit you and you'll be fine you're wrong, Because theres infection!I really love these kind of games, So it's a 5 out of 5.

Posted: March 24, 2014
												Inevitably this game will be compared up against Left 4 Dead 2. This is understandable but not entirely fair to the game although there are certainly many similarities. In a market already oversaturated with zombie-games left, right and center what is there to recommend? What is there to make this stand out? Honestly I can't answer that since I haven't played most of the other games out there. What I can tell you though is why I like it.First of all it has atmosphere in spades. The graphics do a lot to help with this and by that I don't necessarily mean visual fidelity but the overall style. Where L4D is a little lighter on the horror and as a result tend to be a brighter game this is darker and more - dare I call it - ""realistic"". When I say dark I mean litteral darkness and your flashlight is designed in such a way that it isn't a magic lamp that illuminates everything and make things instantly better. You'll have to see it to know what I mean but I can tell you that facing off against a gang of zombies in a dark room can get very tense despite your flashlight.The pace is also very different. It's slower and less arcade than other similar FPS zombie games. Zombies move slower and though they can ""run"" (more like walking fast) there are no sprinters. It builds more on the premise that even a few zombies become a serious threat if you let them come up close. Headshots are the name of the game and ammo/weapons are meant to be scarce. Melee is an option but don't expect to wade through even a few zombies with your sledgehammer. Zombies take multiple hits to go down, swings are slower than you might think... oh and they use precious stamina that you also need to sprint.I could go on but I hope the above has already given you a sense of whether this is something for you or not. You can read about the different game modes elsewhere but in brief there's one PvP mode (hunting others on maps filled with zombies) and two co-op modes. And when I say co-op I do mean co-op: don't expect to get far or have an easy time without some serious teamwork!Bottom-line: don't let comparisons to other games (such as L4D1-2) influence your decision. Both this game and L4D2 are among my favorite zombie co-op shooters and I love each for their way of doing things.			"

												Fun game once you get the hold of it. But a bit hard to understand in the beginning without a tutorial. I can imagine this game beign scary if it wasn't for the little kids screaming.			"

												Great game with many Coop and PvP modes. Ammo is scarce, teamplay essential and the atmosphere is often very tense! You can play on public servers or host your own server. Mods allow new maps, weapon skins and other things. It has a lot in common with ""No more room in hell"" which is good and free but Contagion is a much, much more polished game while ""No more room in hell"" more feels like a mod.			"

												I first played Contagion way back in Early Access, and while it was a decent game then, it definitely needed work. I then went a very long time without playing it, and recently decided to try it out again. I came back not expecting much to have changed. However, it has become a very enjoyable game, with several different and fun gamemodes, splitscreen multiplayer, and steam workshop integration. While I rarely buy games that are not on sale, this is one that I can actually say is worth the full price.			"

												Good stuff, little lacking on the content at the moment, but for a beta a rather complete game. Turn down your volume when you first load or you will have your ear drums blown out by the menu music.edit* needs more extraction maps, escaping from the prison is great fun but how often can you escape from the same prison before even randomizing zombie placement becomes predictable.

												Really had a hard time playing this game. The fish-eye lense effect was making me nauseous, play control was pretty awful. I wanted to like this game as I was hoping to play it with my group of friends but it's just terrible. I know I only have short amount of play time logged, but it's just so unplayable I'm not sure I even want to try to get any further into the game.			"

												Yet another zombie game, yet another game built on the source engine, it's very similar to Left 4 Dead but less arcadish, whereas in Left 4 Dead you are given military-grade weapons with practically unlimited bullets vs hundreds of athletic zombies and first aid kits everywhere. Here you get a more hardcore, classic resident evil atmosphere, where objectives(like finding keys) are not spoon-fed to the players and they have to find how to escape(for example) the map themselves, and most zombies are slow as ♥♥♥♥, and ammunition is scarce.Weapons range from simple household weapons to police/military weapons depending on the map and mission. There are melee weapons but they aren't as polished as left 4 dead's and you can find yourself missing a lot of swings. The game is very cooperative but when you die it's not the end. you get to become a zombie, and you can try to kill the other players and stop them from completing the mission. Also, from zombie scratches and bites alone you can get infected and turn into a zombie even though you still have hp left. personally I don't like these features, as it basically negates the hp system because one scratch can kill you anyway, and when players die they become wise-zombies that know how to hide and ambush which can break immersion and kill fun for the remaining survivors, I liked the dynamic respawn systems of L4D better, but it's still a unique feature to this game.The online community is kinda dead as there are lots of servers but few of them actually have players playing in regularly, and playing with random players isn't that fun in this game as it can turn into a looting race between survivors, so make sure you have friends to play this with.Recommend only if you like the classic resident evil-vibe and first person games, and if you have friends to play this with, as the community is pretty much dead imo.6.5/10			"

												I really hate saying that games are rips of other games but this game feels just like a carbon copy of no more room in hell they both play the same except No more room in hell is far better and free, this game has some very serious issues, there are some clipping bugs, the zombie AI is really wonky the AI is either really ♥♥♥♥ing good IE. seeing me through walls or just really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cant see me when im 3 to 4 feet infront of them, the different difficulties make no difference really minus you may find less ammo other than that all zombies die with 1 head shot, movement is sluggish and the guns accuacy or the zombies hit boxes are awful ive had al least 20 to 30 times ive aimed for the head dead on with the sights and the wall on the other side of their head gets hit but not the zombie. lastly the direction HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥the direction in this game is so ♥♥♥♥ing terrible to the point where i want to say there is just none, youre ploped in on a map and told to go to ""Chucks gun store"" it does not tell you where its at what it looks like or how to get there thats all on you, now that may sound like a cool thing the game not holding youre hand but in a game where there are more zombies than you and you need bullets to kill them because the ♥♥♥♥ing melee wepons rarely spawn it gets to be pretty annoying when you keep running out of ammo from going the wrong way and kill 10 zombies that did not need to. also ""KEY ITEMS"" why is nothing ever highlighted i had to find a fire extinguisher i spent 20 min in a crappy lit map looking for a dark red non highlighted item that i had no clue where it would be because of the random generator for this game because there is NO DIRECTION IN THIS GAME that item could have spawned back at the begining of the level but since it did not tell you before hand what you may have needed you now have to spend 30 min looking for and item that may not even be in that area. If you want a game that actualy has a good zombie exp you should get no more room in hell its free and it plays just like this, though the graphics are less quality due to it being free but the gamplay is so much better and you can actually play it with friends and have too much trouble on the server list			"

												Reviewed 12th July 2014, full released versionThe good:+ Sticking to Romero-esque zombies, no ""special infected"" zombies that don't really belong to the universe.+ Basic Gunplay and movement+ A more grounded L4D in conceptThe why and the bad:- immserion breaking objects placement: Tools and weaponary that seemingly can be used in the game are more often than not just decorations in maps. And there are literally littered everywhere around the map. Fences that act as wall barriers to make you go through long alternate routes is fine until you see not only zombies, but other suvivor NPCs climb over them with ease.- Very bad guns balancing. It's ok if I have to do head shots to kill zombies, but it's a bit ridiculous if I have to do a headshot with a shotgun in pin point distance to kill them too. SMGs, ARs advantages are really only just a higher fire rate for me to spam more bullets to hit heads rather than doing more damage or more stopping power.- Bad resource management and feedback. You will have to guess how much of a type of ammo you have if you don't have the corresponding guns that use the specific ammo. Dropping ammo for team mates that require them is pretty much gonna be a disaster of mess, which it really shouldn't be for a game that is suppose to rely on good team work.- Each co-op playthroughs has no or very little and quite meaningless variant in paths and objectives, despite what's being advertised to you. Randomization of weaponary really doesn't mean much when the balancing of them are so bad that your pistol will normally do the job.The bottom line:- The game is fun with friends for the first few times until you have ran through each map once or twice.- If you are looking for an experience similar to L4D campaign co-op, there is a grand total of 2 maps of that that will take at max 2 hours to complete, with a high chance that you have missed a key somewhere and spending 20 minutes being frustrated looking for it.- If you don't have friends to play this with, your best bet is the pvp hunted mode as it's the only mode that still has a few players playing in and it's the mode that require the least team work if at all. In which I really have to say that there are just about hundreds and thousands of other shooters that plays and look better, do yourself a favor and play those instead.- There is not much content, or variations as of this review is written. Surely you can always keep an eye on steam workshop for actual extra content, but keep your expectations in check until the free DLC hits.			"

												This is a game that I will download, play with friends for a while, forget about, notice it has an update and play again.Every-time I've opened the game something has been changed and improved, whether that's extensive as new maps or as small as a redesigned menu; this game seems to be moving forward.I really love the multiplayer ideas they have included - trying to hunt down other players while navigation a horde of zombies all whilst not giving your position away is really stressful, and really fun!As well as this, the Escape maps - where you and other players must work together to escape from the map are really fun and quite challenging sometimes. The only problem I have with the Escape levels is that when a player dies, they then become a zombie and in my past experience, it is very easy for that one player to then wipe out the remaining ""survivors"". I feel more could be done to increase the difficulty of playing as a zombie.Overall though, this game is a great time killer and I thoroughly enjoy it. Can't wait to see where it goes!			"

												The main game mode is called escape and sees up to 8 players try to work their way through a map full of zombies to escape a situation. The puzzles are pretty basic and usually involve finding an item to open a door or barrier. Each time you play the game the route changes, keys change location, different doors are unlockable/open, one game saw the team using vents to get around the map instead of taking the stairs. The zombies are easy enough to kill but a lack of ammo and limit to the number of things you can hold means that you often resort to using risky melee weapons. The limits on holding 5 things at once mean that through the game you do things such as swap a key for machine gun with no ammo(in the hope you will find ammo) only to find that the armory later in the game is locked..    Deathmatch sees up to 8 players battling it out on medium sized maps filled with zombies. While not strong the zombies are a great addition to the fight. The match is slow paced and it can be quite hard to find other human players, following a hoard who can smell human blood is a great way to track people down. Other ways to find humans include following flashlights, which works great when you see a small flash in the front room of the house next door or following gunshots. Gunshots is a great idea by the developers because at some point human players find themselves cornered in a loft with a zombie they need to take out; unfortunately, unless you have 5.1 sound its unlikely to help locate people that much.   I should point out the game is beta, so there is plenty of time for things to change. I don’t know how being a zombie can be more fun while not making them too powerful for humans. While it takes a while to hunt a human player down in escape mode, this stops the humans getting overran by 5 zombie players. I should also note that while being a zombie was a tad boring, playing as a human was really fun. It was also really tense, death actually meant something to the player and kept you on your toes.    I’m giving this 4.5 stars because I’m knowingly taking part in a beta. Perhaps I would give it 3.5 if this was the finished product, but it’s not. Reviewing games at this stage in their life is perhaps a little unfair, but I think its good giving games trying something new and following the kickstarter/green light/beta business models as much coverage as possible. 4.5/5 stars :D "

												Ever wished L4D was less about running ASAP from A-B with magical infinite-ammo pistols & minor punishment for getting killed, and more like a first-person classic Resident Evil with full co-op that wasn't a disappointing or underpopulated mess? Well, here you go! Admittedly it's certainly a niche market and obviously not for everyone if they just want to shoot some zombies, but get some like-minded friends in on the action with a private server and you'd be surprised at just how enormously replayable the (currently) small roster of Escape maps can be, especially on Extreme difficulty. Hell, even joining public servers full of randoms manages to go against the usual online experience and can often wind up being remarkably fun. A game that will sometimes feel a little rough around the edges the more you play and experiment with things, but certainly not enough in any way to ruin the experience.			"

												The game is entertaining and has many great features, but it has many bugs including the following:1. Sometimes the keyboard/mouse will not move you correctly after loading; disabling controller settings can help this however these settings are on by default and it may be a recurring problem if you are not diligent about checking them.2. There is no way to tell if you are going to spawn as a zombie when joining random games, so if you're interested in cooperative play to meet objectives, you need to arrange your match ahead of time for any guarantees.3. Every time I have completed a map, the game sits on the final score screen and I am forced to exit the game which results in my not having any of my achievements recorded on my steam profile.  Annoying to not be able to track your progress.4. Between my kids and I (three computers), whenever we try to play together on LAN, if one of the games crashes it crashes the game for all three of us.  The two who do not crash get a ""Game Paused"" message and it never recovers, and the person who crashed (if it was not the host) is unable to rejoin the game.  We have not yet been able to complete a mission together on LAN due to this.  This may actually be two problems; either an actual game crash, or a short break in our wifi which I believe is the cause for the ""Game Pause"" message, however both have the same result of being unable to finish a level.If these issues can be resolved then I would recommend this game.

												It has finally come out as a full release and it does not disappoint. This game absolutely nails the feeling of a hopeless society being torn apart by the living dead. The sound design is top notch and the gameplay is brilliant (highly recommend ""Hunted""). For $20 you get the best survival horror FPS since Left 4 Dead, what are you waiting for?OLD REVIEW -- NOV 3 2013 ::: This game is fantastic! The amount of tension/terror in the PvP Hunted mode is incredible and the atmosphere really enhances the experience. The standard ZPS style modes also return where you have to collect X to get to Y but now teamwork is top priority. No more running off solo, the zombies will find you. Buy this now, even at its current stage of development it is fantastic.			"

												Pros: Very tactical. Feels like the zombie apocalypse, with that atmosphere, the ability to board up entrances, infection, and a mode that allows humans to fight each other over resources. Tense, addictive. Challenging, so satisfying, hard won victories. Escape Mode plays like a proper single-player survival horror, but with co-op, and player zombies: look for the way to proceed, find objective items like fire extinguishers and keys, etc. Allows players fighting each other as Humans, zombies. Varied, dynamic modes. Randomized objectives means you can't predict quite where to go, or what to do, even after playing levels many times. Solid co-op, with 2-16 players. Good alternative to Left 4 Dead, which it is a clone of.Cons: Some awkward elements, such as glitches and bugs. Exploits that some players abuse. Players that are zombies are not quite equal to 'human' players, the way it is in, say, Aliens vs Predator. Too little content. Not as refined as Left 4 Dead. No ""easy"" way to play, and steep learning curve, and rarely winning does get frustrating.My recommendation: Get this if you want an alternative to Left 4 Dead that is not streamlined, and even more realistic and dynamic.

												Great game especially for the Sale. The overall atmosphere of the game is amazing, and the PVP free for all gamemode (hunted) is terrifyingly fun. It's like DayZ in the fact that it's you versus everyone plus zombies. Except, when people die, they actually join the ranks of the undead. There's nothing more intense than roaming a zombie-filled neighborhood, breaking into a house, checking your phone, and realizing you're not the only living person in the house. Then you see one of the bedroom doors open... The only downside is that it's still in its beta stages, so there's bugs here and there, like the occasional zombie model freezing in place or just a hitbox mishap. There's also only a few maps to choose from. But that'll most likely change as they continue to update the game. It's early access for a reason of course.			"

 *Almost* the Zombie game we have all been waiting forI have played a lot of zombie FPS (They Hunger, Zombie Master, Zombie Panic, NMRIH, L4D...ect), however I have longed for a game that captured the essence of a George A Romero zombie flick. At last we have a game where the zombies can only be dispatched by shooting them in the head! I am suprised this has not been done before, as it not only says true to the greatest zombie triology of all time, but more importantly, it rewards player accuracy. The game offers a fantastic atmosphere, good gun mechanics and some interesting maps. What stands out from this game is the fantastic 'hunted' mode, which is essentially a last man standing PVP deathmatch with NPC zombies. However, it has a slight twist, in that when a player dies, they come back playing as a zombie. I loved the PVP element of 'Day Z', so this game mode was perfect for me. At present, I would even go as far as saying that the battles on this game are better, because the game mechanics are so fluid and the zombies are actually a threat.Contagion is by no means perfect though, for starters, the objective game modes are hit and miss. Although the player is told what to do by a mobile phone, it is often not clear what the objective actually is, or where the player should go. The game is crying out for more maps, which I am sure will come when/if it gets workshop support. Also, I am hoping that the developers adapt the current barracading system, so that players can actually move objects (at present you can only place wooden boards). Overall, this is a decent addition to the genre. Perhaps the amount of content does not justify the full price tag, but it is definitely worth picking up in the sale for the 'hunted' gameplay mode. Hopefully it will develop and maintain a healthy player count. 7.5/10			"

Since it's still in beta, i can't really know how it's going to be when fully released, but i've heard they're gonna add SDK soon so lots of community maps and other content will probably be there.it's quite hard to play with people you don't know though, since they're mostly just team killing you. i recommend playing with friends.

												If you're looking at this you're probably wondering if the game is worth a buy, 20$ may seem very expensive to those who don't have the luxury to just go out and buy games without a doubt while it may seem like pocket change to others.Considering this is my first review please take this with a grain of salt.Why should I consider buying Contagion?You should buy Contagion because It's fun, it provides an environment where cooperation is key, while that may seem like a generic statement across all sorts of zombie survival games, seriously, in this one, it is. If your friends die they become zombies and ultimately that makes your gameplay a whole lot more difficult because that one player zombie can infect another player and they're count goes up one by one until the last person is left cowering in a corner before she/he is mauled to death by a horde. A lot of players who prefer the old slow zombies and freakish hordes of them will like this game in its entirety.Contagion challenges the players in a multitude of gamemodes such as... Escape - Which you could say is the traditional left 4 dead style, ""Let's go do some objectives so we can get out of here."" type of thing. Extract - If you have ever played Resident Evil 3, this is the mercenary mode where you run around extracting civilains. Hunt - You versus everything else pretty much. Zombie Panic Classic - If you have ever played the Free to Play Zombie Panic Source, this is basically the same. Zombe Panic Objective - The same as Zombie Panic Source's objective escape mode, it's Escape in Contagion too but this time it's you versus a player zombie at the start.Stopping with the possibly ranting non-sense, lets get on with this review. First of all, the store page in comparison to real gameplay.Store Page Advertising in Comparison to Real GameplayIf you've read the section ""What they're saying about Contagion"" which is the first section of the store page for reviewers it's basically saying that Contagion is a good game that has gone back to the old style slow zombie game that is worth the 20$ it's worth. But is that really true?My Experience in relation to this statement.Yes, Contagion has done that and so far I've liked the game, even in the most frustrating moments I've had fun running around popping zombies in the head once or beating them with a melee weapon of my choice. But that is me however, how would it be for you the player?Contagion may be fun for a good majority of the possible people willing to throw money at the developers so that they can play however a there is also the fact a lot of people have said that the game is terrible, the graphics are bad, the gameplay sucks, gore is 'meh' and it's been an overall bad experience. Hell, the two first reviews I saw of Contagion had said that it was a bad game and there was only one good review. But these reviews were a bit old, like, months back old so I decided to write one myself.In all seriousness, if you have a problem with graphics, any game developed for the Source Engine is gonna look bad in some way so you should save yourself the time and money and just ignore this game all together. If you're cool with it, enjoy.Gameplay wise, if you have everything going for you and you have a smart team to play with, even on the most hardest difficulties you will steam roll through zombie hordes and make it to the end with minimum casualties if not zero. That is probably the biggest aspect of the game I consider that makes it fun for anyone to play it really. Teamwork is essential in this game and if you're not a teamplayer, you're gonna get wiped quick and you'll probably get mad very easily at this game because being mauled by a horde of zombies isn't fun, not for you, not for anyone and not even for your teammates across the map. Because when you die, they'll have to deal with you and any player zombie is more fiendish than an NPC in a horde.The Gore is decent, it's not gonna rock you and have blood spraying everywhere but the limbs will fall off I assure you this. It's also toggable so if you have children who want to play feel free to turn of it. Then again, why are you subjecting your child to such a violent gorish videogame like Contagion?Overall Experience of Contagion? It's pretty good, I wouldn't say 'decent' because the only time I would ever say 'decent' if it was a 50/50 that everything was going right and everything was going wrong at that point. With my 'small' experience of Contagion gameplay I can only say this. It's good because discluding the idiotic players, the twit taking things he doesn't need and the relatively low chance of getting trolled by a zombie because you've emptied a magazine into his head, it's pretty good.The only things you need to worry about in the game is the things I just discluded, the dumb or should I say, learning players, the trolls, the hoarder of ammo and the trollish hitboxes preventing you from ending the zombies life. Those are the only things that are going to ruin your day, mostly the trollish hitboxes on the zombies. Other than that, the players tend to listen and stick together but you will usually always have the one guy who decided to hoard everything and not share one bit of it. Dynamic Gameplay What they've said is true in terms of finding weapons or objectives but the map layout tends to be the same and you will usually have a deja vu moment here and there. It will always be new in terms of trying to find the objective in the various places they put it as well as the pathways you take to that objective but other than that the map will remain the same. I honestly thought the map would be different like they made blocks of the maps that would interlock easily and would create a whole new environment all together.Edit 9/2/2014 - Added a little bit concerning the pathways to objectives will always be different. State Of The Art Gore I would say that this would be true in terms of it described but I honestly don't think it's state of the art, you could really compare this to Deadspace's limbic system when you utterly destroyed the monsters. Immersive Sound Effects This I would consider to be definetly true, I never got to a point where I ran through the game without even thinking, I was always cautious because the obvious zombie moans around the corner usually prepared me to get mauled to death. Traditional Zombies Yes, yes, yes. Spot on though I'd have to say, they can climb ladders and get into vents? Seems a bit new to me in terms of what zombies could do...Extensive Survival EquipmentI'd have to say, this really disappointed me. I expected there to be a multitude of items to use as a weapon and it severely disappointed me when I enter a store and there's all this hardware I could use as a possible weapon but they didn't consider it. They did however say that they would continue to add so I suspect more in the future.Unique GamemodesI don't know if Unique meant that the experience in itself would be unique each time or that each game mode was unique. This statement is basically what I explained up top if you've missed it, other than that, I don't know how to respond to this literally. Stop Paying More Hurray! What else am I supposed to say?I'll probably add more to this review later on in the future, overall I have to say 9/10, the game is really fun when things are on your side, that can be said for a lot of games though.In the end, it's your choice whether or not you want to buy it or not. Hopefully this review is on your side and you don't have a horrible experience. "

												This game is wonderful, for once there is a game that brings the horror of zombies back to life. With contangions ""darkness"" and ""gritty"" enviorments and shading this game is a treat to those who want to finally partake in a game where zombies are a real threat.Contangion brings back everything i loved in zombie games and have wanted in a long line of them that have fallen short to my expectations. Todays genera of ""survival"" games really try to grab people into the market by saying they have ""zombies"" inside of them, when in fact the zombies in most those games are minor or no threat what so ever, but more of a backnoise that brings you back to the realization that the game was meant to be a zombie one, when ever you are not pvp'ing other's.this game dosent do that like the other's, Instead this game wants zombies to be the true threat, along with other player's.when bitten you can be infected and turn among you're fellow friends, making trust a very scary thing in the game.For those who want to take on the game as a hero slaying loner they have ""solo"" witch dose bring the realization as to how vunerable you really are in this world.ammo is tough to find, and zombies only go down in one way that has been ignored by so many game developer's, and thats ""shoot them in the head""the only way to put them down, making you really hate yourself if you miss a head shot, knowing you just wasted a bullet.I suggest trying this game out while you can.it makes you feel like you're playing ""l4d"" but a more realistic feel instead of a cartoonish one.wonderful game, i hope they keep up the work, so far its a amazing ride.

												NOTE: This review was written 5/3/2014, things may have been subject to change.This is it, folks. The zombie game that will revolutionize the genre once again.Straight from the developers of the ever so popular mod, Zombie Panic!: Source, lies this gem, Contagion.Contagion is the definition of the first few days of a zombie apocalypse. No other zombie games I know of can capture the immersion of an atmosphere so dark, and cold. No other game captures the direct feeling of when a gunshot rings off in the distance, or a scream s heard across the open landscape. Or even... when it's a dead, dreadful, silence.The use of modern technology in this game is a neat and clever idea, using a smart phone to get info and help you on your quest makes it feel as if this can happen at any given moment, right now.Now, for gameplay mechanics and good things:You go up to a zombie. You shoot a bullet, thinking everything will be alright, as if this was Left 4 Dead. It resounds through the area and zombies reply with a big, fat ""NOPE"" as many rush over fences and break open windows to munch on a newfound meal. The sounds in this game are amazing, as they immerse you and give you that extra feel as if you're really there. Buildings have that nice echo that make you feel at home, then zombies are barreling through the door at the slightest loud noise that you may drum up.As of this review, you can now be infected by AI Zombies' physical attacks. It's very easy now to get infected. Now, you know that noone will have the heart EVER to tell someone they are going to turn, so they sit there, and they go throguh the symptoms. Then, their cries of agony fill the air, and it turns to a gurgle as their human qualities vanish and they lunge for their friends before your very eyes. It's a horrible feeling when you've been traveling with your friends for miles through the cities, and behind you, one of your friends is gone.It's cold.Now, for some flaws, because this is a review and I have to cover things good, AND bad.For one, and I know this will be fixed, is that there are so little maps that the replay value gets a little repetitive after a while. Now I'm sure the team is working avidly on new maps, especially co-op maps, but as of now, little co-op maps.There are some bugs, but this is all really stuff that will be fixed. I'm glad the team is really proud of this and I have all the respect for them.In conclusion, Contagion will reach for the stars for reviving the zombie genre. It's atmosphere is spot on, and it makes you feel isolated and helpless, which is what we wanetd ever since we've cracked open the pages of the Zombie Survival Guide. I hope this game makes history, and if it doesn't I will take a hot steaming crap on Steam.11/10Buy this game, and get it for your friends. You will not regret it.--------------------------Also, I guess I deviate from the norm, as for the record I think Hunted is stupid, unlike everyone else. ._.Yeah, flame me.

												This isn't what I wanted it to be. The style is pretty much ""left 4 dead"" but in this game when you die, you respawn as a zombie and try to kill the remaining survivors and the player with the most points wins the match, maps are dense, dark and glitchy.

												If you were to immediately become blind while standing in the middle of Walmart during Black Friday, you'd probably have a better time finding where to go, what to find, and surviving than this game. Servers are usually laggy, game has barely changed over a year, zombie hitboxes are awful, player zombies are completely overpowered, list goes on and on and on.Although you might have some initial fun popping zombie heads, the more you play, the more obvious the problems become. Playing escape always tells you to go hunting for small items across an entire maps like keys, so you have to backtrack for most escape maps, and you basically bumble around for 20 minutes, die, then do it again as a zombie until the round ends. Directions are way too vague for escape, which is actually one of the best modes. The rest of the game mode are meh except for hunted, until player zombies win the match for everyone.Play No more room in hell instead, it's free and it's at least 78.54% more fun than this overpriced mess.TL;DR Gets boring after a while,zombie hitboxes are broken + player zombies opGamemodes are pretty boringGET NO MORE ROOM IN HELL			"

												It's ok for the most part. Some of the modes make no sense like hunted mode. Escape takes so long and theres many times zombies dont even spawn it makes no sense at all. I haven't tried some of the other modes yet.Extraction is proably the only mode that I like. The problem with thi smode is if a player dies he can become a player zombie and the ability to hoard zombies ruins the game. Sometimes players enter the match and are player zombies automatically. There is an option to turn this off. Problem is none of the official servers have it and if you try to run your own server its super annoying to get it working (my friend tried port forwarding like 3 times) we gave up. If its was easier to make your own server room it would be more enjoyable.			"

												Contagion is one of the most realistic zombie games I've come across, I bought it while it was in kickstarter and it hasn't disappointed. There's many excellent parts that make this game a whole, the UI is really easy to use, the game is really smooth and looks great on high quality, when you shoot a zombie in the head it'll blast brains out of the back of the head which I think looks really cool and you can cut limbs with sharp weapons.The zombies aren't overpowered but it's easy to die to a horde if you don't know what you're doing, it's a good strategy game in itself because if you're cornered by a big horde you need to figure out what to do, it's intense!The human zombies are definitely much harder to kill but that makes it much more fun, every mode is great, extraction, escape, panic, hunt, all enjoyable game modes.There is a minority of people who have given the game a bad review, think of these people as the critics who'm gave your favorite movie a bad review. Trust me, this game is worth your money.The only thing I can complain about is the fact that they were going to launch a DLC pack in October and it's May now and it still isn't released, I'm not sure what complicated things but I'm sure they have a good reason. they've been keeping the game bug free. You should definitely buy this.			"

												First impressions review so take what you will. I was granted with a main menu with options, start game, find game, extras and quit. Pressing start game takes you to the server creation page i think... find game brings you to page where you choose a difficulty, a gamemode and a map. You can do this if you want but i tried selecting random map, all modes, and easy and found nothing.So i joined an official server and was immediately confronted with a zombie, no kidding, not a foot in front of me. Of course the FPS in me came out and i immediately shot it in the face, other than that though i had no idea what i was doing. I quickly found out that control is crouch but otherwise it was not a game you can simply just pause and look at all the options, so i was immediately confronted with a tent which i ran inside and then cried into a corner. After killing two more zombies i found some courage and ran out, the zombies are rather dim witted and slow. I did find a couple players however, except they immediately shot me. Once again confused i started into the game again and immediately cowared into a shack. After shooting some more zombies i felt confident i wasn't going to die.Oh boy i was wrong. After voicing in chat my inability to actually play the game i found out i was playing in PVP with other players as zombies. Of course i also was called a camper and someone voiced my position in chat so of course they began to gang up on me so i just quit.Overall, it could be something good, but with no tutorial, no game mode descriptions and in general just♥♥♥♥♥♥other things it can't get a good review from me and it's going to be deleted.No wonder i got it for free off humble bundle...

												[Hunted] In this game, you have 2 troubles : 1) Zombies 2) Players. 1) Zombies can spot you almost everywere , they hear you, they want your brain. 2) Players are hunting you, as you hunt them. So stay allert. I found this game verry challenging, It's like you trying to outsmart your oponents, and at the same time thinking about zombies, and about noise you make, about escaping from zombies/players and ect. Great game, even if It's in Early Access. This game makes  you feel, and think like a zombie, It's like : you dont know where survivors at, and you hear a gunshot, and all zombies from all streets, are running towards the sound and you too. This game is totaly worth it. ( Sorry for bad english )Others gamemodes I found a bit boring.			"

												I love this game, and everything about it. When extracting survivors from a house surrounded by the shambling undead, the game hardly feels like an early access game. Every bullet, every step, cannot be taken lightly - this game is a very good change to the zombie titles in the market today. With the option of both co-op and player versus player, this game can be enjoyed even without a multitude of maps for early access. Each map is random - what I mean by that, is NO playthrough will be the same - Objectives will be different, will have different locations, and different strategies for tackling them. Knowing maps won't do very good here, and thats what makes this game amazing.			"

												Fans of the zombie genre will be pleased. Unlike L4D, there are no specials in this game. To bring down a zombie, you have to land a well-placed headshot. Zombies are typically slow, with the occasional burst of speed.The game offers three game-types as of this writing: two co-op gametypes, and one versus. In all the game modes, if you die, you become a zombie. It's definitely different and the team at Monochrome have been steadily updating the title since Alpha. I heartily recommend Contagion. The game oozes personality and runs well (pros and cons of being a Source engine game). In the end though, it's fun as hell. And isn't that what really matters?I love Contagion. Check it out.If you want a more in-depth explaination check out my impressions at my blog: http://www.saityrus.com/impressions-contagion/ "

												From a hardcore zombie panic source player (the game that his game was influenced by), I really was hoping for this to be the new and popular game to revive the ZPS gameplay.This game has lots of potential but fails on many qualities that is needed that made zps so fun.Community is mediocre. For a sourcemod needs more slots to bring server owners. Right now its another NMRIH where you can't really have a community based server which really makes gaming fun.Gameplay needs improvement. Hunted is the only one that does not get old, however the gameplay simply is a big wave of deaths in the beginning and then few people are hiding around the map. So basically it goes from hunted to hide and go seek.The obvious lack of maps but who knows maybe the devs will make more maps faster.Bad server quality. Many times I've seen the servers crash. I believe gameservers.com hosts them as a sponsership and they suck.Hardmode with ff off is needed. FF on a public server with no admin on is stupid nonsense.			"

The only fix I've found for this is to restart the game. All in all, great game. 7/10

												WARNING: THIS REVIEW REFLECTS MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE DURING THE EARLY ACCESS BUILD 4259IT IS IN NO WAY A FULL PRODUCT REVIEW AND IT WILL BE UPDATED IN THE FUTURE AS THE GAME EVOLVESContagion is in many ways the ultimate co-op zombie apocalypse experience. You have many game modes, you have many weapons to grab, tools to use, there is a variety of zombies, it's graphically superior to many other games, and it's a challenge to anybody who wants to play a zombie game and doesn't want to be bothered by a-holes ruining the games, like they do in other zombie games I could mention (but I won't, you already know of which I'm talking about).You shoot the zombies to the brain and the brain explodes, you see the bullet coming out of their head exactly where it should, and it's awesome. You need to take care and not waste your ammo because there's few and it's a valuable and scarce resource; same goes with medkits.There are currently three game modes, one in which you must escape a facility carrying on a number of tasks, another where you need to evacuate a neighbourhood before it gets overwhelmed (and you must hold position barricading and such) and a game called ""hunt"" made for PVP combat. The first two are cooperative, although there is friendly fire so look where you shoot. The last one is a free for all deathmatch; the last man standing wins.Although there are few maps at the time, you can see they are very detailed and won't get bored so easily as there is also a script which randomizes each game making it feel fresh, changing everything from weapon spawns to open hallways and houses.All in all and even though it's early access this game is a gem and if you're into zombie shooters you should give it a test drive because it may be just what you were looking for.

												More effort was put into the commercial for this game than the actual game itself. This feels like an alpha product. It somehow manages to be worse than a free game with nearly the same concept. Everything is clunky, and I mean everything. Even one of the menu's used to pick your ringer for your phone is broken, as the preview button doesn't work. The servers are some of the worst I've played on, your ping will skyrocket as well as everyone else's just randomly. Even with lower ping everything is still laggy as ♥♥♥♥. The gunplay is okay, the sounds are pretty well designed, the voice acting is terrible. There are several weapons that you think you can use, but they are just part of the map itself. The animations for the zombies climbing obstacles are terribly done and as a result, hilarious. The map's are mazes, they have so many different directions that lead to dead ends. Most doors are locked. Any immersion that you thought you had is broken every time a character talks or you go into third person for a stealth kill animation. Every aspect of your movement is either slow or doesn't work half the time. On top of all these things the concept itself is flawed. When you die, you become a much too overpowered version of the undead. You can sprint faster than any human and you are constantly attacking no matter what if you are sprinting. It's even a one hit kill to any human players. Close to the end of any game someone will likely die, and as a result that one player who was bad enough at the game to die (or glitched off of a building) comes back as a zombie and kills everyone else. It is very rare that you will ever win a game, and while that might not be bad, the game is simply not at all fun enough to lose every time at. Don't waste your money, as there is a different, free zombie game with out the ""coming back as a zombie"" mechanic. It also has working servers and a game that isn't nearly as clunky.This game can eat my♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Contagion has stopped responding simulator 2015.  I alt tab and crash, i join server and crash, i open a door and crash. Look this game is fun and there is no denying that but the technical bugs are ghastly. My friend wanted to play with me but it says her pc is under the req. specs fine fair enough but she can run dota at full blast and have no issues. 4gb of ram for dota vs 4gb of ram for contagion should be the same i would hope?! Honestly the time i spend trying to run the game is not worth the time i spend trying to play the game. Fix the glitches and bugs and get back to me.  "

												WARNING: THIS REVIEW REFLECTS MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE DURING THE EARLY ACCESS BUILD 4259IT IS IN NO WAY A FULL PRODUCT REVIEW AND IT WILL BE UPDATED IN THE FUTURE AS THE GAME EVOLVESContagion is in many ways the ultimate co-op zombie apocalypse experience. You have many game modes, you have many weapons to grab, tools to use, there is a variety of zombies, it's graphically superior to many other games, and it's a challenge to anybody who wants to play a zombie game and doesn't want to be bothered by a-holes ruining the games, like they do in other zombie games I could mention (but I won't, you already know of which I'm talking about).You shoot the zombies to the brain and the brain explodes, you see the bullet coming out of their head exactly where it should, and it's awesome. You need to take care and not waste your ammo because there's few and it's a valuable and scarce resource; same goes with medkits.There are currently three game modes, one in which you must escape a facility carrying on a number of tasks, another where you need to evacuate a neighbourhood before it gets overwhelmed (and you must hold position barricading and such) and a game called ""hunt"" made for PVP combat. The first two are cooperative, although there is friendly fire so look where you shoot. The last one is a free for all deathmatch; the last man standing wins.Although there are few maps at the time, you can see they are very detailed and won't get bored so easily as there is also a script which randomizes each game making it feel fresh, changing everything from weapon spawns to open hallways and houses.All in all and even though it's early access this game is a gem and if you're into zombie shooters you should give it a test drive because it may be just what you were looking for.

												One of the best zombie games to come out in a while... This is NOT like Left 4 Dead, run and shoot em up. It's like Half-Life 2 meets Dead Island and DayZ, You have to conserve your ammo, You don't know if you can trust anyone and sneaking around will save your life more then running and gunning, first zombie game where I've gotten scared.  It's only in beta and has a few bugs but they are not that bad, I def rec this game to anyone looking for the next great zombie game. Throw on your headset, crank up the graphics, play in the dark with friends and be ready to get scared and have an awesome time killing zombies or... be a zombie and infect the living! 11 out of 10!

												There is no doubt in my mind that this game is my favorite! Even after a year of playing Contagion I'm still not tired with it. This apocalyptic gem features a few different levels to play with your friends whether you want co-op or pvp.Try to escape a police station before the undead horde claims all of your lives, and if you get left for dead come back as one of the horde to hunt down your ex survivors. Take a spin at pvp. Sure shooters can be fun, but when you throw neutral zombies in the mix its not so easy to just run and gun. If you're one for the classics give panic a shot. Trust me after you play it you'll know why they call it that.This beauty of a game has so much good content already, but it doesn't stop there. These game maker guys throw in some cool updates every now and then to give us new weapon, maps, characters even gamemodes *cough cough flatline*.Stop hesitating and buy it already. You will have hours of fun playing this zombie infested masterpiece. Totally worth a $20 price tag.			"

A once promising game, offering an intriguing addition to the over-saturated ""zombie survival"" genre.Despite its successful initial execution, the development of the game has now been suspended (unofficially or not) due to the developers transferring their priorities to a different project.

												Contagion is ultra realistic zombie apocalypse simulation with different modes and game types, like Hunted (PvP), Escape (exatcly what it means) and Extraction (helping NPC survivors to escape). Ammo is very limited, finding powerful guns can be pretty challenging, and the envirnoment is dark, mostly rainy and full of zombies. Graphics are very realistic, gameplay is nice and non-repetetive. It's all about teamplay; as a L4D2 scavenge rusher and soloer, (yea, right) I also wandered off the group and did objectives myself, but usually you can get yourself killed by doing that (yes, in some modes you can get infected from single scratch). All in all this game very well done, and as the workshop just came to it, it's even getting better. Rating: 8.5/10			"

												The game is decent and still obviously needs way more content.As it stands right now, the way it is going is good.Graphics: The graphics are nicely done and better than most game graphics. Audio: The audio is alright with some guns sounding weird, with even the foot sounds weird but it's fine to get over.Controls: The character control is decent just moving sometimes feels little off and kinda weird when moving around.There are some great features in the game like when you die you become a zombie to attack people... You must manually reload your gun when it runs out (No auto reload) there are a few more.The game is good fun and I have given away a few copies of this game because it is good, just it is a little hard to learn because the phone is the only way of telling you about what to do and where to go, and even then it is vague.The co-op is what makes the game, if you can get a game with your friends and if you complete a mission it restarts and nothing is the same thing.  Things change around, your route is altered so that is good thing.Things are never in the same location and some might be but others not so each time the game makes you search and look because it changes.Anyway a good game and worth buying and playing.

												When I first bought this game I was disapointed. I paid full price for it and I felt confused and annoyed by almost everthing I tried to do. After investing a reasonable amount of playtime into this game, I am happy to say now that I thoroughly enjoy this game. That is why I would really like for more people to buy this game and play it. This game deserves to be more popular. Furthermore, the game is on sale right now so people will be checking it out and there has never been a better time to join if you have considered it. For those reasons I have decided to provide what I think is a good recipe for getting started in Contagion. 1. The first thing you should do is go to start game and select the hunted game mode on any map. Choose solo play, turn infection off, and put the difficulty on easy. You will be dropped into a map with randomly generated zombies and a decent amount of weapons and ammo laying around for you to pick up. Hunted is a pvp game mode and since you are playing solo, this will be a good way for you to just run around aimlessly killing zombies and familiarizing yourself with the gameplay and the maps. Do this until you get tired of it and feel ready for the game to get more intense.2. Now that you have gotten a feel for the game, go to find game, select hunted as the game mode, and join the first server that pops up. From here you will be looking to find and kill the other living characters (not zombies). This is a lot of fun, for beginners and vets alilke. Since your new, you may or may not get killed early, but thats ok since you get to come back from the dead to seek retribution against the living. Basically you get to play the entire time without having to sit and wait just because you died, 3. Have you made any friends yet? If so, check out some of the escape maps and see if they want to play. If not, check out some escape maps anyway, pay attention to your phone, but dont expect it to spell out all the information you need, your gonna need to figure things out on your own. 4. After logging some time in the game, now you are ready to try your skills at extraction. Try to find and save the survivors, but be warned, it gets intense. Just remember to wait for other players before entering the extraction points, as you will need their help when the hoards start to arrive. Not to mention if you go running straight into the houses without waiting for the others, it kinda ruins the game for everyone.5. Have nothing to note on the panic game modes since it's pvp and I've never found a server playing them, looks like it might be fun though. Check this game out!! Happy gaming everyone!			"

												This is one of the best zombie shooter games available.  The graphics are great, the weapon selection is good and the survival gameplay is major in this game.  This also has to be one of the most realistic zombie shooters too.  You have to search for weapons, ammo and supplies.  Sometimes you'll have to look for bolt cutters to cut a chain off a fence or a keycard to open a locked door.  Just like in real life you have to conserve your ammo and learn to share with fellow players.  If you grab all of the ammo they won't have any.  The game makes it easy to share unneeded ammo with fellow players.  To survive you have to work together.  The maps are large and it's easy to loose teammates if you don't stick together.  Unlike Left4Dead you don't have indicatators to help find other players.  I highly recommend using a mic so you can talk to other players.  When under attack you won't have time to type.  This game can be played single player or multiplayer.  But if you play single player don't expect casual gameplay.  Even on easy, this game isn't that easy.  Don't let any of this keep you from getting this game.  If you want a zombie shooter that has great survial gameplay and is well made, this is it!  (Hint: make your headshots count.)ProsA very well made zombie shooter!GraphicsRealisticGood sized mapsEncourages teamworkSome paths in the level randomize with each playthrough.  If you play the same map again the next time you may have to find a different door or take an alternate path to complete the campaign.The developers are always improving and adding to the game.  Sometimes they release a seasonal update to reflect Halloween or Christmas.ConsHosting multiplayer - you have to do it the ""hard way"".  It's not as simple as clicking multiplayer and inviting friends.  You have to do port forwarding.  If you're joining a game you can do it the easy way, just join or have the game to throw you in a random lobby.Zombies glitch a little when around obstacles.			"

												A great zombie game that has potential. Loved it for months played the same maps. Awesome fun.....However I would say that since I bought it I have been waiting for aggggeeessss for some new maps aside from the 4 or so that are on the game. Very unhappy with the progress. It wouldnt take much to release a some maps for the game.The fan base have tried to make decent maps and done well. However are limited. Very disappointed that the developer hasnt pulled finger with this one. Its as if he has just released it and left it, which is totally different for other games on steam that are always updating or getting better.I dont think there is going to be any new maps anytime soon and as a result ive lost interest in this game. Would only reccomend if the game had more maps 10+ maps would be a start.			"

												Honestly. I played this game a couple of times with my friends and It was ok, Didnt feel like a bad game but didnt feel like a good one ither. In its current state I cant recomend buying it but I do like the game itself just if your expecting to get your moneys worth its not worth the 18,99 its being sold at tho I can recomend Project Zomboid as a worthwhile buy. ya see, Contagion is a perfect example of Ambishion and Passion broken down. It was going to be a good game so ive heard, A game worth playing for hours on end and laugh when you mess up and do something stupid but sadly it was never actually achived, Instead i felt like I was wondering around most of the time with little to no enjoyment and being attacked every so often by the ocasional zombie or 5 tho It was fun at parts It wasnt fun overall and I felt like it was more draining to play then anything else. I will stay with the game and watch to see if it actually improves apon its flaws but untill then Im affraid I have to say that Contagion is Not worth buying ( in its current state )			"

												Have you ever wanted to play a serious hardcore survival horror game online with your friends? Well, you've found Contagion.Contagion is a survival horror game with zombie virus as theme, and has online multiplayer support, both co-op against the AI and playing against human zombies. Different modes for different gameplays. You can escape a building full of infected zombies and scarce resource, cross a city looking for a safe place, escort civilians out of a small town or even go crazy and play with your friends as humans and zombies. If you are looking for multiple gameplays, I'm happy to tell you the items and the scenario changes, forcing you to handle different threats and unexpected situations. The game really has this aura that brings you into the survival mood. It makes you want to save ammo, to stick together with your friends, to work as a team.I recommend Contagion. It has a lot the features and the atmosphere of a survival horror, and brings the best of your solo or co-op play. Its only downside is the need of more maps. Most particularly for the ""Escape"" game mode.			"

												This game just simply isn't remarkable.  There is nothing you haven't seen and some of the standard elements you might find in a game like this are missing.1.  There are only about 8 character models - one for each character you can choose from and one infected version of these characters.  These are recylced over and over making for a stale, non-emersive experience.2.  The models are all low res and don't have the visceral feel of something like Dead Island or Dead Rising.  Not a lot of blood.  No dangling body parts.  Sorta like the bad painted face zombies of the early 1980s.3.  The mechanics are a little clunky.  I don'y know how you can take the source engine and make it less elegant but they managed it.4.  Resources are limited and this is good and bad.  I did feel the need to scrounge and save resources but this was partially due to the fact that standard things you might expect are not in the game.   Example - see all that food in the cafeteria?  You might want to eat it to gain some health or at least some stamina buff.  Nope.  Non-interactable.  There is literally no way to heal yourself - that I found - in the game.  Perhaps there is a particular character that is a medic, which would increase team play, but that is not made clear to you in the character selection if so.  I found no method of healing in the game itself - no food, med packs, etc.5.  The environment is bland and interaction options limited making for a non-emersive experience.  Kill a cop zmobie?  no ammo or gun on him.  See that knife sticking out of the dead zombie's head?  Yeah you can't use that.  Unlike most half-life/source mods, you can't even pickup and throw any objects in the room.6.  Stamina system is fine but is pretty unimaginative.  It's a standard mechanic in a lot of survival games now and it makes sense.  But then you have other standard survival horror mechanics missing.  Example - your flashlights have unlimited batteries.7.  Probably the most disappointing part of this game is melee combat.  You have a regular attack and a charge attack.  While you reel from being hit, the zmobies do not.  Even wielding a large sledge hammer, your melee range is about the length of a small toothpick.   The sneak attack thing is highly buggy and this is exasperated by a really underdeveloped stealth system.  If the dev. wanted this to be a part of the game play, the execution needs to be on par with something like State of Decay, Skyrim, or Dishonored.  No stealth or awareness indicator.  The stealth attack can only be executed when you are directly behind the zombie and this often still doesn't work due to environment clipping issues.Final analysis - pass on this.  I gave it a try on the free weekened and glad I didn't spend a dime on it.  With so many other titles in the zombie genre that are quite solid (although I am still waiting for that perfect zombie game), this one is rather forgetable.			"

												There are so many interesting concepts to Contaigon that it's hard to imagine how they made the game so un-enjoyable to play. From the shakey graphics, to the horrible weapon control, and most unforgivably: the lack of any direction to the gamemodes, make this a chore.The only enjoyment I had was on the missions where you have to rescue survivors. In that game mode, the game actually tells you where to go (rather than dropping you in a poorly designed, random, confusing maze) - and there is a nice element of survival boarding up windows and such. But there's only 2 maps for this mode, and the AI you have to save are dumb as a brick.Worth a punt in a sale, but certainly doesn't justify the £15 price tag.			"

Contagion is a game where survival is earned not pwning ""mutated"" zombies, Because there are no mutated zombies just plain zombies and it's realistic not over-powered where an legendary gunslinger's skill is needed to even dare to try this alone and not for those weak at heart missions are to find a way out while not getting infected or make sure your team mates survives i give 9/10 rate for awesome realisme and no free-roam			"

												I'd just like to toss in my two cents, and a hearty concurrence to the review by CunningFox. First of all, the biggest death to this game from my seasoned experience of survival gaming, is definitely the mobility. If you want to make your characters move slow for the sake of difficulty, then you need to base the entire game's format, map layouts, and zombie AI around that. Not have slow straight walking-across-open-spaces, zombies, massive spanning maps with terrible layouts, and little nooks and cranny's that are your actual necessary route, but hidden in a dark corner alleyway. You could pretty easily just melee your way through the entire map with the difficulty of the zombie pathing and behavior, so it's not like making the objectives and map routes hard to find is interesting or difficult, it's just extremely tedious. And then once you learn the route through the maps, the game becomes incredibly simple. It's just a lottery of whether humans become zombies from source external of the actual zombies attacking you; Such as joining late, or willfully being suicidal/EXTREMELY BAD AT GAMES. I mean, the first time me and my friends played escape on that city level, we actually wandered around virtually ignoring the zombies for a good 40 minutes, because the maps are just so circular fenced off in stupid places, with little hidden pathways to circumvent the randomly locked and unlocked doors. This is also so far away from realism and immersion that it becomes implausible to consider scaring or thrilling the player, and yet the genre is horror survival. Rofl. Fence gates you can't climb over, zombies that are about as threatening as counterstrike bots who aren't allowed to have guns, and the mappers in all their aesthetic glory, can't actually map at all. There's no culling, there's invisible walls everywhere because they can't design well, and random piles of debree that look like a nice one way ramp, are actually walls to prevent any access (To the other side, which is also part of the map, but you'll have to walk a big circlejerk circle around the map to get there) I can understand having restricted pathways to get to certain areas in order to make a linear pathway to a final objective, but this is definitely not how you do it. And again about the culling, that is some really terrible mapping. I go from 200fps looking in the direction of the outwards edge of the map, to 30 looking inwards. This is ♥♥♥♥ing source engine, you can take literally 3minutes to learn how to occlusively cull geometry and props, on youtube. Look up 3kliksphilip. This was a terribly impulse purchase in hopes of reigniting the days I loved on L4D in a new experience. Such good prospect, such a broken game. I was praying it was in beta or alpha stages when I closed the game and came back to the store page, because I didn't really look at anything when it was 5$Edit: Also and checking more reviews, I just had a giggle that there's two people who downvote every single negative review, for hundreds of reviews so far.

												This game is really great, it challenges your sense of teamwork and can get really tense at times. The levels suffle different paths and weapon placements each game (This game could use some extra weapon and items scattered around)The downside i see is the zombie gameplay. Playing as a zombie is really boring and quite under powered. Most players turn around often so it make it difficult to sneak up on some players and most users that turn into a zombie just remain afk until the game ends. And the ability to command AI zombies seems pointless to me. Still a great game, worth the buy.			"

												So much to love, so much to hate...To me, contagion is what l4d should add to their game.  This has a realistic/better feel.  Its not arcady like l4d, and the gun system is way different.  Its all about headshots in this game, or blowing them to hell with a grenade.There are many game modes in Contagion.  Really, just keep an eye on your cellphone, (you get text updates and maps), it will somewhat guide you to your next objective.If you can get it for 5, its a steal.  My favorite parts of this game...-playing with others and starting to turn :-D-playing hunted :-Dgood game, but only for $5			"

												I would totally recommend this game if you have at least one buddy to play with on headset. The community is just fine, but the fun ramps up with a friend. If you dont have anyone you know to play with, I think it's a waste of 20 bucks personally. Maps are fun, but the game feels more like a sim more than an actual game. Needs unlockables, maybe new weapon loadouts, perhaps a character leveling system that makes people better at using specific weapons/items - or a medic class. Also...Hunt mode needs a feature where player zombies can always ""smell"" or sense where the human players are. Otherwise it just devolves into a guy playing hide and seek for 10 minutes while everyone else shuffles around in the street. I recommend it but wait till it comes on sale again and pick it up. Deffinitly not for $20.			"

												A very interesting game here is the the real reveiw of the game also somthing to keep in mind though.There are two main types of zombie games. Fast pace Hack N Slash Gore Filled Blockbusters or Mild pace realistic scavange / pvz (Player Vs Human Zed) open world shooters.Most of the people that are down rating the game prefer the big blockbuster titles such as Dead Island or Killing Floor they are into gore skill trees or rpg styled zombie games.This game is the second genre I spoke of. Very fun to play with freinds mild pace scavange / objective style game play with random generated maps. If you cant find ammo your pretty much dead using mele wepons is somthing you should avoid everytime you get hit by an infected there is a chance you will be bitten and die only to return as a zombie and then hunt your freinds. A neat feature you have as a zed is you can see human foot prints and roar to have a squad of 15 zombies rally to you and fight for you. Now we move on to the Guns let me tell you about guns in this game. They did a very good job on the wepons in this game the look good and fire like the real deal there is also no stupid aim assist or anything of the sorts I also forgot to warn you of your flash light the zeds can see it and tred lightly they hear you also and will find and eat you.

												It's not worth it at least for me so this is my opinion. I love zombi games so thats why i bought this. i expected waaay more than the atual content. I like to play lone wolf and solo the maps however you can only play like 4 maps (the city,biolab,police station, park) these maps are soloable but for me i only like the lab+police station other maps are not well designed or confusing for me (like the city). There are more maps like when you spawn in a house and need to wait/survive untill the rescue it's still soloable BUT i hate that map, you need to survive like 20 minutes or more cant remember bassicly the only thing you do is running around and around the house try dodge/kill zeds and thats all..boring. the game need MORE map which able to solo in low difficulty and requires team play in higher diff. I suggest you to save your money and play No more room in hell. its free and its better.Positive:+ zombies..a lots of zombies+ nice game modes to play (however you can only play 1 of them if you have no friends whos have the game or dont want to play with strangers)+ not bad grapcs tho but not the best (is this positive?)+ guns are cool, i like their iron sight and sounds+ large maps, first try they took 40-45 mins to beat themNegatives:- little buggy , zeds clip throug doors and can kill them easly- some maps are confusing- lack of soloable content- could have more weapons- few maps (balanced with game modes...)- few player base- maps are too dark (i know there is a flashlight but cmon you can barely see with flaslight set on)tldr;only buy(in sale) if your friend have(will have it too) so you can enjoy the game for some hours.it has replayability still i would stick to No more room in hell instead of this.i will keep testing the game and open to change my review, i really want so pls devs do your magic.

And when someone gets scratched there screen begins to fade as they can no longer control it and just die as the friends have to put them down as a zombie. This game is pretty awesome with a nice soundtrack, interesting maps and a preferably large variety of weapons to choose from and a strong and high FPS running rate.

												I recommend ""Contagion"" to whoever wants to play a little bit simulative survival game. I love the fact that you need to hit the zombies in their heads to kill them, otherwise you will waste your time. There are lots of weapons like the compound bow or the crossbow (that make me feel like Daryl of TWD), which allow you to regain the same arrow you've shot. I like the type of map where you must cooperate with your team to face hordes of zombies and then escape from a place. There are other type of map, like killing zombies in waves, saving people and guide them to a safe zone (extraction) and others. I really appreciate it.			"

												this game is amazing. this can be coop or pvp game, you choose. play as one of the survivors... until you are bitten. then try to hide symptoms or admit your mates and let em shorten you sufferings. either way, you'll return as undead and try to hunt em, alone or with horde you build-up along the way. play against other survivors, play against zombies, team up, betray, or play solo, save other survivors, barricade the house, wait for help, take others to safe place, use your phone as gps to locate others, to communicate with survivors... lots of modes, lots of maps, lots of paths to choose. atmosphere is amazingly good, tense all the time, scary and nostalgic in a way only zombie apocalypse can make you feel.i see this as advanced, in a way, version of l4d game, it is not so well done as valve's game, but gameplay and modes are more interesting, more stuff to do, more survival aspect in it. although they all are different and unique games, i could put left 4 dead, no more room in hell, and contagion, in same coop zombie fps genre, and everyone who enjoyed any of these games should play the other two too.

												I find myself playing this game on and off for some reason. It's a fun zombie FPS, but it is still missing something in the gameplay. This game is based off of the free Half-Life 2 mod ""Zombie Panic! Source"", so it has the Half-Life game mechanics and feel to it. I really enjoy the PvP ""Hunted"" game mode in Contagion. It's very fast-paced and very intense! It is fairly difficult to play solo though, so teaming up with some friends is a good idea. There are also a good variety of weapons in the game, ranging from melee weapons to guns.To make this short, the game is really fun and has lots of potential to grow. It's defiantly a different type of a zombie survival game for sure. There are some things that could be tweaked/changed, but it's not that big of a deal. This game deserves a 8/10 from me!			"

												First I did not like Contigation. Its concept was far away from ZPS:Source and also it has some big bugs, not many maps but many bluescreens.In the current version I really like it alot! I would say its defently worth it.The developers added Maps, resolved bugs and improved things. Its a lot of fun now. The only thing is that it has a small community because of the first impressions in 2014, 2015. Hopefully more Players join in future and some guys mapping more custom maps!			"

												I would totally recommend this game if you have at least one buddy to play with on headset. The community is just fine, but the fun ramps up with a friend. If you dont have anyone you know to play with, I think it's a waste of 20 bucks personally. Maps are fun, but the game feels more like a sim more than an actual game. Needs unlockables, maybe new weapon loadouts, perhaps a character leveling system that makes people better at using specific weapons/items - or a medic class. Also...Hunt mode needs a feature where player zombies can always ""smell"" or sense where the human players are. Otherwise it just devolves into a guy playing hide and seek for 10 minutes while everyone else shuffles around in the street. I recommend it but wait till it comes on sale again and pick it up. Deffinitly not for $20.			"

												The game is not like most zombie games. It feels more realistic and dependent. I'm a fan of the walking dead (If you like TWD get this game now) and I like the fact that shots to the head to the trick. Unlike L4D2 when your just spraying into the body. And when someone gets scratched there screen begins to fade as they can no longer control it and just die as the friends have to put them down as a zombie. This game is pretty awesome with a nice soundtrack, interesting maps and a preferably large variety of weapons to choose from and a strong and high FPS running rate. Game is really worth it I would really recommend trying this out!			"

												An alright way to spend your time.  I don't know if it should really be worth $20, but it is a nice game.  Gameplay:  about like any other first-person-zombie-survival-shooter, so, check.  Graphics:  okay, check.  Sound: at times terrifying and at other times just down right annoying, check.  There are not may different game modes, but that's alright, things will always be changed up so you won't play a map the exact same way after just completing it.  I enjoyed the Co-op mode, but hated the PvP mode (only because I never got a chance, sniper from four or five buildings down the street or a player zombie just infected me while I was looking for some ammunition).(In other words: I suck.)It's an alright game, I enjoyed it.  I wouldn't say it's $20 alright, but if you could get it on sale, I would say go for it!			"

												Runs beautifully on my computer, which goes to show a good level of technical competence on the peoples who made this game. Gameplay is cool too, you shoot zombies, rescue survivors and do the usual zombie killing gig. Maps are beautiful and really neat, especially the one in the centre of a major city.Sometimes I just play this game to watch how smoothly and effortlessly it runs.Recommended because it is well coded and there's no pay-to-win or such nonsense on the MP side.

												I recommend ""Contagion"" to whoever wants to play a little bit simulative survival game. I love the fact that you need to hit the zombies in their heads to kill them, otherwise you will waste your time. There are lots of weapons like the compound bow or the crossbow (that make me feel like Daryl of TWD), which allow you to regain the same arrow you've shot. I like the type of map where you must cooperate with your team to face hordes of zombies and then escape from a place. There are other type of map, like killing zombies in waves, saving people and guide them to a safe zone (extraction) and others. I really appreciate it.			"

It's original, well executed and most of all enjoyable without the tedious aspects you get with other zombie FPS survival games. Considering it's still in it's Beta phase it is definately on it's way to being a very successful and well known game amongst the zombie lovers market. Well worth the money, even when not on sale.

												I'd just like to toss in my two cents, and a hearty concurrence to the review by CunningFox. First of all, the biggest death to this game from my seasoned experience of survival gaming, is definitely the mobility. If you want to make your characters move slow for the sake of difficulty, then you need to base the entire game's format, map layouts, and zombie AI around that. Not have slow straight walking-across-open-spaces, zombies, massive spanning maps with terrible layouts, and little nooks and cranny's that are your actual necessary route, but hidden in a dark corner alleyway. You could pretty easily just melee your way through the entire map with the difficulty of the zombie pathing and behavior, so it's not like making the objectives and map routes hard to find is interesting or difficult, it's just extremely tedious. And then once you learn the route through the maps, the game becomes incredibly simple. It's just a lottery of whether humans become zombies from source external of the actual zombies attacking you; Such as joining late, or willfully being suicidal/EXTREMELY BAD AT GAMES. I mean, the first time me and my friends played escape on that city level, we actually wandered around virtually ignoring the zombies for a good 40 minutes, because the maps are just so circular fenced off in stupid places, with little hidden pathways to circumvent the randomly locked and unlocked doors. This is also so far away from realism and immersion that it becomes implausible to consider scaring or thrilling the player, and yet the genre is horror survival. Rofl. Fence gates you can't climb over, zombies that are about as threatening as counterstrike bots who aren't allowed to have guns, and the mappers in all their aesthetic glory, can't actually map at all. There's no culling, there's invisible walls everywhere because they can't design well, and random piles of debree that look like a nice one way ramp, are actually walls to prevent any access (To the other side, which is also part of the map, but you'll have to walk a big circlejerk circle around the map to get there) I can understand having restricted pathways to get to certain areas in order to make a linear pathway to a final objective, but this is definitely not how you do it. And again about the culling, that is some really terrible mapping. I go from 200fps looking in the direction of the outwards edge of the map, to 30 looking inwards. This is ♥♥♥♥ing source engine, you can take literally 3minutes to learn how to occlusively cull geometry and props, on youtube. Look up 3kliksphilip. This was a terribly impulse purchase in hopes of reigniting the days I loved on L4D in a new experience. Such good prospect, such a broken game. I was praying it was in beta or alpha stages when I closed the game and came back to the store page, because I didn't really look at anything when it was 5$Edit: Also and checking more reviews, I just had a giggle that there's two people who downvote every single negative review, for hundreds of reviews so far.

												It's not worth it at least for me so this is my opinion. I love zombi games so thats why i bought this. i expected waaay more than the atual content. I like to play lone wolf and solo the maps however you can only play like 4 maps (the city,biolab,police station, park) these maps are soloable but for me i only like the lab+police station other maps are not well designed or confusing for me (like the city). There are more maps like when you spawn in a house and need to wait/survive untill the rescue it's still soloable BUT i hate that map, you need to survive like 20 minutes or more cant remember bassicly the only thing you do is running around and around the house try dodge/kill zeds and thats all..boring. the game need MORE map which able to solo in low difficulty and requires team play in higher diff. I suggest you to save your money and play No more room in hell. its free and its better.Positive:+ zombies..a lots of zombies+ nice game modes to play (however you can only play 1 of them if you have no friends whos have the game or dont want to play with strangers)+ not bad grapcs tho but not the best (is this positive?)+ guns are cool, i like their iron sight and sounds+ large maps, first try they took 40-45 mins to beat themNegatives:- little buggy , zeds clip throug doors and can kill them easly- some maps are confusing- lack of soloable content- could have more weapons- few maps (balanced with game modes...)- few player base- maps are too dark (i know there is a flashlight but cmon you can barely see with flaslight set on)tldr;only buy(in sale) if your friend have(will have it too) so you can enjoy the game for some hours.it has replayability still i would stick to No more room in hell instead of this.i will keep testing the game and open to change my review, i really want so pls devs do your magic.

												This game is simply one of the best ""zombie apocalypse"" multiplayer I've ever had.It mixes a litlte bit of realism with a little bit of fast paced gameplay. The game contains good puzzles in the escape maps, and it requires a good level of cooperation on the extraction maps.Ammo isn't avaliable anywhere, so make any of your shots count, and don't forget to share it with your comrades. This has made this game pretty neat.But hey, now there is the PVP mode. One thing that annoyed me in the past zombie games/mods, was the PVP. One team of humans vs zombies. Just that. Humans could get to high places and spam M4A1 shots on them, making it impossible for zombies to reach, but in Contagion, this is different. The PVP mode is a mix of FFA with a VS and King of the Hill Mode. You have to kill the other players in order to survive, and be advised, all the players begin as humans. Killed some of them? Nice! But watch out, because they will come back from hell as reanimated corpses and hunt you down, and this is one of the best parts on this game: Humans. Are. Not. O.P against the zombies. This little fact over here made this game one of the best Multiplayer experiences I had on 2013, and it will be one of the best of 2014.			"

												A very interesting game here is the the real reveiw of the game also somthing to keep in mind though.There are two main types of zombie games. Fast pace Hack N Slash Gore Filled Blockbusters or Mild pace realistic scavange / pvz (Player Vs Human Zed) open world shooters.Most of the people that are down rating the game prefer the big blockbuster titles such as Dead Island or Killing Floor they are into gore skill trees or rpg styled zombie games.This game is the second genre I spoke of. Very fun to play with freinds mild pace scavange / objective style game play with random generated maps. If you cant find ammo your pretty much dead using mele wepons is somthing you should avoid everytime you get hit by an infected there is a chance you will be bitten and die only to return as a zombie and then hunt your freinds. A neat feature you have as a zed is you can see human foot prints and roar to have a squad of 15 zombies rally to you and fight for you. Now we move on to the Guns let me tell you about guns in this game. They did a very good job on the wepons in this game the look good and fire like the real deal there is also no stupid aim assist or anything of the sorts I also forgot to warn you of your flash light the zeds can see it and tred lightly they hear you also and will find and eat you.

												An alright way to spend your time.  I don't know if it should really be worth $20, but it is a nice game.  Gameplay:  about like any other first-person-zombie-survival-shooter, so, check.  Graphics:  okay, check.  Sound: at times terrifying and at other times just down right annoying, check.  There are not may different game modes, but that's alright, things will always be changed up so you won't play a map the exact same way after just completing it.  I enjoyed the Co-op mode, but hated the PvP mode (only because I never got a chance, sniper from four or five buildings down the street or a player zombie just infected me while I was looking for some ammunition).(In other words: I suck.)It's an alright game, I enjoyed it.  I wouldn't say it's $20 alright, but if you could get it on sale, I would say go for it!			"

												First I did not like Contigation. Its concept was far away from ZPS:Source and also it has some big bugs, not many maps but many bluescreens.In the current version I really like it alot! I would say its defently worth it.The developers added Maps, resolved bugs and improved things. Its a lot of fun now. The only thing is that it has a small community because of the first impressions in 2014, 2015. Hopefully more Players join in future and some guys mapping more custom maps!			"

												 Nice Survival Horror romp, much like Left4Dead, but less run-and-gun... It's slower paced and more tense imho.Running out into a hoarde of Zombies will likey result in you joining them, unlike L4D, where you can soak up damagelike a sponge. I really can't wait to see where they take this in the end.Even though it's not finished yet, I can already tell this will be one of those games I will be playing 2 years from now.			"

												This isn't your typical zombie shooter. This is a round by round zombie survival game that you collect wepons and bullets as you go through the level. It realy takes you into the game, makes you feel like your there with the other survivors. Although when you die and become a zombie and gather all the zombies possible and hide them in a room so the survivors can win it kinda ruins the experience. I defently recommend this game!			"

												As aplayer who tends to avoid these sorts of games I would have to see that Contagion has something special. I have found myself becoming more involved as time passes. Seeing as how no two play throughs are the same I have found that the method of remembering drop locations has become obsolete. Cautious play through is always necessary and strenth in numbers seems to have become my new religion. Seriously, Great buy. Tell your Friends and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up!			"

I have played this game at lan parties and it was a lot of fun. Definiltey reccomended especially with the current winter sale price. Pick this one up and check it out!			"

												If I would buy this for the first time I would second guess thanks to all the negative comments here, but this is what I have to say:In the beginning of the release, yes they lacked content and replayability was close to none.Now after a while I saw the game on special sale and I thought ""well now some time has passed, maybe the game is more fun now"".I was actually right, the way this game has improved since the first time I was playing it is huge, lots of more maps, modes etc.It still has it flaws but I trust the developers that they will fix them in time since they come this far already.I recommend this game simply because I now enjoyed playing it.I look forward to future updates and upcoming DLC's.You should definitely buy this game while it is on sale, after all it is quite a fun Zombie Game and as an Zombie Panic! oldschooler I can say that I enjoy this, especially with the new ""Panic"" mode that reflects perfect on the ZP game.7/10I see you in the game!

												Adventures in Contagion.1. Threw away useless key after needing space for a gun. Later spent 10 minutes had me and my bro-op partner backtracking trying to find the room where the key was, next 5 minutes trying get them out from under a bed.2. Zombie breaks down a door and smacks me in the face, promptly had to go replace pants.3. Me and bro-op partner doing well. Out comes a zombie in riot gear, Broson gets eaten by a zombie, I'm left bleeding with 1 bullet, promptly eaten by Broson.10/10 would get eaten by a zombified Broson again.---Extremely well done for a source engine game, needs some polish but its the first zombie game to fill the void left by BrainBread I've ever found.

												The price point is too high, but this game does a great job of recreating the tense, twitchy situations of Zombie Panic. The atmosphere and sound is good at setting the dark tone, and the combat takes a more realistic approach, requiring precise aim and manual reloading. Playing a survivor is fun: scavenging for weapons, barricading a house, avoiding the undead and taking a few of them out silently, then sneaking up on a fellow survivor and executing them for their sniper rifle and vantage point is satisfying. Playing as a zombie is frustrating, but it is about as good as it can be. Player zombies have slightly better manueverability and the ability control the horde.There are three main modes: extraction, escape, and hunted. Hunted is the true gem. It is a PvP game mode where everyone starts off in a random spot with a few supplies, and the only rule is to be the last one left alive. I always try to forge an uneasy alliance with whoever is around me early on, each of us knowing that if things go our way then eventually one of us has to die. Large gunfights attract zombies, and any players who die become a fresh walker ready to head straight back for the camping point they just died at. It can get very tense, especially while hiding in a closet with a revolver pointed at the door while gunshots, broken windows and screams echo around you.Extraction is a co-op mode has you going from house to house and searching for survivors, then fending off waves of zombies as you lead them to safety. It's fun and challenging because each person is limited in what they can carry and do. If a person is barricading they cannot shoot, and it is useless to have a sniper and shotgun at the same time. The AI survivors however, are useless and will die without protection, even with a gun. The maps also last way too long, and most people will not make it to the end. Escape is an objective based co-op mode that isn't really all that enjoyable. As you work your way through various obstacles and puzzles, anyone who dies becomes a zombie. In the beginning it is too easy as there are only a few zombies to deal with. The difficulty either stays that way because everyone works together, or it falls apart because too many people die and overwhelm the survivors. The puzzles are okay but using a smart phone to check objectives and locations of keys isn't really that fun.			"

												Don't get me wrong you can have alot of fun in this game BUT it is full with bugs and glitches. We found nothing gamebreaking so far but it can still ruin your experience. There's alot of good things in this game and it can be quite challenging at times but there's a reason why it is below 100 players average. Sure this game doesn't need a million players it has no large maps and servers that can host large amounts of players but there are certain gamemodes that would be way more fun with a larger amount of players than just with one maybe two friends.If you wan't to play a zombie game like this play no more room in hell which is free and also has a LOT of players compared to Contagion.I can only recommend you to buy Contagion when its on a sale and when you're only looking for a coop game to play with friends not a multiplayer game to play with randos.Sources for player counts:http://steamcharts.com/app/238430http://steamcharts.com/app/224260 "

												I previously had a positive review on this game it was a good game at the time and I enjoyed playing it. Like I said it WAS a good game.... I recently tried playing it again two days ago and it was terrible it wasn't fun, I couldn't find a game with more than 2 people in it, and I can't run it anymore. Which is strange because on my old PC I could still run this game on high... and when I got my new PC almost a year ago I could play this game on max settings with no problem at 50-60 FPS. But the other day when I tried to play I hopped on a solo/lan server and could barely get 20 FPS on low settings, I don't know if there were any game breaking updates or anything like that but I feel like the game isn't playable anymore, and that the community even though it was small before is now non existent. With not being able to find servers with more than two people and the game running like garbage... when it used to run excellently, I'm going to have to re-review it as not recommended.			"

												The price point is too high, but this game does a great job of recreating the tense, twitchy situations of Zombie Panic. The atmosphere and sound is good at setting the dark tone, and the combat takes a more realistic approach, requiring precise aim and manual reloading. Playing a survivor is fun: scavenging for weapons, barricading a house, avoiding the undead and taking a few of them out silently, then sneaking up on a fellow survivor and executing them for their sniper rifle and vantage point is satisfying. Playing as a zombie is frustrating, but it is about as good as it can be.

												I wish I can put this to be a neutral but I have to pick from the 2The game can be great if you have friends to play with and a private server. That way I would recommend the game.But it seams that devs did give up on this game. This is not a finished game. If you can get it on 80-90% off you can get it for yourself and your friends. The game is slow zombies and you have to save your ammo and really get the head shoots in there. There are some nice weapons and everything.The main problem is if you don't know where to go or what to do. If people that do know what to do join you will just run after them and try to survive and still not know what to do. And if people that don't know join than they will die fast and they will be human zombies that are more powerful and you will probably end up dead before you know what to do.			"

												It's a pretty good game in my opinion, but has some problems. It's not bugged, everything is fixed, updates every month, but it doesn't have unpredictability of some sort. There are only 3 types of game and only 3 maps. It would MUCH better if the developers weren't that 'money sick' and didn't say that the will make other maps only when they'll get 300.000$... but anyway the game is worth the price and you can watch my full review of it IN RUSSIAN by clicking on this link:

												Okay, where do i begin?This is an early access game.That much is for sure but don't let that deceive you into thinking this game isn't good.It has so much potential and with that in mind, play it without thinking of the other games that have come before it (Left 4 Dead 1-2, Killing Floor, etc.) so that you'll experience it as the devs intended. I like how they decided to make ammunition scarce, making the experience almost like real life. You are not likely to find a gun and a ton of ammo next to it behind a desk in real life. Well unless you're in a gun shop but i digress..The stamina meter system forces players to pace themselves in order to survive as you would in a zombie apocalypse scenario.Lastly, this game was meant to be played in Co-op. Playing it alone to practice is utterly boring, it would be better to play it with friends and gradually learn how to survive rather than do it on your own.For an early access game it is really really good. I enjoyed playing, surviving, dying and shooting in the game and i'd play it again as soon as my friends are free to do so as well.Solid 8/10 material. Would be 10/10 probably when the game is fully developed. I am excited to see what else they can put in the game.			"

												This game is decent, even tho it's still in beta stage I hope this game can become alot better by release. Basicly it's a L4D2 game but with less ammo, less zombies, more survival and there is ""game modes"" in which there is objectives or just plain survive versus other humans. If you die , you become a zombie to try to stop them. Good multiplayer idea and decent game so far in beta stage. Hope this game can become better, because right now it's kinda simple and dull. It should have however great potential if you can invite your friends over, and you protect a house or fort or something, while a ""horde"" or wave of zombies try to kill you.Ps. The only scary thing about this game is the humans with mics who sound like frickin ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ while they speak in a language or attempt to speak english.My score: 6.5 out of 10.			"

												The best part about this game is thefact that it has split-screen, but that is quite buggy as when one person dies you can no longer veiw the texts and verticle mode doesn't work, also the second player can only veiw the texts while the first person is veiwing the texts. I would manly recomend this game to people that have friends that come over often or friends that have this game. The graphics are not the best, but I don't expect that much from a $10 still in development game made in the source engine. The game is obviously not perfect and could probably do with a story mode or something of that like.			"

												Update:So is this game still recommended? Yes, but barely. Keep your expectations low as Contagion rarely receives updates (if any) now. I would recommend buying ‘Contagion’ on a sale or getting it through a trade.  Much of the hype for Contagion has died and fans (players) of the game (like myself) have moved on to better games– so finding players may be a bit of a challenge. This is partially due to the slow release of the DLC “Flatline” and the lack of contents in the finished product. Some improvements the devs should make is an option for PvE (or an option to respawn) in game modes like “Extraction” and “Escape”. ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––An early access review:Superb! Faith restored in indie game devs!This is one of the very few early access games that is worth getting; even at the full price of $14.99. Contagion is very stable and playable even at its early build. I've encountered minimal (to no) problems/errors or bugs so far. The developers are incredibly friendly, responsive and helpful. They take constructive criticisms positively and strive to improve the game. I can't wait for the final release.			"

												Just wow. Even if this game is still in development this game is really well made so far. It has the right idea for a multiplayer zombie survival horror game. There are some really good mechanics such as: infecting humans as a zombie, roaring to attract nearby zombies to create your own horde as a zombie, awesome instant sneak kills from a melee weapon as a human survivor, and a lot more I do not care to mention. All I am saying is that even though this game is still early access it is very well made. Though it does need a lot more content and more weapons and more types of zombies, but right now this game is very addicting and is worth your time. This game is also challenging when you have to face zombie hordes AND survivors! Anyone can enjoy this game and appreciate the attention to detail. 7.6/10			"

												Admit it, thanks to DayZ, we are simply overflowed with zombie games.Unfortunately most of them are monotone and feels like they're all the same.Contagion is nothing like that. It's the good ol' Resident Evil in first person, created with the jolly good Source Engine.The atmosphere gets tense slowly and the whole setting makes you feel that this growling you've just heard a minute ago somehow got louder, which means you're gonna cover your rear a lot.There are many useful features like unloading weapons and taking mags from the same weapon types.Although the game is still swimming in bugs and not that many maps, the potential gets bigger and bigger.I want this game to become an Indie Game of 2014 year, do you understand, Mr. Monochrome LLC?

												Well i have put in 4 hours into Contagion so far and mostly played Hunter mode. So far im loving this game! definitly worth the 10 bucks i spent. A lot of reviews seem to say bad visuals, bad maps, no point to it... i highly disagree. For a short summary, Hunter Mode is so much fun. its a couple humans scrounging for weapons and ammo, while having the ability to barricade windows and doors a bit from zombies. Its PvP during the hunt for ammo and guns and also to avoid the odd zombie or horde of zombies that come your way if you stay still. You can only kill a zombie with a headshot or a melee weapon to the head and shooting will also give away your position, as does your flashlight! Oh and you carry around an Android Smartphone and you need to pop it up often to see when enimies are nearby (also vibrates when close) and what your objectives are.I have seen one glitch so far in Extraction mode where the AI human got glitched in a bush and we couldnt complete the match.But overall from 4 hours of continual play, i highly enjoy this game and its a blast if you have a couple of buddies or not to play with!8/10Pros: Good Visuals (id compare to L4D2 for visuals) teamworkexplorationintenseCons:The odd glitch. not a lot of maps (enough to be satisfied with)some servers are laggy (as are all games)			"

												Buggy but fun. This game has a lot of potential to be a nifty zombie survial game but as it stand there are bugs galore. Zombies get stuck on things and freak out, some will come for you even though you haven't moved or made a sound they just magically see you. The most frustrating thing is the PvP aspect, the shots do not land where you shoot (I shot like 2 feet off of target and got a kill), the sniper rifle is atrocious, the sound is extremely lacking. It's near impossible to tell what or who's footsteps you're hearing or something may just run up to you and not make any sound. That being said, so far when I've played this game with a friend it's been a blast. The hunt is my favorite map type so far. The game is still in beta though so I'm hoping most if not all this is fixed.			"

												Contagion is a standalone zombie survival/campeign/PvP/cooperative game run on the Source Engine. Created by the developers of Zombie Panic: Source, aswell as being inspired by it, the game really stands out apon high quality graphics, gore level L4D2, and it's confusing, long lasting objective campeigns.Zombie Panic: SourceZP:S was my favorite mod for some time. I loved the ambient environment the developers gave to the maps. I enjoyed the concept of NEVER waiting after death, and you get to return as a zombie to infect the unsuspecting, almost helpless humans. The objectives it gave to the map were not confusing like in Contagion.Objective based gameplayThe ""Escape"" gamemode is rather confusing and really long, I do like long objective based campeigns, but I find it repetitive when the campeigns get you lost all the time. The maps are randomised, so they are incredibly confusing. I, aswell as many other people have been lost countless times looking for a button to open a door.Gore, & GraphicsThe gore and graphics are astounding. It's what peaks my eye, it looks fascinating for the Source Engine. This and, 'No More Room in Hell' (another Source mod) are the top 2 for graphically awesome Source games/mods I've ever seen. (This one is number 1).Contagion still seems incomplete in only some areas, which may be fixed by frequent game updates. If there's anything I can recommend for the game, I recommend adding some maps from Zombie Panic: Source, remastering and implementing them in the game, I think that would be an awesome expirience for the people that have played the mod in the past.98.6/100			"

												**Playing Random Multiplayer Match**Journal Entry 1 I've dropped into the street of an urban area, no idea where the hell I am or what im doing. Apparently im playing the role of a police officer who due to his talents and training has survived the undead takeover. I have a pistol and a flashlight and im feeling pretty good about how quiet these streets look. The houses are nice but show signs of being boarded up and busted in, whatever happened here... it happened fast! Journal Entry 2 This is like an episode of Leave it to beaver... but there isn't any happy singing folks jumping around. I creep quietly along a white picket fence and take cover behind a white car. I can see someone up on the road walking really slowly.. Ok it looks like another player maybe? I turn off my light slowly creep up behind him, the closer I get the more odd the players behavior becomes. I get right up behind him and then he turns... well ... that's not a player at all, before me lies the bloodied face and nattering jaws of really nasty looking undead monster. Journal Entry 3 I whip on my light and take a steady aim down the barrel.... The creature gives out a shriek and starts running at me, I take very careful calm aim and fire. A perfect headshot, I can see the exit wound clearly pop open from the back of his head like a straw going through the pre-cut slits in a slurpee lid. He instantly goes silent and falls to the ground with a thud, now I hear more noises and more shrieks from all around me. It appears we woke up the rest of his friends.... Journal Entry 4 The undead are now locked in on my position and waves of them from dirty back alleys and busted up backyard fences moan and scream as they come towards me. I begin picking off the closest targets that I can get, headshoting to the best of my ability. I kill probably a dozen but they keep coming, wave after wave. I'm running low on ammo now, I've only got 5 rounds left and there are about 10 zombies close enough to deserve the bullets. I've stupidly backed myself into a fenced yard with no escape route. The only way out is in the direction that the zombies are coming in... crap this is bad... well its been a good run... I take very careful aim and shoot the next 5 zombies with perfect headshots, behind them comes a hoard of about 7 more. I don't think I will be able to charge through them, I accept my defeat and wait for them to get me.... Journal Entry 5 All the sudden I hear gunfire... wtf.... I see flashlights bouncing off the cracks in the fence and footsteps running. I hear machine gun fire and pistols going off everywhere. A group of 3 other players rush in and save the day, a feeling of relief and awesomeness washes over me as they pick off the 7 zombies that were about to make dinner out of me. I join up with the group and follow them onward into the street. Journal Entry 6 The hoards are getting worse and worse as we progress up the blocks of this pleasant valley neighborhood, Another player states that we need to go hold up somewhere until the waves calm down a bit. We find a reasonably well boarded up house and decide to take it over, we move in clearing room by room. I now have ammo again and am able to help out with the room clearing. Suddenly the waves of zombies decide to start charging the house, the doors are shut and the windows boarded.... it is here that we make our stand, we load up our guns and take our positions.... the screams of zombies makes it sound like thousands of them are outside... we begin to hear the doors getting kicked and smashed.... they are coming through... lets do this! 9/10 "

												This game has many rough edges (which is to expect, being an alpha). Hitbox issues, the inventory is horrible, animation quirks, bugs, and a lot of small, but visible problems.That being said, it's a surprisingly nice game, and I am getting more enjoyment out of that I thought I would.It runs the risk of being TOO punishing on its players, though. I would love to have the ability to customize my game further, adding things like the ability to ressurect dead players. It really sucks when you want to just play a co-op session with your friends and one of them dies in the beginning and cannot play with the rest of the game.There isn't a lot of content yet, but it's a very promising game that if you don't get now, you should definetly get upon release.

												I think I got this game for $4.99 or something, on sale, and it was worth every penny! At first the game was really laggy for me, but then I changed the video settings to ""very high"" and the game looked awesome and worked fine! It lags a bit from time to time but it does not hinder my performance. Lots of people play this game and most are friendly players, some people do not work well as a team... but that is the way with any cooperative gameplay and especially in a zombie game.   A lot of people compare this with Left 4 Dead and a lot say otherwise, truth is Valve was also Left 4 Dead so... YES, in many aspects this game is much like Left 4 Dead. I like the levels, they are pretty big and lots of places to search, hide, snipe, etc. I enjoy most game types for this game... my biggest issue with the game overall is, being a zombie... it SUCKS! Sometimes I am spawned really far away, or in a deadend, or my scent trail runs cold and I can't track the survivors. But it has made me get better at surviving because I don't want to be a dang zombie.   There are no ""special"" zombies either which I like, the only thing close to that in this game is the riot police zombie which is slow, dumb, and easy to dodge. I never liked a lot of ""special infected"" like the smoker from L4D is so unreal, or just about any special zombie in Resident Evil. There is a good selection of weapons to weild and I like that you need to find special tools for special tasks. Like you need to find a nail gun then you need to find a wood to board up windows and doorways. Or some doors are locked and you need to find a key, or bolt cutters to clip the chain on doors... pretty frustrating at times though, not finding what you need with a hoard on your tail.   I would recommend this game, I have had a lot of fun with it already.Rating  7.5/10+Zombies!+Level design+Weapons & tools-Being a zombie... :{}			"

												The very popular sequel to Infection, Infection 2: Disease, Infection 3: Spreading Viruses, Infection 4: Transmition Proliferation Dissemination Simulator 2012.The main story revolves around the Contaigions that were caused by infectious agents such as viruses, viroids, and prions, microorganisms such as bacteria, nematodes such as roundworms and pinworms, arthropods such as ticks, mites, fleas, and lice, fungi such as ringworm, and other macroparasites such as tapeworms. You personally are responsible to attempt to counter the current contaigion in the areas by all of the equipment that you have.There's also a minor sub plot involving zombies, who are fictional undead creatures regularly encountered in horror and fantasy themed works. They are typically depicted as mindless, reanimated corpses with a hunger for human flesh, and particularly for human brains in some depictions. Although they share their name and some superficial similarities with the zombie from Haitian Vodun, their links to such folklore are unclear.			"

												Contagion has grown a lot through development into its final release, it has a team of devoted and friendly devs who've commited to the concept whole heartedly.  Though graphically at times it may be lacking it is still capable of producing some great gaming experiences. However what is important is that you play it with friends as that improves the experience massively. Nothing like lying to your friends about being infected and then turning on them!If you were a fan of zombie panic or anything zombie related, this is a no brainer (pun intended aha) Grab a pack while its on special and get in and have some fun with your friends!

												So, Contagion.I'm not a fan of twitch shooter's or zombie games, so when I recieved a copy of this game from one of my friends in an after christmas gift giving spree we all took part in... i was less than exicted.While I am flat out terrible at the game, I will say that it is extremely enjoyable. The major reason? It perfectly captures the atmosphere of a Zombie Survival.What I mean is, until you finally succumb to your wounds and the infection takes over, you will try your damndest to survive and help your other survivors, excepting the Hunt PvP game mode. When the infection takes over however, it becomes immensely satisfying to hunt down your friends and bury them beneath a horde of undead. The game really ramps up as soon as a survivor dies, as now one zombie that looks like any other, has human intelligence and wants everyone dead like them.So yeah, I like it, and fans of Schadenfreude should too.

												This game has a couple of good elements that are a refreshing change from other zombie games. There is a solid survival horror feel that translates well into a multiplayer setting.			"

												Admit it, thanks to DayZ, we are simply overflowed with zombie games.Unfortunately most of them are monotone and feels like they're all the same.Contagion is nothing like that. It's the good ol' Resident Evil in first person, created with the jolly good Source Engine.The atmosphere gets tense slowly and the whole setting makes you feel that this growling you've just heard a minute ago somehow got louder, which means you're gonna cover your rear a lot.There are many useful features like unloading weapons and taking mags from the same weapon types.Although the game is still swimming in bugs and not that many maps, the potential gets bigger and bigger.I want this game to become an Indie Game of 2014 year, do you understand, Mr. Monochrome LLC?

												Well i have put in 4 hours into Contagion so far and mostly played Hunter mode. So far im loving this game! definitly worth the 10 bucks i spent. A lot of reviews seem to say bad visuals, bad maps, no point to it... i highly disagree. For a short summary, Hunter Mode is so much fun. its a couple humans scrounging for weapons and ammo, while having the ability to barricade windows and doors a bit from zombies. Its PvP during the hunt for ammo and guns and also to avoid the odd zombie or horde of zombies that come your way if you stay still. You can only kill a zombie with a headshot or a melee weapon to the head and shooting will also give away your position, as does your flashlight! Oh and you carry around an Android Smartphone and you need to pop it up often to see when enimies are nearby (also vibrates when close) and what your objectives are.I have seen one glitch so far in Extraction mode where the AI human got glitched in a bush and we couldnt complete the match.But overall from 4 hours of continual play, i highly enjoy this game and its a blast if you have a couple of buddies or not to play with!8/10Pros: Good Visuals (id compare to L4D2 for visuals) teamworkexplorationintenseCons:The odd glitch. not a lot of maps (enough to be satisfied with)some servers are laggy (as are all games)			"

												The very popular sequel to Infection, Infection 2: Disease, Infection 3: Spreading Viruses, Infection 4: Transmition Proliferation Dissemination Simulator 2012.The main story revolves around the Contaigions that were caused by infectious agents such as viruses, viroids, and prions, microorganisms such as bacteria, nematodes such as roundworms and pinworms, arthropods such as ticks, mites, fleas, and lice, fungi such as ringworm, and other macroparasites such as tapeworms. You personally are responsible to attempt to counter the current contaigion in the areas by all of the equipment that you have.There's also a minor sub plot involving zombies, who are fictional undead creatures regularly encountered in horror and fantasy themed works. They are typically depicted as mindless, reanimated corpses with a hunger for human flesh, and particularly for human brains in some depictions. Although they share their name and some superficial similarities with the zombie from Haitian Vodun, their links to such folklore are unclear.			"

												I think I got this game for $4.99 or something, on sale, and it was worth every penny! At first the game was really laggy for me, but then I changed the video settings to ""very high"" and the game looked awesome and worked fine! It lags a bit from time to time but it does not hinder my performance. Lots of people play this game and most are friendly players, some people do not work well as a team... but that is the way with any cooperative gameplay and especially in a zombie game.   A lot of people compare this with Left 4 Dead and a lot say otherwise, truth is Valve was also Left 4 Dead so... YES, in many aspects this game is much like Left 4 Dead. I like the levels, they are pretty big and lots of places to search, hide, snipe, etc. I enjoy most game types for this game... my biggest issue with the game overall is, being a zombie... it SUCKS! Sometimes I am spawned really far away, or in a deadend, or my scent trail runs cold and I can't track the survivors. But it has made me get better at surviving because I don't want to be a dang zombie.   There are no ""special"" zombies either which I like, the only thing close to that in this game is the riot police zombie which is slow, dumb, and easy to dodge. I never liked a lot of ""special infected"" like the smoker from L4D is so unreal, or just about any special zombie in Resident Evil. There is a good selection of weapons to weild and I like that you need to find special tools for special tasks. Like you need to find a nail gun then you need to find a wood to board up windows and doorways. Or some doors are locked and you need to find a key, or bolt cutters to clip the chain on doors... pretty frustrating at times though, not finding what you need with a hoard on your tail.   I would recommend this game, I have had a lot of fun with it already.Rating  7.5/10+Zombies!+Level design+Weapons & tools-Being a zombie... :{}			"

												3.5/5 gameI figured I would give this game a chance since it was up for free for the weekend. Now, I'm a big fan of killing zombies, I rarely get tired of putting a shot or a axe in the skull of a zombie. With this in mind, I like what Contagion is, but there are things about it I'm not too crazy about it. Before I go about posting what I think is great about the game, I will start with the things I'm not too crazy about.1. Forgettable characters - Aside from picking the character you like, that is really about all there is to character selection. There just isn't anything that makes you remember the character beyond it's appearance.2. Lack of a story - Now I know the game isn't a RPG or anything, but a little bit of story would be nice. Matter of fact it would be a nice way for the character's to be rememberable.3. Flashlight needs work - Now the flashlight is very handy and by no means am I saying it's useless. However, why can the flashlight not light up rooms? It just seems to light up a small area and jeebus don't get too close to anything in particular with it. The light at the center can just about block out the view of items. You cannot even light up a room for a fellow survivor whose weapon doesn't allow a flashlight fitting.4. Lack of Zombie variations - Aside from the standard Zombie, player Zombie, and Riot armored zombie. There really isn't anything else of danger around. A Zombie dog would have been a great addition to this game, or even enviromental hazards like falling buildings, out of control cars crashing, or something. A well organized team can easily put down a army of zombies, unless of course they're out of ammo.5. Ammo hoarders - Don't get me wrong, when you need ammo badly, you need it badly. However, there are people that will pick up ammo for every gun BUT the gun they actually have. I cannot tell you how many times I've been down to one bullet and cannot even get a person to throw a magazine or ammo box my way.6. Terrible Iron Sights - Now you don't need to serve a tour of duty in a war to tell some of these weapons have terrible iron sights. I've had times where I've woundered if it was easier to shoot from the hip or just aim down sights. Obviously it's better to aim down the sights, but some weapons just have such terrible iron sights it renders players ineffective at times. However, if you get use to the iron sights, you can easily work your way around their terrible design. Out of all the guns, your best bets are on the Pistols, the shotgun, and the hunting rifle. Pistols are semi-automatic, so you can control your rate of fire with them. Shotgun has bad iron sights, but it makes up for it with a wide shot spread so you just need to aim for the head. Heck you may even take down more than one zombie with a single shell. The Hunting rifle zooms in and it's the sniper rifle, so you don't have to deal with iron sights with it.7. Getting stuck on stuff - This is more of a minor complaint, but there are times that it feels like I get stuck in doorways at times. It looks like I got enough room to enter, but some how I still get stuck.Now for the things I like about the game.1. The Enviroment - It actually feels like a proper zombie apocalypse. Nothing is clean, nothing is overly destroyed. Things feel just right.2. Zombies are true to nature - Short of shooting them in the head, blowing them up with a grenade, or hitting them with a melee weapon. A zombie will keep coming after you. Thank you devs, these are true Zombies!3. Sound effects  - The sound effects in this game are really good in my opinion. Since there is no real map to use, you can listen for the gun shots of your fellow survivors to actually tell you a general idea of what direction they're at. Or as a Zombie you can use it to find where your targets are at (short of using the vision sight for foot prints.) Overall everything sounds good in this game.4. Limited resources - Nothing worse than playing a survival game and finding every little thing you need in the world in no time. Ammo, weapons, and medical kits are so hard to find. You actually have to concern yourself on how you approach the streets, corners, buildings, and rooms.5. Infection - There is a chance when you get hit by a zombie that you actually get infected. If you're infected, there is a limit of time before you start to feel it and eventually turn against your fellow survivors. You won't know you're infected till it's too late. Some people may find this annoying, but I love it. Even if you die as a survivor, the game isn't over for you. Because now you can fight against them as a zombie and lead Hordes of zombies towards them. (Nice way of getting payback on those Ammo hoaders)6. Board up and hold out - Now I know everyone likes base building, but honestly it get's old seeing player made sky forts or whatever. Contagion may not have base building, but boarding up windows is one of the most logical ways of keeping the zombies out. I just wish the boards didn't fall inbetween line of sights. If a Zombie gets close enough to try and break into the building, it's hard to get them off the window boards without shooting the defense itself.7. Plenty of maps and game modes - The game isn't limited to just your typical ""Start at A and get to C by moving through B"" (Though ti does have a escape mode which is fun still), but you also have a PVP game mode where players start off killing each other, then holding out against zombie palyers in a game of Hide and seek. A objective based game where players locate survivors and take them to be extracted across zombie infested streets or neighborhoods. Also with players seemingly able to make their own playable maps, it's no real concern about there ever really being a feeling of a lack of enviroments to play in.8. Maps change - Nothing better than playing a map that can change from another playthrough. I've had games where doors that were usually unlocked, were actually blocked off. So really you cannot predict what route you must take to get to a objective, you sort of have to learn on the fly.9. Random starting gear - Our survivors may be all different, but the nice thing is that they start out with random gear. You may have just a pistol at first one game, then the next you may have a pistol and a SMG. I just feel this is a nice way to keep things feeling interesting.Overall Contagion isn't a bad game, but it doesn't do too many things great. With some stuff fixed, a few improvements made, and some other little things. The game can honestly stand toe to toe with the Left 4 Dead games. Don't take this as me saying ""i want it to be more like Left 4 Dead."" I just want to see some more stuff that will pull me into the game more. One more zombie type, fixed weapon iron sights (or at least a visual zoom in), and some other little things would just be perfect for someone like me. While I cannot stand playing the game for hours on end. I can at least say what time I do play, I enjoy greatly.If you see this game on sale and you want a good little Zombie shooter game, I would highly suggest picking this game up. I only paid five bucks and don't regret it.			"

												Contagion is a zombie game that feels like no other. I've played everything from Left 4 Dead to Day Z, and nothing feels quite as special as Contagion. The felling you get when playing the pvp/pve mode Hunted, for example, is incredible. Suddenly, you truly feel alone and vulnurable, as you would in a life or death survival scenario. The sparcity of weapons and ammo give a realisitic feel, and the infection system keeps you always on edge. Most zombie games are all about fending off huge numbers of zombies with lots of ammo and powerful weapons. Contagion is one of only a few games that truly give the player a sense of anxiety. I cannot reccomend this game enough.			"

												This game has many rough edges (which is to expect, being an alpha). Hitbox issues, the inventory is horrible, animation quirks, bugs, and a lot of small, but visible problems.That being said, it's a surprisingly nice game, and I am getting more enjoyment out of that I thought I would.It runs the risk of being TOO punishing on its players, though. I would love to have the ability to customize my game further, adding things like the ability to ressurect dead players. It really sucks when you want to just play a co-op session with your friends and one of them dies in the beginning and cannot play with the rest of the game.There isn't a lot of content yet, but it's a very promising game that if you don't get now, you should definetly get upon release.

It's the best zombie game since Resident Evil 2. Plus, it has eight player Co-op. I will be mapping for this when the SDK is released.You'd be a fool to pass this up. It makes ""No More Room in Hell"" look like crap.Buy it now, cheapskates.			"

												This game is a generally more realistic approach to a zombie-slaying FPS.(Honestly I think the beta was better but whatevs)It is quite similar to Left 4 Dead's game mechanics as you must preserve your ammunition, acquiring health is a pain as well.This game is the sort where you will be scared♥♥♥♥♥♥less by a sudden noise of a window pane breaking.  It isn't very fun to play alone, so see if you can get a friend or two to play as well			"

												So, Contagion.I'm not a fan of twitch shooter's or zombie games, so when I recieved a copy of this game from one of my friends in an after christmas gift giving spree we all took part in... i was less than exicted.While I am flat out terrible at the game, I will say that it is extremely enjoyable. The major reason? It perfectly captures the atmosphere of a Zombie Survival.What I mean is, until you finally succumb to your wounds and the infection takes over, you will try your damndest to survive and help your other survivors, excepting the Hunt PvP game mode. When the infection takes over however, it becomes immensely satisfying to hunt down your friends and bury them beneath a horde of undead. The game really ramps up as soon as a survivor dies, as now one zombie that looks like any other, has human intelligence and wants everyone dead like them.So yeah, I like it, and fans of Schadenfreude should too.

												The closest you'll get to playing The Walking Dead and better than Left4Dead. Zombies shamble forward, they don't run. They go down by damaging the brain, not other parts of the body. Weapons and ammo are scarce. Maps are dark, zombies can creep up behind you without you knowing. You can get infected and turn. Other humans can be just as dangerous as zombies. No hand-holding objectives, you have to figure out where everything is, just like in real life. Great atmospheric soundtrack.This game is amazing. Definitely get it for the most ""realistic"" zombie experience.			"

												I played this game ALOT during the beta - im a big zombie fan, so im pretty bias but....i love it!While i mainly play co-op (escape) mode, i find all game modes very entertaining - fun as a human, hilarious as a zombie.While it does take a little bit of time to learn maps and mechanics, the pay off is worth it. Your either a zombie survival pro...or a particularly clever zombie (it never gets old dodging bullets and biting someones face off!)All in all, if you like FPS's (particularly co-op in my opinion) you will like this game, if your a zombie fan like me - you'll love it!As of summer 2014, the multiplayer community is alive and kicking, and new maps are released now and again.Considering the hours of fun i have got out of this game, its well worth the £15 - and now it has a ""panic"" mode like the original mod, it just keeps getting better! Buy it...buy it now!! =)			"

												Contagion is a zombie game that feels like no other. I've played everything from Left 4 Dead to Day Z, and nothing feels quite as special as Contagion. The felling you get when playing the pvp/pve mode Hunted, for example, is incredible. Suddenly, you truly feel alone and vulnurable, as you would in a life or death survival scenario. The sparcity of weapons and ammo give a realisitic feel, and the infection system keeps you always on edge. Most zombie games are all about fending off huge numbers of zombies with lots of ammo and powerful weapons. Contagion is one of only a few games that truly give the player a sense of anxiety. I cannot reccomend this game enough.			"

												Okay, where do i begin?This is an early access game.That much is for sure but don't let that deceive you into thinking this game isn't good.It has so much potential and with that in mind, play it without thinking of the other games that have come before it (Left 4 Dead 1-2, Killing Floor, etc.) so that you'll experience it as the devs intended. I like how they decided to make ammunition scarce, making the experience almost like real life. You are not likely to find a gun and a ton of ammo next to it behind a desk in real life. Well unless you're in a gun shop but i digress..The stamina meter system forces players to pace themselves in order to survive as you would in a zombie apocalypse scenario.Lastly, this game was meant to be played in Co-op. Playing it alone to practice is utterly boring, it would be better to play it with friends and gradually learn how to survive rather than do it on your own.For an early access game it is really really good. I enjoyed playing, surviving, dying and shooting in the game and i'd play it again as soon as my friends are free to do so as well.Solid 8/10 material. Would be 10/10 probably when the game is fully developed. I am excited to see what else they can put in the game.			"

												It's a pretty good game in my opinion, but has some problems. It's not bugged, everything is fixed, updates every month, but it doesn't have unpredictability of some sort. There are only 3 types of game and only 3 maps. It would MUCH better if the developers weren't that 'money sick' and didn't say that the will make other maps only when they'll get 300.000$... but anyway the game is worth the price and you can watch my full review of it IN RUSSIAN by clicking on this link:

												As a enormous fan of everything ""living dead"", I am very pleased to say that Contagion scratches that more authentic zombie survival itch. This isn't a Left 4 Dead twitch FPS, no. Your shots have to be in the head and, considering ammo scarcity, they have to count. The guns sound punchy, feel great and do appropriate damage to the models. The dead shamble just like you'd expect and are incredibly adept at navigating the level. And, speaking of levels, the maps in Contagion are some of the best, most realistic feeling I've ever experienced in a shooter. They don't feel too ""gamey"", but more like real places gone to Hell because of the Apocalypse.			"

												So me and my wife have put a little bit of time into this game.  At first I was pretty skeptical, considering I absolutely hated the Left 4 Dead series.  I'm just generally not a huge fan of the zombie genre (it's overdone imo).  But Contagion feels different.  You, as the player, are more involved.  We've really only played the Escape game mode, which for just the two of us is great.  And it seems a lot of the maps have randomly generated objectives when you play them.  Like some times a door may be blocked, but the next play through you can go through it and explore a different path to escape the map.  It makes replaying maps more enjoyable.When you die, you become a zombie.  It'd say it's more fun on a public server with multiple players, but in a 2-player co-op setting, it's not that fun.  But I can see the effects it would have on a 6+ player server.All in all, it's a pretty decent game.			"

												This game is fun when played with friends online or over LAN, the only real downside to the game is the alternative (and free) No More Room in Hell, which is aiming for almost exactly the same style and pace of zombie survival game.Even still, this is more polished than NMRIH and in my experience has not had any map breaking bugs yet.Me and my friends waited for the game to go on sale before picking this up but had quite a few good nights with it, you will want to make sure that at least one of you has a decent internet connection and is happy to be the server for the game as there is a very slim chance of finding a random server with a playable ping.

												This is a surprisingly great game.  It plays well and feels very realistic.  There's not much like getting together with some friends late at night and playing through a zombie infested bio-med company.  There is lots of room for new content down the road as well.  Since it's based on the Source engine, it's very smooth and has very few bugs.  All around, a really fun game!			"

												Contagion is a zombie survival game with a number of game mode focused on online play. In the game you can either play as a zombie or as a person when playing pvp which is fun to play both sides. As the person you can do your basic FPS mechanics and as a zombie you are the normal zombie exept you have a small speed boost and you can call a horde to your side from any zombies near to you. Theres also an extraction game mode where you have to try to save civilians without letting anyone die. There are more game modes to suchas one that can act like a story guiding you through a map. I personally found myself playing a pvp all alone just for the fun of blasting zombies away without worry of someone else trying to kill me. When it comes to inventory, you have 4 weapon slots and you can carry so much ammo it's not a worry, but that leads me into the next thing, getting ammo and supplies.You start off every match witha random melee wapon and a pistol of some sort. From there, you must scavenge. You must break into peoples houses, movie theaters, malls, really anywhere and search high and low for things (don't worry about how the locals feel about this, they've already been infected). You can find anything from med kits to nail guns to wooden planks to assault rifles to varrying types of ammo to an occasional greanade (just try not to blow yourself up). This is a game where your shots count though and you shouldn't fire until you know it's going to be a head shot. A zombie can take a very large sum of bullets to the body or a single shot to the head.Contagion did do a nive job with the models and what they look like when they take damage for the bodies. When you put a round in an undead's head, you can see a large exit would on the other side. If you blast their leg with a shot gun, it may come right off. If you hammer away at their chest, you may leave a nice cavity there. The point is, you can blast an enemy to smitherines and you'll be able to tell.In the game you can also make a 'home base' type area such as when you're in the suburban map. The game provides nail guns and planks of wood if you look around to help secure an area. You can make this place a stock pile, a temporary place to just sit for a minute, or simply slow the zombies down for a few seconds while you run for your life out the back door.Contagion also has large maps, especially the city one which I think is something like 9 full sized blocks (also if you look enough, this is the one game to put a gun store in it if you need a couple extra rounds. *wink wink, nudge nudge*) This is great when needing to run from another player or when you just feel like exploring.The graphics in the game are good... but only at night. I've noticed that durring the daytime nothing looks as good as it could be, and though that may just be a time/budget thing to make it look good, just try not to look too closely at textures in the sunlight. When it comes to night time it does look very pleasing to the eye with their lighting engine and the reflections in everything. You can see this which helps to show off what it can do and with the lack of sunlight makes it so you don't focus on any below-par textures. Lastly for what I have to say about the looks of the enviroment is rain. Just rain. It looks very nice compared to many other games I have played especially with the lighting engine to help show it off. You can see small ripples if you look close enough to where a rain drop has landed and little things like that. Finally, I would just like to point out the sound. They did a great job with the sound like when you step on a piece of fallen fence you can hear it shake, of when you step on broken glass and hear it crack. My point is, it sounds nice.The good--Great lighting engine (if anything it's a tad too bright with the flashlight, but that's fairly small depending on where you are-Zombies look great when heavily damaged-Nice sound-big maps-good, serious atmosphere-if you look close enough, most of the little extra stuff like books do actually have titles and such.The bad--player zombies feel a bit underpowered (but thats probably to help balence)-map size can make multiplayer difficult-revolves anound the same mechanics most of the time, it's more just who you're shooting at.The ugly- -It may just be me but I've noticed a case of ""fuzzy screen"" when playing this that usually doesn't happen with other games-don't look at textures to close in the day timeRating: 7.5-8/10If you catch it for under $5 on a steam sale I definatelty reccomend, it's a fun game but some will like it more than others.

												This game is fun when played with friends online or over LAN, the only real downside to the game is the alternative (and free) No More Room in Hell, which is aiming for almost exactly the same style and pace of zombie survival game.Even still, this is more polished than NMRIH and in my experience has not had any map breaking bugs yet.Me and my friends waited for the game to go on sale before picking this up but had quite a few good nights with it, you will want to make sure that at least one of you has a decent internet connection and is happy to be the server for the game as there is a very slim chance of finding a random server with a playable ping.

												Great co-op zombie survival game. It's challenging and fun, and makes you think twice before you shoot as your ammo is limited and you have to scavenge for weapons and ammo. The zombies are also quite interesting as they aren't your typical weak zombie. You have to aim for the head and get headshots or else these guy's are bullet sponges.There are some minor bugs like zombies glitching out and such, but it isn't enough to really affect gameplay. Contagion is really a very well made and polished game.Overall, Contagion has a nice balance of challenge and fun, and you can survive with a big group of your friends which is awesome.I highly reccomend Contagion. And tell your friends to get it too, as it's more than just 4 player co-op, it's 5/6+, heck I'm sure you can get 12 of your friends in a game.			"

												Good game, but either some of the menu options are just placeholders for the final product or the developers were really lazy with their copy paste job, seeing that these menus look exactly like Left 4 deads. Theres an option in menus to to turn subtitles on.... but there are no subtitles in game so why? The gameplay itself is really good, but it doesnt make sense why most of the time you play as a zombie instead of a survivor, because most if not all games you join will have you as one. Also, why do the zombies have stamina? I don't know, but ohwell. One last thing is the lack of content. Theres only 3 maps and 3 modes. At the moment this really isnt an issue because I'm still fairly new to this game, but once I clock more hours into it, I hope there will be more contentto keep me coming back for more. In a survival horror game like this, the game doesnt need to sport dozens and dozens of weapons and this game makes that statement true. Theres enough variety to give players options without over saturating the game with unessecary crap, like 12 different types of ammunition and such. This review may sound like a fairly negative one, but rest assured. I like this game. Just pointing out the faults for anyone who might see them as a concern.			"

												The game i am recomending is called Contagion. It is a fun pack filled game.There are some bugs though, Like you can walk threw some fences. But the game is great like the is about 6 gamemode to play my Favorite Gamemode is Hunted. Because it is PvP based survival there are weapons placed around the map, U and 5 other player have to kill eachother, With the fact that there are bloodthirsty Zombies walking around. Enough with that there is also 8-9 Charicters to choose from, They also have there own traits like ones good with a sniper, and ones good with a pistol. I can handle the game on my DELL Windows 8.1 AMD A6 Prosseser. so u could probly handle this but i over all rate the game a 8.9/10. And i know what u are thinking the game looks just like No More Room In Hell, But its not It is 4x better than NMRIH, And Guess what when u die in some gamemodes U turn into a Zombie. YEAH A ZOMBIE. So you can go around and kill your friends. I might even buy this game for its full price. I Bought the game For $9.99 and its real price on steam is $14.99. But Overall you should get the game Have Fun. :)			"

As a result of these things, I picked up Contagion during it's early access period.My first impressions? It was rough as guts, but had a certain charm. Graphically, not amazing but solid. It is Source engine after all, it's old but it's capable. It was a little bit limited in terms of maps and modes at the time but, being early access, I couldn't expect it to be fully featured. The melee was atrocious, and was so hard to use that it wasn't worth using. Animations etc were a bit clunky and sometimes awkward, but forgivable coming from a (until recently) mod team. The gore was humorous, seeing heads pop open was always fun to see. One thing that really irked me though was the teleporting...sometimes the zombies, either AI or player controlled, would teleport a metre or so at a time which made it impossible to shoot them in the head. It's fair to say that I liked the game but that I had a few gripes.I went away from it for a while, distracted by other games (it happens to me very regularly) and came back to it a little more recently, probably just after it had officially launched. By this time, Barlowe Square had been launched and the bugs ironed out, melee was FAR more usable and a lot of the teleporting was gone. It was nice to see things progressing.What do I think now? To be honest, it still feels like it's in beta a lot of the time, but end stages of beta. There are still problems. Player controlled zombies seem to be able to hit me from 2 metres away. There is still a shortage of maps. The animations are still mostly awkward. On the other hand, things are improving steadily. More maps are on their way out soon, along with more weapons. Steam Workshop has been integrated. The melee system is being revamped, animations and textures are getting work done. Just recently, split screen mode was added (AWESOME FUN!) It still has a few issues, but they don't get in the way of me enjoying myself.I now play regularly with a number of mates, running our comms through GameVox. With only two of us, we can have a great time playing Escape or Extraction. With any more than that, we can quite happily play Hunted mode. In my opinion, this game is best played with friends. Playing against unknown wombles is still fun, but having a laugh with your mates while you play is where it's at. Contagion will never be perfect, but it's faults are forgivable due to the insane amount of giggles that we get out of it. That, and it scratches that zombie game itch like no other games I've played.I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10 currently, but with what's on the road map I could see that easily going to an 8 or 8.5. Contagion has some rough edges but it also has a strange appeal, and I certainly don't regret buying it. If anything, I actually feel a bit guilty that I paid so little for it (weird, I know).			"

												Great co-op zombie survival game. It's challenging and fun, and makes you think twice before you shoot as your ammo is limited and you have to scavenge for weapons and ammo. The zombies are also quite interesting as they aren't your typical weak zombie. You have to aim for the head and get headshots or else these guy's are bullet sponges.There are some minor bugs like zombies glitching out and such, but it isn't enough to really affect gameplay. Contagion is really a very well made and polished game.Overall, Contagion has a nice balance of challenge and fun, and you can survive with a big group of your friends which is awesome.I highly reccomend Contagion. And tell your friends to get it too, as it's more than just 4 player co-op, it's 5/6+, heck I'm sure you can get 12 of your friends in a game.			"

												The game i am recomending is called Contagion. It is a fun pack filled game.There are some bugs though, Like you can walk threw some fences. But the game is great like the is about 6 gamemode to play my Favorite Gamemode is Hunted. Because it is PvP based survival there are weapons placed around the map, U and 5 other player have to kill eachother, With the fact that there are bloodthirsty Zombies walking around. Enough with that there is also 8-9 Charicters to choose from, They also have there own traits like ones good with a sniper, and ones good with a pistol. I can handle the game on my DELL Windows 8.1 AMD A6 Prosseser. so u could probly handle this but i over all rate the game a 8.9/10. And i know what u are thinking the game looks just like No More Room In Hell, But its not It is 4x better than NMRIH, And Guess what when u die in some gamemodes U turn into a Zombie. YEAH A ZOMBIE. So you can go around and kill your friends. I might even buy this game for its full price. I Bought the game For $9.99 and its real price on steam is $14.99. But Overall you should get the game Have Fun. :)			"

												BEST ZOMBIE GAME?!?! - Contagion is a very smooth and very visuall appealing game. Despite the annoying zombie mode in the game, the co-op and PvP missions in the game are very very fun. If you are not careful they can draw you in and never let you leave. One thing that the game needs improvement on is helping players learn the game more quickly. I was a noob when I started playing and I had to ask people how to do things. Sure I could have looked at the controls but some of the keys were hard to understand and find. Overall this is fantastic game, although the BEST zombie game, no. That is still yet to come. See full review here:

The game is fun and is quite customisable with steam workshop encorporated. Over all i would recommend this if you take into consideration you may be playing with randoms for a while or if you don't mind limited single player.7/10			"

												No replayability, like 4 interesting maps for the 1 co-op mode. This game is great for a one time only play through of the co-op mode 'escape' but other than that it just sucks. Zombies move like they are on a line and move in 45 degree angles. With very annoying voices always saying ""We should be closing these doors behind us!!!!!!!!!!!"" to the bad gamemodes and maps. This game would be better if it was a max $10 because on the only co-op mode there are only like 4 good maps and with no replayability I would rate this game a 4/10. If it was $10 I would maybe give it a 6/10, the price is simply unfair to the consumer for a game with NO replayability. NO REPLAYABILITY!!! NONE! WHAT THE HELL!?			"

												This is such an awesome game to me. The game is fantastic and i would rate it  a 9/10. It is extremly fun when playing modes like Hunted where you try survive from the zombies and also the other players and Panic (classic) where you try to survive from player zombies (yes not A.I, real players). I love that once you die you can become a zombie and try kill the other players. This game has 8 different playable character (from what i remember) who all have a different backstory. Contagion also has a few maps for you to play on and they never seem to make me get sick of them. This game is Buy especially if you love zombie  games as much as i do. 9/10 (this is my sort of game), (Free dlc will be here soon)			"

												New review since the game just released from the Early Access stage. Immediately had to reset to dafault keys and it seems to be an okay game. It's more serious than L4D as the game has no specialized zombies like a tank or witch, just traditional zombies. Players can also play as zombies after dying as a human, so it has a bit of Zombie Panic and No More Room in Hell mixed in together. Considering part of the Zombie Panic team also worked on No More Room in Hell, this game really does resemble a bit of both. The game offers a fair amount of modes, objective mode is fairly complicated and easy to get lost in. Extraction mode I didn't particularly like since you're acting as rescuers. A bit strange of a goal especially when the NPC's follow you around like clueless morons with no survival skills. That's the job of the military usually, to rescue survivors, not you because you're too busy trying to survive on your own. You'd think the NPC survivors would also be trying to save their own hide. So it offers a new gameplay mechanic that Nmrih and Zombie Panic doesn't offer, but it's not the best mechanic either. Cellphone replaces the compass function you'd normally have in Nmrih and unlike Nmrih the players can still play after dying so a bit of Zombie Panic.The good news is the game is less spatially disorientating than what it was in the past, so I give it a thumbs up for improving the camera movements of the game. The zombie running animation with the claws running out furiously could use some work, but aside from that, overall it's a mediocre game. I suggest buying this cheap and not at the full price ($19.99) it is currently at. You can have more fun with the free Zombie Panic and No More Room in Hell mods.			"

												The objective based escape map is wonderfully made.The pvp hunting map is chaotic and full of oppurtunity as it should be.The zombies are smart enough to be a threat, even for veteran players.♥♥♥♥ PLAYER CONTROLLED ZOMBIES THEY ARE THE BANE OF THIS GAME.Seriously. This game is fun, until you let a teammate die, then everyone involved is ♥♥♥♥ed.Would recommend, fun for a while until the small number of maps (5?) Get stale, but you'd better guard your buddies with your life!			"

												A friend of mine told me to get this game awhile back, and when I was checking it out it seemed pretty cool but not amazing. I'm always cautious of early access games because you never know where your money is being spent, or if they're even working on it at all. But I risked it for this game based on the fact that it gave me and my friend something to Co-op for awhile.And I'm so glad that I did, because It's one of the best early access games I've ever played, and absolutely worth the price. I got to play it for most of it's beta, and I've seen it go from a cool little zombie game, to a game on par with L4D2. At it's current state, It's added so much more content to the game since Beta, the Developers have listened to every bug or problem I found while playing (which they'd look into and fix almost immediately) And graphically, it's the best looking game I've ever seen coming from an indie team, even better than most AAA games aswell. You can really feel how much effort they put into this game, from the subtle references of their original game Zombie Panic Source, to the finer details in lighting, textures, ambient noise and overall atmosphere. Also did I mention, you can chop the arms off a zombie, and watch as it attempts to grab you but can't? Yeahhh this game is worth your time			"

Comes across as Left 4 Dead with more stuff to do other than just shoot zombies. I will play for some more hours until the free period ends and will buy it one day.

												This game sets itself apart from the other zombie shooters by not being an arcade ♥♥♥♥ up. This game focuses on realistic mechanics and slower gameplay. The only bad thing I can say about this game is that it only has a couple orgiginal co-op maps. If only the developers of this game would make more awesome maps, I bet this game would receive much deserverd sucess. I myself got this game on a sale. Just because of the lack of maps I would not pay full price for this game but as a person who likes survival games I am happy that I did not completely pass this game as it is amazing.			"

												Contagion is a more than decent zombie survival game, It has a variety of fun game modes and I enjoyed playing it. I also have to note that I really like the games soundtrack/ score, It stands out to me more than the gameplay even!Contagion is pretty fun but does not come without a few problems. The biggest to me is probably that there are not very many maps, though varied item spawns can help decrease content fatigue, it can only do so much. There is a workshop for the game, and this also helps shake things up if you ever get bored with the vanilla content! Another issue I have is that playing as a zombie can be frustrating. Often times I find myself being spawnkilled by someone from a very long distance, or worse yet never being able to find anyone at all because they are just too good at hiding.All said, I still think Contagion is good fun, and worth your time if you are a fan of zombie survival games. The co-op is pretty top notch, even if the versus is often sub par.			"

												It could have been an awesome game. Unfortunately, it has never been finished properly...However, I can STRONGLY recommend the game for its ""hunted"" game mode. This one gives me pretty pretty much adrenalin and a lot of FUN. Because you are being hunted by the zombies and the other players there's always danger plus you think twice about using a gun on zombies because other players then can locate you. Overall, the atmosphere, for me, is quite thrilling, especially when playing a new map!The escape mode is also quite nice but the problem is it needs polishing... (For example voting for server options like ""no more new players are allowed to join"" etc.)Don't really care about the missing community/the empty servers btw. You don't really need other people to play it (especially not if you got one other person to play with via Teamspeak or what ever). Some will join the server after you've joined any way.Overall, if you can get it cheap, get it. It's worth it - especially playing with buddies + microphones!			"

You must survive either with other humans or alone. You start of with a melee weapon and a gun. If you die, you become a zombie and kill other humans. The last remaining human alive wins the round.If you like zombie survival gamemodes in Counter-Strike games, or if you like to survive with/against your friends then this game is for you!			"

												This game delivers very well for what it has to offer and I would definitely recommend this game to someone who is intrigued by cooperatively-driven gameplay. I shall continue to play because it offers a very entertaining and somewhat rewarding experience that I enjoy very much.Presentation: This game has a low production value, but that doesn't really negate from the overall package. Monochrome has delivered a reasonably enjoyable title that differs greatly from other titles that are similar too it. Generally speaking, the game has a nice and slow pace, but picks up progressively as you immerse yourself into the game modes that it has to offer. The game modes are all worth playing. They paid a legitimate amount of attention to detail. Many environments are dark, the zombies can be fierce, and you feel as if you must really fight for your survival. And that's what it's all about.Graphics: The Source Engine has been on the market for quite some time now, but that doesn't mean that the graphics are unimpressive. The graphics are still very nice and there are a lot of options you can adjust to get it to how you'd like. This game does not push the Source Engine to its limits in terms of visual aesthetics, but there is a sufficient amount of visuals to keep you immersed in each environment. The lighting can be a little-bipolar - either extremely dark or extremely bright, but the flashlight lighting was done very well. It even alarms the zombies quite a bit. The frame rate also holds together very well when tons of zombies drop in on you and your partners' location.Sound: They did a fantastic job with the audio system. You can hear rain drop onto tin roofs of surrounding shacks or drop onto plastic tents and the differences in sound are all there. You can even hear the rain trickle off of buildings and onto the ground. The voice overs were done okay, but the players can be a little annoying when they say the same thing over and over about keycards or how every door separates ""US"" (players) from ""THEM"" (zombies). Because of the fact that the GPS system is not an absolute pinpoint marker to locate other players, you must really do well to communicate with other players, but with that said, you'll also learn to appreciate the sounds of other players' gunshots, bones cracking from falling, and other sounds as well. Music is also there and it is very appropriate. It's subtle, but enough to enhance the overall feel.Gameplay: This is where the game stands out. I'd definitely recommend playing with people you know and play it with the intent of wanting to succeed, otherwise you will crumble. Alone, you might not even enjoy the experience at all.  You cannot run and gun through this game. You have to plan routes together, find and conserve resources, as well as ration them fairly. Knowing what you NEED to take versus what you WANT to take can make the difference in having to put bullets in the heads of a legion of zombies or just wiping a huge chunk of them out with an IED. This is one of those games where you will be highly tempted to wander off alone, but doing so can be extremely dangerous and may cost you the game. Stick together and you will find that it is a much more rewarding experience, even if it is possible to succeed scrambled. That would be a no-no.Lasting Appeal: The gameplay formula is sufficient enough to provide for definite replayability, but the ice-breaker is content. The small number of maps and game modes may feel limited to many people who have played or decide to play this game. If Monochrome adds more content to this videogame, this will definitely be a much more longer-lasting game. However, the maps and modes are very fun when played as they should be, and the overall experience does not have a bad aftertaste. On the contrary, it may feel natural to want to play multiple sessions on the same map. Aside from it being fun, there is also a modest level of randomization on each map, which allows for some unique playthroughs each time.I'd say play it, but play it with the right people. :)			"

												This game is a must, for me, if you love zombie games. It's still in beta and there's a lot more work that will be put into it, I guess. It feels way more realistic than other games I played. The sounds are amazing in this game, too, and sound does affect how nearby zombies react to your presence (as does lightning).I especially like the Escape mode (and I wish they will make more maps of that) though Evacuation is nice too. If you want a more realistic experience where teamwork does matter, buy this game. "

												to be honest i was really looking forward to this game, i didnt realise that it was all just death matches and one off events (multiplayer). I was thinking it was more of an RPG survival horror kind of game (like dayz). the only lucky thing is the fact that i bought it during the summer steam sale, and didnt lose a the full price of the game. to be honest it wasnt even worth the £1.50 odd i paid.If you like random shoot em up matches then this is for you, i just wanted a game with more substance....

												I just played for free for a few hours. ""Extraction""(Totally confusing) and ""Escape""(very satisfying) mode. I'm not going to buy this now because my gaming time is capped (DOS is all Ican do now) but I'm still  recomending it based on my initial impressions.  There are bugs. Climbing down ladders is difficult and sometimes deadly(I'm not joking). Sometimes point blank shots don't register. You need to go to forums to figure out what is going on. The graphic are dated ...BUT it's a lot of fun. The ammo runs out which forces you to conserve and think a little bit. The AI is satisfying. It's exciting. The zombies seem very weak at first but they mob as your ammo gets low -  Just like in a zombie movie.			"

												I would've enjoyed this game if the devs could PLEASE fix the clunky zombie animations and hitboxes:The way the do a full climb animation over the smallest obstacle is annoying and really just looks plain silly and cheap. Hitboxes are terrible - aiming dead on the head a few meters away should result in a clean headshot, right? But no, that happens maybe half the time. Yeah the zombies are shambling a lot, but so fast that they dodge bullets from point blank range? I don't think so.And the physics.... just awful, and combined with the poor animations it just looks and feels like an annoyingly bad made B-movie...Graphically, the game looks good enough, but the exaggerated lens flares are just annoying.So yeah, that pretty much sums it up; this game is annoying.It had promise, but was poorly done.

												You will find many people complaining about this game and its wonky controls but in my opinion the good outweighs the bad.+its very well optimised+i like the idea of using ""movie zombies"" only and not some OP monsters+it has a great atmosphere +fantastic hunter mode where u have to fight off zombies and other players+i like the fact that zombies can inffect you, yet sometimes it take just 1 scratch and another time u may have 10% left and are still not infected. (you start seeing the world grey and sounds get muffeld)+immersive sounds +you can play as either a zombie or a human and if u are killed too many times you get to be a insect.+with workshop-its not open world -the graphics of the zombie faces look like a smooth surface not scars no nothing -the game has crashed 2/2 times since the last patch until i have lost my will to try again.(but i think the devs are working on it)-u will get confused a lot about the mapsbut in the end all the other games similar to this 1 on the market have either got supernatural zombies or they are way to expensive.So long live Contagion.

												""Contagion isn't your average Zombie Shooter but instead takes a more realistic and different approach"" 15 shots with a pistol to kill some body, and you find more guns and ammo in the bathroom than any where else. Maybe if  you guys make it more realistic and it doesn't take a thousand rounds to kill someone. Other than this a lot of the modes are great and don't need work and the modding community is awesome. The graphics are pretty and the game rarely lags. Just please fix the combat, and when zombies sometimes (happens a lot) ignore the fact that you shot them in the head and everybody is a walking tank.			"

												I just happen to come across this game by chance and thought it might be interesting to play. I didn't have the cash to purchase it at the time but a friend of mine actually gifted it as a present and I was on my way. At first glance getting into the game was quite interesting with different styles of maps, modes, and objectives. My personal favorite were escape modes which is pretty self explanatory. After getting well adjusted into the game I decide to move up to harder difficulty seeing as that was the only viable option instead of doing straight PVP (hunted). Reason being the overall game lacked content so you often found yourself in repetitive situations ultimately remembering specific locations to give yourself an edge versus other players. To my surprise the difficulty was quite challenging however certain mechanics left the overall experience bland if not just right out horrible. Some examples of this were random disconnections, hit-box for zombie head-shots, and the overwhelming powerful armored zombie that required an large amount of ammo to take down if you aren't good at using melee attack (which by the way wasn't an easy task on extreme). Putting that aside, another problem facing this game was the community. Now, by community I mean specifically the typical run-of-the-mill ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you'd often see in any online game. See, this wouldn't be such an issues however, with the open mic feature and team killing enabled... Well let's just say the overall game experience dropped to below average. You'd often join games hoping to have some fun but run into horrible people that would kill you on purpose, disconnect and reconnect (which auto-turns you into a zombie) to sabotage the team, or have players just abuse the mic privileges by spewing some toxic things out of their mouths. Now, in order to have fun in this game emphasis on teamwork is required without doubt, it is a must or the game becomes virtually impossible to complete or even be slightly successful at (speaking for average players). To put things in perspective, ultimately the game itself will fall into one of these headings for the majority of players either death by fellow teammate, accidental shots (leading into arguments), players turning into zombie (on purpose), players throwing away valuable in-game-items needed progress (by hiding it), player stalling the game when everyone is dead (on purpose) by hiding in specific areas before progressing to far, players mass looting all items which should be shared leading to the teams inevitable death, or completing the game successfully without any issues. In team-based games such as this one, it is important to work together to better the overall gaming experience however Contagion fails to really address these issues thus the problem persist even today. Granted there is a mute feature which is nice but doesn't do justice. So, in conclusion, if you decide to play this game with friends consider it a decent game but overall short (content wise). If you decide to play by yourself, consider yourself warned and tread lightly. The game itself would best be described as a ""pick-up"" game in which you can start and stop at any time with no real commitment towards progression or anything of that nature. If you find yourself in the long-haul playing a lot more (for the competitive gamer) I'd recommend a pass on this game altogether, save yourself a headache personally. There are much better games out there. I don't recommend this game.			"

												From the little bit I've played of it, it's a lot of fun.  Having internet issues so I haven't really gotten a chance to try with friends, but from my solo experiences, it has good gameplay, the mechanics feel good and the gunplay feels fairly satisfying.  Similar to No More Room in Hell in ways, but not nearly as melee reliant.  More ammo to go around, which helps immensely.			"

												Looking for a zombie game thats not like any others?Looking for a well made coop FPS experience?Well you havent found it. If you have played any zombie game then you have played this. What the dev's will tell you is that the game is complete. Thats a lie. For starters let me preface by saying i play every type of game and strive to do the best at them. So i have mastered first person shooters. let alone zombie games. I know to aim at the brain and im accurate enough to hit it everytime. However in this game the brain hitbox is not the best, many times i have accurately hit the brain only to have nothing happen. Shotguns destroy flesh in real life however in this game they are the worst weapons, they do nothing. This goes for melee weapons as well. choping off arms doesnt do anything as they still hit you with phantom limbs. When you die you turn into a zombie and are pretty much unstoppable, and when you die as a zombie you respawn as another zombie making the game really unenjoyable. You are pretty much a tank. The NPC zombies always get stuck on something or each other. You cant climb down ladders. There are many problems with this game. All in all its a bad No More Room In Hell knock off. With so many zombie games out, this is nothing new or creative.			"

												After i had played this game for 4 hours when it still was in ""Early Access"" i was thinking, ""This game is garbage"". But when i saw  that this game was out of Early Access and was realeased i decided to install the game again and give it another try. Now i have one word to say ""Wow"". I can't believe that this is the ""Contagion"" that i tried months ago. Now my view of this game has completly changed. This zombie game is not just a zombie game. It's a game that has a wonderful co-op, fantastic graphics and alot of fun and action. I really must say ""Great Job"" because this has changed my view of this game. For a zombie game this got all the content that it needs. I really enjoy playing this and the opportunity to meet new players. I will rate this game at 8/10 for being a fun zombie game with wonderful co-op.			"

												TEN OUT OF TEN.....Is what i would be saying, if:I didn't get auto disconnected from ever server i join: As soon as i get in my camping spot after aobut 3 or 4 rounds i get auto disconnected, its not my internet, I have 5 bars at all times with fios quantum.There was a way for zombies to locate camping survivors: In big maps like that city one with the gas station, its damn near impossible to find them, i like how its realistic, but for a video game i think we need a way to find them.The Good:This is what i said to my friend after i first got this game: Thursday, April 17, 201412:00 AM - Tybalt: dude this game is the scariest zombie game ever made12:00 AM - Tybalt: its amazingIts very true, i was terrified while playing, im in a corner looking at my phone, sending messages, to turn hear a ""buzz buzz"" directly behind me, i turn, a zombie standing over me, i jumped so far out of my chair, i didnt even get a chance to kill him, and i was laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off afterwards, it was an amazing expierence along with many more ive had and hope to have.Overall i give this game: 8/10P.S. i understand you guys want to make it as realistic as possible, but its also a video game, we play them to get away from life and have fun.My Suggestions:I didn't get auto disconnected from ever server i join: This i have no idea, idk if its the server or the game, i myself can live with it, seeing as the game is new and things like this are expected, i hope you are trying to fix it, if i am not the only one experiencing this.There was a way for zombies to locate camping survivors: Simple, maybe make the survivors cough or talk to themselves like in ZPS (have not checked in game if they do that already, if they do just ignore)LONG STORY SHORT: GREAT GAME!!! BUY AND PLAY!!!!			"

What makes this Game specialDon't ever compare it with Left4Dead2.You can compare some of the gamemodes and teamplay but overall, Contagion is much more realistic and L4D2 more the oldschool arcade type.Here are some differences:Any different Zombie species?L4D2 yeah, loads of with different abilitiesContagion no, only normal and armored policemen, just differs from NPC (no special abilities except crawling) or player controlled (able to crawl, to blend, to build a horde and special vision)How to kill a Zombie?L4D2 pump 'em full of leadContagion headshots are a one-hit-kill and therefore key to survival, because a bodyshot does much less damage, means it takes alot more ammo and ammo is sparseGetting wounded/killed by a zombie means...L4D2 wounded...it slows you down, killed...you're dead (unless a teammate helps you up)Contagion wounded...you'll probably turn into one of 'em, killed...you'll turnWhat about the User Interface?L4D2 displayed health and inventory of you and your teammates, cursorContagion only your health, stamina and inventory (teammates displayed by holding tab), no cursor, map and notifications on the phone (equipped by tapping B)How's the weapon handling?L4D2 fire arms: no aiming (except sniper rifle) instead there's punching with weapon, melee: chargable punch from upContagion fire arms: aiming for every weapon (punch with weapon by tapping V), melee: chargable punch from up(LMB) and the side(RMB)other differencesother gamemodes like extraction (your team has to escort NPC  survivors) or hide'n'seek with player controlled Zombiesthere's a PvP mode for survivors (last survivor wins)ammo and weapons can be found anywhere, mostly where you least expect itthere's no storylinesome character animations a bit poor but hopefully getting better with the next patchesAs you read, it differs from L4D2.But I can't say that one is better than the other because they're different. I really enjoy playing L4D2 when I'm looking for fast-paced oldschool arcade fps action. But when I'm in the mood for a realistic Zombie-experience, I choose Contagion over all for the time being.ConclusionIt's a realistic Zombiegame where you can also play as a Zombie in any gamemode.I rate it 82/100Also check out the wikia http://contagion-game.wikia.com/wiki/Contagion_Game_WikiThank you for reading the whole review.I hope it was helpful for most of you.Feel free to comment if you have a question about the game or the reviewDominik			"

												I just happen to come across this game by chance and thought it might be interesting to play. I didn't have the cash to purchase it at the time but a friend of mine actually gifted it as a present and I was on my way. At first glance getting into the game was quite interesting with different styles of maps, modes, and objectives. My personal favorite were escape modes which is pretty self explanatory. After getting well adjusted into the game I decide to move up to harder difficulty seeing as that was the only viable option instead of doing straight PVP (hunted). Reason being the overall game lacked content so you often found yourself in repetitive situations ultimately remembering specific locations to give yourself an edge versus other players. To my surprise the difficulty was quite challenging however certain mechanics left the overall experience bland if not just right out horrible. Some examples of this were random disconnections, hit-box for zombie head-shots, and the overwhelming powerful armored zombie that required an large amount of ammo to take down if you aren't good at using melee attack (which by the way wasn't an easy task on extreme). Putting that aside, another problem facing this game was the community. Now, by community I mean specifically the typical run-of-the-mill ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you'd often see in any online game. See, this wouldn't be such an issues however, with the open mic feature and team killing enabled... Well let's just say the overall game experience dropped to below average. You'd often join games hoping to have some fun but run into horrible people that would kill you on purpose, disconnect and reconnect (which auto-turns you into a zombie) to sabotage the team, or have players just abuse the mic privileges by spewing some toxic things out of their mouths. Now, in order to have fun in this game emphasis on teamwork is required without doubt, it is a must or the game becomes virtually impossible to complete or even be slightly successful at (speaking for average players). To put things in perspective, ultimately the game itself will fall into one of these headings for the majority of players either death by fellow teammate, accidental shots (leading into arguments), players turning into zombie (on purpose), players throwing away valuable in-game-items needed progress (by hiding it), player stalling the game when everyone is dead (on purpose) by hiding in specific areas before progressing to far, players mass looting all items which should be shared leading to the teams inevitable death, or completing the game successfully without any issues.

												8.1/10Contagion is not one of those original zombie games. This game has added more features than those certain games. The game is worth it even for $5 with its' updates overtime. I don't have much to say about this game, but it has different types of modes to play on. The game is addicting when scavenging for items while playing with a friend. The game can however get boring which tends to make this rating of mine on it, low. It's pretty worth it, hoping to see some kind of adventure with the game.			"

												Contagion is an amazing Co-op Survival game that can be highly addictive (in my case). Contagion features Five impressive game modes,, each including it's own styles of gameplay:+Escape+Extraction+Hunted+Classic (x2)+Flatline(DLC Bundle/not yet released)* Escape puts you and other players into the world with an Objective- Escape the undead. It is recommended that you raise the difficulty (if easy/normal) if playing with 3+ players. * Extraction again teams up the players against the dead to rescue survivors around the map. This mode can be difficult. (play hard with 5-6 Players)* Hunted pits Players against eachother - but the undead still wonder the streets? thats right! watch your back because once you begin shooting at other players, the Undead will come for you. no recommended difficulty.*As well as the main modes, Contagion has two Classic modes that are very similar to ZPS. Both are player only modes and support larger servers. The first Classic mode is very similar to Escape but with only players. The other is a timed survival themed mode. * Flatline SHOULD be a wave based survival. This game plays well on low preformance PCs, however it greatly reduces the graphics to a simple toonish feel. If playing Solo, i Recommend playing Escape or Extraction, Just set the Difficulty to its highest setting.---I've been playing Contagion sense its beta stage and it has greatly improved, however i've always enjoyed it.Thumbs up, and post your own recommendations to let others know of Contagion!

												If you like zombie survival games you'll like this one. You can play coop to scape the infestation like L4D, you can play PvP where you have to scavange for weapons and fight the other players and zombies.I like this game because different from Infestation and DayZ, where you waste hours looking for guns and stuff just to get killed and lose everything, in this game you just find guns really easy and then go PvP, and once there's just one guy left the game is over and will restart. Also, if you die, you can play as zombie.Not the best graphics, but it's a good game 8/10			"

												This game should be advertised as COD with zombies because that's what it really is. The Hunted gamemode, which is the only gamemode played really, is pretty much COD. I went in thinking I'm going to get a real zombie game as they sell it as but instead I got kids running around gunning everyone down. I think this game would of been a FPS but the creators wanted to be ""original"" and threw in zombies. No other game mode is hosted either. The server browser is♥♥♥♥♥♥too because of instead of telling what gamemode they're playing it just says Contagion. Real help that is. Really the game is lacking on all fronts. The only thing I liked about this game is that when you die you turn into a zombie, and that isn't even enough for this game to be considered good.			"

												Okay, so I think this game does not deserve all the good reviews it has..  I bought this in early access and I enjoyed the game, even though it wasn't ""good"" in my opinion. CONS-The gun gameplay is BAD and the game has the worst rifle scope in history, wich makes it very scary to use since all the zombies in the medium sized maps of this game will come knocking at your door when you shoot even one bullet.-Not many players in multiplayer, which makes it difficult (for me at least) to find a server with good ping.-The zombies lag! This is a major and a common problem in zombie games. I haven't seen a zombie game with zombie hordes where the zombies wouldn't lag, with the exeption of Black Ops zombies. This is not my computers fault since it runs everything quite well.-Too much 3d anaglyph.. At first on early access the amount of it was good and it gave the game a little bit more realistic feel. Now there is just too much of it though. It is ditorting and confusing. PROS+Mods! This game has mods, which can of course make it better by some amount. In the other hand there aren't too many of them, because there aren't that many players either..+Well it has zombies and CO-OP, so if you like those things you will enjoy this game to some extent like I did, even though it is a little unpolished and crappy :PCONCLUSIONThis is Steam, so buy it on sale if you really like co-op zombie games. The game can be enjoyable, but i wouldn't recommend it. "

												If you're looking for complete realism, this may not be the game for you, but it comes close. If you want something as realistic as it can get (at least at the time this was written), try No more room in hell, which is free on steam. Anyway, in this game, you play as a survivor of a zombie apocalypse, where zombies are everywhere and ammo is everything but plentiful. Players can play in (Again, in the time this was written, because updates happen) 3 different gamemodes. Hunted places players in a deathmatch-like game, where you are your only friend, and the zombies aren't the only threat. Humans can fight off zombies as well as each other (Which is why I never play hunted). Objective has players meneuvering throughout a map attempting to complete a list of objectives in order to escape the nightmare. And finally, Extraction consists of players going to different locations looking for survivors, and once a group of survivors are located, players have to defend the area for a specific amount of time, after which they are escorted to an extraction point. Players who die will take control of a zombie for the rest of the game (Which is one of the reasons I find it unrealistic), and have some abilities to compensate for their very small amount of heallth (Another reason it's unrealistic). Undead players can call zombies to their aid, and can command them to attack living players, and can let the AI take over to seem like AIs to living players and lower suspicioun.IIt's a tad pricy, but it's good fun, and using a mic is recommended for communicating with your team without stopping and letting a zombie take you out.

												I would probably not buy this game for $20. Its kind of fun with limited maps and gamemodes but the fps aspect is horribly innaccurate. Would not reccomend mostly due to weak game mechanics. There are no working vehicles, the trailer I watched said that you can throw coins to conserve ammo which is only true if you are using cheats. All of the maps are pretty straight forward (not at all openworld in anysense) and I have not once played a round where I did not have an excess of 45+ rounds for the standard handgun (Not to mention any 3 other guns I might have.)All of the zombies are the same height so anytime there is more then 5 of them coming at you, all you need to do is walk through any doorway and they will line up for you.If you want to shoot mindless zombies who shuffle straight towards you in almost a single file line with excess ammo and no need for a team, then this is the game for you. Mindless headshots is a big part of the game. However the guns are really innaccurate. I dont expect to be able to snipe with a handgun but I should atleast be able to hit a non-moving target that is 15feet away.Also, they have 1 map that is endless waves of zombies but if you arent using cheats, you are limited to about 30 - 45 bullets and they recreated the map from the first nazi zombies. They didnt add all of the furnature and stuff, but it is the exact same game mode and map layout.I give Contagion 3/105/22/2014			"

												I feel so stronly about this game I hope for the day its developers hire me. I would love to make half-baked,glitchy, bugged,fundamentally flawed garbage and sell it for a living. I tried to give this game a chance but it is so utterly and profoundly screwed up I shudder to think how unplayable the early release versions were. Did the zombies just stand there and pee their pants? The suvivors? was there even a map or was it just some dark abysmal purgatory where the players floated about as disembodied spirits crapping on eachothers shoes?You got three modes for your money. Escape, in which you wander about aimlessly looking for keys or a bolt cutter or (after 5 minutes) a reason to not bash yourself in the temple with your mouse. Extraction, in which you use your smartphone to go find grown adults, fight some zombies and walk those armed adults to a fence just so they can NOT climb it to safety. And Hunted mode...basically organized trolling. The only redemption to this game is that you can be a cockroach. I cannot begin to tell you how many times my friends and I were sitting around talking about video games and, forlorned and angry at the world, regretted the fact there was nowhere on the market we could be at the helm of some disgusting insect watching people kill zombies...pay attention Walking Dead there might be a season finale here with this meticuously crafted and fresh perspective on the whole zombie genre. For those of you who like this game and/or lack attention span I'll summarize:♥♥♥♥ this game. Seriously...♥♥♥♥ this game.			"

												Ah Contagion.....Do I love you? Or do I find you utterly redundant? Maybe a little bit of both. You see, this is a game that provides some innovative mechanics into a familiar video game theme. I have had this game since it's early days, so I have had the chance to watch it grow, and grow it has. I personally find the art style nice, and the graphics quite good, so I have no complaints in those departments. The physics are fine, and I absolutely love how the zombies can only die with a proper shot to the brain. I feel like this game has really improved my overall skill and precision using a mouse for aiming. The game consists of a couple modes, only two of which I personally find interesting. There is mainly just co op modes, but there is one mode that shines, and it's called ""Hunted"". In Hunted, it's every man/woman for his/herself with weapons and pathways randomly generated, but there are of course, zombies everywhere. Now the thing that makes this game different, is that when you die, you actually BECOME one of the zombies, and have multiple abilities, including the power to call a horde of up to 15 zombies to follow you, zombie sight (Basically night vision for the deceased), and the ability to blend in with the NPC zombies. Sounds cool right? It's not. I'll be honest, it gets very tedious running around as a zombie, as people RARELY work together and use strategy to take down the remaining survivors, and it's simply not as fun as being human. The factor of fear completely disapears and I think that's actually the issue with this game. It's very shallow and one of the only things that makes it interesting would be the fear factor. Hiding in a house, then you hear a player walking in, for example. The maps are very well created, and I give props to the designers responsible, but it still doesn't save this game from being mediocre at this current time. One thing that's cool, is that the devs have stated that all the upcoming DLC will be free, and they apparently plan on implementing more features, but I have no idea if any of that is actually true in the long run.Okay, so the game is original, and has style, but what does it lack? I shall start with the fact that there is absolutely nothing to unlock, or achieve, other than steam achievements. It does not matter how many matches you win, all you will ever recieve is a little message, and ""awards"" like ""Hunter"" that actually hold no weight whatsoever to your profile or game at all. I know some people prefer this style of online game, but I find it totally destroys replayability and makes the game feel pointless. I think this is a great game to play in SHORT bursts but only with close friends on a mic. I find going online solo, only lasts me about 25 minutes before I have to turn it off due to how repetitive and redudant it had become. To sum things up....The game is well made, and bursts with creativity, considering the genre. Although it's creative, looks good, and the bugs are extremely rare, the game lacks content and feels very shallow in comparison to other modern, multiplayer online games. PRO:-Creative take on the zombie game genre-Very nice visuals and not too hard on your PC. - Interesting weapon selection/Small selection of maps, but they are well done.- Virutally no bugs (100 hours of playing and I have yet to encounter many past full release.)- All upcoming DLC are going to be given to us free (They say they plan on POSSIBLY adding a ranking system of some sort, but only want to add it to ""Escape"" mode which absolutely baffles my mind.CON- No Ranking/No unlockables whatsoever. Nothing to achieve.- Small map selection- Only ONE proper pvp mode (It's good though)- The other modes are boring (Escape isn't terrible but as I explained, there is no reward for completing it other than a steam achievement)- Lack of replay unless you have close friends to play with using mics. I have friends that play but even then I find it redundant, so it's truly hard to say.- NO CHARACTER CREATION/NO CHARACTER PROFILE FOR ONLINE- The head developer of this game will reply in anger to criticism on the forums, defending his game to the very last breath, even if it means he is so completely incorrect about the subject at hand. -Warning-If you enjoy FPS games with a zombie theme, and enjoy a minor horror touch, then go ahead and buy this...If it is ON SALE. I would never pay more than $10 for this game in it's current, shallow state.6/10 "

												If you even hated L4D series for it's arcade'ish pushing gameplay but wanted a spooky zombie survival game - you just found it. Well... kind of.True what Contagion currently suffers from all common Early Access problems, starting from bugs and broken critical features (like melee combat) and ending with lack of contents. However that may be exactly what currently making this game outstanding and induce euphoria on first use to any survival game enthusiast. I mean if you want a pure survival gem, you probably want Contagion right now - before it will be tainted by all-popular 'balancing' stuff, like special infected and infinity horde collection mode.Just look the negative reviews - people actually complains what they can't shove off bunch of zombies with a 700g handgun swing. Yes, in Contagion you'll die if you failed to determine the right moment to reload when fighting horde. You'll also die if you failed to check what is behind door before opening it... Or to check room for stray zombie before start looting it... Or to plan yourself retreat path before engaging larger hordes. Did i mention that you can simply run out of ammo - depends of how good team survivors are?			"

												My experience with this game was and is still great. I always played as a host with two or three friends with in-game vocal chat in Extraction or Escape modes (PvE). I played  Left 4 Dead and one difference I can recall is the fact that, even at normal difficulty, you can run out of ammo in Contagion if you don't search for it or you waste it. It gives a small inventory management challenge and search-for-items pleasure. Since your inventory is limited, you'll find ammo for guns that you don't have but that one of your friends have, this adds to the cooperation since you often have to drop ammo for your teammates to be efficient.The maps are well made even if the objectives are kind of confusing for the first time you do the map (We usually play at lower difficulty than usual for a new map to get hang of the objectives). There is some nice replayability on maps since the path you take from one game to another may not be the same. In one playtrough, you may use a certain door but in the other, this door is locked and then you realize you have to find another way or that the keys you need are not at the same place and you have to search for it, this help to lessen the feel that you are playing the same map.The only major crittic I have about this game is the lack of variety in ennemies. Since shooting is a large part of the game, your target stays the head for everything you encounter (walking and crawling zombies). The only exception is an armored zombie, he just have a lot more health, no weakpoints like 'You need to shoot it in the back' which would be a perfect feature for a cooperative game but no, you just have to fill him full of lead. Many Shooting Zombie-Themed games use different types of ennemies to create some variety in shooting (Like Left 4 Dead, Resident Evil, 7 Days to Die...) but maybe the concept of a 'realistic' zombie virus locked the concept of using more variety.

												A useless piece of raw and underdeveloped game. What do we see here? A zombie game? AGAIN? Like, L4D, KIlling Floor, Dead Island, No More Room In Hell, Resident Evil, Zombie Apocalypse weren't enough to fullfill your survival needs? If they make a new game in the fully harvested field, then there must be a reason to it, they want to bring in something NEW in the genre. What do we see here? ♥♥♥♥ing. Nothing. New. It is end of 2013 and all they create is ♥♥♥♥ing nothing. Let's see how the developers describe it themselves:""Contagion isn't your average Zombie Shooter but instead takes a more realistic and different approach to the popular genre with unique characters, environments, weapons, items, and a built in system that makes every round completely unpredictable with resources, objectives, and paths ever changing.""1) Unique characters - Killing Floor, L4D.2) weapons and items - pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, nothing good was found thereChanging paths and environment - ♥♥♥♥ING WHOA? Is this the innovation here? Don't Starve+zombies+first person?Is that what you've created? Is that what costs 10 ♥♥♥♥ing euros on steam? Game I wanted to uninstall after 5 minutes of gameplay? IS THAT REALLY IT, DEVELOPERS? THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT ME TO TEAR 10 EUROS OFF MY WALLET? I could have bought a large ♥♥♥♥ing pizza for that and eat it a week, here you put a gameplay for a day. It's so ugh, I deleted it straight away. No servers running, singleplayer mode is kill myself simulator, thank you.4.3/10			"

												This game is best described as a Left4Dead with more traditional zombies (slow moving) with 8 players instead of 4. Ammo is not unlimited and headshots are extremely important and infected players turn into zombies. These gamplay differences may seem insignificant, but it can make the game tense and exciting. I thoroughly enjoyed the time I've spent in the game so far and am looking forward to what else Monochrome does with the game. In my opinion this replaces L4D. it deserves your attention if you like multiplayer zombie shooters/survival games.			"

												Frankly, this game has potential to be good. But it just isn't. It's far too easy and boring. The level design is cool, and I was scared to run into zombies at first. As soon as I found some, however, I killed them easily. All 2 of them. Which leads me to the main issue. There are no zombies! This is supposed to be a zombie survival game but there are never more than 5 zombies attacking you at once. When you have HUGE teams of human players, what's the point of playing when the humans outnumber the zombies?Plus, the zombies move like they were programmed in 1998.			"

												Although the movement is a bit awkward, this really creepy  game as single player is okay. When playing with a group who use their microphones, it is a great funny game....you start survivor and if you get killed, you become zombies. Then the choice is to attack the other survivors or just hang out!!! The game is a piece in progress so there are constant improvements. My first game with other players I was a zombie twice after being infected then killed by the survivors, and my third spawn I was a cockroach in the cafeteria. All talk is on so it is possible to communicate with the other players at any stage.			"

Rank: 6/10Recommendation(s): Buy on sale, don't think this is a triple A title, and live in New York or beside server host.Major Theme: Significant lack of professionalism.Bought at Price: $0 - Gifted when $3There's quite a list of things to touch on, so let's get right to it.I have always been a big fan of Source powered titles, and even more so of mods going pro level. This title is a big let down, and I certainly hope it improves quickly. To me, licencing and using the Source engine means serious work. The developers are willing to step up to the AAA level and deliver. So far, development has been very amateurish, almost what I would expect from a Source mod.Being SteamWorks enabled, the download and install process was easy. On launching the game, I was shocked and confused as to why I am seeing a notice about RAM requirements. This original shows the situation hasn't improved:


Uhm... WHAT!? What kind of unoptimized hunk of junk is this? Since when did source games use close to 1GB of RAM? This doesn't look good....

From what you see today:


The programmers still can't do basic math.. So much for leaving early access! 
A Screenshot of Contagion
By: DarK_St3alth




If you are having issues understanding (which is the case with many) what the issue is, please read this little bit. The game notifies me that the OS is reporting there's 4087MB of RAM to use, yet the game needs a minimum 4064MB.Tieing back into the amateurish development, it seems that the developers can't even do simple math; is 4087 bigger then 4064? I'm not sure why this hasn't been resolved or if it will ever be, but it's scary to think that it has passed through not only QA (quality assurance) but the project lead and programmers as well.Talking about testing and QA, a recent issue came up of kill reporting. If you were to throw a grenade bound to kill someone, and switch to another weapon, you will find that the server reports back that the person was killed with the actively selected weapon.I hate going on about the QA, so let's move to another topic. How about effects for show?Throughout my education to date and programming experience, I was always told ""simple is best"". There's no need to overly complicate things or add things ""just for show"". Sadly, Contagion falls into this trap. What I call the ""dirty lens effect"", doesn't make any logical sense. This effect is used when characters have glasses or a protective visor on. When used correctly it can add that extra level of immersion, knowing that you are looking out of a visor. Last time I checked, none (or the vast majority) of characters didn't have a visor or glasses on. So why include it? What was the gain from adding an effect that doesn't have sound backing? It's just yet another questionable move by the amateurish development team.I can't bash the game that much, because gameplay wise, it's nice to see some fresh elements in an over crowded and over saturated zombie genre. The cell phone dynamic/mechanic allows for greater immersion, and removes the need for HUD elements. Operation can be odd due to the key bindings.Rescuing trapped survivors was another fresh idea, but again has a failing in it. While they added the ability for the AI to defend themselves, they tend to shoot each other if one is in the line of fire.Jumping into the most worldly debated topic of ""PvE"" and ""PvP"" (which I don't agree with the terms) would seem logical at this point. The hunter maps seem to be random, but don't provide enough randomness to prevent players learning the how many different combinations to gain an advantage. I vouch for games that focus on player skills, rather then easy memorization. Sadly, memorization is the is the only skill really required and doesn't allow for fair play.The randomness the title does provide in the ""hunted"" gamemode seems to be unbalancing. Some players are given the more powerful 1911, where as others are given the weaker Sig Sauer. While the round progresses, this doesn't matter that much, but early on can certainly provide an unfair advantage. There's no counter balance to the 1911 early game, because you don't need that much ammo to kill targets.On that topic, due to using a certain server host, latency can be a real game killer. Valve tends to spread their servers out, and have enough in reserve to get people playing. This is not the case with Contagion. Either there's an issue with the server host or game code, but you can end up playing on a UK server while sitting on the far side of North America. Not sure how many of you have done this, but let's say 130ms makes shots and server-client prediction interesting.""Early Beta"" for the team was really more of an excuse then a development status. Besides the ambiguity caused by using ""early"", it just seems that there was (and continutes to be) a significant lack of professionalism.So there you have it. All the major issues, and the unfortunate lack of positives. Throughout the whole review, I keep going back to the idea of ""amateurish development"". It's the biggest idea that screams out the most when playing the title.			"

												It's actually not that bad of a zombie game. If you were to play alone I can see why it can be boring and hard to complete. With a friend or a group it's quite enjoyable. I don't really care for Extraction mode though, even with friends. I find it to be repetitive, going from house to house saving people who all look like the previous saved people lol. Escape is my favorite. The objectives can be quite annoying though, especially when you are low on ammo, barely any health, have a  zombie horde trying to murder you, and you don't know where to go. I love the little cockroach you become when you die. It's so fun to jump around, trolling the remaining survivors lol. Oh, and medkits are too scarce. There is also a tiny problem with hitboxes not registering when you melee. When you take a sledgehammer to the head of a zombie 5 times, it should die right? Well not all the time :)As for the pumpkin head Halloween update: It was fun for awhile, but it is so hard to get a headshot on them so you are constantly just wasting ammo.			"

Run around for more amo or go head to head against other players. There are even modes where you escape. Basically zombie panic and no more room in hell except with way more polish and variety.

												Spectacularly bad and I'm not generally a picky gamer.Contagion crashed 4 times over the course of 2 hours and with very long (3-4 minute) load times, that's really irritating.The graphics are shockingly poor, even by 2014 standards. The sound is broken.  For example, if you let out a zombie scream (after you've become one), it plays maybe once or twice but then you just get the animation.  You'll also hear sounds that are not coupled to direction.  Got headphones on and there's gunfire to your left?  No there isn't.  And this is for ALL sounds, not just some.  Might as well just play with the sound off as it is quite literally worse than useless.If you die, you become a zombie.  Good luck trying to find that one survivor holed up somewhere in a huge map loaded with explorable buildings.  When you do find them, hopefully they aren't barricaded in a room (they will be) because you can look forward to getting killed quickly, then spending five minutes getting back to where they are (provided you know the map well enough to know how to get back to where you were), and get killed again.  And that's if you're lucky and they haven't moved.  If so, back to square 1 which can take 20-30 minutes of just wandering around.  You think there'd be a game timer move the game along.  Nope.  You stay in this state until all survivrs are dead.  Invariably, the survivors get bored and just die intentinally because that's more fun than the self-barricaded stalemate.  Nothing serves as an impetus for the survivors to be pushed toward action like a countdown to a carpet bombing or the last evac helicopter leaving.  Success is survival and if that means sitting in a closet with three bullets forever, your optiosn are to either stay in that closet forever or intentionally die.What's irritating is that it's a generally interesting concept but everything about it, and I mean everything, is fail.  That this game got a ""mostly positive"" review is mind-blowing.  It's terrible.  I wouldn't play it if it were free.			"

												If you expect an easy 0815 zombie shooting game, you're wrong.There are many gamemodes like Escape, save NPCs, a simply deathmatch etc.Find your equipment, avoid making sounds and avoid as many zombies as you can.DON'T GET HIT! It could be over after one simply hit because you can get infected by one hit and then you'll turn into a zombie... is it over then?NO! You can still play as a zombie, lead a horde of 15 zombies and kill all the remaining players. Now you ask, why should I kill the guys I tried to survive with? Cause it's fun. But be careful, you're easy to kill as a zombie and if you die too often, you'll become a cockroach (simply a spectator). You'll run around on the map as a cockroach, waiting for everyone to die or escape (depends on the gamemode you chose). But hey, its not that simple, players can run over you and kill you even if you're a cockroach.Theres death everywhere ;DBut it's not only fun but.. the game is dead. Feeling like there are only 50 people playing it. Thats quiet sad cause it's such a fun game :(PS: aim for the head, don't waste ammo			"

												Tought it would be a good game to try, I heard goos review from early stage, but since it game full release people seem to dislike it. So I was happy when i could try it for free.Heres the thing, this could have been a good replacement for l4d, since i doubt there gonna be a l4d3 so yeah, for the engine it use the graphics are good, the atmosphere is what you expect from the genre, dark wishing to have a flashlight, low ammo and scavenge any gun around. Cool idea to be able to barricade yourself inside, wich aint new, but seriously its a pain to patch a window when zombies dont stop coming out of it, you need to switch back and forth with guns and nailgun. It does support Xbox controller wich is a plus, im gonna try this later on to see it it does change my review.The really downside for me is the sloppy slow mouvements, really........ it feel like overweight guy who try to move, so slow, and slow, and thats just the aiming!! Could have gone faster in speed too, but would have been unbalanced because those are brainless old fashion retro zombie... wich mean if you had time to dance un front of him before shooting it, might be too easy, i understand some balancing, if its that here.Metacritics is right on this one, no more no less, just not enough.

												As of 4/10/2014, this game is still in its beta stages. And I am a very negitive person, so of course I'll start with the badBAD: The overall game is buggy at best, (I'm rating this on its current stages of the game) and it has the HL2 trademarked terrible hitboxes. The game provides only 3 co-op maps and a fist full of decent weapons (sorry kebar knife you're out) The updates, as far as my experinces, are very slow to come out, but when they do they're full of half-decent thingysGOOD: The game provdies a wonderful Gamemode called 'hunted' where you're so-called friends get a laugh out of hunting each other (those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s). Overall the gamemode is very tense and I would buy it just for that gamemode. The other gamemodes are nothing glorious, but nevertheless fun. There's the 'extraction' where you'll experience your 'friends' hogging all the loot trying to 'save' surviors from a horde of zombies that arrive the moment you open a door (of course this is a fun gamemode as well) Then there's the 'escape' gamemode where your 'friends' will acuatally have to 'work together' (meaning your more dense freind shot a shotgun into a horde of zombies you were hoping to avoid) Again a fun gamemodeOh and the graphics are half decent as well.Overall: A Giant steaming pile of 8.3/10			"

												Definetly worth the price! Contagion has left the BETA stages and is now a full game. The game is awesome graphically, amazing and detailed sounds! [Incredibly useful for when playing The hunted gamemode] Plenty of fun to be had! with 5 or more game modes theres a lot to do! One of my favorite features is for the Escape game mode which puts you in a situation and you and your team need to cooperate to get out alive. The best part? the mission's objectives are randomized so you don't always play the same thing over and over again. Contagion Currently has 6 maps to choose from [which are incredibly fun] And Steamworkshop to add a bunch of player made gun skins, flashlights, phone backgrounds and maps! Also they announced the up coming DLCS will be absolutely free! Contagion is a refreshing and fun addition to the zombie survival genre with a mechanic where when ever you die you yourself get to become a zombie! Even better you have full controll over your zombie and must kill the rest of your old team to win! SO wether you're a zombie or a human there is lot's of fun to be had. Now the cons of the game: Sometimes the zombie AI will group up to attack a player but get stuck in a giant mass [can be fixed with the roar ability as a zombie to make them follow you] [I forgot to add that a great feature is the ability to climb over objects and break down doors] other cons are sometimes the zombie vision can kinda hurt your eyes so don't leave it on for too long. Now that the cons are over one of my favorite features to the game they recently added is Controller Support and wait for it..... SPLIT SCREEN!!! Yes split screen! Plug in 2 controllers or one controller and the other uses the mouse&keyboard and guess what? you got yourself some couch co-op which most games lack these days! [ No auto-aim for controllers i might add] [PS4 controllers work to!!!} All in all Contagion is a really fun game especially with friends! I would go into detail about the gamemodes but that would take too long! Anyway I give Contagion an awesome 8.5/10 Go pick this game up! Have fun in big picture mode on a tv with controllers! Do what ever! 8.5/10.			"

Product received for free
												This game is the prime reason why 'early access' shouldn't exist...The devs havent updated for almost a year now and they claimed that this game would be finished but it's far from that. They Post their undevloped game and got their money and dipped. This is why early access pisses me off, cause devs never stick to their word.			"

												Bought this on a sale with my partner a while ago and we love it. We have been looking for co-op zombie orientated games  and for us this game is brilliant. The map selection is small but what makes it fresh is that locations change, while some doors will be open one time the next they will be blocked up and you'll have to find alternate paths or alternate items to progress. It would be nice for more maps to be added in the future though.Gameplay is great, I feel it's as realistic as it can be in a zombie apocalypse in which if a crowd finds you, you will be overwhelmed which means you need to form tactics with a partner or solo, the way that the zombies only really die by headshots is also brilliant while difficult when first getting into the game but it becomes easier in time. The objectives are plenty and each gamemode has different aims which is great when you get bored with one.The only issues I can really come up with are zombies pathing is sometimes strange but it doesn't affect the game much, could use some more maps. Also when infection is on and you'll sometimes change for no reason even if you haven't been hit, but it's not extremely common though when at the end of a game waiting to escape it's a damn pain in the♥♥♥♥♥Love this game I'll give it 9/10. had a very good time with it. Though I would reccomend it with a friend rather than solo as it is fun.			"

												As of 3/10/14, I give this game a score of 7/10.PROS: O  The graphics look very good.O  Many characters to choose from.O  Animations are fluid.O  Sound is immersive and realistic.CONS: X  There is a lack of maps, but that's okay as long as they are working on making the mechanics of the game better. You can only play the gametypes for certain maps. They should consider making survival-like versions of every extraction map or versus gamemode so that you could play the same mode but in a survival mode.X  The gunshots in this game sound like little BB guns. There is only about one gun that sounds like an actual gun and the sound isn't even for the right type of gun. Not big enough of a deal to take a rating off, but hey it's the little things that count. X  The shove with V is terrible, it doesn't even push the zombies away.X  When you die, the game is extremely boring. You spend all of your time as a zombie going around trying to find the humans and it's just terrible. CONCLUSION: Concept is good but needs a LOT of work. If you are reading this and have watched the trailer, realize that the trailer is a bit misleading. Not all of the things in the trailer are in the game yet, but that's not to say that they won't add it soon. After buying the game during the fall sale, I was a bit skeptical to whether they would update or not. However, the game has been updated regularly so you can count on the developers to add more things to the game. I play this game every time there is an update so that I can change the review to match what the current product is. I do realize the game is in beta and I hope they continue working to make it a better game.EDIT: As of 3/10/14 the game has been updated several times and improved on animations, bugs, and the graphical user interface. I have updated the overall rating to match its current state.The moderators on the Contagion discussions delete reviews that talk sh*t about the game. Haha.			"

												The word is Clunky.Clunky controls.Clunky words.Clunky AI.Clunky gamemodes.Clunky pvp.Clunky Co-Op.Everything about this game doesn't work smoothly, whether you get literal jerks attempting to jump over something in a motion similar to being yanked by a short string and dragged over the obstacle.or more metaphorical clunkiness in the form of map readability and gameplay flow.Additionally, many of the features this game presents as it's strong points are actually weak points, or hardly points at all.""Map variability"" here means ""Sometimes a door is open that isn't always open"".Does that door matter? Heck no.Except one in a million times, the objective decides to be behind that door, so you run the map you've run a hundred times before, only to realise the end was 1/5th of the way through the 45 minute run.""CooP and PvP"" here means: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will shoot you at random, Rust Style, and if they don't, people will join your server as you're in site of the goal as zomies, kill you, then leave the server. Say goodbye to another 45 minutes.Weapons function strangely, and there are odd levels of spread. Additionally, with no viable dedicated servers for half the countries that play this game, good luck getting a stable connection.Try sniping in a game where even high sensitivity makes you feel like your arms are encased in jelly with a grainy scope with poor resolution compensation on a connection that drops every tenth of a second.... with 15% spread.Additionally, and finally, The developers censor any negative comments or constructive criticism made to them on their forums.They have since beta.They act smarmy in and out of game, and don't hesitate to inform you that they can make you jump through a hoop at will.It's likely this mentality is what lead to the games... mediocre state.Don't buy, not even at 75% off, courtesy of the steam summer sale.

												Have you ever played Dead Island? It's mediocre, does nothing special and has tons of bugs. Despite that, it's still enjoyable to play with friends and worth it if the game is on sale. I feel the same thing applies to Contagion and if Steam reviews had a rating between yes and no for recommendations, that's where I would put this game.My first thought about this game was that it simply did not feel finished, or like a retail game. It was then quickly pointing out to me that this is based on a Source game, Zombie Panic. That's what this feels exactly like, a source mod, as opposed to a game you pay for. Although despite this, the game somehow manages to look dated and the animations are shoddy. Gameplay itself can be quite fun in places, but feels bear. For example, there is one gamemode in which you are given a location you must get to, find supplies and kill zombies. At first, this seemed really enjoyable, there was no map apart from those located in-game as models which was a neat idea but soon we discovered everything felt extremely linear with many of the paths we wanted to take blocked off. You quickly learn this game is not as open world as it seems, which is disappointing since taking multiple routes to get to an objective in a zombie game should be encouraged.The game also includes a neat mechanic in which if you die, you become a zombie and get to hunt down your friends. This is a good idea and proved to be some fun, however it is somewhat flawed. It is extremely hard to find other players, unless they're close. If you press a button, you get a red filter which is supposed to make things easier, I don't know, I didn't find it useful. Zombies have no trackers to find humans which is probably intentional but when some maps are so big and dark, it can be a nightmare and purely coincidence to find humans. So zombies are probably more fun for people who are actually used to the game and know the maps, but the first time it happens, especially if it's on Barlow Square, it's extremely tedious to do and you will spend ages just trying to find your way around the map.Another problem this game suffers from is the surround sound is complete and utter garbage. I don't know if this is a Source Limitation or what but on a gamemode like Hunted, which is PvP and is vital for you to be able know where enemies are to stay alive, it can be absolutely frustrating and disorienting. The game isn't terrible, we had quite a lot of fun on some gamemodes when a bunch of us got together but it just feels extremely hard to recommend, with the tipping factor how much you're being asked to pay for it. If you don't bother with it, you aren't missing much and should probably go download No More Room In Hell instead since they both generally feel on the same level.However the SDK it comes with has a very nice interface and it's pretty easy to get css/gmod maps into the game.Also to point out what Panda posted in his review: http://i.imgur.com/6Td7w0E.png "

												Contagion is exactly like what imagine where the left for dead series would go, if the next iteration had an extra chromosome.  or perhaps the designers for left for dead or other good games had created a list of all the good things and a list of bad things to put into a survival horror game, and Contagion is what happens when someone uses the wrong list as their design base?its the last cohesive gameplay experience i think i have ever had. lets design a team survival game, with no functional map, or hud display of any kind to indicate where your team is, how ways in which you can work together, then lets make it super dark so you knee jerk shoot your team when they come within a 100 yards of you and startle you a bitthen lets maybe think of ways we can design maps so that are so homiginized that navigating them is a joke because every area looks just like every other area, and since you dont have a map of any kind all you get to do is walk around in the dark until your team mates  shoot you for ...walking around looking for your team mates..... good times to be had by all			"

												I played Contagion during the time it was free so my time was short. The concepts in the game were a lot of fun. Working together, hunting, being hunted, extractions etc. As small of a thing as it was, I thought the cellphone idea was cool. Overall, I would not pay anything for this game if it receives no major updates. The controls are very clunky. Granted, this is partially due to my machine, but I found the gameplay very rough when the action was on. Graphics-wise, I was not super disappointed (because I paid nothing) but given what is out there I would expect more. Gameplay was only fun because I played with others. Oddly enough, I agreed with another player who said the running around searching for a way out and looking for ammo/tools was probably more like a 'real' zombie apocalypse than running and gunning everywhere. Playing as a zombie was basically like Left 4 Dead but worse. I would have preferred dying and waiting for my teammates to die or win instead of playing as a zombie OP. Potential is there but not fulfilled.			"

												I bought this game on sale for $5, thinking I was getting a steal because It was a full released game. After playing for a while I felt scammed because it felt like an alpha or a really bad beta. Pros; It can be fun to blow a zombie's brains out, but it gets old because that's the only satisfying place to shoot the zombies. Playing with a friend is fun, but there are bugs such as your phone map displaying your friend's phone map. You can- There are- .... This one map-, ... Nah thats pretty much it. Shooting a zombie in the face is the most fun thing about the game.Cons: The graphics are eh and the gameplay is poor. There aren't very many guns or weapons to use, and the game modes are very tedious, boring, and unsatisfying. The mechanics are lame too, the only things you can do are aim shoot and press E to interact, which doesn't even serve you well. I found myself trying to interact with loads of stuff that didn't work. For example, there was a cleaver stabbed into a countertop in one of the maps, which seemed perfectly suitable for zombie killing, but it turns out it was just part of the scenery. There were also lots of small places and corners to investigae, however they never had any loot or useful weapons, so it turned out to be a waste of time. Speaking of wasting my time, this game is also a total waste of money. **PLEASE, NO MATTER WHAT, DO NOT SPEND $20 ON THIS GAME**. 5 is acceptable, but 20 is a bit crazy. The zombie AI is strange, they're slow moving and unintelligent, however they can climb ladders and come after you if you're on a roof. The mele button may as well not be there because hitting a zombie with your gun seems to not do damage, and doesn't even knock it back for breathing room. The fact that you can't knock zombies really stinks because if you get cornered by an armored zombie, (I've seen 2 my entire time playing.) you're as good as done.All in all, don't buy this game unless it's on sale for under 5 bucks, and even then you'll probably be disappointed.

												This game is a beta, and it sure feels that way.options re blacked out, there's only a few maps, and to my knowledge, there's no particular objective to some of the maps/game modes. The aiming, AI, and weapons are all a little rough. Headshots sometimes don't register, and AI are invulnerable when walking into waist high fences. But other than that, I enjoyed this.It's a zombie game. You shoot them, you look for ammo, you get necrophillia again (whilst staring at undead boobage)Anyways, looking into a non closed-minded viewpoint, this game is great. It has a LOT of potential, and I'll love to see what the devs do. Because I sure as hell will be eagerly awaiting whatever comes at me.I like horses.			"

To follow several interacting plot lines, the film makes use of the multi-narrative ""hyperlink cinema"" style, popularized in several of Soderbergh's films.Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Z. Burns had collaborated on The Informant! (2009). Following that film's release, both considered creating a biopic covering Leni Riefenstahl's life, before Burns brought up the idea of producing a medical thriller film depicting the rapid spread of a virus, which was inspired by various pandemics such as the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2009 flu pandemic. To devise an accurate perception of a pandemic event, Burns consulted with representatives of the World Health Organization as well as noted medical experts such as W. Ian Lipkin and Lawrence ""Larry"" Brilliant. Principal photography started in Hong Kong in September 2010, and continued in Chicago, Atlanta, London, Geneva, and San Francisco until February 2011.Contagion premiered at the 68th Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy on September 3, 2011, and went on general release on September 9. The film was well received by critics, who praised the narratives and the performances of various actors and actresses. It was also well received by scientists, who praised its accuracy. Commercially, the film was a moderate box office success. Budgeted at USD $60 million, Contagion attained $135 million in box office revenue during its theatrical run.			"

												Has great potential to become the best zombie FPS out here.Comparing to l4d, it's much slow paced and more realistic, and have better atmosphere.Requiring good teamwork and communication, and also clear mind rather than pure killing/aiming skill to win the round.I love the realism of the game.Still in beta, hope more maps will come out and more players will join in so this game will be a gem			"

												For $6.50 I got to camp in a dark dreary bathroom for 15 minutes in a free for all / Hunger Games game mode. Listening to the snaps and cracks of bullets around my building. Real players yelling from shoot outs, that ended with a winner in blood. Hearing the drone of a horde of zombies, and then hearing the last player hunting me get taken out by a zombie horde. With me coming out victorious.WOULD BUY AGAIN.			"

												Its not the most refined & there are plenty of bugs but Oh man its fun! The iron sights and only head shots absorb you right into the game. The levels always start out easy enough. Plenty of ammo you're popping off head shots right and left. By mid level the game changes and you barely will noticed. Without warning you are low on ammo and zombies are surrounding you. You're tunnel visioned end firing a zombie when you see the flash of damage and realize a zombie snuck up behind you! Are you bit? Are you infected? How long can you hide it from your friends?....This is by far the best zombie game out there! It will pull you in lining up iron sites then scare you to death when zombie pops out of no where!			"

												Harvest is so hard!!! I get slaughtered so fast!Anyway, it's a great game. Very challenging and can be time-consuming. The only people who are whining about the zombies are the lazy gamers who like everything handed to them on a silver platter. Don't change the way the zombies are. If anything, improve their AI so they don't get hung up on things.Contagion imo highly encourages co-op gameplay. My gf and I have logged a lot of hours together offline and in splitscreen. It's awesome the way we have to think of our next move or play freerunner to juke the hordes. If there was one negative thing to say about this game is that it just doesn't have enough maps. Especially for the escape game mode.Other than that, I recommend it to all but mostly to those who like a challenge and who accept the fact that you will die over and over and over again for seemingly crazy reasons. Awesome game! 9/10 cuz yunomakemaormaps?!			"

												Dated graphics, BAD animation. PvP Game modes could have been fun but most rounds end after about 1 min, which would be okay had you a) found anyone, b) not just spent 10 mins trying to find a game. Standard PvE survival is out of the question... you`ll have more fun seeing how many cocktail sticks you can shove under your fingernails. You start on a set map (the procedural side of things seem to involve which of 5 doors are open or closed) and you wander around following a mobile phone set of quests which just send you to waypoints...Steer clear of this one!

The once who doesn't make it will become zombies are try to hunt the people that are still alive and those who are alive can even shoot eachother.Great small game worthe the buy and like me I think you will enjoy it.

												Great game, especially in escape co-op mode. Haven't tried PVP yet.Luckily developers still support it and react to player's reports. With the last patch released it became stable. Haven't noticed a single crash after playing it for 3-4 days.Zombies are not superfast and intelligent. There are only two types of zombies - regular and armored SWAT ones. This game doesn't have any science fictional weapons of the future which is a plus for me.Weapons, ammo and medkits spawn rendomly, so you always have to look for any useful loot everywhere which increases the replayability.I recommend playing this game with couple of friends using voice chat.

												I am a die hard L4D fan and so I was a little hesitant to purchase this game, I'm really glad I did. Contagion is co-op survival horror at its finest. Your actions must be deliberate, especially on the higher difficulty settings as ammo is scarce. Headshots and a reliable buddy are your only way out of this zombiepocolypse. The maps have mutliple pathways to them so it is not always the same experience. Add into that the player controlled zombie feature (after a friend gets killed) and you will dread the sound of zombies groaning in the distance. My advicve is to stop reading this pathetic review and click buy.			"

												This game is really good for a early access game. It feels like its a complete game even though its in beta. The maps are a decent size and weapons are relatively easy to find and easy to access. Every gun sounds and handles great with little to no problems about bullets not registering. I haven't experienced any lag and there are little to no bugs from what I see ( except an occasional zombie getting trapped behind some funiture). the graphics are good and maps are pretty well detailed. The AI is kind of derpy at sometimes. In some cases you could be standing yard or two away from zombies and they wouldn't even see you standing there. My only big problem in the game I see is that you get control of the situation to quick! there is almost little to no dread in the ""survival"" situation of the game. If your playing with a well coordinated team or just one friend in any of the modes theres not much you haft to worry about except other players. Now what I mean by that is sometimes weapons, ammo, and health are too easy to find and stack way to high!!!! you could have more then 100 rounds in any smg, assualt riffle, or even the pistol. Besides the rediculous amount of ammo you can obtain with four weapons  is that the hordes of the zombies are too small. Pros:- No lag- every gun looks, sounds, and handles great.- decent graphics, good maps, well detailed enviroments- classic shoot in the head to kill zombie style gamplayCons:- occasional bullet not registering and weird AI- loot in the game is to easy to access overall 8.5 out of 10 would like to see a variety of new maps, maybe make it so you can't contain so much ammo, and more random hordes of zombies.

												Seems fun although i dont know if i could play it much more. the graphics are a bit choppy and getting around objects sucks, and the constant reflection on things that dont reflect light was annoying, but overall i would reccomend trying it although i find most other zombie games alot more fun and interactive.

												I am surprised this game is in it's finished form. I did a LAN with 5 other people and to begin with, the game was fun. However, when a player dies and the mission continues, those that are dead are either turned into a zombie (hopefully), or turned into a cockcoach to help other players navigate the rest of the map like a scout. however, players can squish the cockroach and once they do, that player is dead and has to sit and wait until everyone else either wins or loses. At one point, I was ""infected"" and turned on the spot. It was a cool mechanic, but I had NO idea how I became infected or what the prerequisite is for turning into a zombie. I want to turn into a zombie if I die with friends!! Prepare to sit and wait patiently after you die.

												Survivors vs Zombies gameplay is fun but gets old quick if stuck on the same map with no cycling. It is a $$ knockoff of the FREE Zombie Panic! Source mod on Steam:I would only recommend this game if it were free or had significant overhaul/expansion of features to explain the price increase from a free mod. Some constructive criticism for the devs based on my gameplay experience follows: -Zombies get tired? No ranged attack? WTFrack?? Get rid of the stamina guage for the Zombie run or use it instead for a spit attack (minor damage+chance to infect+momentary blurred vision?). The undead don't tire, but it does take time to cough up more corruption+parasites from their dead lungs. Make it an unlock if you think Zombies with ranged weapon is unbalanced - refillable only by devouring Surviors perhaps (minor health gain)?-Insanely difficult to track down survivors on the larger maps as a zombie, especially if you are new to a map and don't know the layout. The pathing/tracking blood sight system needs to be improved badly.-Royal Pain to sneak up on anyone as a zombie, especially with the constant moaning an groaning. Maybe limit the noise zombies make to only when they are attacking and/or running quickly. It should be much easier to get one good stealth bite in and would definitely increase the suspense factor.-Remove the Nail Gun + Boards or make them easier to use. Easier currently to just defend an area yourself than board it up, as it is very non-intuitive.-Survivors should be able to scale fences just like Zombies, faster even but using their stamina meter, same as jumping or running. Very annoying when the undead are climbing over fences and cars but you cannot. Other option is to take away Zombie ability to scale anything and instead allow them to knock fences down especially when zombie buddies helping, similar to the destructible doors.-The physics engine felt blocky with most of the movement - maybe smooth it out? I don't know if collision can be tweaked, but I found myself frequently getting snagged on corner of cars, buildings, dumpsters, etc. Definitely breaks the mood when you are running someone down or trying to run from a horde.-No anti-camping mechanism. All roofs should have multiple access points but do not currently. Zombie spit attack (see above) would also help with this. The other option would be to make all survivors spawn in an infected state with life steadily decreasing. When it hits zero, they die and turn. Obviously you would have to have more med kits and/or food/drink items laying about to counteract this. It would add a definite sense of urgency to scavenging items besides ammo.-Headshotting zombies is a guaranteed one-shot kill. The only difficulty with this is the zombies which have broken necks or otherwise move their head down or to the side when shambling about - also the riot gear zombies. Grappling+biting survivors should be a guaranteed infection to balance things out. Didn't seem to be the case.-Nothing sucks worse than running from a horde shrieking like a lil girl because you have no weapon with which to defend yourself. Sometimea your teammate is hogging all the drops or just got to them first because you're new to the map. More variety and availability of improvised weapons would take care of this problem - ie screwdrivers, broom handle, ice pick, meat cleaver, molotovs, hairspray+lighter, etc. There should be an improvised weapon in almost every room if you looked closely enough. This doesn't mean they cannot be depleted, snap off in or get lodged in a zombie carcass, forcing you to obtain another. This increases the need to scavenge.-Plenty of weapons in game, but I'd like to see more, so long as they are not too similar to existing weapons - ie flamethrowers, katanas, crossbows, etc. Permanent weapon mods/unlocks such as extended mags, flash supressors, vertical foregrips, silencers, laser sights, extra magnifcation scopes, etc would be awesome but should be rare finds or purchased DLC unlocks. Also more ammo types per weapon - ie hollow points or shotgun slugs to blow thru the SWAT zombies.-Varying reach and delay for different melee weapons. It felt as if all melee attacks were pretty much the same and equally susceptible to getting your arm chewed off. Only thing that seemed to help was higher ground and timing. Close quarters should be knives and Grapple+Bite only (quickest). Everything else requres room+time to swing and thus 1-2 meters more reach. Also additional effects such as block, knockback, dazed or impaired runspeed dependant on what was struck by which weapon. Zombies don't feel pain but they lose limbs fairly easily. Its all that corruptive rot setting in.I did enjoy the few flaming zombies I saw, but did not get to see how long they could last running about like that - they caught a round to the head far too quickly. Saved my assault rifle ammo for when I ran into SWAT zombies or all my other ammo ran dry. Also got infected twice and the blurred vision was a good indication I was turning. IMHO it should be more nauseating and/or disgusting to watch them turn, within the existing ESRB rating ofc.  Chance to infect seemed random but may have been based on how many times I was gnawed on.			"

												Was a little bland. The zombies come at you but not too fast and there does not seem to be any real goals other than to live through the zombies. Maybe I missed a bunch by playing at the noob level but that is what I am when it comes to this type of game. The tutorials could have been more obvious and there should have been some sort of indication if you were supposed to be getting somewhere other than just walking around killing zombies.I did enjoy getting to bash zombie heads in with a wrench and stabbing them with a knife. Much more fun than wasting bullets but survival is more difficult.			"

Sometime they just fall out of the sky, and you can't do anything but die.Way to much ammo, but no medical kits or something like that.There are more games like this out there and most way better. Graphics are realy old, and there are only a few maps, who keep repeating themselfs.I wanted to try a multiplayer, but there no players around...My advise, think twice before you spend any money on this game.

Thinking about when it's better not to waste a bullet is exactly what I was looking for!I kinda want you to do 2 things: A voting system for mapchanges/player kicks on public servers (like in cs) and MORE MAPS :D, you are working on the 2nd one, I know, just telling you, we're looking forward to seeing more :).Kind regards!

												Was a little bland. The zombies come at you but not too fast and there does not seem to be any real goals other than to live through the zombies. Maybe I missed a bunch by playing at the noob level but that is what I am when it comes to this type of game. The tutorials could have been more obvious and there should have been some sort of indication if you were supposed to be getting somewhere other than just walking around killing zombies.I did enjoy getting to bash zombie heads in with a wrench and stabbing them with a knife. Much more fun than wasting bullets but survival is more difficult.			"

												The best zombie game I have played. Character movements, sounds, and lighting are the best I have witnessed. The amount of blood and gore in the game is fantastic and realistic-like. But, that's where it ends.Pretty much everything else about this game is not great. The amount of maps and game modes is poor, boring and repetitive. You could complete this game within a couple of hours of playing. This is where I was severely disappointed, for a great game, not enough effort was put into map making, game mode making, etc. I believe the community needs to get more involved and make player based maps,  so that we can broaden our entertainment purposes. This game is similar to Left for Dead 2, but in my opinion, much better. It's just too bad that the developers did not follow on with what Left 4 Dead did, and make player based maps, and hold competitions to who could make the best map. I would rate this game 10/10. But this the content that it is lacking, I would lower it down to a 5/10. This game isn't worth $20.			"

												You may not be able to appreciate the level of polish that goes into a game like Left 4 Dead or even Killing Floor until you play a game like this. I don't recommend this to anyone, especially at anything higher than a $7 price point and even then only if you have friends to play it with. Save your money and get something else. If you're looking for good survival horror, this isn't it. It's not scary, it's just cryptic about where you should be going next depending on the mission.Be honest with yourself, how often do games in beta that start out poor actually become really good?

												Here we are for Contagion ! A game developed since 2005 if I remember, ok so I will be fast because the game is very very very short. There is five missions, the principal mission is in cooperation (you need to escape to a prison), one mission is called extraction (you need to protect a survivor until he escaped), and the three other are make for kill other players and you can be bored after 2 hours of gameplay (it's my case by the way)The good things are: there is not a lot of glitches (I found some but I'm a pro for this lol), and the gameplay is optimised (I have a very bad computer and I can play without any freeze or something like this) The bad things are: the game can be annoying when you tried all the missions, the new map is weird (there is some places than you can be sure you can enter but no) and the coop mission is glitched sometime.My final verdict is a 7/10 because except the game life, the game is very fun and the ""Hunted"" (PvP) mod are cool to play.

												Hated it. I loved Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2 but this just seemed like a really bad copy of it. I was looking foward to playing this since the trailer intrigued me so much, the characters were okay, but the gameplay was awful. I used a Xbox 360 controller, and I couldn't turn to my right or left, it worked on my other games, and I was struggling to find out what controls were on the keyboard that worked since there wasn't a tutorial. The lagg was a big issue, since I couldn't even move because of it (I turned down all the quality, hoping that the performance would be faster, however it only changed a bit.) The people online were sexist, racist and very offensive. All my favourite characters has been picked since I was too late because of the loading time. I've had no problems with my other games (which consist of: Resident Evil 6, Killing Floor, Left 4 Dead 2 and more.) I spent 55 minutes on this game, which I dread, and I managed to barely play 2 matches. This game was very disapointing, I reccomend you spend your money on Left 4 Dead 1 & 2 if you want a similar game that is much better.			"

												This game is a breath of fresh air among a horde or zombie games coming out these days. Although in beta I find this game very playable and extremely fun! Once you get into it there is no turning back. The Hunter (free for all) mode is fantastic and can be VERY intense! This intensity of trying not to make a sound because you hear another survivor close by, but there is a zombie headed towards you, do you shoot your gun? Then everyone will hear where you are. Do you run? Other players might see you or hear you and follow your movements. Often you have very little time to make critical decisions in order to survive. These moments can be wonderfully terrifying and make the game in my opinion. Cant wait for more updates!! (holiday update is great!)			"

												Contagion is a fun objective based zombie survival game. Minus some initial issues with crashing to the desktop before getting into the game, I'd recommend it heartily. The game rewards good observation skills and keen awareness of your surroundings. There are a couple issues with odd animations when the zombies get in close to attack or when they go to climb over something, but the sound quality is very good including some background noise such as far off gunshots, which is hard to mistake for gunshots within the map that you're playing. Good job on the sounds. The zombies sound eerie and when they spot you, you'll know it. Ammo is spread around the maps, and is sparse, but luckily, there are some decent melee weapons.For people who want to compare this to Left 4 Dead, I'd say it's a bit more easy going, but just as scary even without ""special"" infected. The maps objectives and loot is randomized throughout the map, so check your corners and behind desks because there are some surprises occasionally in the form of ammo and weapons.Multiplayer requires cooperation. Those people who run and gun getting all the loot will find themselves alone soon with the players that die taking over spots as zombies. More than a few times I was surprised by a zombie while I was going to check a dark room and it turned out a player who had died was waiting for someone. It's worth the full price of the game, although I got it at the steam sale for half off. I'd recommend it as a well thought out zombie survival game.			"

												While Contagion may sound like another generic FPS with tons of zombies, it has much more to offer.Contagion is developed by Monochrome LLC, the same guys who previously created Zombie Panic: Source (you probably know that one). Game's Source based but don't get all disappointed - the graphics still look pretty amazing for a Source game, as obviously effort was put into that. This doesn't mean that the game isn't optimized - I personally didn't have any lag spikes due to the maps not being optimized, and I could play on max graphics with a Radeon HD 4850. This doesn't mean that your grandma's computer will be able to run this, though - the graphics do take their toll on your hardware.The game has Workshop support as well, making customizing the game as easy as never before. It also has an SDK for those guys who know how to release skins for Source games and such ;)Contagion takes place in some sort of global zombie apocalypse event, in a city called Roanoke or something. There are a few gamemodes in this game, probably the highlight of all of those is the Escape gamemode. It's a co-op multiplayer gamemode which supports up to 4 players in a match. The premise of this gamemode is that you have to wander around the map to find the exit, but it isn't your simple hit n' run match - maps are usually randomized, that means that there is more than one possible way to complete the game, that gets chosen while the map loads. So if you beat the map once, don't expect the second time you play it to be the exact same - you will have to find a new path. The maps are fairly large as well, you'll spend probably an hour on each map.The downside to the stuff I wrote above is that there are 2 maps at this very moment which actually support the Escape gamemode. There might be more made by other people, but I didn't look into it.Another gamemode which I really liked was Hunted - that gamemode has 4 maps, which I won't spoil. The premise of that gamemode is pretty simple - only one human must survive. This gamemode supports up to 8 players, which randomly spawn around the map. You look for supplies, guns, anything useful and attempt to hunt down the other players. The map is still full of zombies though, so you will have two things to worry about - the zombies and the other players sneaking behind you and killing you when you are completely unaware. Trust me, that happens a lot ;)Now this game offers some more gamemodes, such as Extraction, but I didn't look into them as well - just those two gamemodes I mentioned before are more than enough for this game already, but it's nice to know the developers added even more to accomodate to different tastes.When I got the game, it was just a few days after release, so lots of updates and bugfixes were being pumped out, which really made me angry. Not the fact that you had to download the updates - the fact that the official servers had to be updated as well, which usually took a long time and you had no choice but to host a server yourself because you can't play anywhere...So, the final word; should you buy this game?YES.

												A bloody scary survival experience! Contagion has you working closely with your teammates to complete various objectives. The catch is the hardcore combat style against zombies controlled by human players. Use ammo sparingly, aim for the head and listen to your surroundings very closely. One of the best zombie multiplayer games since Left 4 dead. 8/10!			"

												While I do reccomend this game in steam I do say it comes with the caveat  that only fairly expierenced gamers should get this one. This game is a okay game for some one to mess around with but is really not a good game for begginners due to it's issues.   It  needs serious map improvements as well as user interface improvemnts. Some maps are litterally truncated and should be under  a different catagory than they were assigned. it is good that like Left 4 Dead and its sequel Left 4 Dead 2 there are different catagories of missoin types but the types are confusing and mislabled for some missions such as los muertos escape and the stone creek escape where it is basically a hold out mission with a limited map rather that a challenging map with different destinations and puzzles like in other missions of the same catagory. How ever that being said the other missions are fairly challenging and fun the only real problem with them is the extreemly overwhelming haord attacks at the end of the missions. The game has been updated recently with new content which I have not yet played and do not yet know about but will play and then update this review so give it a look see any way if you want. Now having played the new content I do like the game better though the weapons and items inventory still sucks, being only able to hold four items at once is not really conducive to good game play. It would be better if you could hold more items although the limit to the amount of weapons does make game play more challengeing and interesting.			"

												I enjoyed this game a lot. It stood out as a fun, realistic, zombie game. But after a while, I got bored of the content that it had and left it for a while.Then I got a few friends and played it a few years later. This game is an amazing coop experience. Multiple times, after failing or winning an escape map or extraction, me and my friends will just sit there and just talk about parts where it looked like it was ripped straight from some zombie movie. The best thing is, they weren't really scripted to be just like that. The power wasn't scripted to turn on so we were able to run away right when the horde got close to us, it just happened. This game, the atmosphere, the teamwork, the constant struggle of ammunition and weapons, it feels like a zombie movie. Long story short, I really enjoy it, especially with friends. The only downsides I have is that the voice acting can ruin some people's immersion and atmosphere. It's not bad, I love it, but some people may not think so. Especially when you can constantly scream, ""LETS WAIT AND BARRICADE HERE"" when you're literally in the middle of the street. And, it does have it's fair share of bugs. Not too bad, but... ye			"

												Here we are for Contagion ! A game developed since 2005 if I remember, ok so I will be fast because the game is very very very short. There is five missions, the principal mission is in cooperation (you need to escape to a prison), one mission is called extraction (you need to protect a survivor until he escaped), and the three other are make for kill other players and you can be bored after 2 hours of gameplay (it's my case by the way)The good things are: there is not a lot of glitches (I found some but I'm a pro for this lol), and the gameplay is optimised (I have a very bad computer and I can play without any freeze or something like this) The bad things are: the game can be annoying when you tried all the missions, the new map is weird (there is some places than you can be sure you can enter but no) and the coop mission is glitched sometime.My final verdict is a 7/10 because except the game life, the game is very fun and the ""Hunted"" (PvP) mod are cool to play.

												This game brings the old zombie flair back in which you have to hide and fear the zombies. (not like the Action-Zombiegames like boring Left for Dead 2) Work together with others or go your single way through the many maps. In the maps there are houses e.g. in which you can find useful things like weapons or you can just barricade yourself against a zombie onslaught with planks.If you die, you spawn as Zombie and can also control several beasts at your command. TL:DR Great game buy it for fast fun and if you start it you can just start without any big learning curve! Worth the money absolutely.Played it for 10 hours now and it is still much fun to play!TIP: Always aim for the head, may it be zombie or human! LORD TYWIN HAS SPOKEN, FOLK.			"

Baught this a while ago and didn't play it for a while but started playing again and now i am hooked especially on pvp. Just a few things most people without mics will not hesitate to kill you but people with will mostly team. Also can get a bit annoying when you die.

												this game is quite fantastic. more akin to the original style of zombies started so long ago by George Romero, the zombies in here as slow (most the time) and hard-hitting enemies. sometimes plentiful, and always dangerous, even the small hordes hold great threat to you and your friends. to kill one, its best to shoot once in the head to conserve ammunition, otherwise, you arent doing very much against them. the maps are all randomly generated, giving you different experiences each time. the maps are pretty damn big too, and take a long time to complete, so you definitely have plenty of stuff to play through.the game is, however, quite difficult to play on your own, and not much fun either. that is a downside to me, as most the time, i prefer to play on my own if not playing with a friend. regardless, i still strongly recommend this game, especially if you enjoy the more tense and difficult type of zombies and an eerie atmosphere, instead of the crazed, adrenaline rush Left 4 Dead zombies			"

The once who doesn't make it will become zombies are try to hunt the people that are still alive and those who are alive can even shoot eachother.Great small game worthe the buy and like me I think you will enjoy it.

In hunted mode you fight not only against zombies, but also other survivors. Maps are big, and also very climatic. You can hide inside house's bathroom, and hear people getting killed on the street, and the you hear that they broke the door to your house, and they're coming to get you :D I really reccomend it. There is also free patch coming soon adding new maps, mode, charachters, and weapons!			"

												Awesome Zombie shooting fun with a different pace to L4d or Cod Zombies!This started off as the half life mod Zombie Panic... then Zombie Panic Source followed and finally this stand alone offering named Contagion.The most played game mode is hunted, where every survivor is spawned randomly accross a map and last man standing wins. One player will be randomly chosen as a zombie and each survivor who dies (from the zombies or other surviors) becomes a Zombie. Players can work together, gather guns and supplies, barricade doors and even Text each others phones to give away thier locations!!! Its really edge of your seat stuff especially as the survivors die and you are one of the last few left, everyone is out to get you as you make your final stand!You can also get a group together and take on a pre set mission map with various objectives to solve and NPC zombies to kill, these can be very hard on the harder settings as ammo is sparse and the zombies lurk round every corner.

												This a load of junk. I played this during the free weekend deal, and I wish I didn't. This is an awful game, it's a generic zombie coop game similar to left 4 dead. You check objectives with your phone (ya know, that thing a bazillion other games haven't done) and complete them. There are several gametypes, though I wouldnt be able to tell you which ones are which as I only remember escape and extraction. The others are basic PVP and PVE unlimited round survival games, that much I know. Escape has you follow a set of objectives to get to the end, and extraction...has you follow a set of objectives to get to the end and escape..? I didn't play for long, but I could NOT tell the diffrence between extraction and escape, both were similar and boring. And also, this game looks hideous. Not gonna pull any punches, this game is ugly. Textures look muggy, animation is stiff, the models look like they were pulled straight outta some zombie mod from GMOD, sometimes models overlayed themselves over some textures (Example: a fire extinguisher popping out behind solid glass) and for whatever reason this game has tons of lens flares which make the game IMPOSSIBLE to play. The reason being is in order to check your objectives, you have to check your phone. But because of the lens flares, you can't read your objectives, and if you can't read your objectives, then what the hell are you gonna do? Delete this game from your account. 1/10, only because the game didn't seem to buggy. Not sure about that though, you might wanna check some of the other reviews.			"

												Terrible game.  I read one of the positive reviews and wonder what game they played.  This game is confusing and glitchy.  The cell phone, which gives you your missions, had text that was too large for its screen, so I ended up with only a quarter or less of the goal description, which was useless.I spawned (twice) in a building that had no way out.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt and searched for a key or something to open the outside doors, and after about an hour of searching, gave up and disconnected.  It wasn't even that big a building.  Even if there WAS a way out, a good game doesn't have you sitting around with nothing to do for an hour.Buttons would sometimes not do what they were supposed to.  Once I ran out of ammo, and it wouldn't let me melee.  What is worse, when you do melee, it feels like your just slapping the zombie.  If I was gonna hit a zombie, I'd hit the zombie hard enough to knock it over or break something.  In the game, I hit a zombie over and over and over, and it never got knocked back, and it never died.  Finally a teammate found me and shot it.Someone mentioned how much fun it was to not have much ammo.  Well, I got stuck without ammo on a ladder with zombies at the top, and I couldn't get them out of the way.  These zombies finally discovered the perfect strategy.  Just swallow the ammo and stand on the ladders, and there's no way they'll ever escape.If this game has any hope of being a fun experience, they've got a lot of work to do.  It isn't exciting.  It isn't scary.  It isn't fun.  What were they hoping the game would be?  And why have a free weekend when the game is in such a terrible state?I'll follow this up by saying that the game may have some redeeming qualities that I didn't see.  I didn't play much, and won't be coming back, so I may have missed the best it has to offer.  But with so many excellent games out there... I don't see how they can balance out the hours of unexplained, empty, lonely exploration that concluded in exiting to desktop.			"

												Wan dropped his gun trying to give me some ammo and couldn't find it again. So we met our grisly end while trying to batter zombies to death with keys and a phone. While this probably doesn't speak well of us, credit where it's due for realism.Update!: Not recommended due to lack of working multi-player.  But recommended for the key/phone thing.			"

												It's not worth twenty dollars, or even five dollars. It feels like every other free to play zombie game out right now, but at substantially less of a quality. The peak amount of players being around thirty to fourty people should tell you enough. I can see this game being a good mod or f2p, but not a good pay to play game. If you want a better zombie game, check out No more room in hell, or zombie panic source.			"

There is only a few things you won't like but you'll respect why the developers made that choice at the same time. Also if you do happen to buy this game, be sure to submit bugs, things that seem unbalanced, etc... so the developers can make this game extremely well done. It gets better literally every update!

												Yes highly recomend its very fun to play with friends , and its a cool game. If you like this i would also recomend Day-Z . It has better graphics. Back to contagion xD . So i hope yall read this . Contagion is like diffrent objectives . My favorite is escape i like to kick zombie butt ,  but you find diffrent weppons , get the amo or ma favorite get the sniper long distance , or get axe it takes a while till you hit the zm witht he axe buut a hit on the head saves amo :D and head shot kills with axe. So Contagion basicly if you die your a zm. So you kill all the humans is the zm's  objective . The humans it depends wich game type your on . So  I hope you love contagion if you get it !			"

												this game was good when it 1st came out, i played it some felt it was very good for what it is a Zombie Survival FPS and played it on and off for well over a year now, i recently picked it up again and i can definately see improvements, i find it to be the perfect George A Romero Zombie Game just like The Walking Dead it's slow moving Zombies but dont let that fool you, you can get overwhelmed in a second if you try and pick off Zombies at a distance they will hear you and come at you from all directions, it's the type of game that at times you under estimate a Hordes ability to get to you even thou some are slow walking type, you also have some that are kind off slow jogging and some even try to kind of flank you, so they are not as easy a target as you would think especialy at the harder setting, in games like L4D 1 and 2 they are of the faster 28 days/weeks later type of infected/dead/mutations you always have your guard up, this game however is contantly switching it up, great game as is and beats out most or all of those $60 full price game			"

												Poor old Contagion gets bashed a bit, but I adore it!Now, it's not perfect. Sometimes the puzzles can be a bit fiddly especially for new players and I personally am not a fan of player zombies, although it can be fun on occasion. One can always just choose other modes or customisations though.Overall though, I find the game wonderfully atmospheric, immersive, intelligent, convincing and probably my favourite co-operative game I have ever played. Genuinely scares me quite regularly, and very few games do. Just the right pace - not too fast, not too slow.A brilliant title. I got it for about £4 but I would have probably paid up to £20 for it at this point in time, maybe more simply because NO OTHER GAME DOES WHAT IT DOES THIS WELL! Or at least none that I've ever played!Wonderful stuff :)			"

												Whenever you think of Contagion as a player that has played source games/mods for a long time its like Zombie Panic: Source. Not like a copy I guess, I mean its pretty good but usually without friends it will become very dull very quickly. But with the gamemodes it adds some more gameplay I guess you could say. Its a well made game and I would buy it if your friends are willing as well.			"

												I am surprised this game is in it's finished form. I did a LAN with 5 other people and to begin with, the game was fun. However, when a player dies and the mission continues, those that are dead are either turned into a zombie (hopefully), or turned into a cockcoach to help other players navigate the rest of the map like a scout. however, players can squish the cockroach and once they do, that player is dead and has to sit and wait until everyone else either wins or loses. At one point, I was ""infected"" and turned on the spot. It was a cool mechanic, but I had NO idea how I became infected or what the prerequisite is for turning into a zombie. I want to turn into a zombie if I die with friends!! Prepare to sit and wait patiently after you die.

												The best zombie game I have played. Character movements, sounds, and lighting are the best I have witnessed. The amount of blood and gore in the game is fantastic and realistic-like. But, that's where it ends.Pretty much everything else about this game is not great. The amount of maps and game modes is poor, boring and repetitive. You could complete this game within a couple of hours of playing. This is where I was severely disappointed, for a great game, not enough effort was put into map making, game mode making, etc. I believe the community needs to get more involved and make player based maps,  so that we can broaden our entertainment purposes. This game is similar to Left for Dead 2, but in my opinion, much better. It's just too bad that the developers did not follow on with what Left 4 Dead did, and make player based maps, and hold competitions to who could make the best map. I would rate this game 10/10. But this the content that it is lacking, I would lower it down to a 5/10. This game isn't worth $20.			"

												Survivors vs Zombies gameplay is fun but gets old quick if stuck on the same map with no cycling. It is a $$ knockoff of the FREE Zombie Panic! Source mod on Steam:I would only recommend this game if it were free or had significant overhaul/expansion of features to explain the price increase from a free mod. Some constructive criticism for the devs based on my gameplay experience follows: -Zombies get tired? No ranged attack? WTFrack?? Get rid of the stamina guage for the Zombie run or use it instead for a spit attack (minor damage+chance to infect+momentary blurred vision?). The undead don't tire, but it does take time to cough up more corruption+parasites from their dead lungs. Make it an unlock if you think Zombies with ranged weapon is unbalanced - refillable only by devouring Surviors perhaps (minor health gain)?-Insanely difficult to track down survivors on the larger maps as a zombie, especially if you are new to a map and don't know the layout. The pathing/tracking blood sight system needs to be improved badly.-Royal Pain to sneak up on anyone as a zombie, especially with the constant moaning an groaning. Maybe limit the noise zombies make to only when they are attacking and/or running quickly. It should be much easier to get one good stealth bite in and would definitely increase the suspense factor.-Remove the Nail Gun + Boards or make them easier to use. Easier currently to just defend an area yourself than board it up, as it is very non-intuitive.-Survivors should be able to scale fences just like Zombies, faster even but using their stamina meter, same as jumping or running. Very annoying when the undead are climbing over fences and cars but you cannot. Other option is to take away Zombie ability to scale anything and instead allow them to knock fences down especially when zombie buddies helping, similar to the destructible doors.-The physics engine felt blocky with most of the movement - maybe smooth it out? I don't know if collision can be tweaked, but I found myself frequently getting snagged on corner of cars, buildings, dumpsters, etc. Definitely breaks the mood when you are running someone down or trying to run from a horde.-No anti-camping mechanism. All roofs should have multiple access points but do not currently. Zombie spit attack (see above) would also help with this. The other option would be to make all survivors spawn in an infected state with life steadily decreasing. When it hits zero, they die and turn. Obviously you would have to have more med kits and/or food/drink items laying about to counteract this. It would add a definite sense of urgency to scavenging items besides ammo.-Headshotting zombies is a guaranteed one-shot kill. The only difficulty with this is the zombies which have broken necks or otherwise move their head down or to the side when shambling about - also the riot gear zombies. Grappling+biting survivors should be a guaranteed infection to balance things out. Didn't seem to be the case.-Nothing sucks worse than running from a horde shrieking like a lil girl because you have no weapon with which to defend yourself. Sometimea your teammate is hogging all the drops or just got to them first because you're new to the map. More variety and availability of improvised weapons would take care of this problem - ie screwdrivers, broom handle, ice pick, meat cleaver, molotovs, hairspray+lighter, etc. There should be an improvised weapon in almost every room if you looked closely enough. This doesn't mean they cannot be depleted, snap off in or get lodged in a zombie carcass, forcing you to obtain another. This increases the need to scavenge.-Plenty of weapons in game, but I'd like to see more, so long as they are not too similar to existing weapons - ie flamethrowers, katanas, crossbows, etc. Permanent weapon mods/unlocks such as extended mags, flash supressors, vertical foregrips, silencers, laser sights, extra magnifcation scopes, etc would be awesome but should be rare finds or purchased DLC unlocks. Also more ammo types per weapon - ie hollow points or shotgun slugs to blow thru the SWAT zombies.-Varying reach and delay for different melee weapons. It felt as if all melee attacks were pretty much the same and equally susceptible to getting your arm chewed off. Only thing that seemed to help was higher ground and timing. Close quarters should be knives and Grapple+Bite only (quickest). Everything else requres room+time to swing and thus 1-2 meters more reach. Also additional effects such as block, knockback, dazed or impaired runspeed dependant on what was struck by which weapon. Zombies don't feel pain but they lose limbs fairly easily. Its all that corruptive rot setting in.I did enjoy the few flaming zombies I saw, but did not get to see how long they could last running about like that - they caught a round to the head far too quickly. Saved my assault rifle ammo for when I ran into SWAT zombies or all my other ammo ran dry. Also got infected twice and the blurred vision was a good indication I was turning. IMHO it should be more nauseating and/or disgusting to watch them turn, within the existing ESRB rating ofc.  Chance to infect seemed random but may have been based on how many times I was gnawed on.			"

The tutorials could have been more obvious and there should have been some sort of indication if you were supposed to be getting somewhere other than just walking around killing zombies.I did enjoy getting to bash zombie heads in with a wrench and stabbing them with a knife.

												The cinematic was interesting - but that's about it.  In terms of game play, you mostly play as a zombie since you get killed so easily by zombs (cpu or player controlled).  The game feels broken and the maps are just plain boring.  Don't bother - save your money, it's not even worth it when it's on sale.			"

												I do not recomend this game, the graphics suck, the engine is buggy and it is horibly unbalanced. If you are looking for a good co op zombie survival game with a good engine, good graphics and an intresting variety of maps i would recomend ""No More Room in Hell"". This game is an obvious rip off that charges 20 $ for an expirance you can get else where for free.			"

												Hated it. I loved Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2 but this just seemed like a really bad copy of it. I was looking foward to playing this since the trailer intrigued me so much, the characters were okay, but the gameplay was awful. I used a Xbox 360 controller, and I couldn't turn to my right or left, it worked on my other games, and I was struggling to find out what controls were on the keyboard that worked since there wasn't a tutorial. The lagg was a big issue, since I couldn't even move because of it (I turned down all the quality, hoping that the performance would be faster, however it only changed a bit.) The people online were sexist, racist and very offensive. All my favourite characters has been picked since I was too late because of the loading time. I've had no problems with my other games (which consist of: Resident Evil 6, Killing Floor, Left 4 Dead 2 and more.) I spent 55 minutes on this game, which I dread, and I managed to barely play 2 matches. This game was very disapointing, I reccomend you spend your money on Left 4 Dead 1 & 2 if you want a similar game that is much better.			"

												If you love zombies, if you love player co-ops and pvp, if you love challenge then this game is for you.First time around the game will kick you hard, specially player versus player. Playing a co-op scenario but your teamates or you losed focus? You are all gonna be zombie chow.Making too much noise and not saving ammo?You are all gonna be a Human buffet.One of you is a jerk and didn't say when he got infected?You are all gonna be dead... if you are lucky.Definetly a great game for zombie lovers.

												An absolute blast to play - and manages to breathe some life into an otherwise stale genre.Who would have thought another Zombie based game had anything to offer, but it truly does and brings back ""Zombie Survival Horror"" in a way that best compares with George A. Romeros classic Zombie movies.Yes, there are still bugs (after all it is an early access), but despite of this, it's still an absolutely brilliant game with lot of tension and plenty of opportunity for excellent co-op gameplay.HIGHLY recommended! At full price it's a bargain; at sale price it's an absolute steal!			"

Havent seen any of that ""survival"" crap, no fortress building and stuffSeriously this look like an alpha...i wish i could refund my money.			"

												I wish I could get my money back, this game is realy stupid.Zombies can wlk trough doors and walls. Sometime they just fall out of the sky, and you can't do anything but die.Way to much ammo, but no medical kits or something like that.There are more games like this out there and most way better. Graphics are realy old, and there are only a few maps, who keep repeating themselfs.I wanted to try a multiplayer, but there no players around...My advise, think twice before you spend any money on this game.

												Really fun and entertaining zombie game. Unlike many others the zombies actually ""feel"" real. They shamble through the streets, heads bobbing around like maniacs as they slowly pace toward you, making those headshots more difficult than one would imagine. Completely ignoring bullets as they rip through their arms and legs, as it has no effect other than waying their arm slightly. If you want the kill, you're going to have to get that perfect headshot.They stupidly wander aimlessly, only beginning the chase once you've alerted them by sprinting through the streets or firing like a maniac. Smashing through doors and barricades with their bleeding arms, lacking the mental capacity to use door knobs. The zombies definitely have a life-like, or rather, un-life-like quality that makes them very appealing.But the zombies aren't the only threat. Aside from the co-op ""Extraction"" and ""Escape"" game modes, ""Hunted"" brings one of the most exciting and dynamic pvp experiences. Because unlike other games, being shot down doesn't just end your life, it brings on a new one. The hunt continues as you stalk the humans from the shadows as a newly made zombie. As a human you scavenge for weapons and supplies on the spot, compulsively checking your phone for nearby survivors, or player zombies. You can run guns ablaze through the streets, hoping to run into il-prepared survivors, or barricade a house of your own and take your last stand. Shooting through windows at other survivors or battling an onslaught of zombies as they swarm their way up the stairs or bashing down the door to the room you've taken shelter in.Overall it's a great game and I strongly recommen it. However, a Mic is basically a must. While not so much if you fly solo on Hunted, but the co-op modes desperately require coordination and team work, as a well-crrafted co-op game should. Definitely better with friends. Teaming up with them as securing a house together as you battle off the undead is some of the most fun I've had in a multiplayer game.The only downside to this game is the lack of content. Which can be expected from an early-access game. There's only 3 maps as of yet, 1 of which is used in 2 of the game modes. But with steam workshop support in the works, user maps and mods, that will soon be a thing of the past. But it doesn't require that. The devs are still very much working on the game and supplying new content.Well worth the price. I'm already over 30hours of gametime and it has yet to lose it's luster. At $15, this game is a steal.8/10			"

												The game is amazing. I first bought it during the beta, I didnt play it that much but now, with the workshop added and a free DLC came out, this game is really good. The game has a single-player and multiplayer. you can play this game on lan too. The graphics are good, sounds in-game are good aswell, and if you get bored of looking at the usual gun skins, you can go into the workshop and get new playermodel skins, gun skins, melee skins, and even custom maps if you get bored of the ones you have. Overall this game was amazing and it still is. But that is my opinion. You can go on youtube and watch gameplay but this game wont be a waste of $20.0011/10 Would kill, Die, kill, tea bag player controlled zombies again, then kill again.			"

												This game should be free to play on steam i dont understand why it cost money, it dosent worth not even 1 euro. Because:1.The graphics are like from 2004(10 years old graphincs like half life 2\that was a very good game/)2.And the most scamming thing ever is that this game is a copy-paste of ''No More Room In Hell'' mod witch is free 2 play and is even better then this.3.There is no storyline or a good single player campaing(like in the old ''Land of the Dead'' game, if they would made a good story on a single player campaign(not just random missions) i think maybe would worth more then 1 euro, like 10 euros but not 20 euros in eny cases.4.The lack of missions, the primitive missions and the lack of info(the cell phone is not enaugh) about what u have 2 do(u just wonder around for hours trying 2 find the ''switch'' to advance.Cuz of these 4 aspects i do not recommend this game(why to spend 20 euros on a game thats looks unfinisht and is more like an alpha mod then a real game, instead u can just install ''No More Room In Hell'' mod witch is free and is the same thing even better.And now what i liked about this game: First: The main soundtracks lol... music is very important when it comes to zombies xD(no realy a good soundtrack and sound in general make 70% of a game on been good)And second: KIllling zombies is always fun(even if this game sucks game lol i mean an unfinisht alpha mod)---with other words this is a scam---			"

												I've played many games over the years, especially zombie games, so I have allot of experience of this genre, I found games like left4dead and Killing Floor allot of fun and worth my money, so you will understand when I say the following.Do not buy this game, no matter how cheap! This is the most basic Zombie shooter, it is less fun and has less content than Killing Floor or Left4dead, it does ""NOTHING"" new, there is zero innovation here, this is a shooter made to ride on the cash train created by better Zombie games.Dead Island even which I don't rate super highly is a diamond compaired to this game.To sum up this game, you go around corridors of a city, not able to enter most buildings, having a really hard time getting ammo, to shoot a few basic crappy guns, the zombies are nothing special and you will get bored with this game unless you have never played a zombie shooter before.I'd write more and go into the out of date graphics, the monotonous gameplay, the vagueness of the missions and the corridor streets of boring, but it isn't worth my time or yours.There are better games out there, do not bother with this lazy shell of a game.

												SUCKS BIG TIME. Could have been something awesome but turned into a poorly copied left for dead clone. Linear maps with no explorabilitly, poor character handling, simulated restrictions to mimick real life setbacks are just there to get in the way not challenge you. All these things could have been put to the side for more team oriented play and better rewarding gameplay when completing a mission. The game avertises about ""realism"" but offers no character development and no true reason to press on. The only interesting thing to mention is the multiplayer gives you a chance to become a zombie and that seems to be the most fleshed out part of the entire game.			"

The pvp is okay as long as you play with a good group of people/friends. Now, the coop on the other hand......Don't even get me started..... That's what brings this game down.....It needs alot of work...ALOT!!!! Thats all I'm going to say because I don't want to end up going into a rant like I do with most of my negative reviews....

The 3-5 missions are very easy with very little challenge the map will change just a little bit, like the keys will change placement from a room to an other, the commiunlty is very dull and dumb, that is if there even is a community not many people play this game at all. but why should they you can get (No more room in hell) for free and it offers more fun than this game. the Dev group rarly update this game at all every three months there is a bug fix even is there is a game breaking bug,  to end this Review I would say do not get this game its not worth it, just get no more room in hell its much better and free :D			"

												I have been playing the game since it came out on Steam and since Alpha it hasn't changed a whole lot in my opinion. Sure there are more maps and most of the bugs an glitches that were there in January have been removed but it could have been a whole lot more.The Engine supports large campaign-style maps but is poorly optimised. The zombies in this game are actually pretty lethal so be careful not to make too much noise or you may find yourself surrounded by the undead! It has good balanced gameplay elements for the casual gamer. If it could be any better it is if had more content and mod support. Overall it is a fun little first person zombie shooter more suited to groups of friends than people you do not know.			"

												There's nothing necessarily terrible about Contagion, it's just soooooo generic. Generic maps, generic weapons, generic 'characters,' (if you can even call them that,) and generic enviroments. Maybe it's worth $5, but $20?! Hell no.			"

												A game released from early access... that still looks like it's in early access.Picked this up on sale 75% off and even then it's only just worth it, what's wrong, well:1) It doesn't look great, source engine may be old but it can still be beautiful, unfortunately this game is not an example, it's hard to put my finger on it, but all the environments feel too ""clean"", they look pristine, in fact, so much so they don't look real, especially for an apocalypse.2) The guns, they all feel like toys, cannot tell the difference between any of the pistols, the shotguns have really stupid damage (point blank to the chest wouldn't flat out kill you?) and are buggy and the sniper scope is near impossible to use.3) It really doesn't feel finished, you can do dumb stuff like run a long fences, the zombie climbing mechanic can never make it's mind up whether you can climb that thing - and will allow you to climb out of the map, and movement feels clunky. As an added bonus, as I found when launching the dedicated server, one of the things it printed to console was ""Map is missing dictionary - DON'T SHIP LIKE THIS"", even the developers don't seem to think it's finished.4) The gamemodes - Hunted just turns into free for all, Escape (I think) is just like nazi zombies but with a vending machine that randomly spits stuff out and you all end up running out of ammo, then there's another one which is ""lead the AI around"" and then there's another one which I don't even remember so it must be great. 5) The phone, pretty much a gimmic, being able to ring people in hunted is good, but beyond that it just feels shoehorned in, in some missions you get to use it as a map, why not all? The game really needs one! Each time I spawn I have no idea where I am, most times because I'm in the dark.Redeeming features: If you like L4D and got bored of it then you'll probably like this for a couple of days until the four maps get repetitive - more are coming though as free DLC (DLC or 'finishing off the game'?)Oh and the English is really terrible in places and it behaves really weirdly with a controller.TL:DR Pick it up for less than £5, no more.EDIT: Proof on issue 3 - http://i.imgur.com/6Td7w0E.png "

Donc tu te ramasse plus à essayer dsurvivre en tuant des zombies nono en essayant drejoindre tes friends que d'avoir du fun en gang!.. et quand tu finis de les rejoindre.. tu te rend compte que tu n'as plus de balles et que tu peux rien faire tu peux même pas les fesser avec un bat ou de quoi du genre...

When co-op is so important, and you don't wanna get your expirience ruined by randoms, on its lagging, damn servers. Not enough maps, dumb optimalization, bugs. Yeah. Hell of a game. Also, nobody seems playing anything except this Hunted (pvp) mode. Co-op indeed.			"

												This game is a beta, and it sure feels that way.options re blacked out, there's only a few maps, and to my knowledge, there's no particular objective to some of the maps/game modes. The aiming, AI, and weapons are all a little rough. Headshots sometimes don't register, and AI are invulnerable when walking into waist high fences. But other than that, I enjoyed this.It's a zombie game. You shoot them, you look for ammo, you get necrophillia again (whilst staring at undead boobage)Anyways, looking into a non closed-minded viewpoint, this game is great. It has a LOT of potential, and I'll love to see what the devs do. Because I sure as hell will be eagerly awaiting whatever comes at me.I like horses.			"

												Here we are for Contagion ! A game developed since 2005 if I remember, ok so I will be fast because the game is very very very short. There is five missions, the principal mission is in cooperation (you need to escape to a prison), one mission is called extraction (you need to protect a survivor until he escaped), and the three other are make for kill other players and you can be bored after 2 hours of gameplay (it's my case by the way)The good things are: there is not a lot of glitches (I found some but I'm a pro for this lol), and the gameplay is optimised (I have a very bad computer and I can play without any freeze or something like this) The bad things are: the game can be annoying when you tried all the missions, the new map is weird (there is some places than you can be sure you can enter but no) and the coop mission is glitched sometime.My final verdict is a 7/10 because except the game life, the game is very fun and the ""Hunted"" (PvP) mod are cool to play.

Romeros classic Zombie movies.Yes, there are still bugs (after all it is an early access), but despite of this, it's still an absolutely brilliant game with lot of tension and plenty of opportunity for excellent co-op gameplay.HIGHLY recommended!

												While I do reccomend this game in steam I do say it comes with the caveat  that only fairly expierenced gamers should get this one. This game is a okay game for some one to mess around with but is really not a good game for begginners due to it's issues.   It  needs serious map improvements as well as user interface improvemnts. Some maps are litterally truncated and should be under  a different catagory than they were assigned. it is good that like Left 4 Dead and its sequel Left 4 Dead 2 there are different catagories of missoin types but the types are confusing and mislabled for some missions such as los muertos escape and the stone creek escape where it is basically a hold out mission with a limited map rather that a challenging map with different destinations and puzzles like in other missions of the same catagory. How ever that being said the other missions are fairly challenging and fun the only real problem with them is the extreemly overwhelming haord attacks at the end of the missions. The game has been updated recently with new content which I have not yet played and do not yet know about but will play and then update this review so give it a look see any way if you want. Now having played the new content I do like the game better though the weapons and items inventory still sucks, being only able to hold four items at once is not really conducive to good game play. It would be better if you could hold more items although the limit to the amount of weapons does make game play more challengeing and interesting.			"

												I enjoyed this game a lot. It stood out as a fun, realistic, zombie game. But after a while, I got bored of the content that it had and left it for a while.Then I got a few friends and played it a few years later. This game is an amazing coop experience. Multiple times, after failing or winning an escape map or extraction, me and my friends will just sit there and just talk about parts where it looked like it was ripped straight from some zombie movie. The best thing is, they weren't really scripted to be just like that. The power wasn't scripted to turn on so we were able to run away right when the horde got close to us, it just happened. This game, the atmosphere, the teamwork, the constant struggle of ammunition and weapons, it feels like a zombie movie. Long story short, I really enjoy it, especially with friends. The only downsides I have is that the voice acting can ruin some people's immersion and atmosphere. It's not bad, I love it, but some people may not think so. Especially when you can constantly scream, ""LETS WAIT AND BARRICADE HERE"" when you're literally in the middle of the street. And, it does have it's fair share of bugs. Not too bad, but... ye			"

			Contagion isn't your average Zombie Shooter but instead takes a more realistic and different approach to the popular genre with unique characters, environments, weapons, items, and a built in system...

												Really fun and entertaining zombie game. Unlike many others the zombies actually ""feel"" real. They shamble through the streets, heads bobbing around like maniacs as they slowly pace toward you, making those headshots more difficult than one would imagine. Completely ignoring bullets as they rip through their arms and legs, as it has no effect other than waying their arm slightly. If you want the kill, you're going to have to get that perfect headshot.They stupidly wander aimlessly, only beginning the chase once you've alerted them by sprinting through the streets or firing like a maniac. Smashing through doors and barricades with their bleeding arms, lacking the mental capacity to use door knobs. The zombies definitely have a life-like, or rather, un-life-like quality that makes them very appealing.But the zombies aren't the only threat. Aside from the co-op ""Extraction"" and ""Escape"" game modes, ""Hunted"" brings one of the most exciting and dynamic pvp experiences. Because unlike other games, being shot down doesn't just end your life, it brings on a new one. The hunt continues as you stalk the humans from the shadows as a newly made zombie. As a human you scavenge for weapons and supplies on the spot, compulsively checking your phone for nearby survivors, or player zombies. You can run guns ablaze through the streets, hoping to run into il-prepared survivors, or barricade a house of your own and take your last stand. Shooting through windows at other survivors or battling an onslaught of zombies as they swarm their way up the stairs or bashing down the door to the room you've taken shelter in.Overall it's a great game and I strongly recommen it. However, a Mic is basically a must. While not so much if you fly solo on Hunted, but the co-op modes desperately require coordination and team work, as a well-crrafted co-op game should. Definitely better with friends. Teaming up with them as securing a house together as you battle off the undead is some of the most fun I've had in a multiplayer game.The only downside to this game is the lack of content. Which can be expected from an early-access game. There's only 3 maps as of yet, 1 of which is used in 2 of the game modes. But with steam workshop support in the works, user maps and mods, that will soon be a thing of the past. But it doesn't require that. The devs are still very much working on the game and supplying new content.Well worth the price. I'm already over 30hours of gametime and it has yet to lose it's luster. At $15, this game is a steal.8/10			"

If a zombie can climb a fence so can can I  :) Where are the sound suppressors? Overall this is a unique zombie apoc game and I recomend it  :)			"

												Bought this on a sale with my partner a while ago and we love it. We have been looking for co-op zombie orientated games  and for us this game is brilliant. The map selection is small but what makes it fresh is that locations change, while some doors will be open one time the next they will be blocked up and you'll have to find alternate paths or alternate items to progress. It would be nice for more maps to be added in the future though.Gameplay is great, I feel it's as realistic as it can be in a zombie apocalypse in which if a crowd finds you, you will be overwhelmed which means you need to form tactics with a partner or solo, the way that the zombies only really die by headshots is also brilliant while difficult when first getting into the game but it becomes easier in time. The objectives are plenty and each gamemode has different aims which is great when you get bored with one.The only issues I can really come up with are zombies pathing is sometimes strange but it doesn't affect the game much, could use some more maps. Also when infection is on and you'll sometimes change for no reason even if you haven't been hit, but it's not extremely common though when at the end of a game waiting to escape it's a damn pain in the♥♥♥♥♥Love this game I'll give it 9/10. had a very good time with it. Though I would reccomend it with a friend rather than solo as it is fun.			"

												A middling first person shooter of infected genre. Decent graphics and scenes, tight mechanics, big maps, classic selection of guns and tools. Light and sound effects and its consecuences are very fine finished too. Includes an option of infection risk and play as a zombie. But its quite limited for single player: hand combat is insecure, slow and without options to block or evade attacks, the stealth system is poor, guns are little useful at closer ranges and the most powerful ones attract so many foes that is better to use them only at final struggles or known places; to survive depends on random placing of medkits. Missing classic weapons of genre like flametrower, molotov cocktail, katana and chainsaw. Player can not climb fences and walls like the infected, that can to sprint and pursue players without pause, at long distances. Foes are a bit exaggerated: are infected, but they can running a lot and make strong damages with bare hands, only a headshot can kill them, like conventional zombies; some wear really heavy armours. The difficultly is bad leveled: normal is piece of cake but hard is nearby to the impossible: get cornered by two or three enemies at close range always is lethal. Could be better with more scenarios for ""escape"" mode. Causes glitches on Windows 10 and Workshop community has few mods. Very often offered with high discounts, no buy without.			"

												I highly recommend this game. Don't expect your standard COD zombies experience, or even anything exactly like Left 4 Dead. This game is all about zombie survival horror. There is a fair amount of content with several gamemodes, and while the playere base isn't huge, you can almost always find a game in progress to join if your friends aren't online to play with you. Also, there is a fair bit of custom mods out there to improve your experience, ranging from slight visual tweaks to completely new, often vast and terrifying, levels. I got this game in a Humble Bundle 4 pack, and my friends and I have put about 85 hours or so into this game in the last three weeks. Thoroughly enjoyable.			"

You've got to be VERY careful, just one scratch might be enough to turn you into a zombie after a while, with a nice transformation effect. (you start to see black and white, sounds get distant etc).Other than that, the little ""finesses"" make this game a ton of fun, you actually can shoot thorugh a door into a zombie's head if you hear him behind it. You'll need certain items to enter in some restricted areas (like keys, fireman axes to open your way etc).All in all it's an amazing game being still in alpha, can't wait to see the complete version.

												Contagion is a fun game that is eerily similar to ""No More Room in Hell"".  The premise is that you are a survivor in a zombie apocolypse and you have to survive.  It isn't very original but it's one of the better made zombie survival games out there, however ""No More Room in Hell"" has the advantage because the multiplayer works better and the zombie AI is much better.  Contagion is a fun game but it needs to be updated and patched because it's missing a lot of key elements that make a survival game great.			"

												This game brings the old zombie flair back in which you have to hide and fear the zombies. (not like the Action-Zombiegames like boring Left for Dead 2) Work together with others or go your single way through the many maps. In the maps there are houses e.g. in which you can find useful things like weapons or you can just barricade yourself against a zombie onslaught with planks.If you die, you spawn as Zombie and can also control several beasts at your command. TL:DR Great game buy it for fast fun and if you start it you can just start without any big learning curve! Worth the money absolutely.Played it for 10 hours now and it is still much fun to play!TIP: Always aim for the head, may it be zombie or human! LORD TYWIN HAS SPOKEN, FOLK.			"

												Have only played a bit but am ready to review it since I have experienced almost every gamemode some with friends some without friends. So let's start off with the core game itself it feels like Zombie Panic and any sexy new source engine game had sex. They have added the core gamemodes from ZPS in a recent update the maps are a bit lacking for each gamemode except for Hunt. Hunt is a great gamemode it is a mix of PvP/Survival if you have a buddy you can team up and take other players out but in the end only one survives. Next we have Extraction which is a gamemode where you have to extract AI survivors you and your group of players move to a point on the map that survivors are held in and you fight off zombies for a certain time then move the survivors to a certain point and they throw ammon and weapons down before they jump the fence to leave the map. Basically if your a fan of Zombie Panic Source or a fan of Zombie games this is for you I am enjoying it the only thing is the lack of maps so far but the community will soon fix that.			"
