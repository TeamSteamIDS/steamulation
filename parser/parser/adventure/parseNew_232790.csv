												The art is gorgeous, the voice talent is sublime and together they give the game true character. The soundtrack has been so carefully considered and composed. This game is much greater than the sum of its parts and it is really knocking my socks off.			"

												After an overwhelmingly successful Kickstarter campaign, Tim Schafer and his team at Double Fine have decided to return to their roots with their first point-and-click adventure game in over 15 years. Similar to their past projects like Grim Fandango and The Secret of Monkey Island, Broken Age features unforgettable characters, puzzles, unique themes, and plenty of humor.The game centers around two characters each from a drastically different walk of life. One half of the narrative follows Vella, a girl who is to be offered as a sacrifice to an enormous monster known as Mog Chothra. While the other half of the story focuses on a boy named Shay who finds himself trapped on a spaceship under the watchful eye of an overly protective computer that holds him prisoner under the pretense of safety. Both of the characters yearn for change and freedom in their own way. While Vella is surrounded by overly zealous villagers that cling to tradition, Shay is completely isolated and patronized by an overbearing computer as he’s forced to endure the same routine day after day.The puzzles are quite satisfying, they’re not overly complex but they still require some thinking which is a refreshing change from most recent games in the genre. They consist of scouring the environment for various items which can be combined with one another or given to certain characters. The amount of overall polish added to the dialogue is impressive, as you’ll most likely try to use the items in your inventory in clever ways to prompt humorous reactions and responses.The art style is unique and really sets the game apart. While not being overly impressive on a technical level, Broken Age is brimming with personality and has an undeniable charm. The game feels like a children’s book come to life but the underlying themes and subtle humor make it appealing to players of all ages. The environments are varied and interesting to look at while the characters are all quite memorable.Sporting an all-star cast, the voice acting is top notch which brings each of the characters to life with standout performances from Elijah Wood as Shay and Jennifer Hale best known for her work on Mass Effect (Femshep) as the megalomaniacal computer. The soundtrack is also well done, fitting the mood and atmosphere of the game perfectly.Unfortunately, the game is quite linear and doesn’t really offer much in terms of re-playability. The different dialogue options add a bit of humor but have little to no impact on the story. For example: choosing to lie to certain characters won’t change the way they perceive you and will have the same effect as telling the truth.Act one is also fairly short, lasting around 4 hours and it ends with a bit of a cliffhanger which will leave you anxiously waiting for Act two. Broken Age probably would have benefited from being released all at once but Act two is promised at no additional cost at a later date. Overall, Broken Age is a charming game with a strong narrative, great humor and memorable characters. It’s proof that there is still room for creativity and innovation amidst the slew of modern action titles. Broken Age not only revives the point and click genre, it helps redefine it.TLDR?

												Quick disclaimer for this review: I have 9.6 hours on record for this game, but the time played for the game is actually half of that (at around 5 hours), as I revisited the game to replay the first part and screw around for achievements, before giving up entirely. I've included some spoilers for the game under warning. Be aware of it if you don't want spoilers.Having that said: It is now three years later. The Double Fine Adventure kickstarter asked for $400,000 to make this game and they were given $3.45 million to do it. Double Fine, rather than budgeting themselves to stay within that target, sold the first half of the game on Steam so they could raise money for the second half. They already had more money than they needed, but they still sold a half-finished game to bring in more funds, bringing up to around the $4 million mark. It also took them over a year to release the second installment of the game.Broken Age is like eating a beautiful, delicious cake, and finding out that Double Fine saved money on frosting by using leftover spackle. Then you have to watch Double Fine eating better, more edible cake, bought with your money.ART:The game itself is, admittedly, gorgeous. The art style and animations are very well done. The voice over talent, too, is pretty decent. I'm tired of hearing Wil Wheaton drone his way through video games, but Pendleton Ward and Jennifer Hale are welcome sounds for your ear-drums. That's where the general positivity ends.STORY: The story is abysmal. You play as two characters, Shay and Vella. Shay is trapped on a spaceship under a domineering, overly-loving computer named MOM, with basically no life. Vella is about to be sacrificed to the Lovecraftian ""Mog Chothra"" monster because ""tradition."" You control each character in turn, and can switch between either, but they're both sectioned off and unrelated adventures for the most part. In Act 1, the game does a pretty decent job of setting up mysteries: What is Mog Chothra? Who is Marek the Wolf? Why is the ship's computer, MOM, so seemingly hell-bent on imprisoning Shay? Who is the mysterious man in the DeadEye Mountain and how does he have technology like we see on Shay's ship? Why are we still pretending Wil Wheaton has a career in acting when he only ever plays himself with a beard?In Act 2, these questions are swept under a rug quickly. Players are plied with half-hearted exposition, contrived answers, and massive plot holes that are never filled. Characters from the first game are given completely different rules and motivations than before, but offer no explanation for their behavior change. Shay is useless in the grand scheme of the game, and affects NOTHING of the outcome, when you get right down to it. Acts 1 and 2 favor Vella heavily as the ""get♥♥♥♥♥♥done"" protagonist and she gets most of the interesting story as a result. Getting into spoiler territory below.***SPOILERS***The portrayal of the characters is severely infuriating, too. Shay is a poor protagonist, especially in light of Vella's achievements throughout the game. Shay affects almost nothing story-wise and, in some cases, actually causes problems for Vella as a result of his actions. He is infantilized, both by his overbearing mother and his reliance on child toys for assistance. At one point in Act 2, he is actually, literally replaced by a blow-up doll, while other characters comment on how useless he is. Vella, by contrast, is smart, capable, solves most of the game's big puzzles, directly fights the game's main enemies, and we are told explicitly that she is the most important character in the game because her blood is coveted by the enemies.The enemies of Broken Age are introduced in the last hour of the game (if you complete Shay's half of Act 2 first) and they barely make an appearance until the last 15 minutes. They are cadaver-white, mutated humans, that have been using eugenics to ""purify"" themselves and they use the Mog Chothra ships to secure targets for eugenics testing or something. The game kind of skips over most of the exposition when it comes to their history, character, and motivations, confining it all to a single conversation with Vella before she fission bombs them back to the stone age.The end result is that Shay is a useless boy, easily replaced, and isn't capable of resolving issues without his child toys. Vella is a strong black girl using death lasers and nuclear bombs to take on the (essentially) Aryan Establishment, who desperately want her blood so they can fix their failing genetic structure. The game ends when Vella melts both Mog Chothra ships together into a literal bridge between the ""normal"" world and the Plague Dam, offering no further information about what the characters do, or how the story ends. ***SPOILERS***If I wasn't so aware of Tim Schafer's personal politics, I'd almost assume it's unintentional, but it comes off as preachy, pretentious, and frustratingly lackluster.GAMEPLAY:The place where this game truly, truly fails... is the game-play. That's a cardinal sin in gaming.Some of the puzzles for Broken Age are clever. They remind me of old-school gaming, where the solutions to problems generally involved the inventive use of a otherwise off-the-wall item to resolve issues. In the entirity of Broken Age, I'd say there's about a dozen examples of this and it works well for the game. The problem is the other several dozen puzzles, which are not intuitive, inventive, or explained. I'm going to save you all time right now and tell you that one of the puzzles in Act 2, regarding a Boa Constrictor, requires that you stop playing the game for three minutes and wait. The game does not tell you this and does not give an immediate or clear indication that the you should wait. It's not explained before this that the snake will get tired and fall off so you can collect him. It was only after getting frustrated and looking up what to do with the snake that I, and my friends, realized you had to stop playing the game for a few minutes to progress in it. Another cardinal sin.The WORST PUZZLE IN THE GAME is a wiring puzzle, in which you have to rewire helper robots to perform different functions. This isn't easily explained, the instructions aren't listed in a spot that is easily accessed, and even then, they're not marked as instructions on how to fix up the robot. You have to perform this puzzle at least 5 TIMES, although that number skyrockets if you don't know what you're doing, and the answer is ALWAYS randomized, so you can't just look it up. Trying to figure out this rewiring puzzle easily took up over 45 minutes of my time before the game gave me a hint that the answer was somewhere in Vella's half of Act 2. It was another hour before I found the instructions and realized what they were for. The fact that I had to perform the rewiring puzzle another 4 times after this, for different robot ""modes"", was just lazy and not fun in the slightest.The rest of the puzzles in the game either had really boring solutions (like raising/lowering the pH of a mixture, which was more time-consuming than difficult), or they were just run-of-the-mill item fetch quests for things that shouldn't be issues. Shay has a cupcake, at one point, with icing on it and you need to take the icing off, but Shay refuses to just take the icing off. Why the hell is this even an problem!?SUMMARY: This is a gorgeous game beset by a lot of gameplay and story issues. Double Fine CLEARLY rushed through development on Act 2 and it shows. There are massive plotholes, the game has no real ending, and the puzzles they set up are lazy in Act 2. The fact that Tim Schafer says this game is a success and he plans to do another kickstarter is reason enough not to support this game, especially after the SpaceBase debacle.TL;DR: Game is pretty, but dumb and not fun at some parts. Save your money, buy a better adventure game.			"

												This is a game in two parts, and unfortunately, I have to review it is such.I can sum up part one in one word: Brilliant!Here we have two characters in two seemingly unrelated situations. One has been chosen as a human sacrifice to a monster that has been terrorising the local villages for generations, the other is alone on a deep-space exploration vessel. You, as the player, have to guide these two through their own stories of ""escape"".I found the story interesting, and then when the two characters briefly meet, then abruptly change places...On to part two, and in a word: Disapointing.After months of waiting, we get this lacklustre, almost generic point-and-click game that relies more on player knowlege than imersion in the story. I got stuck on several puzzles, only to discover that the solution requires finding something AS THE OTHER CHARACTER, totally destroying any immersion that I may have still had, and dumping me into the mode of ""player behind the keyboard"" instead.And then, when the final solution required co-ordinating the actions of both characters at the same time, without either character even knowing what the other is doing, well, I guess that's the ""Broken"" part of Broken Age.While I would like to recomend this game based on the first part, I just can't. Sorry.			"

												While Act 1 was wonderful, I feel like the game just fell apart in Act 2.  There's a feeling of it having been rushed, and so many details you'd expect to have been finessed over the long wait for Act 2 are just glossed over.  Yes, the game is finally complete, but Act 1 was far better written in terms of story telling.  Having completed the game at long last, I'm sad to say I didn't enjoy Act 2 as much as I did Act 1, and to that point, the game is just...meh.  There's just no sense of accomplishment when all is over.  It really does seem like everything that was hyped up just falls apart at the end.  Sorry to everyone who was as dissapointed as I was.			"

												After waiting a year between installments, the finished product that is Broken Age really wasn't worth the wait.The first half of the game left a lot to be desired, while the second part had me begging for it to end.Gameplay is very simple, and while it does get harder in the second part, it does so by making puzzles a lot more obtuse, and only begins to get complex towards the very end.The music is very nice, but the music loops really quickly and drones on and on in more stressful situations (perfectly matching the gameplay) and characters repeat their lines a lot which broke the immersion for me. The art style really is outstanding, but many art assets are quite low resolution when played in 1080p, leaving a lot to be desired.I don't hate this game, but it did disappoint me and I really wouldn't recommend it.Veterans of the genre will tire of the simple gameplay, and casual players wouldn't put up with the many brick walls this game presents.Broken Age does have a very nice atmosphere and I kinda enjoyed my time playing it, but nothing really stuck out, I didn't find anything very memorable at all.Except the knife character, he's the saving grace.

												Edited after act 2 release.What a wonderful game. Finally a quality adventure game. I can't really find anything negative about it except for it's length. I know there will a second part sometime in the future, but no one knows when. At least i hope it will be same as good as the act 1 which was amazing. But still i wouldn't pay the full price for it. This game was crowdfunded and got more than enough money, so they could've released the whole game.It reminds me of those old adventure games. Beautiful environments and artstyle. Great voice acting and wonderful music follows you through the whole first act. You're carried away into that beautiful world and don't want to stop playing. And the story is top notch, you keep thinking how the two characters are connected and when you find out, it's amazing and keeps wanting to play act 2 as soon as possible. Sadly the second act is not that good. No, it's really bad. After waiting for soooooo long i expected something more than backtracking to the same locations as in first act. Now you changed places, you are running back and forth in the spaceship with Vella this time and Shay is in the clouds. Same locations, new puzzles. Like the same locations is not enough, the puzzles became stupidly hard and it breaks the experience. All that running around in the same locations gets boring and you don't have a clue how to solve the puzzles. I don't want to play it anymore, i lost the interest because of the stupid puzzles. There's absolutely no logic behind them. You don't know what you supposed to do.I can't recommend this. It is made by lazy developers who have wasted the money no one knows where.Just go and buy something better like Broken sword 5, The Book of unwritten tales 2 or even the Runaway games.			"

												I have played the girls story for about an hour and I must say, I am blown away. Like most other backers, I am a huge fan of the old Lucusarts adventures, and this has exactly the same feel. Lighthearted whimsy, and dreamlike imagination. This comes in huge part from the lovely crayon art style, as well as supurb voice acting, and some memorable characters. I have not played the boys story at all yet, but if the standard carrys on with this level of quality, then the wait for this kickstarter will have been truly worth it. Thanks Tim and everyone else at Double Fine!!!			"

												(Review is mostly about Act II. Avoided giving any spoilers).Man, I hate giving this game a negative review. I really wanted this♥♥♥♥♥♥to be awesome. I never really played adventure games before Broken Age's kickstarter happened, and the genre just seemed to explode in popularity.The first Act of the game was great. Superb. Loved it. Interesting world, interesting puzzles that made me go DOH!, fun characters (even if they could be a bit one dimensional sometimes). The tone of the game was calm despite what drove the two main characters.Then Act II came out. And... eeeeeh.The big chunk of Act II for both characters is a very long fetch quest. Or at least it feels that way. A very, very long segment that prevents the story from progressing. In Act II, each puzzle pushed me closer to the next grand environment. In Act I, I was running around all the environments I'd already gone to, and it just wasn't as fun. Both stories blow their big twists very quickly, which are ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Problem is that I consider them the climax, as the game feels like it just wants to end after that, but feels like it needs to live up to what I hear are 'classic adventure game puzzles', which to me just felt obtuse and forced me to get hints online.Everything just began to feel rushed after the twists. Knowing Double Fine's budget problems behind the scenes, I understand why this is the case, but the game's still unsatisfying.I'm a bit bummed by the lack of Merek at the end. The conversations you get to have with him are awesome. But I wanted more of him. He's my favorite character in a cast of characters I really enjoyed (outside Vella's family, which I don't think got enough screen time to feel important like Shay's 'mom' and 'dad').So when you get to the end, it feels like everything is on a timer and death is soon to come if you don't act NOW. I understand putting a timer on the game would pressure puzzle fans, and I don't want a timer. But I would have enjoyed if the characters seemed more stressed out. There is an entire gang of characters sitting around and doing nothing. I know they can't really do much, but they just seem grumpy or otherwise docile.The ending is weak. Won't get into it, but I considered it weak.			"

												Well, I have good news and I have bad news.The good news is that Act 1, if you've already played it, is visually stunning, very charming with a lovely soundtrack, very nostalgic and ends with a twist that had me on the edge of my seat for more than a year, waiting for the resolution.The bad news is that Act 2 is here to ruin that.Act 2 fails to live up to the hype. The puzzles are irritatingly convoluted and in no way advance the story, there are no new environments to speak of (only two or three new screens per character), and the ominously sinister undercurrent behind Operation Dandelion and the Maiden's Feast hinted at throughout Act 1 collapses into nothingness almost immediately. Shay and Vella learn nothing, they do not grow, and the entire backstory, the entire reason for the plot, is dumped in a few lines of dialogue in a completely missable conversation. At the risk of spoilers, we have the opportunity to infiltrate the enemy base and learn these things first hand for ourself, to engage the people beyond the plague dam and see how their society parallels that of Sugar Bunting/Meriloft/Shellmound, but that chance is missed, as we remain stranded on the Little Tykes space ship at the risk of... what? Rendering a new environment? Writing a few more characters?This game was so profoundly disapointing, it's haunting me a full 24 hours after finishing it. I have so much respect for DF and Tim's work, even the things I'm not the target audience for (Hey, I even played Once Upon a Monster with some family and found the unique DF flavor charming and nostalgic). I'm not here to demand to know where all the money went (we know where it went, its not a mystery) or ask why it took so long (I'd be happy if it had taken longer to be honest. This felt like a rushed and unloved project.) But there are games made for the simple love of it, with a team of one or two people in their off hours from their day jobs, in RPG maker or similar programs that have significantly more depth than this. Money does not equal a good game. Without a solid story, Broken Age is...well. Broken.CONSIDER BUYING INSTEAD: Hatoful Boyfriend. NO WAIT come back, I'm serious! The original build of Hatoful Boyfriend was made with royalty-free music and stock graphic assets suplimented by photos taken by the creator herself and it still has a rich, unique cast of characters and tells the story of a truly chilling murder mystery. Its an emotional roller coaster disguised as an otome parody, and a perfect example of a great game made without a big budget. Maybe Broken Age could have been better if it had been forced to work with a humbler budget. Who knows.Bottom line: pass and maybe go play Psychonauts again. It's still amazing. "

												Act 2 of this game is pathetic.  The puzzles were not puzzles so much as arbitrary things loosely linked and generally only discovered through pure trial and error.  My guess is 80% of the people out there will just read a walkthrough.  When you read a walkthrough for a good puzzle, you see the answer and think: ""I could have figured that out, now that I see what I missed."" No, almost every one of the puzzles in Act 2, I thought: ""Wow, that was stupid.  No one would figure this out without pure luck or outside guidance.""  In addition to that, the story and background are flat.  They just reused most of what was in the first Act, scattered some arbitrary and poorly thought out puzzles around, and called it a day.  The 2nd half of this game takes  a 5 star first half and makes the whole thing 2, maybe 2.5 stars at best.  You can't produce trash in the conclusion of your game without ruining the whole thing.  What a waste.			"

												The puzzles in the first half of the game are too simplistic and easy, and the puzzles in the second half are arbitrary and absurd. There needed to be some middle ground, but there wasn't. You may say that Adventure Games have always been that way, but I'd disagree. The best LucasArts and Sierra adventure games always had challenging puzzles that could be solved logically. In Broken Age I felt like I was just clicking on random things until something worked.The bottom of the line is, this is not the ""Classic style adventure game"" it was promised to be. If you want a GOOD adventure game I recommend getting something from Amanita Design or Daedalic Entertainment. They're the ones actually making games that feel like the glory days of LucasArts adventure games.			"

The kind that are nothing but frustrating and upon completion result in relief rather than satisfaction.I have 7.2 hours on record. 2-3 of those were spent wandering aimlessly trying to solve frustrating puzzles that have really obscure solutions.My reactions upon seeing the credits roll were ""What? Already?"" regarding the story, and ""Oh my God finally"" regarding the gameplay.I honestly think the game would have been better if act 2 had never been made. The number of times I had to rewire those little robots... ugh...			"

A lot of the puzzles in this game are incredibly unintuative, i really doubt anyone has finished this without looking anything up. There is one puzzle in particular involving a snake fairly early on in act 2 which involves logic completely counter to what the game was teaching the player up until then.The art/music is ok and the story is mediocre.

												Kickstarted this game. They asked for $400,000 to make a complete game. They got $3,336,371 instead and only managed to make HALF a game with it. The money is already gone. Double Fine used to be a name associated with fun, quirky, and experimental games but now it's becoming synonymous with bad project management.The game itself is cute, has a nice visual style, but as far as point-and-click adventure games go it's almost too easy to really enjoy it. Sure, the hunting for a single pixel stuff from some of the old games in the genre was stupid, but this jumped into the other ditch at times.			"

												Updated Review for Act 2 (Original  review is below. Some things will be repeated. No spoilers for either Act 1 or 2):TLDR: It's not bad, but it's disappointing. The story loses it's attraction as the game goes on, and the puzzles get more tedious to solve. The writing, the art, and the world are good enough that I wouldn't want to prevent anyone from experiencing them, but the story and the puzzles just don't come together well enough for this game to be worth recommending. It's almost good enough, but the bottom line is that even if you go in with no expectations, you'll be disappointed by the time you finish.Story: The flaw in the story is how discordant it is. The strength of the first act was the discovery of the world these characters live in, and the troubling mystery behind it. But the second part, instead of continuing down that path, abandons those mysteries in favor of new, less interesting mysteries, that don't get the time to go through a fulfilling arc. You just get talked at about them, and don't get to explore any of it. And there are many, many points where the only reasonable thing for characters to do is have a thorough conversation about what they know, but it just isn't an option, for no narrative reason. In fact, there are many points where everything we know about the characters indicates that they should be reacting completely differently than they do. Worst of all, there are ""revelations"" that are so jarring that they can only be considered mid-story retcons, that just kind of slide by without comment. Puzzles: Very few puzzles made me feel clever or accomplished. Very few puzzles were seriously illogical (as far as adventure games go). Quite a few more puzzles, while not totally illogical, required experimentation that was tedious to execute (like traversing many screens just to test out a theory that might eventually lead you to the solution). The game frequently presents you with clear lists of goals you can work to achieve in parallel (which is a good thing in adventure games, IMO). But just as frequently, it turns out that one of those goals is completely unachievable until you've completed one of the other tasks (with no indiciation that that might be the case), which means that they're not at all parellel, and all the time you spent trying to progress down one path was a complete waste. This is a huge adventure game design sin, and it's employed here as a standard recurring design element.There's something else that deserves special mention, for being a sin in both the narrative and the game design. There are multiple puzzles in the game that require the player to exploit their omniscience of boths sides of the story. Information that *cannot* be known by the characters is necessary to solve certain puzzles, and the game is designed around this. You'd be forgiven for hoping that this might lead to some interesting twist that makes it make narrative sense, but it's a stunt that is pulled straight-faced and without apology. Humor: There are some funny bits, but this isn't a comedy game. If you're seeking calssic Tim Schafer humor, you'll be mostly disappointed. Humorous dialog keeps the tone light, but the subject matter and the characters aren't really comic in nature, so the game can't avoid being generally mellow with a few laughs. There was only one moment that stood out to me as truly hilarious.Visual / Audio Design: Top notch. The characters, environments, animations and virtually all the voices are amazingly well done, with their own unique style. Overall: I know I'm sounding hard on it, but it isn't a bad game. I was actually on the fence of giving it a positive recommendation. But it just doesn't hold together well enough. The flaws that hurt the game the most are all clearly deliberate (rather than being a failure to achieve goals), and that's frankly inexcusable for a game with this pedigree.Original Review of Act 1 Alone (Not Recommended):I recommend the game if you're either totally in it for the story, OR if you're academically interested in the genre. It will be interesting to see where Broken Age lies in the history of adventure games and interactive storytelling.But overall, the game itself is actually kind of hit and miss. I'd have to wait to see if the second half really ties it together before giving it a solid general recommendation. The puzzles are...whatever. Nothing stood out as particularly clever or interesting. I think part of the problem was that problem space to work with was always so small that matching puzzles to their solutions was straightforward. It was very linear for an adventure game. The dual-story thing was an interesting idea, mechanically, because it lets the player progress along different lines if they're feeling stuck on something. However, that idea was kind of wasted on a game as ""narrow"" as this.Speaking of the story, thumbs up. It's interesting and pretty unique, and maintains a feel of wonder and mystery, as you try to piece everything together. The dual-story contributed to that a lot. The world was filled with neat characters; by that I mean they weren't particularly likeable or memorable, but they were distinct and well conveyed. There's a lot in the world that I'm still curious about, but I feel like this is one of those things where if the payoff in the conclusion isn't good, it'll just spoil everything up to that point. The game isn't funny. It's humorous, sure. The characters have a sense of humor, and there are jokes, and it doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's not a comedy, which is disappointing for a project funded on the dream of classic Tim Schafer adventure games.The art is downright stunning. It's amazing how well the visuals, the animation, and the sound blend seamlessly into such a cohesive style.			"

												Warning, this is a biased backer's review!I admit it, I can not distinguish between the objective quality of an early 90's computer game and its impact on my emotions at the time. I am one of the many sentimental fools who like to believe that it is possible to recreate the overall experience of a DOTT or the later (fantastic!) GRIM FANDAGO in the mind of a mid 30's guy if you just have the right ingredients.And then Tim Schafer comes along, with an idea to good to be true. So, give the man some money! Release the kraken! Just let him create for god's sake. It was the easiest decision of my life. And so many people did the same thing. So the game was hilariously overfunded.Today I believe that the money killed it. If he'd just gotten the 400.000 he'd been asking for, he would have been forced to stick to established mechanics for adventure games (don't forget, that's what he wanted to do, a classic 2D Point and Click, a ""Double Fine Adventure"") and work out some funny puzzles. No milestone in gaming history but a nice and small project for the fans.So, what is this ""Broken Age""? It is an ambitious interactive animated movie. The word ""game"" is not part of that definition for a reason. The production value is high, it looks good (if you like the art design) and It certainly can be a real jewel for a new generation of gamers, let's say the 12-year olds of today. I was twelve when I played Schafer's early works and I didn’t complain about gameplay details, I just loved the experience. Broken Age however simply doesn't get to me.Here the problem. Broken Age was not supposed to be a game for 12-year olds. It was supposed to be for the backers, for the old f***s! Hardly ever was a target group this precise and he obviously didn't even try to hit it. Tim Schafer knows how to make games for his generation. He proved it over and over.So, what's wrong with Broken Age?1) It's not a game.Some say it's too easy, I'd say it's not even a game by definition. After the first 20 minutes I wondered why they bothered implementing an interface at all. For the way the story unravels a movie would have been the appropriate medium.2) Marketing was a strong design factor.No one can blame Schafer for having sales in mind. He is a businessman after all. But this game should have been an exception for it was fully funded. The overall appeal of the game is that of an IOS or Android port. Versatile mouse controls are missing in favour of multi platform marketing.3) The dramaturgy doesn't work (Small Spoiler?!)Tim Schafer is usually good at building tension and relieving it. He makes you empathise with the characters. Broken Age has a serious timing and immersion problem. After about 10 minutes of gameplay your character has to fight for her life but it doesn't stress you at all. It's like it doesn't matter and the other characters don't care much either. Given the actual drama of the scene it happens way too early and the story is not building up to it. It is a feeling of alienation that is highly unusual for Schafer's work.If I didn't know anything about the background of ""Broken Age"" or who made it, I'd say: ""Well, this is an interesting indie debut! Let's see what the guys can do when the come into some money!"" But as a result of the most anticipated Kickstarter gaming project from a designer legend like Tim Schafer, it is an utter disappointment. "

Posted: January 20, 2014
												So, I waited to finish act one before jumping to conclusions. First an important note about myself, I´m a 27 years old art director specialized in animation, I work for the game and advertising industry. So, I probably suffer a little because of this during gameplay; it´s hard to fool someone that knows where all the strings ussually hide. Also, english is my third language. Beware.I honestly think that Tim got all wrong here, out of good intentions, but wrong indeed. I dont think he jumped the shark (I enjoyed VGAS mini adventure a lot) but the lack of focus and strategic management is intriguing. Tim has no problem seeing all that´s wrong about publishers and their intrussions in the creative process, but he clearly doesnt see that his workflow kind of depends on them. Running out of money in a proyect is not something to become used to. Specially when you propose a semi-open comunication platform.DoubleFine invested in this game more than they should. For me, this was the first intrussion into the kickstarter work dynamic. For them, its a ""make or brake"" project. Why? Dunno. Maybe their finances justify such a bold move, but that desition made the backers accesory. The fact that they depend on a larger sample to justify the investment, leaves us out of the picture. We paid for a game, and on the run they decided to make another one. Tim presents it as a ""bigger game"" but to be fair, that´s not a precise term. Broken Age turned out to be wider, not bigger.Dont get me wrong, it´s probably the right move, with PC sales declining and tablets sales trough the roof, priorizing the casual tablet gamer represents a bigger target audience. But, it cant be denied, they used our money to make a game for other people. People that probably dont even know about the kickstarter campaing.I made a list of Tim mistakes, since I think the team really warned him about everything im goint to point out:1) Not having a game idea ready before the kickstarter or changing it on the fly due to budget increase. This is clear from the documentary, over 2 months of the guy writing alone and delaying both the art, animation and programming team. The proof behind this is the fact they ended up using test levels and characters in game. They didnt had the time to turn their backs to that amount of work. 2) Not hiring a 2nd writer so he can do what he does best, direct the damn thing. This is derivatory from point 1. It´s clear how Tims writing hurt the game. He was behind on the game concept, behind on the game name, behind on dialog. Animating without dialog is frustrasting, as most of the work ends up being redone or retouched. You can move ahead, but you have to pretty much do it all over a again ( or at least supervise it ) so theres little time saved. Tim clearly delayed production time, and even worse, couldnt concentrate in writing ( his words ) due to ""interruptions"".2) Not listening to the community manager, that was the only one with the gut to tell the guy what everyone was thinking. The idea was too big for the budget. And at the end we got a small game that feels empty.3) Making Bagel a human chokepoint. This was ( since it´s my area of expertise ) the most intriguin desition of all and i know it really hurt the game. I'm a Bagel fan, but the idea of a game with his style and his style only, is flawed, because the guy only has 2 hands. Not only this, Bagel is more of an artist than a game art director nowadays. The art team suffered this desition; Bagel, because of the work load and responsability towards composition in a bigger scope, and the rest of the team for being subdued to someone elses stlye. This shows in the current version of the game. The contrast between scene and scene its hard to swallow, I personally can tell who draw each background.5) Changing the scope of the game ""because he cant think of a smaller game"" and then make it smaller due to budget constrains. The amount of concept art developed for this game is morbid, mostly when you consider how little we got to see implemented. All those hours of work could be better spent in many other areas that clearly needed of polishing.6) Priorizing art over gameplay. Now we get to the rough part. Yes, the game can be funny, but sincerely it isn´t really fun. Shay´s portion of the game altough conceptual feels empty and streamlined. I didnt break free, they gave me the perfect tool for every single puzzle, because of reasons. I solved the teleporter puzzle even before knowing why i should solve it, i saw it coming from the distance.7) Being OK with exploiting employees. This really got my gears going, since it's something that I suffer myself. Tim made a big game, because his a big boy that only knows how to make big games, and because of that, art directors, illustrators and animators, had to work overtime, because his damn schedule DOESNT MAKE SENSE. His words. I was OK with it ( I work overtime due to passion, not explotation ) untill I hear it from the man itself, he made a game that REQUIRED fathers to spend time away from their children. That's wrong, it doesnt matter how you present it.8) Forgetting that implementing audio and doing animation tests takes a lot of time. This is linked to point 2. Dialog really delayed everything. Without lines you cant record them, without the records you cant take your time to carefully choose the best takes, and then tie them to animation that actually makes sense with the tone and cadence of the voice. So little time to polish shows. At least for me, this was a deal breaker. The quality of the game it´s so sporadic that the beautiful made the ugly look more ugly. 9) Leaving the sound team alone. Yup, this one is hard to write, since it´s clear in the documentary how much passion went in to the game. But, the voice takes they endedup choosing are baffling, many dont fit the tone, and in many cases, not only does the voice acting missfit the emotion of the dialog but the animation also does so, so we really see it. Watching a character moving his arms and opening his mouth like he's screaming, only to hear a calm voice whisper to my ears is baffling. I re-watched the voice acting episodes, and saw many takes much clear in intention than the ones they ended up using ( example, bellas ""screw you bird"" was off, really off ). The score has moments of greatness, I must be sincere. But often, the disconnection, the lack of time to adjust things is palpable. What use is a director if he doesn't have access to his most powerful tool, saying ""No, you got it wrong, do it again."". 10) Playtesting and making a simple game simpler, because you forgot what adventure games are all about. If you test a puzzle game, and fear that your user is going to get stuck, then you really dont understand how adventure games work. Chokepoints, are most necesary, they build up tension, that is released, and that´s what you call satisfaction. Play ""The Dig"" if you forgot how that feels. The fact that the internet is a thing, is even more of an incentive for such dynamic. If you get really stuck and feel really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about it, you dont have to buy a magazine to move forward.11) Backwards rationalization. Tim did this so many times that I lost count. It goes like this: Tim: ""I WANT A"". Reality: ""You can only get B"" Tim: ""Now that I think about it, B is much better because..."" It´s hard to make a game specially when you keep moving the target over and over again. When Tim said ""part 2 has to be much harder"" he really meant that part1 should be much harder but he couldn´t do anything about it.12) Forgeting to make smart production choices. Tim grew fond of shotting himself in the foot. I wouldnt be so harsh if it werent for a single game: ""Swords and Sworcery"". Made with little over 200,000$ in less than 8 months, the game is a great example of smart and creative choices, that fit a low budget perfectly.			"

												I generally enjoy point and click games and while I mostly enjoyed my time with this game, there's a few major issues that prevent me from recommending it.Before I get into the issues, I'll highlight the good aspects of the game. It has very high production values (take a look at that voice cast) and an interesting story for the most part. The art style is well done and consistent, and I didn't run into any bugs or issues while playing. The puzzles for the most part are about right in terms of difficulty.Unfortunately, this game does have a few major issues.Most point and click games have a button that highlights interactive elements on the screen. Not so with this game. Generally it's not an issue, but it is possible to get stuck simply because you didn't see you could interact with something.On the topic of getting stuck, there's a string of randomized memory puzzles at the end of the game that are essentially a vertical wall in terms of difficulty. They require you to notice very subtle hints from the other story track to proceed, but the game provides no indication of this and you can get stuck for a long period of time. To top it off, some of these puzzles are timed and have a long cooldown before you can check the hints again (if you even know what to look for). This greatly reduced my enjoyment at a critical point in the game.The story, while interesting overall, leaves a lot hanging at the end. Technically there's a few illustrations in the credits, but they provide very little info on the result of the finale and not much closure for the story. Given the insane puzzles in the finale, I was disappointed to have it just end after all that work without a satisfying conclusion.Add to that the relative shortness of the game (there's an achievement for finishing the game in under an hour) and the high price for this type of game, I unfortunately cannot recommend this game at the asking price. If it's on sale it's worth playing if you enjoy point and click games (with the use of a guide to get past those poorly designed puzzles at the end), but otherwise there are more enjoyable point and click adventures for your money.

												3 Years since I kickstarted this game, no complete game. Near radio silence from the developers. No solid information on a release date. The ""monthly"" documentary from the kickstarter is reliably late weeks or even months late. There was a few funny parts in this game, but it seemed geared towards children. After this and the Space Base DF-9 fiasco I'll never purchase another DoubleFine product again.			"

												After finishing (the incredibly frustrating) Act 2 of Broken Fine Adventure, the only thing I want is to watch the development documentary. Judging my the severe lack of content and polish in the second half, I assume every other minute of the documentary is going to be filled with cocaine and hookers - nothing else would explain how they went so far over budget, and so far over time. The puzzles in Act 2 are obtuse, backtrack-heavy, trial-and-error ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. To make matters worse, they're frequently re-used. Tedious timing puzzles that provides no feedback whatsoever will keep you occupied with retry after long-winding-retry. And if those don't make you pull your hair out, you'll probably go insane scouring the world for the next puzzle - as several scenes are confusing as to what exits are available! Unless you remember the layouts of the first game you're probably going to get stuck simply for not having any apparent way to go.I wanted to buy the game for some non-gamer friends- and family. I want to share the art style, humor and characters, and the low skill requirement of a point-&-click adventure makes it perfect. But yeah, no. I can just imagine how frustrated real people would be trying, having to struggle with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ logic if Act 2.Act 2 is so incredibly poor that the game would have been better left unfinished, I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not.

												Having just beaten both acts, had I been a backer I would have only one thing on my mind: asking some very♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off questions. Where did all the money go? Why did such a short game take so damn long to make? Who thought taking input between acts was a good idea? And why should I ever consider giving money to Double Fine again?The third question in particular is the one that drives me up the wall. The first act wasn't very difficult in terms of puzzle design, and it's pretty clear DF listened to the backers between acts on this one. But not in the good way. The first act WAS too easy, but act two has some puzzles based on random seeds and a completely unintuative design. That's when the logic behind them doesn't mirror the leaps in logic found in Sierra's old point and click adventures, they're completely bizarre to the point of frustration.If you really must play this, do not pay full price, it will not last you more than 6 hours and lacks any replay value with the characters being mostly uninteresting on the whole. (Barring Vella, who was at least pretty well done) I may not have backed this, but I wanted it to be good. Seems I made the right decision in not doing so, I would be far more upset.			"

Posted: May 9, 2015
												I kickstarted Broken Age back when it was called Double Fine Adventure, and comming in my expectation was to get something that played as well as the Lucas Arts games of old, with large worlds to explore, a lot of things to interact with, and puzzles that make me feel proud about figuring them out (or stupid for not doing so when I finally get it).When I got to play the first episode the first thing i reacted to was the art style. The game really has a picture book for kids vibe that continues through the entire game. If you can stand it, the graphics are pretty, and the animations are smooth. I thought the game was over all pretty, but it's up to your taste if you can stand it.The voices are also well done. All character have well sounding voices, and what little dialogue there is is mostly well written, and some characters are memorable and likable. What little plot there is is interesting, and in the end I must concede that Double Fine managed to create an interesting world I would like to return to in what will hopefully be a Broken Age 2.All that said, why is this a negative review? Well, the game has very little content when it comes to gameplay.Over all there are very few objects you can carry around, and mostly it is fairly obvious what they are supposed to be used for. This means that the item based puzzles are trivial to solve.Act 1 mostly consists of moving around in the cloud kingdom and a fishing village for Vella, and a space ship for Shay. The puzzles are mostly embarassingly easy fetch quests, and to be fair, act 1 might make a good introduction to adventure games for a young child. Act 1 ends with a plot twist I enjoyed, and after it I was looking forward to the meat of the game that I thought would be act 2.Act 2 mostly consists of moving around in the cloud kingdom and fishing village as Shay, and a space ship for Vella.The puzzles are still mostly embarassingly easy fetch quests, there are a few mildly tricky puzzles, and then there are a few puzzles that are just a big slap in the face where the solution is only obvious after you have solved it, or only available to the other character as something they might comment on or see in the background.The end game mostly centers around wiring up robots with patterns only the other character can find, and the ending really didn't feel very satisfactory to me, but it does leave room for a sequel which I hope we will get to see.The main problem with act 2 is that it doesn't really expand on act 1. The characters are still stuck in the same small world with only a few items and the same characters as in act 1 available to them to use at any time, and ultimately that leaves the puzzles no more interesting than the ones in the introduction that is act 1. Ultimately I have to ask: What took so long? After years of development I was expecting a lot more gameplay content than this.Broken age is not a bad game, but it is not a very good one either. I'd give it a neutral grade if I could. I don't hate it, but why waste time on it when you could be playing something better?			"

												A very pretty game but one that doesn't really merit a purchase or the whole debacle that has been it's development.Two kickstarters and several years in the making, Double Fine finally finished Broken Age after splitting it into two development cycles. The first half of the game could be finished in 2 hours without much issue. The 2nd half was dragged out by really un-intuitive puzzles that seemed only to exist because people compained how easy Part 1 was. The solution they had was to require some rediculous trial and error and puzzles that had their solutions hidden in the other persons section of the game.   sometimes the thing you needed to interact with really required almost no logical sense at all and had almost zero evidence pointing towards it that I can tell. I suppose this is true to old point and click adventure games, but that kind of logic probably was best left in the ancient era of Sierra games.To re-interate how messy and nonsense the puzzles are in this game at one point you have to put a character in danger with very little hint that this is a thing you need to do. You have to do it for a while and even the character starts to discourage you towards the end, saying its time to stop. But if you stop you don't solve the puzzle, so you have to ignore common sense and everything the world and characters are telling you.The characters constantly have to rely on knowledge they don't have and brush it off as ""instict"" that they figured it out after you found teh answer in the other persons story line. Sometimes you even have to do things that are presented as counter productive or perhaps make no real sense to do other than that you, as the player, are aware it needs to be done. And I don't mean stand on a pressure plate or pull a leaver. For a fictional example pretend a character of yours needs to stick a fork in a light socket to knock out the power. They as a character don't know hey need to do this. you as a player know that it will unlock a door down the block, but the character in this fictional example  just sticks the fork in there and knocks themself out in the process 'because reasons'. They have no reason to want to do it, and its presented as being detrimental, but you know better. Maybe.The truth is there isn't much to this game. It has some funny dialog but even that is in short supply, if you were hoping for Tim Schafer's prime material then this isn't it. Plotwise it's a mess. At one point a character actually brushes off a major plot relevation as ""oh yeah, I think i knew that but I kinda forgot"" They have to have forgotten for it to work out as a big reveal to you, but then it's immediately deflated by the presenting it as your character just being that dumb they somehow forgot about this. The game being made in two parts will also be quite obvious as it is a glarring jagged scar in terms of gameplay. You will breeze through the first half, then have the second driving you crazy. The final puzzle in the game requires you to do everything perfectly or it all resets back even further than it needed too, and in reality there is no reason it needed to reset at all other than to pad out the game time.As for the ending, with no spoilers, this game has no real ending. It just kind of stops. You solve an annoying puzzle, there is a cutscene which tries to be epic but in the end it just does.. nothing. You accomplish nothing, you resolve nothing, you get no reward, no explination, and no resolution. It just ends. It might as well just pop a link to another kickstarter page saying ""Yeah we ran out of money again, plz donate"" Because honestly it feels like they burned through their cash and decided they had to just end it there. NO ENDING FOR YOU.All in all if you already owned the first half, well you have the game already, if you were waiting for both halves to come out before buying, I can't recommend it.			"

												Well this game was a disappointment for me. I love 'Schafer' games, but this didn't entertain me as much as the others. The humor was so so, it gave a few chuckles, but I'm used of more.   The story wasn't engaging me, there were a lot of times I felt boredom due to puzzles being simplistic, the limited world the game has to offer didn't do it just justice either. Sure everything is cuddly and cute, but that didn't save it for me.  A lot of people were very positive towards this game and I feel let down. Wondering if that was more about it being Double Fine rather than a reflection of the actual game.  It's not a bad game however, I would rate it as mediocre and I don't think Act II will save this for me.  So, nope... in the end I wouldn't recommend it and definitely not at its full price for what little game you get.			"

												I loved, absolutely adored the first half of Broken Age, which is why the second half felt like such a letdown.  People keep complaining about the gameplay, and while the first half was really easy, yes, they did hike up the difficulty for the second half.  However, it's honestly no more difficult than the puzzles of old-school adventure games.Really, my problem comes in the form of story.  Tim Schafer is a man I go to for fun worlds and good stories.  Unfortunately, while the world is interesting, we barely learn anything about it, and the story loses all structure after the end of the first act.  Virtually all the fun, interesting themes from the beginning are swept under the rug, and it felt like half of all the mystery was just hand-waved.  I cannot recommend buying this game.			"

												Great story, characters, audio, and lovely backgrounds all ruined thanks to some mediocre puzzles (especially act 2), which are supposed to make the gameplay longer (I cannot think of any other reason for constant rewiring of little helpers). Great way to ruin fun. Thank you for not respecting my leisure time Double Fine!The Broken Age is not a bad game and I may even say I enjoyed it until some point of Act 2, however, taken in consideration how long I waited for the second part and questionable quality of it in comparison to the first part, it just makes me angry. The strory also had its weak moments. I am sure many adventure gamers are going to enjoy this, but I did not.			"

												Well, it's here at last after almost two years of development, we get to see what Double Fine did with those 3.3 million dollars they got from backers. So is the game actually good? After playing the entire first act in one sitting, the short answer is yes. Is it 3.3 million dollars good? I'd say no. The game really shines when it comes to the world that Tim Schafer envisioned. I never felt bored exploring the world of Broken Age. There was always something interesting to see and marvel at. The story is really well done too and I really like how the first act ends and sets the events for the second act. I didn't see the story twist coming even though there were a lot of cleverly hidden clues which is a sign of good story writing. The dialogue is also very well written and as expected from a Tim Schafer game, very funny. I can see the same game being made at a much lower budget though. Voice acting probably cost them more than it should because there are some big names in there like Jack Black and Elijah Wood, but they could have done without them easily as their voice acting doesn't really add much to the game in my opinion.Gameplay in Broken Age is your standard point and click adventure game fair. There is nothing revolutionary here that will change the genre forever or anything and I don't think Double Fine had plans to do that anyway. Most of the puzzles are on the easy side and there are enough clues to help you solve them quickly without feeling stuck for too long.Overall, I recommend Broken Age at a sale price. Maybe when it's $10 or less. It's not the best adventure game I've played, but it's worth playing nonetheless. Now the wait begins for the second act and the conclusion of the story.			"

												Three years ago Tim Schafer's DoubleFine sold nearly 90,000 fans on the idea of making and an Old School Adventure game. And after all this time he finally gives us the completed Broken Age, which is a mess and one of the worst games this acclaimed studio has produced.I've spent a whole day revisiting Broken Age, replaying Part 1 and playing Part 2, as per Mr. Schafer's advice. And that actually made the experience far worse because it made it all the more apparent how cheap this game feels. There's only three (well more like two and a half) locations you'll spend the majority of time exploring in this game, and man does it get boring. This game is supposed to rekindle the love of the LucasArts Adventure games but you aren't exploring a large and varied game world, you're just walking back and forth between the same backdrops OVER AND OVER AGAIN. And it's not like the artwork does anything to alleviate this, the art as you can tell is awful, it belongs in a cheap kids book that Scholastic would produce.  It's not as interesting as the worlds the player explores in prior DoubleFine games or Lucasarts game. And the animation is absolutely barebones, the game is not nearly as fun to look at in motion as the Monkey Islands or Day of the Tentacle was. To be frank I feel like a loser playing this game, as the artstyle is so amatuer and childish I'm truly embarrassed to see it on my computer screen. I'd rather have friends catch me playing Hyperdimension Neptunia than Broken Age. This would all be forgivable if yes this game were not for my demographic, as a man in my 20s I obviously understand that everything isn't made for me and Broken Age looks perfect for young children. But I would never suggest this game for children because it's not at all designed for novice or easily distracted players. There is no option for a ""Goal"" system to remind you what you're looking for or hints, if you forget what it is you're after in the game you just end up wandering around the environment till you find the right NPC. So yes in some ways Doublefine did indeed make an Old School Adventure game, while I can't speak for everyone this isn't what I loved Adventure Games for. I loved them because they felt like semi-interactive cartoons, with puzzles that made me scratch my head and then feel smart for solving them. Broken Age Puzzles are either ridiculously easy or ridiculously obtuse with no middle ground.The amount of activity is also extremely low in Broken Age. Any of those old Lucasarts games allowed you to click around the environments and your character would say a funny little line, there's only a items in Broken Age that have the characters say anything out loud and it's usually just them stating the obvious with no fanfare. You don't even get a fun line by trying to use the inventory in ways you obviously shouldn't, for an example the character Vella doesn't react negatively to you suggesting you use a knife on her little sister.The only compliment I can pay Broken Age is that the audio is nice. Tim clearly used a large portion of his 3.3 Million budget to rub elbows with celebrities and hang out with an Orchestra. As if the players really cared if the actor who played Frodo Baggins is the star of the game.Do not buy this game for $20, hell I'd have a hard time saying it's worth $10. This is mediocrity and not even one that has lovable quirks. Doublefine put so little effort into it that I'm upset at how much time I've spent playing it. I only feel compelled to complete it because I gave them so much money in the Kickstarter.Shame on you Doublefine and Tim Schafer, you went directly to the gaming enthusiasts and we might not give the cash a big publisher can provide but we allowed you full control on this project. And you squandered it on something completely unmemorable and spent most of that time partying and filming a self-fellating documentary. Good luck ever trying to make a Kickstarter as popular as this first one was. Because I sure as hell am not pledging again and I doubt I'm an anomaly.Before you buy this game I urge you to play through all the Lucasarts and Telltale Adventure games, after that play everything else Doublefine made. Trust me they are all better games.			"

												Fiasco. The game it's even not complete; seems the missing part comes in a few months, something I didn't realize at time to buy (make bigger warnings, come on!).When I bought it I though it would be a great graphic adventure like in the old times. But actually it has no emotion, perhaps for a 12 year old who has been its whole life in a cave it may be emotionant.In the other hand, quality of designs, music and production is great. Just missing the fun, emotion and challenges.			"

												Before you read further, note that my entire childhood was defined by these point and click adventure games, so my expectations are extremely high. I really wanted to enjoy this game. When I first fired it up, I was expecting something along the lines of what I remembered from the later Lucas Arts games such as Grim Fandango and Monkey Island 3. What I got was a very small, very simple game, with some seriously lacking dialog, gameplay and design.There really is a lack of gameplay across the board with this one. The whole first part of the boys sequence is on rails, and after that, the area he is in (the spaceship) is lacklustre at best with very little to do but explore the on-rails areas you were in at the start, which are very small boring areas with not a lot of stuff to interact with. In fact, there really are no areas in the game with a lot of interaction, nothing like the point and click games of the past or even the present.The girls sequence is a little more open, but you are still put on a linear sequence of events which are always the same.The NPCs in the world merely act as a tool to guide the player through the linear sequence of events, which is normally fine, but with NPC dialog being not a lot more than 5 or so questions directed at them about the world and a walk away line, it feels pretty dry and boring. Only a couple of characters are actually interesting throughout the experience. It just feels like the NPCs are waiting for the player to interact with them, instead of acting like real people with questions of their own, not to mention none of them ever move away from their original positions, as if they are glued to the world.Now onto the other important aspect of a good point and click adventure, the puzzles. They are so simple I didn’t actually have to think about them, with several of them solving themselves on their own. I remember the days when I used to spend a couple game sessions solving a specific puzzle, but this game really offers nothing that isn’t obvious. However, it might be a good starting point for a young child (even though I would suggest Spyfox or Freddie Fish over this any day).I am not one of those people who gets their kicks from art style so I will just say from what I saw it was pretty good. The music tracks however just weren’t memorable. Usually with games like these there are a couple music pieces which are memorable, but really, I can’t remember any of the music. Nothing like Stan’s themes from the Monkey Island series, or the awesome tracks from Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.To finish I will just say this game is forgettable, and it is sad too. I was really hoping they would pull something incredible off which would bring back the genre with a bang, but this game isn’t going to do that for us. I really hope they aren’t going with the (swapping places) idea for part 2, I don’t care to see those old areas again, but heres hoping they make part 2 at least trickier with more interaction and more depthly dialog.

   My Playthrough   Youtube Playlist    The Review It really saddens me but I can't recommend this game. I was one of the kickstarter backers and I had high hopes for this game but it falls flat. First let's start with the pros. This game looks beautiful. It looks like a storybook and it's also drawn in the Psychonauts style which looks very good. The game has great voice acting with actors like Jack Black and Elijah Wood. And finally the music sounds very nice and fit perfectly with the game.Now the cons. The game is very simple for an point-and-click adventure. Theirs is lack of options for how you deal with people and objects. In older point-and-click adventure games you would have options to look, interact, or take most objects but in the game all you can do is click on objects and if the character can take the object he/she will if they can't they will comment on it. It also got the lazy game mechanic where items disappear when it is used to solve a puzzle. The interaction between the player characters and NPCs are also very limited and when you solve their puzzle you can't even talk with them anymore. And talking about puzzles the puzzles of act 1 was OK but the puzzles for act 2 was terrible. The knot puzzle was by far the worse and their is little to no clue of how to solve it on your own. They also added dual puzzles for act 2 which makes no sense. For example to repair Shay's robot you will need Vella to see some symbols but that makes no sense as Shay and Vella have no way of communicating with each other. So Shay is just guessing the solution. But the biggest failure of this game is the story. For a point-and-click adventure game story is the most important feature. Act 1 started off with with many interesting plot threads but they either became plot-holes or has very little payoff in act 2. The ending for Broken Age is one of the most disappointing endings that I have ever encountered. Most of the important plot threads like dealing with the true villain are all done off screen!This game feels very incomplete which is sad as I thought that $3,336,371 and 3 years of development would be enough to make great game but I was wrong.

												Act I was very good. I loved the visuals, the music, the voice acting and the characters. I really enjoyed how the game was an allegory for growing up, while also being a fantasy-scifi-mystery at the same time.However it became immediately obvious that greed had poisoned the production of the game. Even with all the excess budget they still managed to run out and, after a hiatus of a year, release a poor conclusion to the game.Act II got absolutely everything except for the visuals and voice acting so wrong. All of the themes and mysteries of the first game were given nonsensical explanations or barely explained at all. The ultimate conclusion of the story is relegated to a series of silhouettes in the background of the credits. The puzzles were not fun to solve, and are never explained.All in all, it was a very promising game that failed to deliver anything other than disappointment. I just hope that in the future, we can forget about this tragedy and remember games such as Pillars of Eternity and Divinity: Original Sin as the shining examples of what crowdfunding can do.			"

												Broken Age is by far one of the most amazing point and click adventure games I have ever played. I honestly wish this game would have been around when I was a kid, because I know I would have loved it even more than I already do. What can I say? The game was very well designed and is truly unique is every aspect. From the amazing artwork, to the enjoyable soundtrack that gives the game it's adorable charm. The aspect of playing 2 different characters in different world is something I've yet to try in any game until Broken Age. Even though I've only played part one, my jaw still dropped at the ending making me so excited for part two. I knew before buying this game from what I saw that this would be a winner, and I can peoudly say this game is a winner. I suggest you give it a try. This game has forever won a special place in my heart, and I applaud Double Fine for yet again, creating a masterpiece. I was waiting for a game like this for many years. I can only hope to see more games like Broken Age in the future.			"

												As a backer of the Kickstarter for this game, I was given early access to Act I. So I won't spoil any of the story, but I will say that this is a very good adventure game experience, on par with the classics of the Golden Era (80s & 90s). I've been waiting for these games to come back and what better way to re-usher them in than with a brand new game from Tim Schafer himself, an adventure star who designed the likes of Full Throttle, Grim Fandango, and Day of the Tentacle. He also had a hand in designing the first two Monkey Island games by Ron Gilbert. These are adventure gaming classics. I've only played half the game so far, but the other half is coming in a few months as of this writing. That said here are my thoughts:The Good:-Story. Very intriguing. I was very invested in both the girl and boy's characters and was quite interested to see where their stories would take them and how they'd eventually intertwine. The experience was not unrewarding and definitely wasn't a disappointment!-Writing. Tim's humour is expectedly very present in the game. His trademark sarcasm and wit are strewn throughout the dialogue and even into some of the look of the locations. It's a very bizarre and funny world Tim has created, but not too bizarre. Just recognizable enough to not seem too far out and unrelatable.-Art style. The 2D painted artwork style is fantastic. I was initially skeptical in the beginning of Bagel's art style, once I'd seen some of his work in one of the hidden backer forum threads on the Double Fine forums. But I have to say that my skepticism was misplaced. This game has a lovely quality and very pleasing aesthetic. The artwork truly does resemble a beautiful painting come to life. And despite this it is absolutely brimming with detail in every scene. It's beautiful to just sit and watch, but it also works very well for the gaming experience and story. Some of the girl's locations actually reminded me of Curse of Monkey Island, even though the styles are wildly different. While the boy's space ship is unlike anything I've ever seen for a space ship. It's all very unique and with just a dash of familiarity in it as well.-Animation. Truly charming and natural. Everything seemed so alive. Not like puppets on strings, but real characters that were moving on their own. Special care was given to these animations. Every one showed amazing attention to detail and added a great deal of character to everything that moved. Every character in the game had their own unique persona that spoke volumes about their motivations and intentions. One of my favourite aspects of the design of the game!-Voice acting. Top notch. Every voice puts a life and an identity into their characters in a way that binds them to their personas where I could not justify turning voices off and just reading subtitles. The voices are truly special and unique and are really part of the experience in a huge way. So don't mute them.-Soundtrack. Peter McConnell did a fantastic job with the soundtrack. The themes are very fitting and atmospheric, yet the themes for the boy and girl and their locales are separate and distinct from eachother, as should be expected. Peter doesn't disappoint. As a backer, I also received the soundtrack to the game which I immediately put straight on my player for my long drives to work. And it's played by a live orchestra. Can't beat that. Truly effective work. Bravo, Peter.The ""Wish-It-Was-Better"":-Puzzles. The heart of the adventure game experience (combined with story). There are some great puzzles in this game, but as a veteran adventure gamer I was expecting a bit more of a challenge. Especially in the beginning, the puzzles were fairly simple. I assume to ease in new or rusty players. Luckily these simple ""tutorial"" puzzles didn't last long at all end began to become more complex soon enough, to my relief. As long as I was thorough, however, I never missed anything. Years of adventure gaming has taught me to leave no stone unturned and to keep a mental map image in my head of where certain characters, objects, and puzzles were located. This made it easier to deduce when and where I'd be needing certain objects or what objects I might need in certain areas. I ended up acquiring all of the objects I needed ahead of time before I needed to use them, which sped up the gameplay a bit. But that's due to my obsessive style of exploration. Other gamers might not share this and thus wouldn't run into the same problem, which would probably extend the experience for them. There was no so-called ""moon logic"" in this game, which many classic adventure games were infamous for. Personally, I never had a problem with extremely hard puzzles and enjoyed them, but many others (especially nowadays) don't share this feeling. Luckily, they won't be disappointed with this game as a result.-Length. Keeping in mind that I have only played Act I, I still have to say it was somewhat shorter than I expected. If Act I is truly an exact halfway point in the game, then I can only hope that the puzzles in Act II are much more difficult. I wish it was longer. I'll have to put it away for a year or two after completing Act II and come back to it to see just how long the game actually is with a fresh perspective from beginning to end.Overall, the world of Broken Age is an immensely pleasing and fun one to live in and explore. The story is gripping and mysterious. By the end of Act I you are left wondering just WHAT in the world is going on! It left me wanting more, but in a good way. Luckily we will be getting more! I encountered no bugs whatsoever. The game played extremely smoothly and there were no unexpected quirks. I was finding myself missing the skip dialogue function from the older LucasArts SCUMM engine games by pressing '.'. Instead it only lets you skip entire ""cutscenes"" of dialogue. Not a huge issue, as there never really was anything that I needed to skip specifically to get at something new from a repeated conversation. I would like a ""retro"" filter shortcut for the game to make it seem all pixelated and 90s looking if only for the novelty. ;)I highly recommend this game to those who enjoy a good story in gaming and those who appreciate a work of art. Newcomers to the adventure genre who are mildly curious but fearful of ominously difficult puzzles needn't worry as everything is intuitive and logical, but still challenging enough I feel to give you a great experience without seeming too easy or too short. Adventure veterans may find the challenge a little lackluster, but what little it may lack in puzzle challenge it makes up for in pretty much everything else. It won't be the next puzzle masterpiece adventure game, but it is surely a very good start to the great Adventure Resurgence! It appeals to old and new fans alike and, I feel, is the perfect bridge to link the two together. Take us onward, Double-Fine! Here's hoping for more adventures after Broken Age!			"

												Broken Age has made somewhat of a name for itself over the past couple years. Starting its life as a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign that has since inspired multiple other dream projects. Crafted by the same team that made the original Grim Fandango, Broken Age was developed as a throwback to adventure games of the past. The game is drawn up in a pastel-heavy style that is both beautiful and appropriate for the wacky antics Double Fine is known for — don’t let it deter you either. Broken Age is a fantastic journey that has a little something for everyone. The story is split between dual protagonists, Vella and Shay, who share more in common than first meets the eye in a universe filled with twists, turns and well-placed illusions. Vella is a girl who has been selected by her village peers to be a living sacrifice to a monster known as the Mog Chothra — and wishing to shed her fate, sets off to escape. Shay is a young boy who lives in the confines of his very own spaceship, under the watchful eye of a motherly computer who works to protect him at all costs. Shay too grows tired of his “traditions” and sneaks off to seek the thrill of real adventure.Everything comes to a head at the end of Act 1 when the story concludes several shocking developments before transitioning into the second Act where things become even more interesting for the dual protagonists as they swap places and explore their new worlds. The only downside to this development is the amount of recycled content — you’ll be revisiting a lot of the same NPCs and as a result it takes away from a lot of the discovery the first Act introduced for players. Those qualms aside though, I did enjoy going back and seeing how the circumstantial differences had changed things I already knew. The dialogue alone does not disappoint.When you start the game you’ll have the option straight away of choosing between Vella or Shay’s tale — both of which can be swapped interchangeably any time you feel like a change of pace. Shay’s story is a bit more exploration and puzzle-heavy, where as Vella’s is more dialogue-heavy with many cutscenes in between traditional fetch-quest segments often found in typical adventure games. You’ll find yourself playing through both characters to get the whole picture here but that’s where Broken Age really shines. Its writing is clever and its characters are done through with a good amount of depth and occasional silliness. Double Fine’s work here is top notch and the various twists and reveals throughout the story kept me reaching for more.From a gameplay perspective, Broken Age is your standard adventure game romp through the use of point-and-click gestures, inventory management and dialogue options players have come to expect over the years.  Broken Age really encourages exploration — and element forced on you to advance the story, which often involves the use of clever puzzles which have equally easy to understand and use controls.Broken Age is a wonderful experience that I can’t recommend enough. As someone who grew up on the LucasArts-style adventure games of old Double Fine has pulled through with just enough nostalgia and modern aesthetic, offering up a fresh and funny classic in an age where blockbuster games rule the roost.

												A lot has been said about the game's funding and development time: memes about non-whole numbers and references to Abrahamic religions. A rough animation of a lumberjack made to test the engine spawned thousands of comments from angry internet posters meaning to imply that it was all a scam, that the entirety of the Kickstarter funds was funneled to feminist ideologues.These people are morons. God damned brain-washed♥♥♥♥♥♥eating meme-spouting♥♥♥♥♥♥sucking mouth-breathing look-mom-i-made-a-meme-on-♥♥♥♥♥ government subsidized NEETs, and they don't deserve your attention, let alone your respect.Nothing in this game's funding or scheduling doomed it to failure. No, the reason I didn't like it is because it uses some of the most obtuse moon logic I've ever seen in an adventure game, with some solutions so obscure that it convinced me I can never be a playtester at Double Fine, because if I ever had to do anything like rewiring that Hexipal again I would turn to Tim Schafer, look him dead in the eyes, and say ""This is where I'd usually uninstall the game"".What makes worse is that the solutions to some of the more complex puzzles are randomized. There are two reasons why a developer would do this: to make the game unique for subsequent playthroughs, or to ♥♥♥♥ with people who use walkthroughs. I sincerely hope it's not the latter school of thought, because if I'm looking up a guide for your puzzle, I obviously don't want to be stuck on your puzzle anymore. It's like you're trying to make me upset.It's not irredeemable. The game made me laugh, Tim is a comedic genius, the characters are likable, his writing credentials are without dispute. He made Psychonauts, and no photoshopped stereotypical Jew noses can take that away from him. But I cannot in good conscience recommend a game that frustrated me to the point where I wanted to stand up and stop playing.Two out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ) ( ) ( )			"

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  Broken AgeDevelopers:  Double Fine ProductionsPublisher:  Double Fine ProductionsGenre:  2D adventureGeneral ImpressionEver since it was first presented to gamers worldwide, Broken Age has been a story of success. Both creatively and financially since it proved to be the perfect template for a fully deserving crowdfunded video game. Kickstarter itself had a lot to benefit from the exposure it received, while the large mass of enthusiastic adventure game fans witnessed the rebirth of Double Fine, a veteran studio whose glory days were resurrected through crowdfunding. No small feat and by no means something that common. Kickstarter had its share of miserable failures and crooks looking to exploit the nostalgia felt by many “older” gamers out there. Broken Age was originally split into two Acts, that were fused together eventually in the singular title we can enjoy today. The unique story and set of characters are complemented by the stellar job performed by the voice actors, some of them film celebrities. The gameplay, while seemingly run-of-the-mill point & click, hides a few secrets along the way and not necessarily regarding the inventory or locations but the possibility to switch at will between the game’s two protagonists. Male and female, both teenagers and both of them stuck into uncomfortable positions from which they struggle to escape and fix their broken worlds. I really wish not to spoil the plot. Suffice to say that despite being two sides of the same coin, there are enough differences to set them apart. My only gripe with this title might be the lack of more mature themes, such as those from Grim Fandango but perhaps Tim Schafer wanted to promote adventure games to an even larger crowd of potentially new players and ultimately fans of his work. Because in all honesty, you can’t hate good writing. Not when it’s so masterfully implemented into a captivating medium which lets you interact on a scale that no book or movie could ever achieve. Gaming is an art form, whether its detractors agree or not.Strong Points+ Beautiful hand drawn graphics.+ Unique setting and storyline.+ Fantastic voice acting.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- A bit childish at times.Rating 9/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes.

												Wow...just finished ACT 2, and what a let down. Don't get me wrong, everything was going great until the end. Or, rather, the total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t non-ending. Imagine any hero story where the hero first meets the villain, is captured, and escapes, but instead of the villain pursuing or going on the offensive or the hero doing anything in response to almost being murdered, the credits just roll right there. Really Tim Schafer? You're going to non-chalantly drop a bombshell that one of the main character's family members was actually a traitor and that the villain is a group of genetically self-modified super mutants and that have been harvesting young girls (which, though the game itself points out as sexist and stupid, never gives any real answer for). And, after their targets escape their evil city (which you never visit), they just give up and accept the people they've been subjugating for hundreds of years. Really!!!TOTAL ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T ENDING!!If there were plans for an act 3, I'd quickly say, ""Wow, what a cliff-hangar?"", but no, everything builds up and just stops on a dime. The final screen may as well just be a group picture of the DEV team shrugging, ""Whoops, ran out of money. Maybe we shouldn't have spent it on giving every utensil star voice talent, and more on quality writing.""			"

												i just can't recommend this game, its too short, its too easy, and its been way to long since any information has come out about the second part.  This game has such a pretty art style and amazing voice acting and well crafted storys. However, WHERE THE HELL IS THE REST OF THE GAME.  If and when the second act comes out i will change the review to include the rest of the game.  ALSO WHY ARE GAMES THESE DAYS BEING CUT UP AND FORCE FED TO US IN LITTLE FREAKEN PIECES STOP THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥EDIT: 2/3/2015It has now been over one year since this game was released, at this point I don't think I can recommend this game even when the next part comes out.  This could have been such a good game but Double Fine has pulled a bait'en switch, no matter how good the second half of the game is, no matter how long it is, the fact is that Double fine took my money for game that wasn't done and made me wait for a YEAR for any kind of news to come out. NO, COMPLETE YOUR GAME DAMMIT, DON'T EXPECT ME TO BY INTO YOUR♥♥♥♥♥♥EXCUSES. Double fine you had the money, you had the fan base, and you didn't deliver.  I can and won't excuse this kind of practices anymore, this review will always be not recommended no matter what. I may not even finish your game because in all honesty I've lost all interst in the story and game.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed Act 1 and was really excited for Act 2 to be released- I must have checked at least weekly to see when it was coming out. I can't really say much here that you won't find in other reviews. Clearly there are a lot of feelings about the politics of development that resonate through a lot of people's reviews here. I can't say I was really affected by that. But I can share some of my feelings about my experience of the game as a puzzle adventure, and that'll be that.I won't get into any details really but just say that Act 2 had certain puzzles that made me feel like I was having a joke played on me. Certain puzzles require a few steps to set up and when you get the final piece incorrect, everything unravels and you have to start over. That's to be expected in a videogame of course (I remember saving a game at a point in King's Quest 6 where I literally had to restart the entire adventure because I had missed an item along the way), and I'm no stranger to having my house of cards crash down around me. But in this game I couldn't forgive the break of immersion that followed in those times, and that mostly had to do with the voiceovers and cutscenes. I really struggled with the choice to either 1) listen to the same phrases and watch the same cutscenes for the 5th or 6th time, or 2) skip quickly through the cutscenes and break myself out of the beautiful strange world I was in, while still being offput by the tedium that sometimes developed. I'll just end with this- I sort of wish they had never released Act 2, and instead of feeling disappointed with the complete project, I could have loved the world of Act 1 and agonized over how great Act 2 would have been if they had only been able to release it. So with a heavy heart I can't say I would recommend this game, but if you can get it half price just play Act 1 and revel in the blissful ignorance of the rest of the game. "

												I remember specifically reading when I backed this that it was going to be a game that harkened back to classic point and click adventure games. It had Tim Schafer's company behind. A man that co-designed the first two Monkey Island games and Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle. When I think ""Classic Point and Click Adventure"" I think of the games listed above as well as the old Sierra games. But I suppose I set myself up for some amount of disappointment by making assumptions based on the information above.   I knew I was in trouble when nothing in the game seemed to stump me. I never really had any moments where I truly had no idea what to do next. This is a huge mistake when it comes to adventure games. When I needed an item to do something, I always knew which item I needed and usually had it or knew where it was. And if a character had it they would, almost always, just give it to me without reservation. Without any puzzles hard enough to slow me down I had it beat in under 4 hours. And I was taking it easy, reading all the dialog choices and trying to click on everything I possibly could for extra story and dialog. Some people had it beat in an hour and some change. Classic point and click adventure games were short but only if you already knew what you were doing. The old games were hard enough to slow people down and give them a challenge so no one ever beat them that fast the first time through. Now I'm not saying it's terrible. I really like the art style and the story is interesting. It be nice if the game itself could catch up. I'd say if you want to try this, wait for a sale later down the road.			"

												Broken Age is a successfully kickstarted adventure game made by Double Fine (Psychonauts, Costume Quest, Brütal Legend) where the main thing is the new look on the environment where the story plays. Broken Age tries to blend fantasy and sci-fi into one big weird world with two protagonists. As in many other adventure games (Gemini Rue goes up to my mind at the moment), you can switch between protagonists anytime.In the world from fantasy theme view, you play as Vella, young baker girl who is just supposed to be sacrificed towards big flying Lovecraftian monster because of the tradition that promises villages not being destroyed for offering in form of young ladies. All people think of it as honor to be sacrificed, but Vella would rather pay the iron price.From futuristic theme view, you play as Shay, a boy who is living in a spaceship with his ""Mom"" and ""Dad"". Although he has a carefree life there, he gets sullen because of the repeating rutine of eating, sleeping and completing missions that should make him feel like a hero. But... even he already realised there's something not right there.You may now ask how does such different storylines can be put together in one game but that doesn't deserve a proper answer - just put up with the fact that it's possible and it's believable. That applies fully to the Act I (at the early access phase of the game, only the first act was available, so the game got a lot of praise). The second act changed opinion of many people, myself included. There are many plotholes and nonsense parts which could be overlooked if there wasn't the ending that, story-wise, feels rushed. Oh my, isn't that Double Fine's tradition? I remember similar impression from Brütal Legend! Difficulty of the game varies on, surprisingly, acts. The first act is pretty easy, you will stay in flow, happily continuing through the story. The second act rises with difficulty that can get you stuck at some moments, but I think it's still in bearable for most players. The ending is something frustrating and hard, even though it plays on lesser amount of rooms.But everything isn't worth criticizing, the game doesn't deserve it. In both acts, characters have a good sense of humour, there are many nice gags and puns. It's also worth mentioning there's more references pointed towards specific groups of people and communities than towards games. Finally a game that tries to be funny without arrow in the knee! (Even though it's a hyperbole, I still think those gaming references are overused in games that are trying to be funny.)Visual style perfectly expresses the unique world of Broken Age and I don't think there's anything to reproach, if you don't mind more room recyclation as the story is revolving just in few specific places. What almost could not be better is the voice acting that's really great! (It would be weird if it wasn't, as there are professional actors.)Conclusion:Broken Age is a disappointment for everybody who went with the hype that started with its Kickstarter campaign, because it ended up as a mediocre adventure made by well-known studio. If the game held the difficulty through all acts, and was properly finished without much nonsense around, it would be definitely great. But it isn't, it's just another point and click adventure game. Still even through the negative aspects I mentioned, I think it's worth buying on sale.			"

												Nearly every review I've read includes a huge list of problems. I'd like to point out a unique perspective in addition to the glaring issues this game presents. Broken Age and Mighty Number Nine are the reasons I refuse to subsidize another kickstarter ever again. Yuuka-Laylee would have more money if this game weren't so terrible. The game is so bad that it's hampering completely unrelated games. Not even Goat Simulator, a game that I honestly enjoyed, played longer, paid less money for and used less than 3 million dollars to create is taking money away from other prospective developers. Broken Age is empirically worse than Goat Simulator.			"

												I'm going to write something more substantial a bit later, but with the game now publicly available, I thought I'd put my +1 next to it.It's very difficult for me to separate my feelings about the game from my personal investment in the project as a whole, but I'm confident that the game stands on its own aside from that and is worthwhile, enjoyable and touching in its own right.To all my friends who helped make this happen (backers and developers alike), thank you <3Edit: In the meantime, here are some other things that might be of interest:* I chatted with Broken Age's Lead Programmer a couple of days before release https://steamlug.org/cast/s02e02* I interviewed with Broken Age's Producer and Technical Director last year http://cheesetalks.twolofbees.com/doublefine.php "

												I purchased this game based on certain positive reviews. “Act 1 of Broken Age is a gorgeous, impeccably written adventure that simultaneously tugs at my nostalgic core, while ushering in a new era for the point-and-click genre.” 9.5 – IGN “I haven’t felt this surge of nostalgia and excitement about a game in a long time, and I truly think Broken Age will be looked back fondly as one of the greats.” 9.5 – Destructoid Having beaten it in roughly 4 hours, I have to ask: Was I playing the same game? Nostolgia? New Era for Point and Click? The Greats?This game offers nothing to the genre. The Greats had action menus. large explorable worlds, plenty of red herrings (both as objects and characters), along with memorable personalities and dialogue. Broken Age has none of this. Instead, interctive action menus have been replaced by a single mouse cursor which works for all Look\Interact\Pick Up type activities. Clicking on a piece of the world causes the character to simply interact with it in only one way. The puzzles are laughable. Some of them literally require nothing more than getting to the end of a dialogue tree.I suggest you all save your money and wait for a real adventure game.			"

												I got this game because of the incredible reviews it got, but to be honest its more of a long boring movie than a game. The game is 100% dialogue... The problem is the game doesnt seem to offer much choice in what you do. Well you do have choices, but no matter what choice you make the end result is the same. Very dissapointed.			"

												Slightly disappointing.Being a true fan of point 'n' click adventure games since...well... forever, and Tim Schafer being about the closest thing to a god in the game developing world for me, it is almost unbelievable that I haven't played this game before now. I can promise that I was totally hyped about this game ever since I first heard about it when it launched on Kickstarter. Even more hyped when it broke records with funding and seemed to be an extended experience. I truly expected an epic masterpiece. A true adventure of old in new packing.Somehow I lost the hype over time, and after reading mixed reviews and critics about the business practice of Double Fine, I ended up just postponing playing the game at all. Finally I got around to it and have just played through it, and now I'm just...well... slightly disappointed.Don't get me wrong. There is lots of things to like in this game. The initial setup is creative and intriguing. From the very start I found myself asking questions about how these seperated stories were connected, and how they would conclude in the end. There were surprises and creative ways the story twisted itself throughout the game. But in the end it just felt that it was cut short. Many questions left unanswered and unsatisfying ""conclusion"".The art style was fully ok, but in my opinion it was not that great. Yet, I respect developers that dare creating something new and different approaches. Some might appreciate the art style much more than me.The dialogue and voice acting can only be praised. Tim Schafer never fails in his clever and humoristic approach to dialogue. It fits my humor to a tee, and is easily comparable to previous games he has been involved in. With actors like Elijah Wood, Jack Black, Jennifer Hale and Wil Wheaton and a team of very talented voice actors it does not fail to impress. Especially Wil Wheaton should consider to do this more often as he has a very good voice for this sort of thing.The gameplay itself varies. It has its remarkable puzzles with some mindbending solutions mixed in with some rather strange approaches to puzzle solving. Everything from the traditional backtracking to progress, typical inventory puzzles to some new odd, and mostly unexplained or poorly introduced puzzles. A rather mixed bowl of rice in other words.All in all I don't feel that it amounted to anything but a mediocre game, especially considering the track record of the brain behind this. The game has been on some great sales, in bundles and even came free with Playstation Plus, so I assume most people fans of the genre has already picked it up, but if you haven't you can be assured that you can great deals on this game in the future as well, so wait to get it until then at least. I do not feel that it is worth a full price.I just barely recommend this game, as it is recommended for fans of point 'n' click and traditional adventure games. It is likely that you would enjoy enough of this game for it to be worth your while.I give it a 6/10 ratingRemember that this review is my personal opinion and yours might vary from that. I know many that adores this game. Check out several reviews if you are in doubt of playing it.Happy GamingTJ			"

												I like puzzle games.  Monkey's island is one of my favorite games, I still will boot up old adventure games all the time. You know what I won't boot up again?  Broken Age.   In Monkey's island there's a lot of fun and silly stuff the player does, In most games it's an enjoyable story,  and Broken Age has a moment or two of that.  But it's a one or two note game, that tries to make a whole symphony.   The beginning of the game you get the choice between two characters, that seem unrelated.  There's the girl who... seems to be immediately thrown into peril without ANY backstory, so much so that I thought I skipped a cutscene.  Nope, just ""hey you're going to be imperiled to start the story!""  She has a mediocre world to explore. Then there's the boy, and honestly I like the world the boy is in far more.  Only thing is, that world goes on entirely too long, and the good parts of the world wanes fast.   If the game stopped after the first act, it'd be a good recommendable gameBut then in the second act, the game changes, and... it's not for the better in my opinion.  It's got an interesting story arc there, but does nothing with it, and it seems that you have to go.... listen I try not to do this, but I need to talk about spoilers.  It's a rather major spoiler, but if you want to know about the second act, it's below.  The Second has the boy and girl change locations, they go through the same areas and explore almost the same environments with some time has passed.  The girl's areas are quite uninteresting, and the boy's areas have already lost their charm.   There's a few good points in the second act, but after the first act, you're essentially going over the same areas, and less interested. Then again the quality of a puzzle game is based on the quality of the puzzles, and the good news is most of the puzzles are simple and easy to solve.  But that's also the bad news.  They're too simple.   Put round battery in the round battery sized hole.  ""Talking"" usually makes things almost blatantly obvious and you have to talk to everyone at least once to get all your objects anyways. Then there are the puzzles you don't get.  If you miss a slightly puzzle, the game won't hint or help you along.  You're stuck.  Hopefully you know what to do (because the game won't help you if you get lost, or return to it after a couple months) but even if you know where you want to go, you better hope you know to do X and Y, because if not, you're going to stand around and have to just stare and hope it comes to you.  Or go use a guide. And yeah that will happen, 90 percent of the puzzles are ""go elsewhere, get something and return to me""  Where 10 percent are ""you have an item that will work but we won't even hint at it.""  I know I'm annoyed at the easiness of the puzzles, but the esoteric puzzles don't even give you a hint if you're stuck.  You just either get it or you don't. Finally the story should be mentioned.  While it's a story, it feels like it's a story written for the modern generation.  Gone is the long exposition or talking.  There's beautiful moments in games like Monkey Island, where Guybrush and Elaine will talk for almost 2 minutes without player interaction.  In Broken Age there appears to be a rush.  The game almost never spends more than 2-3 lines without expecting the player to hit a button to say something.   You constantly have to choose something to say, so there's no elongated exposition. Everything is rushed along, and quite a few parts of the game could use a little more talking such as the beginning of the game.  The story never fully develops and now in hindsight I barely remember anything that was truly unique or I'd want to see again.  I compare this to Monkey's Island again, where Elaine and Guybrush meeting, the three pirates, Stan the boat seller, and even the insult fighting are all amazing moments I could enjoy again and again.   To me that was a better story, this well, this isn't what I was expecting when I funded the kickstarter.It's a shame because while act one is acceptable, I can't in good conscious recommend this game to anyone.  I'd recommend Monkey's Island, Grim Fandago, maybe the King's quest games, or the most games from Telltale game instead of this game.  But Broken Age, it was an interesting Kickstarter, but not a very good game, sadly. (Note I backed the game on kickstarter, I played the game on Ps4, as part of Playstation Plus.  I did pay for this copy)			"

												One of the biggest Kickstarter projects ever, developed by legendary Tim Shafer is sadly, one of the biggest gaming let downs I experienced in recent years. While Act1 of this P&C adventure was fun, enjoyable, nostalgic ride with balanced difficulty and amazing story potential, Act2 feels rushed and unfinished. As Vella and Shay you revisit same exact locations as in part one, to do some of the most annoying puzzles I had the displeasure of solving. That was a throwback to ""good old days"" I did not expect.What caught me by surprise is how all character development from Act1 was seemingly replaced by almost nothing at all. Have you ever wondered how Vella's rebellion against decades-old traditions will resolve? How will her family and whole community of Sugar Bunting will react once she returns? Perhaps you wanted to know if Shay will manage to break free from his patronising prison? Being so used to infantile challenges how will he cope with harsh reality? Well, you certainly won't get the satisfying answers here. Broken Age just suddenly stops being a game that explores the themes of adolescence in unusual situations and complexities of being a teenager and becomes convoluted mess that pulls out plot points from nowhere. Can't recommend at this price. Not a bad game, but very disappointing one.			"

												A lot of people are going to be including the question ""was it worth the wait?"" in their reviews of Broken Age so I think I'll start by saying that I don't intend to answer that. This game will be around for a long time and I want this review to reflect what I thought of the game, not the zeitgeist.Let's also discard the obvious: Broken Age is a beautiful game and the music is excellent. The art design along with the superb voice acting is one of the best parts of the game. You won't find a single sour performance or disinterested NPC in the entire game, I promise you that.Is it a good adventure game, though? Well, yes. Is it GREAT? No. You better keep reading, though, because the ""why"" behind that answer is more important than the answer. Puzzle design in the ""Act 1"" area was genuinely good if not a bit easy. I didn't find myself ever having to ask online for a hint and I didn't get stuck to the point of frustration. It was a very smooth ride all and all. ""Act 2"" shatters this perception and introduces puzzles that, while somewhat logical, are terribly designed. One example of this is the tube puzzle at the beginning of Vela's second chapter. The puzzle itself makes sense, but the way one interact with objects is wonky. Often I found that clicking on something to move it required me to hold down the button and drag, oftentimes I only needed to click and move. The worst part of the puzzle is that the entire thing could have occupied one screen, but it was  split in half which make moving pieces between the two halves awkward. Luckily, the solution to the puzzle is apparent very quickly so it's really only the wonky interface blocking your progress. This seems to often be the case. The game's final puzzle is huge and intricate, and seemingly involves time-based maneuvers when, in actuality, it uses very illogical movement triggers instead. Instead of giving the feeling that characters are working together to solve a puzzle, it becomes a tedious trial and error affair long after you figure out the entire solution. Sadly, I think the poorly designed puzzles would often dampen my enjoyment of what was otherwise a funny or emotional moment.The good news, though, is that puzzle design is my only gripe. It's not insignificant. There is one mechanic that was NEVER used in the first game that gets used a few times without any subtle prompting, but I won't spoil it because I consider it a puzzle solution in and of itself.After all this, why should am I recommending that you buy Broken Age? Simple, because those things I just described were present in Grim Fandango, they were present in Day of the Tentacle, and they were in Full Throttle as well. This game feels old school in the best and worst ways. Plus, the characters are fantastic. Every one of them is so well-written and bursting with personality that I would easily drop money on a Broken Age 2 right now just to see more of them. The story reminds me of Schafer's Full Throttle. It has an excellent flow, but just kind of ends. Not in a BAD way, mind you, but in a way that says, ""this story isn't over"" without sequel baiting.Fans of adventure games old and new owe it to themselves to play this game. As long as you understand that it's not a flawless puzzler then you will find beauty and comedy that will make you laugh out loud at time. It captures that mix of wit and almost fatalistic mirth that makes Tim Schafer one of my favorite video game writers (and Doublefine such a fine team). It's a flawed gem, but still a very valuable one and well woth playing.			"

												Awful mess. Just awful.I wish I could praise this game I really do. It's just not possible. I even held out judgement until the second act was released.I could argue for the antiquated mechanics but still it's that one puzzle whe Shea needs to program a robot, and the robot's programming uses shapes seen all across his own ship. So as vella you explore his ship for some kind of robot programming clue and nothing. Then once you spend 2 hours and give up and cheat do they say ""Oh on the blackboard of the picture with Shae with his mom is a small image of the pattern you need"" That alone made this a terrible experience because that is the second of Shae's puzzles and the rest of his are in the same vein where they simply expect you to just figure these things out through complete nonsense backwards logic. I don't mind fetch quests, and having to try multiple times, and even having to pay attention to obscure clues. (One of my favorite games is Myst.) But if you're going to decide that the player now needs to keep a collection of screenshots half a gig large just to solve your games puzzles then ef you. You don't deserve to make games. That is too much useless work and my comp notebook of Riven notes agrees too. "

												The puzzles in act 2 especially were so poorly done. Why on earth would Shay know what Vella is seeing, and vice versa? I was kind of forgiving it while playing because I was under some misplaced impression there might be some sort of connection between the two. That wiring garbage, character switching, and constant backtracking absolutely halted the progression of the game and cheaply inflated the playtime and frustration levels.Vella's voice acting, and Vella's mother and father felt wholly unmotivated and sleepy. The ending was too abrupt, and explained nothing. It honestly felt like there should have been an act 3 that got completely cut.SUPER bummed with Act 2 after such a strong setup from act 1. Wait until you are super bored and it has hit the cheapest of bargain bins if you are feeling curious about this one, and even then only if you can forgive some truly tedious puzzle design that is totally unintuitive, and random so guides are of no help. Like each player gets their own little unique slice of hell to suffer through to earn having nothing explained to you at the end.			"

												So disappointed. The first half was engaging and fun. Gave some idea of where to go and how to get the story train chugging along. Second half we get *spoilers* baddies we don't get to fight, no defined reason for why any of this is happening (seriously pick a reason, I can think of at least FIVE right now that are better than ""Oou~ It's a mystery! 2Spooky4u~!"") and robot rewiring OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I mean are Shay and Vella psychic? It's the only way they'd know how to rewire robots with information that only ONE of them has access too...The final puzzle has NO explination of how or why it should be happening. Hello! There's an item you had to fix that would allow coordination of information and formation of a plan between Shay and Vella.TL;DR: In short I'm glad a friend got this game for me when it was on sale before Act 2 came out. Act 1 was fun, 2 can take a flying leap.			"

												The first 4 or so hours (the first episode) of this game seem like a well paced adventure game, then everything sorta drags in the rest of it. The game has some great characters and a interesting setting, but the a very sparse number of environment and lack of scope really hinder the ""adventure"" aspect of this game. The puzzles are about on the tedious level of old adventure games, but a lack of space between them really makes the game feel more like work, and the narrative payoff really isn't that great at the end. Those great characters and setting feel underused when the game finishes.			"

												With Act 1 and 2, the game took around 9 hours to finish. The atmosphere and character dialogue was really well done.The puzzles were really easy, usually requiring talking to someone and get something from them to complete the puzzle. They were not fun.The game mechanic that allows you to switch characters was rarely needed. Only on two occasions would you need to use it. There should've been more usage of this.The main plot of the story was alright, but nothing special. Overall, the game was nice while it lasted, but nothing special. I don't really recommend it unless the price was dropped to $10 and even then, there are numerous other point and click games with great plots and interesting puzzles.			"

												I heard a lot of good things about this game after it was released, and I gotta say that it really lives up to the hype.  The art style is fantastic and justifies the price point all on its own, in my opinion.  There were so many points where I found myself sitting back for a moment and just admiring the character designs and scenery.  In addition, the voices suited each character, and obviously, the celebrity cameos were well-done and a joy to behold - not to mention the soundtrack.  I'm so glad I snatched up the OST when I bought this!  :PMoving on to story, I really enjoyed both Vella and Shay's respective storylines.  Vella's was really unnerving with the way other characters seemed to feel about the current state of the world (except for her grandfather, of course), and Shay, well...  I didn't expect any of that.  The end of Act 1 actually really surprised me, and I'm itching to play Act 2 now.  That's really the only downside to this game: the length.  I knew it would be short, but after getting into the story so much, I'm just sad that I have to wait to find out more.  If anything though, it just goes to show how well this game has been executed.  I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.			"

												How did one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns of all time turn into this shlop? I am a slow paced gamer. I like to waddle around and smell the pixels. I appreciate the acrylic backgrounds and beautifully voiced characters. This game may be categorized under ""puzzle games,"" but if you play it for the puzzles, you would be far more entertained by Freddie Fish. Rather, this is more like a beautiful children's book about the perils of being a teenager and growing into adulthood-something all of us can relate to (Except bronies. Boom! Shots fired!). Yet, it failed miserably to live up to its potential. Rather than dwelling into the complexities of human emotion, the plotline fell apart like cottage cheese. The player was sent around doing meaningless tasks that did not in any shape, way, or form contribute to either the story or character development. Hastily built plothole bandaids were dumped like so much dog s*** onto the unsuspecting player. Every character's personality was rendered in glorious 2-D. Nobody was the least bit affected by the traumatization that they experienced. No explanation was given concerning the constant breaches of the fourth wall made by the omnipresent player. Needless to say, this was painful to play. My hopes have been dashed, and I am beyond disappointed with how long I waited for this game.			"

												Time for another review from me! So, here is Broken Age -- Tim Schäfer's first true Point n' Click adventure since Grim Fandango. It's been a while but it's amazing to see him return to the form. This is his hometurf and what he does best. But does it hold up to his usual standard. I'd certainly say so. Now some may say that the game's puzzles (which adventure games are so famous for) are fairly straigtforward. To a degree, they are, but I found myself thinking a bit every now and then.Disregarding all that  -- The comedy and charm is as strong as ever -- You play as 2 characters this time, in 2 different settings, but both of them are related to the other in some way, which you'll discover as you play. First of we got Mr. Frodo, going by the name of Shay, who's a rather ordinary teenage boy, trapped in what most 10-12 year old boys might consider a Utopia, but Shay considers it a dull routine of nightmarish proportions.. because everything is done for you (You know, like how the gaming industry of today is -- Hurr, hurr) or in other words, just dull (like how we all felt during our mid-teens). Shay gets to live in futuristic space-ship, alongside an overprotective AI Motherbrain, who sees to his every needs (Feeding him with a spoon, tucking him in bed, turn every day adventure into easy mode --lol--). His life is basically devoid of excitement in an otherwise adventurous-looking setting --  Shay, getting bored of this ridiculous pretense, decides to flee from it, and accept an invitation from an ominous looking wolf-dressed man named Marek, ready to show him the true hardships of life and how sucky it can be sometimes. Meanwhile in a rural village is our other protagonist, Villa, who's just about ready for the traditional Maiden's Feast, involving her getting eaten by a Lovecraftian monstrosity. Neat. In true Tim Schäfer style, all of the characters feel and act rather mundane but to an absurd degree. They all seem to think of the Maiden's Feast as an exciting celebration, like it was Christmas, despite it revolving around sacrificing innocent girls to be eaten by a cosmic monstrosity. Villa being the protagonist, asks what we are all thinking.. ""Why the bleeding hell don't we just kill the damn thing?"". But no, that would be going against a tradition that no one seems to bother changing because new things are scary, just like in real life -- And there you got it. So as the tentacle beast devours the Maidens, Villa being the only rational human being left, decides to flee and learn how to kill the monster and save her village. It doesn't take long 'till Villa comes across an array of interesting caricatures, whom she has to help in order to proceed -- Among my favorites is the rather 'baked' lumberjack fellow named Curtis & the leader of the Cloud society, Meriloft, voiced by Jack Black. True to its adventure roots, the game has various interpretations of keys for various interpretations of doors, which the player has to figure out in order to proceed. The puzzles are definitely still there but they are not at the league of more complex puzzles like that of the Silent Hill 2-3 games or older Schäfer adventures. What really sells this game is the humor, the characters, the artwork and especially the music. It's all very, very, gorgeous and this is how Adventure games are done -- Where Schäfer shines and Telltale does not. It's recommended to do Shay's story first, then finish it with Villa since her story is a bit longer. An actual negative I can give about the game is the fact that what you're getting isn't the whole game -- Act 2 is still in the making, but it'll be for free whenever, and thus obviously the game ends on a cliff-hanger, but an intriguing one nevertheless. Lastly, I musn't forget. On the audio side you might notice the voicing talents of Jennifer Hale, Will Wheaton, Jack Black (returning from previous Double Fine game Brütal Legend and of course Elijah Wood himself -- Mr. Frodo). All of them do a superb job of enriching the adventure game experience by adding their sharp voices to the humor. Schäfer's voice director has done a splendid job to utilize all of the famous voices correctly. So a thumbs up for that and you'll have to forgive me for not mentioning the other voices, because there are certainly a few noteworthy ones. From a spaceship with talking cutlery, to a cloud society of sky people living with birds -- What you're getting is the Tim Schäfer experience that you'll recognize. So if enjoyed previous Double Fine games or the old LucasArts adventures, then don't cheat yourself out of this experience. While the game isn't complete yet, it is still very much worth it. But it might adviceable to wait a bit before one delves into it when the whole game is complete.			"

												This game contains 10 hours of gameplay max and that's if you're completely clueless about how to solve the types of puzzles this game uses. And while I found the first half of the story to be engaging but as it unravels in the second half the pay-off seemed really insincere and phoned in.  I also can't understand how they needed so many people and so much time to create this game, other than the full voice track and hand-drawn style art there isn't much complexity. It's overall very short and simple. In summation, it's nice to see a new point and click adventure and parts are entertaining but  it's not worth what they're charging for it don't pay full price for it. $5-$10 is about what it's worth. If you have never played Grim Fandango, go play the remaster of that first.			"

												Act 1 is fantastic, but Act 2 takes everything that Act 1 set up and drives it straight into the ground.Characters cease developing, game becomes hours of walking and backtracking and trial and error, with puzzles that border on moon logic being sprinkled about. The ending fails to actually bring ANYTHING in the story to conclusion whatsoever, with Act 2 only adding more gaps in the plot that are never discussed, covered, or concluded in any way shape or form. Some characters even had their personalities from Act 1 negated or ruined.Act 2 ruined this game completely, and it is not worth purchasing whatsoever anymore. Double Fine has fallen far and hard.

												SCORE: 3/10 (points given for art and voice acting only, as gameplay and fun are 0/10)Broken Age was a disaster of a puzzle game and I was so frustrated by the second half. It destroyed any hope of a good game that existed in the first half. THE PUZZLES WERE RIDICULOUS, OBSCURE, UNINTUITIVE, AND JUST TERRIBLY ANNOYING. The three worst puzzles were the all those horrible rewiring and the switching back and forth at the end.This will be my last Double Fine game and has really turned me off to puzzle games in general. They are just not fun anymore. The game was a hot mess in the sense that fresh vomit is. I became increasingly frustrated and disappointed as the game went on.			"

												Act I is delightful, charming, fun. Act II tries too hard to please the Point'n'click core audience and their incomprehensible, unshakable love for the tenets of traditional point and clicks, including terrible puzzles that are at odds with the development, and telling, of the story.Though I'm not quite as disappointed as John, I wouldn't go as far as to say the story of Act II is 'an awful mess', for an instance, Act II is indeed a disappointment given the accomplishments of Act I, and while I think he is spot on about so many things, and that that's worth a read even if you disagree, ultimately Act II elicited more of an ""oh."" from me - expectations probably play a role here, as I tend generally to try and play games as a blank slate, and often manage to come in with close to none.So, thumbs up or down? tough one: there's so much to like; the art is absolutely amazing, the music is good, and the voice-overs are both well made and a breath of fresh air from the usual TTG voice set, as fantastic as that is. Act I does work very well, with fun writing too, but the second part of the game ultimately breaks the promise of being something more than a very traditional PnC. I could have lived with the almost complete asset reuse, but the underwhelming development and focus on obtuse puzzles spoiled my enjoyment. The UI is pretty clumsy for today's adventure games standards, as well, too much of a concession to mobile platforms, with frequent loading screens that are never seen in native adventures.All in all, if you can put up with Act II, and the good things I mentioned sound like enough for you, then by all means get it: just don't let Act I push your hopes up too much. If you're more the type who would love to see narrative-driven games move past tradition and on to something better, and more accomplished, there are better games to play.			"

												Broken Age is a story driven point-and-click 'adventure' game in the vain of the old classics such as Grim Fandango.When I bought this game, both acts were already available to play back-to-back. Apparently though, when Broken Age was just released, act II was unavailable for quite a while. That's pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥to begin with, because act I is about 2-3 hours long, even while exploring and trying everything there is to see.Though Act I was pretty short, it was easily the best part of the game. You choose between 2 protagonists in vastly different settings, and can switch between them freely to progress their stories. All of the puzzles and riddles and what not are pretty logical, and as mentioned, the fact that you can switch between 2 different characters means even if you're stuck, you can always try something else for a while.The only negative thing here would be that the game could be too easy for you if you're a seasoned Point and Click player.Still, there are some stupid puzzles in the latter half of Act I, but all in all, act I was pretty good.Act II is where the ♥♥♥♥♥torm starts.I don't want to spoil anything, even though the game is pretty old by now, but there is not much new stuff to see in the second act. The plot gets pretty ridiculous pretty fast, and the puzzles get a lot less fun. Most puzzles in act II required me to have a walkthrough open in another window just to progress. Maybe that's just because I'm a bit stupid, but I think most people would agree that act II was a serious downgrade from act I.In the end, the story has a pretty mediocre ending, and the game isn't really memorable at all.The voice acting and art-style are pretty amazing though, a lot of celebritys lended their voice to this project, but ultimately, in my opinion, I wouldn't recognize this game, as it's a bit short and a bit mediocre to really buy it for 23€			"

												Broken Age is a beautifully crafted experience that is unfortunately somewhat marred by the dramatic increase in puzzle difficulty in the second part of the game which comes too suddenly and will therefore likely take players off guard. The game follows two separate coming-of-age stories, one centred on the boy Shay and the other on the girl Vella – the two live in different worlds but find out that their lives are intertwined in a surprising way. Broken Age was clearly crafted with a lot of love and care, and the production quality is outstanding. The writing is great, the voice acting is exemplary and the art is simply gorgeous. The  game looks hand-painted and it is clear that a lot of effort went into making it look beautiful and feel unique. The game's world is not all that big, but every location is different and new, and there are many interesting characters. One of the protagonists, Shay, is voiced by Elijah Wood, who is apparently a big fan of adventure games and asked if he could be involved in the project. Some other famous names are in the game as well: Jack Black does a great job voicing the cult leader H'rmony, Will Wheaton appears as a lumberjack afraid of trees, while the amazing Jennifer Hale (voice of FemShep in Mass Effect) is present as the ship's Mom computer.The writing might be my favourite part of the game, the dialogue is really well written and frequently contains a lot of humour, like the lines Vella delivers to make a tree vomit, practically anything involving Shay's yarn pals, or the responses from Shay's talking utensils. It is a really great game in many aspects.However, Broken Age also has one (pretty big) problem, which players who played the game upon completion, as opposed to playing Act 1 first and then Act 2 a year later, might have felt more acutely: the puzzles in the second part of the game are much more complex and difficult to figure out. What started as very much a casual experience – the puzzles in the first half of the game are most of the time quite simple to figure out – suddenly turns into something much more challenging and different from what came before. Broken Age was originally released in two parts, with over a year between the release of the first part and the release of the complete game. In the documentary about the making of the game,* it is clear that the developers felt that they should make the puzzles in Act 2 more difficult because players would have learned from the puzzles in Act 1 and would expect a greater challenge in Act 2. However, playing through the game as a whole, the sudden spike in difficulty halfway through feels like it came out of nowhere and takes the player by surprise. It is something that makes the experience feel disjointed, since the entire first half of the game sets the player up for a specific kind of experience which is then pretty radically changed. The puzzles in the second half are not impossible; some of them might try the player's patience but for the most part they are well thought out. However, they will require the player to rethink how they approach them halfway through the game and that switch might be somewhat jarring for some, or even annoying if a casual experience was one of the things that drew them to the game. On the other hand, some players will probably welcome the more challenging puzzles of the second part, feeling that it is the puzzle experience they were looking for.*The documentary is called Double Fine Adventure and is available in its entirety on Double Fine's YouTube page. It consists of 20 episodes and follows the entire development cycle of the game, from the Kickstarter in 2012 to the game's completion in 2015. If you are even remotely interested in how games are developed, I strongly urge you to watch the documentary because it is incredibly insightful.			"

												The ""TL; DR"" Version:  don't bother buying and playing, just watch the playthrough on Youtube and only buy the soundtrack.  The ""I have time to read"" version:I ended up being so unhappy with this game.  The first half was GREAT!  A lot of fun, challenging, and had hilarious dialogue.  The second half, however, was HORRIBLE!All of that work for nearly impossible tasks, extremely convoluted and ""what the bleep was that?!"" solutions, and characters that didn't grow or change.  Not to mention that it was quite late in being released.Tim Schaffer comes up with some awesome ideas, some of them successful, like the amazing Psychonauts, Stacked and Costume Quest games.  Brutal Legend had a fantastic storyline and the greatest car playlist I have ever heard, but really bad battle dynamics.This game though...poorly thought out, frustrating as all get-out and not worth your time.  The villian made no sense; he was like Don John in ""Much Ado About Nothing"": a bad guy just to be a bad guy, no other reason.  I ended up giving up on the second half of the game and watching a Youtube walktrhough and found THAT disappointing.It felt like such a rip-off; I am so glad that I didn't back this game or else I'd be a heck of a lot meaner than this!  Schaffer needs to be just an ideas man, pitching them to the big companies, and let other people develop them for him.  In my own personal opinion, it was a huge bust and I regret buying the game.

												Given how long it took them to make Act 2, you think they would have remembered to make it fun or engaging. Alas, they took the premise of Act 1 and crapped all over it, substituting plot, character development and appeal for too-hard puzzles. Done properly, completing said puzzles should have felt rewarding and engaging, instead it's 'thank god that's over with'. The story tries to answer everything by answering nothing and all you're left with at the end is a feeling of 'that's it?'			"

												I believe in Tim Schafer and the crew at Double Fine and their ability to design and make an excellent game. So much so that I was one of the intial Kickstarters of the game. ($100 level) Well, me and about 90,000 other friends all decided to put our money were our mouth is and allow these guys to prove their game design skills to the rest of us. I am not disappointed!If you like adventure games, then chances are you will enjoy this game. If you are new to them, then be ready for a different experience than most games. For those unfamiliar with the genre, adventure games are about the story and the journey, not the destination. These kind of games are not about the high score, the action or the grinding enough XP to get to the next level. It is the kind of a game were you can sit back and play the game at your own pace. There is plenty of good humor for young and old alike. Of course there are puzzles that will test your lateral thinking and creativity. Elijah Woods, Wil Wheaton, Jack Black and the creator of Adventure Time and others... they all add their voices to the acting and story of the game.I do not want to give away too many details, but being that this game was one of the most successful kick-starters ever, I suggest you do your research. Take time to watch any youtube videos you can about it. I think you will find that this game is a true piece of art.			"

												TLDR: The first act hooked me. The second act had me just going through the motions, wanting it to end. The ending left me disapointed. Ended up not being as good of a story as it could have been.The Good: The story was simplistic but cool. It's very light hearted, and has a good feel to it. The art and animation is also very good.The Bad:A lot of time and money was sunk into this for a game that's so short and poorly designed. I bought this game at full price a year ago because I heard good things, but I only got half a game. The second half was just now released. The second act doesn't contain many new locations. It's completely based on everything from the first act, so I'm baffled as to what took them so long. The puzzles are poor, and sometimes the hints are so vague, I imagine many people will get stuck and give up. It's not because they are stupid, or that the puzzles are hard, but rather because the puzzles don't make sense. Also, the last hour of the second act is just you doing wiring diagrams, tedious and boring.			"

												The story is great and all but act 2 feels really rushed.  like how vella's family is suddenly friends with those cloud people she randomly met when shay visits the cloud. When did they even get there? How did they get so close? Why did the developers recycle the same characters and scenery?  And once you finish act one the puzzles are just impossible to figure out. Even the solutions make very little sense when you find them in a guide. I only checked the community guides once or twice for act 1 but I need to constantly tab out to them for act 2, which I've only finished half of so far because it gets so frustrating all the time. It could have been done so much better but they rushed it instead. Ugh.So anyway, I would only reccomend this if you're buying it on sale and don't mind having to check a guide every now and then. If you enjoyed other double fine games like stacking then you'll love act one because the puzzle difficulty is about the same. Otherwise nope.			"

												Overall, both acts of Broken Age left me disappointed. One might say, a double failed adventure.The game has some things that work well, like the animation, the graphics and everything audio.For those wondering where the multi million budgetdisappeared, I assume the famous voiceovers are partialy to blame. Is Jack Black's or Elijah Wood's voices essential to the enjoyment of this game? Not when it comes at the expense of the actual gameplay.I've read on the forums some complaints about the difficulty of the puzzles. As a longtime adventure point and click aficionada, I thought they were of medium difficulty and if you really took the time to look for the solution, you would eventually find it (with one or two exceptions - like the wire puzzle). The main problem of the game is that it is tedious. The characters and the story are very unidimensional, there is no real substance, no nuances to them and the puzzles are there only so that you have something to do towards ending the game. There are so many loose ends, so many missed opportunities, you can only wonder how much thought they actually put in the game. In the end, you don't really care about any of the characters, you're glad it's over. The cherry on top, after two years of waiting for a full game, you get an incomplete ending that seems to suggest there will be a third act. I see that as a slap in the face of everybody who ever payed for this game.  I left my original review at the bottom part of this comment.First of all, cannot believe they still haven't released the second part yet.  They could have delivered a full game only on the money they got from Kickstarter. Yes, the graphics are nice but other developers deliver similar or even better animations on less than half of that budget. Regarding the story: at first, I felt it had a lot of potential, but it turned out to be pretty dull. The characters are not interesting and the puzzles are uninspired. I cannot fully rate it, because I could only play half of it, but I definitely put a pin in this game creator. There are other lesser known but better games out there like The Chronicles of Zerzura, the Chains of Satinav etc			"

												Broken age is the game that really got kickstarter started for games. While it's not the first game, it helped opening the floodgates. And a lot of great games have come out of kickstarter. So, how does Broken Age hold up?Let me just start this review with saying that no, I've not actually beaten the game.. And I don't feel like doing so, despite having less than 1/3 of it left. That's probably saying a lot about the game.Graphics & SoundBroken Age has a very distinct art style. While it might not have the most advanced graphics on the market, it has its own visual identity. If it looks good or not, well that's up to each and every one of us to decide, but the screenshots are representative. The game looks like it does in the screenshots. Personally, I'm a fan of it, I think it's a very pleasing art style. Some of the animations do look a bit off though, and the character models sometimes look like they're not really a part of the world, but overlayed on it. For the most part though, it looks good.One can't talk about Broken Age without mentioning the voice acting. It's excellent. The voice actors all convey the personalities of the characters really well, and it does not sound phoned in. Looking at the list of voice actors this is not surprising though, these are veteran voice actors. The soundtrack is no slouch either, and while it's unlikely to be remembered as one of the all time greatest, it works well with the game, and actually sounds really good. Story & SettingBroken age follows two different characters, Vella & Shay, who live very different lives. Vella grew up in a colourful fantasy world, terrorized by a big beast who demands a sacrifice of maidens (and she is one of the maidens who's going to be sacrificed), while Shay lives on board a space ship that caters to his every needs. And never the two shall meet. Or so it feels at least, during half the game. The two characters are entirely separate, and their stories don't seem to relate in any meaningful way. And this, I feel, was a mistake. As the two stories are so disconnected from each other, it's easy to just focus on one character at a time and ignoring the other. The stories do of course end up crossing each other, but then they split again.I found Vella to both have a more compelling story, and to be a more interesting character. Shay just felt a bit bland, where when I was playing through Vella's story I found the game interesting and it motivated me to push forward. GameplayThis is a traditional adventure game, in the vein of the games made by Lucas Arts in the mid 90's. Puzzles are mostly inventory based. Find the item that goes with the other item or character, which gives you an item that you then can use to solve a puzzle that gives you another item. It's all very traditional, and there's nothing wrong with that. The issue are with the puzzles. During the first half of the game you're mostly confined to small areas with few items, so even if you can't figure out a logical way for the items to fit together, you don't have many combinations to worry about, so brute-forcing puzzles is easy. During the second half the puzzles gets more involved, but they also don't make much sense. Even after having solved some puzzles, I don't know how I was supposed to know what to do. Moon logic is often used to describe puzzles like these, puzzles that don't make much logical sense, and there's a good amount of moon logic in Broken Age. The worst offenders are the puzzles that require you to use one character in order to find hints on how to solve puzzles for the other character, where the two characters have no way of communicating with each other. It does not make much sense to switch to another character in order to solve a puzzle when they have no way of interacting. The game also does not communicate that you should do this, and in the first half of the game it teaches you that you don't need to switch characters to solve puzzles.Final ThoughtsWhile Broken Age is by no means terrible, I feel that I can't recommend it. The moon logic puzzles in the second act and a story where only one half feels compelling just killed it for me. Had the stories been more intertwined and the puzzles better, this game could have been a winner, but as it stands, it just feels like wasted potential.			"

												I wish I could recommend this game, really.However, after a long wait for its second half I find it hard to say the wait was worth it. The game still looks good and is nicely voice acted, but the story just ends up having a conclusion that leaves far too many things open ended. And in this sort of game the writing is the ""make or break"" feature for me. So if you want a nice little family game that might entertain you for a few hours, go ahead and get it. Just don't expect anything stellar.			"

												I love broken age. Everything about it brings memories of the games I used to play as a child. The voice acting is flawless, the graphics are very beautiful in a unique kind of way, and the story line is genious, not to mention the humour that anyone of all ages can enjoy. I loved every single moment of this brilliant point and click title.However, there is only one flaw to this game, it only took me 3.4 hours to finish! I know that there will be another act coming out soon, which may be roughly another 4 hours; but 30$ for a 7.4 hours game is a bit much. For replay value, I could see my friends giving it a try, but it would be hard to enjoy the story knowing what happens at the end of the act and all the jokes in between.Do I reccomend this game? On sale, it's a must buy. Not on sale, wait for the second act to come out.			"

												The first act was okayish and Schafer still got the benefit of the doubt. The second part is a seminar in terrible, horrible, adventure game design. I powered through using a walkthrough after wasting five hours of my life figuring out purposefully obtuse puzzles, based on ""let's make this last way longer than it should"" logic.As far as I'm concerned, I'd have to read glowing reviews from the world over to ever consider purchasing a Schafer game again, even on heavy discount.

													I don’t think Tim Schafer needs much introduction as his brilliant works speak for him. But can Broken Age be put among his best creations? In my humble opinion, it definitely can. All the characteristic features are present: captivating storyline, original setting, interesting (and many quite absurd) characters, dialogues filled with humour, top-notch voice acting, good music…	Broken Age is a story of a girl and a boy, each one with unique circumstances, that try to escape from their destiny, but the way this story is told is unlike any other you may have ever read. I don’t want to spoil the game by revealing the details, but, if you like the games of Double Fine Productions or good adventure games in general, I can pretty much guarantee you won’t be disappointed. I, for one, have barely noticed how I’ve spent 20 hours playing, reading, laughing, solving puzzles and, most of all, enjoying the ride.	Surely, if you want to, you will likely find some weak points in Broken Age, but as it never was my intention, I can truthfully say that those 20 hours were like a breath of fresh air.	Highly recommended. Period.			"

												Broken age was released in 2 parts.I'd say PART 1 was a 10/10 for me. I loved the writing, the storytelling, the puzzles, the meeting of so many characters, etc etc. Lots of funny writing and moments that actually had me laughing out loud.PART 2 was more like a 5/10. The story really goes downhill, the puzzle difficulty has some serious spikes and just aren't as fun, the pacing and everything feels extremely rushed, you don't really meet any completely new characters, the writing is much lower quality, you don't go to any new locations, and all in all everything just feels very rushed and stripped down. It doesn't feel like the beginning of something great that part 1 felt like. In the end I've got to give the game as a whole a thumbs down, I just can't recommend the whole thing for the price. When it goes on a good sale definitely pick it up just for act 1 even, but there are definitely better point and clicks to play right now, like the Monkey Island games.			"

												Its a good game but only half of one. It pains me to say that kinda thing, but after a year from the release of a 5 hour game its kinda hard to keep waiting for this. Don't get sucked into the this game because its probably not going to be finished considering they got more than triple of what they asked for and didnt release act after they said they would. Its good. But not finished.			"

												Broken Age is so unbelievably unsatisfying that I can safely say that Tim Schafer will never bring back point and click adventure games to any previous level of grandeur. Vella's voice acting is atrocious, but the main problem is that after the first, semi-decent ""setup"" of a first act, the second act retreads old grounds, literally, constantly. Puzzles involve running back and forth in areas already explored, testing player patience with puzzles that require some setup and then backtracking multiple times to solve. Broken Age's final puzzle is the distillation of everything the could be considered backtracking. It's backtracking incarnate. It's apex backtracking. It's so extraordinarily dry that it is only trumped in unpleasantness by the extremely terrible story. Many assets are not really ""high res"", and often in closeup shots things are pixelated, but that's the least of the game's problems. You spend more time requiring robots than you do exploring this tiny, miniature slice of the ""world"" they've created, which honestly is not really delved in to much, which is probably a good thing considering anything they attempt to explain or justify makes no sense, but for some reason seems ""logical"" to the participants in the story. Many of the jokes are okay, but the majority of the show is stolen by sentient silverware and other bit characters with excellent voice actors; it's more delivery rather than what they are saying, which is derivative most of the time of Tim's other works, collaborative or otherwise. It's not bad, but it's not an amazing experience (Day of the Tentacle) or what I'd call his magnum opus.I made a terrible, terrible mistake backing this game. I regret ever suggesting that donating to this was a good idea. It was a three and a half year blueballing. Double Fine's been coasting on the critical success of Psychonauts for a decade now, and honestly they really need to get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and beg Ron Gilbert to join them if they ever think of making another point and click again. All of these old point and click games had teams of designers and writers that made them great, and Tim's not able to fill that position on his own, obviously.			"

												Nice not-so-long point-click adventure!, first time took me like 8 hs!You can beat it in less than an hour tho, there's even an achievement for that :)Alright, this game has pretty good ratings and it's a solid experience if you're into this genre, the cartooney graphic style was nice, dubbing & sounds are actually pretty good! There were at least two characters that I instantly recognized!While typing this review I googled the cast list and sure enough it confirmed it for me: Shay (the ""kid"") one of the players you control, is voiced by Elijah Wood, other guy who's name I won't spoil here, is voiced by Jack Black, and if you've watched The Big Bang Theory, or Flubber, or Star Trek, you'll find Wil (yes, with just one L) Wheaton. Here's the kicker: the guy you'll met later, -whom think he's but in the end he isn't- well his voice reminded me to Jake Baldino, (Gameranx YT), I don't know, must be the way he talks :PYou can check the full list here[www.imdb.com] if you want.So, controls, short but not too sweet, you'll only click, items, inventory, dialogues and to move your character. Controls were ok, just what you'd expect from a P&C adventure BUT this is inevitably linked to CAMERA.. yeah, It wasn't awful but it could have been better; when you have to come and go, back and forth, you'd find yourself doing some backtracking, it's never too long or too far, its somewhat awkward because when you reach screen limit, it does not scroll; you will need to keep clicking until you reach it and only then you'd be able to finally move to another screen.Luckily this doesn't happen always and it's only during certain events where you have to hurry up or specially if you're going for the Let's Get This Good Time Over With achievement, beat the game under 1 hour. It was more of an annoyance rather than a problem or an issue, since it's a short well done adventure I won't count it as a negative aspect, just thought of mentioning it.Let's see, what else.. in case you don't know, you'd play with either character and you can switch to the other one whenever you want, except especial events of course.You can in fact complete the entire Act 1 (there's 2, total) with one character without having to switch until you're done. Act 2 requires you to go see certain info in order to procede...This game was gifted to me by a friend, after he saw I (unsuccessfully) attempted to win this game (almost 50 times!) in certain giveaway site, this however does not affect the recommendation nor my humble view of the game.At this moment, you can buy Broken Age (along with Titan Souls and Lumino City) from Tier 1 Day of the Devs 2016 HumbleBundle.There is no replayability if not for achievement hunter challenges; pretty much all what happens is scripted and results -as far as I know- are always the same. You can't change the outcome.Overall I liked it, the jokes, puns, (that knife & spoon lines are awesome! :D ), voice castings and the rest of things make this game a good enjoyable one. Recommended!			"

												Act 1 is really cool. Beautiful art style, fun characters, decent puzzles, great story.Act 2 is a giant middlefinger-and-shrug combo to anyone who played Act 1.Absurdly stupid plot twists that make Darkseed 2 seem brilliant.Atrocious puzzles. Boring and lazy exploration.Abandonment of pretty much every plot thread and character motivation set up by Act 1.Play Telltale games instead, to be honest.			"

												(Note: I'm a backer for Broken Age and it's currently one of the only ways to actually play the game. My money supported Broken Age so I'm obviously biased. Nevertheless, this review is for non-backers who are interested in purchasing Broken Age.)Broken Age is both a huge risk for Double Fine and a return to form for them. Broken Age's origin is a popular one of initially a small revival of the old school adventure game genre with a small asking price of 400k. This was back when Kickstarter wasn't the monolithic giant that it is now. The project raised much more than that and went as high as 3.4 million dollars. The development of Broken Age can be called rocky at best with expectations being much higher than the Broken Age team ever dreamed of. As a backer I've had the privilege of seeing behind the curtain of game development and have seen the best and worst from the dev team. I had high hopes for Broken Age and the documentary gave me a higher investment for the project than any video game that I've ever looked forward to. Hell, any thing that has your name in the credits is hopefully something that you're proud of being involved with. So call me a fan boy or anything like that, but I won't back down from my stance on Broken Age. After much anticipation I must say that I really enjoyed my time with Broken Age.The best thing that can be said for Broken Age is how great it looks. Every single environment has the look of it being hand painted and treated with care. You can notice it from looking around by how many things have smiley faces or from how everything seems to fit together perfectly. It was a joy to walk around every new area to see how bizarre yet familiar every environment looks. It's accompanied by a wonderful score that fits each new area. My personal favorite came from Shay's part as it reflects the space ship theme. All of it can fall apart if the actual game play and story don't mesh together well. That isn't the case for Broken Age.Broken Age's story is one of two characters that are each in different time periods and different situations that are worlds apart from each other. They both can seemingly never meet each other yet both have similar situations. Broken Age is a story of personal triumph from oppressive adults. Whether it be Shay's computer mother or Vella's grandmother both are set out to accomplish self-sacrifice for a goal that is of high importance. They both must decided if they should rebel against their elders in order to break tradition. You'll be able to aid both of them in any order you want to. I went with Shay's story first as I was more excited by space. Without spoiling anything I found the story and dialogue of Broken Age to be charming, funny, and nostalgic. This is the first adventure game that Tim Schafer has made in a long time. Grim Fandango was the last big adventure game that he's worked on as a writer. You could easily notice that he wrote Broken Age by how funny it is. The dialogue tree in particular made me laugh several times. It also has a lot of humor from using your inventory on any thing or one in the environment in order to get some kind of reaction. I haven't played a traditional adventure game since Tim Schafer left Lucas Arts so it was truly a nostalgic trip back to the days when adventure games were big on PC. That said, Broken Age isn't just a trip down memory lane. It's a story of breaking away from the past and paving a new future.Double Fine promised a return to old school adventure games and it's a promise that was kept. Broken Age play like you typical adventure game with both a mouse cursor and an inventory. In Broken Age you'll have to solve many small puzzles in order to continue forward with the story. Some of these solutions make sense but others are as ridiculous as you'd expect from old adventure game logic. Luckily, it doesn't suffer from pixel hunting problems and brutally difficult puzzle logic. However, I wish that the game offered a button to let you know what kind of items are in the environment as most of the items that you'll put into your inventory don't stand out as well as I'd like.I also found most of the situations to be fairly easy to solve. I would've liked some more complex puzzles to be in the game. There's also a arm grabbing mini-game in Shay's section that is harder than it should be for something that is necessary to solve in order to beat the game. It's at times far too easy and mostly overly difficult for such a simple mini-game that isn't all that fun. It's also a game that deserves the Beta moniker as the game crashed multiple times for me. It also had numerous bugs such as text being unreadable and characters getting stuck in the environment. These bugs and crashes are an unfortunate part of the early release for us backers but hopefully it shouldn't be a problem once the game is released to the public.It was probably impossible to fulfill the high expectations that many felt after the huge success of the Double Fine Kickstarter. However, as a backer I'm glad to say that my expectations were met for Broken Age. It certainly isn't the greatest adventure game ever but it's still a well worth your time and money. Broken Age is a highly polished journey that has memorable voices from Jack Black, Jennifer Hale, and even Elijah Wood. These voices were treated right and aren't simply cameos. Everything surrounding Broken Age is filled with the love and care that you'd expect a Double Fine game to have. That's the same with Broken Age but it's also amplified higher than ever before. A lot if riding on Broken Age and I felt that they succeed in making a great adventure game that can hang with the best of the genre. This could all go to♥♥♥♥♥♥if the second Act in Broken Age sucks but I'm confident that it won't after playing the first Act. It isn't perfect of course. I still feel that the mechanics and puzzles in the game were far too easy to solve or simply obtuse enough for me to be confused for longer than I'd like. Hopefully the second act has better puzzles to solve. The story and everything is strong enough that it overshadows the puzzles but it still hurts the overall package. I can't wait to finish the story of Broken Age as a backer and a fan of old school adventure games.			"

The puzzles are very obvious and it's impossible to deny the fact that this game is not finished.6/10 for providing an enjoyable evening.Since I got it off a sale at 7 euros I'd say it was worth what I paid for it.

												Finally finished playing the entire game, Act 1 & Act 2. The first act was a fun adventure that brought back memories of classic adventure games. Everything ran great and the overall experience was well polished. Act 2 on the other hand is a broken mess of poor puzzle design and flaws with the UI become glaring problems that nearly resulted in me giving up all hope. There are series of puzzles near the end that require editing how something is wired and for the life of me I could not figure out how to get back to the part where it would let me edit the wiring. I kept grabbing the item out of inventory and clicking it on myself and everything around me in frustration. In the end I had to resort to a Youtube video just to watch carefully at how the player was clicking on the damn item, turns out the item needed to be double-clicked on while in the inventory screen, WTF!!! If you are glutton for puzzles that will make you bash your head in to a wall, then this game is for you, for anyone else, go watch the documentary of the game being made instead, at least that is entertaining.

												It's a pretty cutesy artsy game. The presntation I personally found to be pretty  goregous, and probably the game's strongest aspect.  The soundtrack is pretty notable also. However, the gameplay elements are very rarely engaging, to a point where it seems like it was intended to be a kids game. Very minimal and simple puzzles. The storyline is interesting, at the very least. It's not particularly notable, but it resonantes well with the style and pace of the game. The real issue with the story however is that this game is basically half of the story. That's right, for the price of $24.99 you're getting an incomplete game that's been promised a completion for a while now, This makes the pricetag very questionable. I don't really recommend this game for the main reason that you're really promised way more than is given. The storyline is incomplete and the pricetag just doesn't fit with a game this short. This is the kind of game I would recommend picking up during a megasale or discount period. I would also probably wait for the second part of this game to come out before deciding to invest in it.

												Whelp what can I say I have really mixed feeling about this game.When I first heard about this game I totally got excited and when I finally able to play act 1, I was mind blown. I really loved act 1 despite of the easy puzzles, the world felt amazing, the writing was fantastic, the characters were cute, the music was charming and so on.Then we had to wait a year for act 2. Honestly I expected much more what act 2 has to offer.You jump in the middle of the story and you'll get overwhelmed by frustrating puzzles right at the start, and you'll have to backtrack like millions of things running back and forth between places which feels really tiring after some time.The story could've been sooo awesome, but at the end you'll end up with more questions bc of the major plotholes they left in it + the ending cutscene is just...short/awkward. :/			"

												I thoroughly agree with The Verge's article ""Broken Age is the best and worst of classic adventure games[www.theverge.com]"", and I'll expand upon what it says. Praise Unique, high quality and imaginative art style. AAA voice casting. Writing: there's some genuinely funny moments and good twists. Attention to detail: Broken Age contains ample custom responses for incorrect actions, anticipating almost any logical input. There are also some nice technical details, like seamless close-ups for conversations, custom animations for everything, advanced lip syncing, and dynamic 2D rim lighting.Grievances Pace: The first 40 minutes of Shay's story literally sent me to sleep, causing me to shelve the game for more than a year. The following year, replaying the same section confirmed my previous experience (however, I was engaged all the way through after getting past that section). Puzzle logic: For most of the game, the player is given the perfectly reasonable impression that knowledge gained by one character is not automatically known to the other. At a certain point, this becomes unceremoniously false. While I like the concept that Shay and Vella are somehow intuitively connected, it does not make for intuitive puzzle design, especially when the game starts relying upon it -- without introducing the concept -- over halfway through the narrative. This is poor game design. It's not only immersion breaking, but actually feels like a betrayal, since you play along in good faith with the precedent that you as the player don't exist as an entity in the game world, yet suddenly you're essentially the medium for which information passes between the characters (inconsistently, I might add). Puzzle difficulty: There's a recurring puzzle of rewiring the ship's robots. Firstly, recurring puzzles aren't fun. But more importantly, the game sets a precedent of being relatively easy and trustworthy to always provide all necessary information on hand. But towards the end, It turns out I should have been writing down all the wiring combinations I used hours earlier. Oops, too late. Maybe there's another reference somewhere, but I didn't see one, and had to look it up online, which spoiled the experience a bit more. As a result I now resent this puzzle, which means I resent a significant portion of the game. Background reuse: The characters swap places for Act II, and while that's conceptually interesting, it does give the impression the backgrounds were recycled to cut production costs. Rewarding the player with new areas as they progress can be very satisfying, but no significant new areas are introduced after the first third of the game. ConclusionBroken Age is an ok game which, annoyingly, is almost a great game. Overall, I liked it because I can look past its flaws. With some reservation, I can recommend it to those willing to take the above criticisms as caveats.			"

												Broken Age, is a retro-looking point-and-click adventure game, recently released by Double Fine Productions, and funded by Kickstarter backers. It is an absolute feast of an incredibly unique art design, with amazing soundtracks, and a great, great story. Divided into 2 parts, which both are included in price, one is currently available to play, and other one is in progress right now. (This review is written for people who are familiar with the genre, and have some brief background knowledge about it. I recommend you to pass if you are unfamiliar, since I'll be refering to some classics and relating Broken Age's quality to them.)I want to talk about the sounds of the game first, since it actually impresses me the most. As expected, Peter McConnell (He was responsible for soundtracks of many LucasArts and Double Fine Productions classics. Creator of that famous Monkey Island loop, pretty nice, eh?) did an amazing job on soundtracks, perfectly reflecting the spirits of places like Meriloft, Shellmound, Bossa Nostra, making you feel like you are actually there. It's one of the best game OST I've recently heard, along with Bastion, Transistor, Braid, and Thomas was Alone OST's. As for dialogues, what you'll encounter is beyond belief, as it was a Kickstarter funded game. Names like Elijah Wood and Jack Black are the voice actors, and they all have done an amazing job, also as expected. You may wonder like, ""Where did they found all that money to pay them?"", well, they actually didn't! Voice actors were making a huge pay-cut, willingly, just becaue they liked the game so much...Lee Petty (He was also the art director of Brütal Legend.), working with Nathan Stapley (And he was the art director of Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, one of my first action-adventure games (and a pretty good one) after Tomb Raider.) did an absolutely gorgeous job for the visuals, that it's almost as amazing and unique as the art style of Curse of Monkey Island, which I personally consider as the peak of uniqueness. Such graphics will never get old, and will be considered great even after 30 years.And Tim Schafer, founder of Double Fine Productions, creator of games like Full Throttle, Grim Fandango, Brütal Legend, The Secret of Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge...well, I think we don't even need talk about him. An incredible talent, a total genius. A below-decent, and even an avarage story was out of question, all I've expected was pure amazingness, and he delivered just that! Bravo Tim...Only problem with Broken Age is that, it is kind of too easy for someone familiar with this genre. Yet, it personally doesn't matter for me, since I'm not playing a point-and-click adventure for its ridiculously exaggeratively difficult puzzles (Not like I'm eliminating the ones which has that difficulty level. It just simply doesn't matter.), but for its fluent smart story with a good sense of humor. And, that's Broken Age!In a nutshell, Double Fine did it again...Buy this game, buy this game and play it!----------(27.09.2014) EDIT:So, I think I should've foresaw the 'Double Fine incident' with Spacebase DF-9, and write my Broken Age review accordingly, huh. Suddenly, I started getting a dozen of downvotes (from %90 rate, to %50), and many people adding, just to state that my review is faulty, and Double Fine is a scammer company. Seriously?First of all, that is NOT a company review, that is a GAME REVIEW. I really don't care who created a game, as long as the game is good, despite the fact that I've praised Double Fine in my review. It was just to clarify that good visuals, sounds, and scenario, is not a coincidence, because that they've done it before. How should I've known that would happen?Secondly, Spacebase DF-9 incident is NOT a scam, even remotely. I'm not the one to teach you what kind of precautions spending your money will require, nor I'm not the one to teach you the definition of 'Early Access', but if you still feel confused about the concept, and raging at the same time, I'll suggest you to watch this:

			Views: 431,173		

			TotalBiscuit brings you an extended discussion on Early Access with its consequences and implications. Click here to watch Jimquisition on Early Access: http://bit.ly/KoG45Y RUST gameplay courtesy of...		

Since releasing half of a game is also a type of early access, if you still be like ""Broken Age part 2 is nowhere to be seen, too. They are clearly scamming all the way!"", you would be wrong, again. If part 2 of Broken Age is never to come, that's also a risk that I myself have taken, and consequently my fault.As a sidenote: I believe in Double Fine and Tim Schafer, you repugant people will surely have my regards when part 2 is out.----------(28.04.2015) EDIT:Hah, take that.

												I came to this game after Act II was released and without knowing any of the development drama. Without the hype or long wait for Act II, I was perhaps able to enjoy the game a bit more than others who were rather disappointed with Act II. As other reviewers point out, the art is beautiful and the story in Act I is fantastic. I do have to agree with a number of the critics that Act II wasn't quite as strong as Act I, and for the reasons they mention. However, I still found the game enjoyable, over all.			"

												Don't bother.   The biggest complaint everyone has about this is that you're buying half a game, but really it feels more like just a prologue.  The four hours I have on record are two playthroughs.  Sure, the art is nice, but not almost 4million dollars worth- which is how much kickstarter funding this game got BEFORE it was sold on steam.  Maybe it will be worth playing when it's completed, but after waiting a year for the second half, I've just lost interest.			"

												Broken Age is an old-school point-and-click adventure game. You play as two characters – Shay and Vella – and can switch between them at any point during the story.This sounds neat, but unfortunately, while this sounds neat, for the vast majority of the story – indeed, up until the very, very end of the game – it is almost completely irrelevant. And unfortunately, in the bit where it IS relevant, it actually makes no sense. But I am getting ahead of myself.Broken Age is an old-school adventure game. You have a (very small) inventory, though unlike some old games you can’t create unwinnable situations or nonsense like that. There are puzzles you have to solve in the world, primarily by taking inventory items, combining inventory items, and delivering inventory items to people/locations to solve problems. Some of the items have to be manipulated within your inventory – in particular, you get a robot later on in the game which you repeatedly have to rewire to perform various tasks on your behalf.The actual story is split into two parts – Shay’s story is about him trying to escape from his rather controlling ship, where “Mom” (a woman’s face in a glowing orb) is rather controlling and has him do ridiculous “missions” which are all just fake adventures. Robots serve the roles of NPCs in these adventures, and it is only when Shay deliberately breaks one of the adventures that his story really begins, as a stowaway wolf (or, more accurately, man in a wolf costume) offers to help him find some REAL adventure – saving some innocent creatures. But he has to go around the ship and bypass various security and safety mechanisms in order to do it.Meanwhile, Vella’s half of the story is that her people periodically sacrifice maidens to Mog Chothra, a tentacled flying monster. She has been chosen as one of this year’s sacrifices for her hometown, but she isn’t going to go down without a fight – this whole thing is stupid, and Vella believes they should fight the monster rather than appease it. This leads to her doing exactly that, and her going on an adventure which eventually results in her battling the thing.The second half of the game has the characters switch places – Vella has to go through Shay’s ship, while Shay has to deal with Vella’s world. Both realize that not everything was as it seemed, as does the player.Unfortunately, this reveals one of the three major flaws of the game – you basically spend almost the entire game backtracking back and forth across two fairly limited areas. The ship is smaller and quicker to go through than Vella’s area, which requires significant backtracking. Thus, even though there’s not that many areas in the game, the game as a whole takes nearly ten hours to complete. This can make the game feel a bit tedious at times, doubly so because there just aren’t many new areas to explore after the first half of the game.The second problem arises from the fact that Vella’s part of the game is just generally more interesting than Shay’s ship. Shay’s ship has basically one joke, and it is repeated over and over again, while Vella’s area is more varied and has more interesting people to interact with. Vella herself is a kind of bland character; Shay is somewhat better, and his companion, a spoon in his inventory, is more interesting to drag around. It also is with him longer; Vella acquires a fork and knife, but they are less interesting NPCs and have fewer interesting things to say (though they, too, are amusing).Alas, by the end of the game, the whole thing has worn a bit thin, and it felt like the central villains in the story don’t have a major role at all for a large portion of the gameplay due to Vella’s world being larger and longer than Shay’s. And honestly, the ending felt a bit rushed, with the bad guys apparently being thwarted, but half by accident, with everyone coming together to sing Kumbaya at the end in a kind of dubious way.The third problem comes from the gameplay itself. It has some of the flaws of the old-school games, most notably the “Try to combine everything with everything and everyone” problem. There was at least one puzzle in the game that I only solved by trying to combine an inventory item with everyone in the game until it finally worked, as the vague hints were… well, vague. I knew I had to get an item from a “chain of deals” type thing, but I was missing an intermediate step and it took a bit to figure it out.While it all made sense in the end, it still ended up involving a lot of backtracking.A larger issue, however, lies in the endgame – there are some puzzles which are pretty obscure and require you to notice some symbols in the background of a photograph. Worse, this is not really called out in any major way, and it is extremely easy to miss.However, the largest problem lies in the fact that this puzzle – along with a puzzle that Vella has to solve – require the characters to get knowledge from the other character’s section. BUT THERE IS LITERALLY NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM. It is purely meta – the player learns the solution in one half of the game, and then applies it to the other half. It makes no sense, and in the finale, this is even more blatant, as you constantly have to switch back and forth and use things learned from one half to apply to the other half. It is not at all obvious and it is, frankly, nonsensical, as the characters aren’t actually in active communication with each other. Once you realize that you have to use things from one half in the other, it does sort of come together, but while the idea of the two halves coming together was literally the only application of the “switch between characters” mechanic which was otherwise pointless, the fact that there was no in-character communication between them in order to do this is kind of annoying and feels very “gamey”.Ultimately, I don’t think that this game quite came together for me. The endgame crossover puzzles aren’t the best thing in the world, and the story sort of felt like it never really came together as an exciting whole. There was a fair bit of humor, but the more serious side of the story felt kind of wonky, and Shay’s ship relied far too heavily on a single sort of joke and added essentially no fresh humor in the second half of the game.There are better adventure games out there in the world, and while the humor in this is kind of cute, I’m not sure if it is worth 8-10 hours of your time.

												Broken Age was supposed to be an ""old point and click adventure, like the old classics"". It fall short of achieving this. And I'm glad it does.From what I could see from the first act, this game do so much more. It's beautiful, full of personality, clever and fun. It have been some time since I was able to scratch that old itch left by the old adventure from Lucas Arts. Broken Age manages to do that.Also, HOPEFULLY this game will help consolidate the path for new point and click adventures, either from Doubel Fine or someone else.			"

												This game is wonderful.I grew up on Tim Schaffer's games. Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Maniac Mansion, and other Lucas Arts titles like Monkey Island and Sam & Max. This game is a continuation of those games.Some people complain that those old school graphic adventure titles had illogical puzzles that only made sense to the developers. And I'd say those are people with no imagination. Puzzle solving in these games are puns. There are clues that make them perfectly logical for the world that they're in and often require some degree of familiarity with tropes and cliché followed by subverting them.Act 2 has some very obtuse puzzles, but if you take the time to look at your environment, you can solve them.Players are so used to instant gratification. That is not what this game is about. Its a much slower game. That requires piecing together clues and exploring your options. Adventure games are not designed to be fast. They're designed to be clever.This game is very clever. To get everything it has to offer you need to take it slow. You need time to reflect. There is so much narrative packed in to this game that's just hidden in plain sight. If you were able to plow through this game, you'd never notice the little details hidden in the background that helps tell you the story.It's possible that people don't appreciate experiences like this anymore. But I for one do.			"

												Broken Age exceeded all of my expectations. The artwork is beautiful and the world is wonderfully crafted with so much character and life. I've been a fan of adventure games since I was a kid but for about 10 years now it's been really hard to find quality adventure games that make you fall in love with the world and the characters. This is exactly the game that's been missing. The story is engaging and keeps you guessing until the end. The voice acting is excellent. There were numerous laugh out loud moments where my husband and I were in stitches. We chose to switch between the two stories regularly which kept us engaged in both worlds. Thank you Double Fine for delivering such an amazing game that pushes the boundaries for the genre with the stunning art and the depth of the story.			"

												The game only took about 5 1/2 hours to beat and was frankly unsatisfying. The plot/game world made no sense and the comedy was weak. Art wise the game has been consistently bad, it looks like barely any effort was put in. There's a weeks worth of background art and a days worth of character design in there. The puzzles were needlessly long, requiring a fair bit of running around through the same 6 or so screens. This only inflated the game length rather than add difficulty or enjoyment. If they put the objects for each puzzle within one or two rooms then this game would be even shorter. It's not the difficulty of the puzzles that takes so long, it's having to go back and forth and jot things down on a bit of paper. The only reason it took me as long as it did to complete this game is because I went into act 2 expecting not to need any paper. If you went in fully prepared you could probably beat the game in under 5 hours (not skipping dialogue).The Book of Unwritten Tales series and Deponia are far superior. Wouldn't buy this game for more than £8 if I hadn't already paid as much as I did. Tis a shame I can not get a refund.			"

I'm closing to finish, so I don't think that currently it is much longer than 4h.The story, music and artwork are good though. Puzzles are awful, it is more an interactive short story than an adventure game, which would be fine if it costed 5€.Maybe a year and a half later after its launch, they finally release the Act 2 and fix the game, but it is really lame to sell an unfinished game and I feel scammed.

												Great (but short) Act 1, with an amazing art and a fresh and engaging story but... ...The Act 2 is a completely different game. The story is cheap, the puzzles are repetitive, you will hate robots and wires, and it´s simply disappointing.It feels like it all started very well, but at some point Tim Schafer lost the creativity. I followed his advice and played Act 1 and 2 in the same playthrough, but still...It's a shame. I was expecting so much, and maybe that was the problem.			"

												tl;dr: If you really have to: Play it until Mog Chothra crashes and stop. Just stop. You will be left with many open questions, but you are spared the shere disappointment of the rest of the game.===========Episode 2Wow... disregard everything I said for episode 1, episode 2 is just abysmal in every way imaginable.Puzzles are different in being very poorly executed and some of them are just infuriating illogical. Add the necessity to switch between Vella and Shay for some solutions which have no connection at all, but ""feel familiar"" when solved. It's as if you suddenly introduce new mechanics mid game, no one's expecting..., oh right. There is a difference between difficult and arbitrary, which Double Fine didn't seem to grasp.So puzzles are a big no-no, what about all the open questions and mistery leaving you very hyped at the end of episode 1?Yeah, they are answered after 5min playtime and don't think there are twists like in episode 1 anywhere. You could just skip the rest of the game, because there is nothing important left to learn.Everything about this episode feels rushed and unpolished and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.I'm kind of happy I waited 5 months, so my expectations hit gorund level and my disappointment wasn't as big, but it's still big enough to update this review.Double Fine, we are done.===========Episode 1:I really would like to recommend this beautiful marvel, but there are so many problems attached to it.Imagine the Mona Lisa but with only one half of the smile and everything else missing. There is just a sticky note saying ""coming soon"". You can clearly see, this note has dust on it.Get this image? That's Broken Age for you. And ""Broken"" could not be more fitting.[this review may change if episode 2 comes out, but I do not expect this to happen in 2015]			"

												I enjoyed the beautiful painted images in this game, but felt it became a chore to play because of the amount of provided dialogue you had to click through, which was disjointed and not really contextual. Things you had to ask about would occur before you knew about them so it was an annoying segue and broke the story. The character would say things which as a player I didn't feel were important and wasn't interested in pursuing.I don't think it was as involving or rewarding as smaller games like Lume which had more ambiguous interactions.

												Broken Age is a game of two halves thanks to how development went and it really feels like it, as they completely changed how the game was from one act to another. Act 1 is all about setting up the story with a few puzzles here and there but nothing that will get in the way of enjoying the experience. Then you get to Act 2 and it feels like you're hitting a wall with puzzle after puzzle that will make you go back and forth, the game never makes it that apparent what you can or can't interact with either so sometimes you may need to pickle hunt. It can be frustrating and unintuitive as sometimes you will have to find something using one character to use with the other as if their minds are telepathically linked.It is unfortunate as the game did have a lot of promise in Act 1 with interesting characters, a story set up to make you wonder what is going on with this world, decent voice acting and writing but by the end because of the frustration I felt, act 2's story didn't save it and felt almost trapped behind the puzzles, the ending wasn't very satisfying either so I left the game feeling dejected. I cannot recommend this game, if you are all about the puzzles then you may well enjoy this but then you'd probably feel that act 1 was too easy and possibly boring for you. If you're more interesting in story, characters and the world then you could just end up feeling like I did.			"

												Keep in mind that I loved the first act of this game and the second part was pretty good too, but I can never ever recommend this game because of the conclusion. The way it ends is genuinely jarring and unsatisfying. It feels like I'm playing a game that's 2/3rds of the way completed, and considering how great the rest of the game is, the ending is genuinely insulting. It's not even visually impressive, it doesn't look like an ending in the same way the beginning looked like the beginning. It's not climactic, it's not engaging, and it's not good.Don't play Broken Age. You'll love it, but then it'll spit in your face for it.			"

												Tim Schafer is a game creator that I knew little about until I started to search for an adventure game to play. Tim Schafer is known for creating Grim Fandango (I never played it), which is loved by many and to be honest, I wish I was around to play it. He is also known for other things I bet, I am planning on doing research later. I love adventure games, and usually have it at the top of my list for things to play, and those with amazing stories please even more. When I first saw Broken Age on VGX, I was imediately hooked just by the art style and concept of the story. I got my hands on the game 5 months later than I hoped, wishing I bought it right at the start. This game is absolutely amazing, and Double Fine does it's well known job of amazing wrting, and I found myself laughing and crying at many points throughout this game. At the start of the game however, I started to feel a bit bored after a while, and after I had that feeling, I am thrown right into the point where I am on the edge of my seat. It is sad to say that the game is only one act currently, and I found myself annoyed that I dont have a release date for act 2 yet.. Then again, I waited for act 1, and I got exactly what I wanted. Waiting for Act 2 may in fact be a pain just because I am so desperately waiting to jump back into the story of Shay and Vella, but whenever it comes out, I know it will be just as good as this part, if not better. This review is not the best one I know, but it really does not have to be to tell you that this game is beautiful and very entertaining. I honestly say get the game if you want to have an amazing adventure that has probably one of the greatest scripts and stories I have ever seen. Broken Age is amazing and creative, and showed me exactly why adventure games are amazing, and threw me back into the times where I did not have a chance to experience adventures at their core. 9.75/10 I would reccomend this game to anyone.

												Though Broken Age acts as a return to Double Fine’s earliest adventure game roots, it’s also their largest and most ambitious project in years. But if anything, the added scope and possibility that exploded out of their hugely successful Kickstarter has only amplified their talents as a developer, giving birth to what seems easily capable of becoming the game that defines them as a studio.But playing Broken Age, there’s never the sense that Double Fine has grown beyond the quirky, commercially unviable studio that I’ve loved for years. Broken Age as a game, is exceptionally simple and humble in its construction. It’s unmistakably a product of its creator: esoteric, humorous, and at times even a bit profound, but without the often rough mechanics and invisible cage of possibilities that shackled most of the studio’s prior games. It’s Double Fine in their purest, most unrestrained form, and if you’ve played anything the studio’s made I doubt I have to tell you how exciting that is.It’s somewhat precarious to attempt to discuss Broken Age’s plot, both for fear of spoilers and for the fact it’s only half finished, but its themes are so strong and its writing on point that it’s deserving of more than a minor conversation. It follows the dual stories of Vella and Shay, two people stuck in vastly different situations but united by their shared lack of freedom, forced to blindly conform to the traditions and expectations of those older than them, unable to even question “why?”.Shay is the sole human aboard a ship intended as humanity’s last chance at finding a new planet they can call home. Trapped in an endless isolation, he lives out his days following his computer mom’s orders, still treated as a child ignorant to anything outside his daily routine and sheltered existence.Vella in contrast is a member of a village whose traditions dictate the sacrifice of several young women to the towering Mog Chathra during their annual maiden feast, or otherwise doom them all to its wrath. Vella is the sole person brave enough to propose they fight the beast, but is shrugged off as a silly girl who doesn’t understand the gravity of the situation.These two plotlines fold into each other to form Broken Age’s main themes of rejecting the systematic lives their characters are placed in, and being brave enough to discover the world for themselves. It’s rebellion without anarchy; breaking out to find who you are, not out of distaste of the world, but a desire to make it better if only you’d be given the ability to think and act for yourself.You could label Broken Age a coming of age story (in fact it itself does), but it’s so much more sincere than I feel that commonly implies. Its characters are delightful and lively and often absurd, but also fully developed in how they fit within their world. They fully embody their roles and proclaim them so effectively that it felt like I knew the people I was talking to, as if they had somehow taken on a life outside of the game. Even characters you see in only a single scene or who are given but a few lines of dialogue have so much personality and heart in their interactions that they transcend their small part into the larger world of the game.Double Fine has always been a developer recognized for brilliant writing and characterization, but I’ve never felt as immersed in the worlds they created or as invested in their characters as with Broken Age. As bizarre as their circumstances become, I connected with Shay and Vella’s plight for freedom of their parental and societal shackles, and was as curious as them upon entering a new area and meeting its peculiar inhabitants.For all I know act two could be a complete disaster. It could cause Broken Age to go down as one of the most disappointing games in recent memory and probably cause even me to think twice before checking out anything Double Fine puts out in the future. But for now, it’s sublime, beautiful, expertly pinned, and not afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve. As a huge fan of all things Double Fine, I’m finding it hard not to readily declare this their best work yet, which I consider no small praise.Act II Update & ConclusionPerhaps I expected too much.It’s been more than a year since the first part of Double Fine’s Kickstarted nest egg first release, and since then the anticipation, unease, and in some cases legitimate anger have been steadily increasing to levels that beg the question just what this game means to people. It was one of the first hugely successful examples of using Kickstarter to fund games, as well as a callback to Double Fine’s earliest work and easily their biggest and most ambitious game in a long time (despite hav ing began as something far smaller). It was hard not to want to continuously give them the benefit of the doubt; to let them give it their all and assume Broken Age would come out the better for it however long it took. But for all the hype and impossible dreams of what Broken Age might be, we might have taken it too far. Or maybe Broken Age took it too far, and in my naive enthusiasm I went along with it. [...]Final WordI said at the end of my act one write-up that I could see Broken Age being the game that defines Double Fine. I still think that to be true, but unfortunately it isn’t as glamorous an image as I had first imagined it to be. Broken Age isn’t a bad game, nor do I regret playing it or wish to advise others not to. It’s impossible to ignore though just how uneven and weird the first and second act are. Broken Age seems to reflect a lot on its extended development and the detriment its model of funding and community feedback may have had on it. It began with an eagerness you couldn’t escape and the feeling that this couldn’t be anything but an amazing, and yet by the end it has lost a lot of its drive. It’s tired and drained, seeking to provide closure for those who have been waiting so long, but being unable to do much more.Sadly I've reached the character limit for Steam reviews. If you want to read my full thoughts on act II and Broken Age as a whole you can find them on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												Very nice point-&-click. You get to play as two characters: a boy who lives in a spaceship with his overprotective computer parents, and a girl who lives in a village where girls are sacrificed to a beast every now and then to prevent it from destroying the village. But this broken age is doomed to become unbroken when each of them starts their own little rebellion. I absolutely loved the story. The puzzles become very difficult in the second act though, and some of them are randomly generated for each playthrough.			"

												Well this is rather pleasant. Broken Age isn’t a brash, jaw dropping, impossibly clever, superlative inducing spectacular. Instead it brings an old school charm. It seems not too much has changed in the 20 years since Tim Schafer last shipped a point and click adventure. The main difference is with the complexity of the puzzles. Broken Age is more story focused than puzzle focused with a simple single click interface replacing the verb system found in the old SCUMM games. But at the heart of this is Tim Schafer’s story, with colourful characters, imaginative settings and witty dialog. The story focuses across the two protagonists stuck in an absurdity that they are trying to escape from; one on a spaceship that controls their every action, the other in a fantasy land where they joyfully given as a sacrifice to a mysterious beast. Both of the settings are relatively small, but beautifully realised. Each story is largely independent with nothing like the item passing mechanic of Day of the Tentacle, meaning you can complete each at your own pace, swapping between the two characters at will. Everything comes together very nicely, from the writing, the excellent soundtrack and the beautiful story book art. There’s some excellent animation work as well and while a couple of lines fall flat, most of the voice work is very good.  There are a few minor issues, mainly with the interface. You can’t chose dialog options with the keyboard, the cursor is unnecessarily large and the inventory system is a bit awkward (I recombined rebinding right click to opening your inventory). There’s a larger issue if you were hoping for brain teasing puzzles, but if you were looking for a captivating adventure game your only real complain will probably be that Act 1 comes to an end a bit too soon.

												(It's hard to recommend/not recommend half a game. I'll update this when the full game is released.)Broken Age is definitely one of the more unique adventure games in recent years.To echo some of the other reviewers here, the game exudes charm. The art direction is exquisite and unique. Shafer's trademark humor is here, but it's understated. Below the humor there are weighty themes of independence and growing up, and I'm interested to see where it all goes (and not just because of the amazing ending!)Do not play this game for its puzzles. They are simplistic and not very satisfying to complete. (On the upside, this means the game avoids ""adventure game logic--you will not be combining a string of objects in an illogical fashion). I hope Part II manages to make you feel clever, while at the same time keeping the logic. My other complaint is that I feel that at least so far, Shay and Vella aren't especially developed characters. Other than they want independence, we know very little about them. They're well-designed (with great voice acting), but they aren't fully realized yet. Part I is only around 3-4 hours, so this is somewhat understandable. And the ending paves the way for some...interesting...possibilities. Pro tip: give the wrong objects to people. You will often get amusing, unique answers. Also, map the right-click button to the inventory. The interface was obviously designed for tablets, and while it works on PCs, the default mappings should be different.As it stands, if you're interested in playing it, I would wait until the full game is released. I probably would've done that myself, but I wanted to continue to enjoy the (amazing) documentary as it releases.(Oh, and the music is VERY well done.)			"

												Broken Age is an old-school point-and-click adventure game funded through Kickstarter purely by nostalgia from fans that grew up with LucasArts games from the ‘90s along with Tim Schafer’s earlier works. For a very long time, Broken Age was Kickstarter’s poster-boy, all thanks to being the most funded project at the time. This meant that one small slip could potentially affect the way people perceive the risky-environment of Kickstarter projects in general. No wonder there was high pressure on Double Fine to deliver on their promises since they received almost $4 million in funding (which is almost nothing by today’s standards if it were funded by an actual publisher) in contrast to the $400,000 they were originally asking. The end result was split over two Acts, released approximately a year and half apart from each other.With that said, what Double Fine delivered in the end is a wonderful adventure game with an interesting plot concept: a teenager by the name of Shay who is a prisoner in his own spaceship trying to escape from being babysit by computers he refers to “Mom” and “Dad”; and Vella, daughter of a family of bakers in a village who tries to oppose taking part in a traditional sacrifice to Mog Chathra, a creature known for devouring worlds. Two teenagers living in two different worlds, yet facing almost similar problems, eventually collide with one another. Although the story starts agonisingly slow, it eventually builds up momentum after two or so hours in and keeps you invested until the totally unexpected, nonetheless remarkable, plot twist near the end of the first act which makes up for any pacing issues encountered. I really dig the concept Broken Age is trying to follow here.Additionally, compliments are to be given to the charming art-style. It is simply startling, albeit childish -- but that is its beauty, right? In fact, that is part of the story’s undertones. Sure, perhaps being an adult playing this might look silly, but from an artistic perspective it succeeds in capturing the aesthetics of a children’s storybook. It may not be what some people were expecting Broken Age to look like when the game was first pitched on Kickstarter, but I have no problems with it because Double Fine have done it very creatively. Likewise, while the humour might not be as memorable as in other comedy-oriented adventure games, Broken Age does not disappoint in this aspect either, all thanks to a couple of support characters such as the cutlery collective - the Spoon, the Fork and the Knife – whose dialogues and remarks never seize to be amusing. Throughout its duration, there are a handful of good chuckles to be had from time to time. Conceivably, I do not believe it was necessary for Double Fine to hire Hollywood actors as voice actors, but in the end they all did a solid job in most parts. Whilst there are minor moments where there might lack of emotion in the delivery of some of the lines, they do not break the immersion the game has to offer. And once again, Pete McConnell does a fantastic job on the soundtrack for this game, especially the three stellar tracks “The Lumberjack’s Cabin”, “Vella Wakes” and “Battle At Shellmound”. If you read up to this point, then surely you may be wondering why I gave a negative review for something which, based on my comments above, sounds like an amazing point-and-click adventure game? Well, here is why, and it does actually break my heart to say it but:Act 2 ruined it all.Pretty much everything that is established in Act 1 is thrown out the window. The things we, as players, are to believe judging by how the story unravels in Act 1 simply do not materialise in the second half. In fact, the whole concept seems detached in places in Act 2. As far as the story is concerned, it becomes uninteresting and seems to go almost nowhere. Any new revelation either turns out predictable or unimpressive. And this may be due to a few major flaws which simply killed Act 2.The most obvious crime committed here is the reuse of the same exact locations found in Act 1, with only Shay’s spaceship being “redecorated”. To me, one aspect of adventure games which sucks me in is the notion of exploration; finding new locations and meeting new interesting characters to advance the plot, aside from solving challenging puzzles. Desolately, that is not the case here. Simple as. In reality, what bothers me the most might not actually be the reuse of the same locations in the end, but rather all the fetching for items. In this part of the game, it did not click with me because it is a chore. But hold on a second, fetching for stuff has been in adventure games like this for decades? Yes, but the problem here is when you ultimately realise that most support characters are nothing more than “mechanical” characters. Paying close attention, almost none of them have any influence over nor take direct part in the story. They only exist there artificially for either Shay or Vella to retrieve a specific item from them to solve a certain puzzle. So this makes you stop investing time in caring for them, as characters. Also in regards to the puzzles, Act 1 is indeed a breeze for adventure veterans, so it is almost impossible to get stuck at any point – which in a way I do not think that is necessarily a bad thing at all. All puzzles, although pretty obvious, feel logical in Act 1. On the other hand, Act 2 bumps up the difficulty and takes some risks in being creative with some of the puzzles, but the end result is a mixed bag. Contrary to what other people say, I give Double Fine credit for the wiring puzzle in terms of creativity because it actually made you think (and no, it is not as hard as some people claim it to be – just time consuming). I only wish it was not as frequently used in the last quarter of the game and more intuitive, but stuff like the snake puzzle was badly implemented; waiting for a puzzle to solve itself? But yeah, most puzzles in Broken Age basically boil down to asking the right person for the right item and that is you more or less done. Sort of.Comparing the two acts, it feels like Act 2 was either rushed or made up while they were going along (as in it was not planned out at the same time with Act 1), or both. The charm and humour are still intact in the second half, but everything in terms of plot, characters, concept and some puzzles took a major hit by some bad design choices. Plus, just when you think Act 2 would redeem itself by the end, Broken Age ends in an anticlimax which raises more questions than providing all the answers. Simply put, the writing is poor in Act 2, and it seems like poor management could have been another factor here.In conclusion, Broken Age is a visually beautiful and well-crafted game where all the passion was clearly injected a lot more in the first act, but all its potential is completely ruined by its second act plagued by poor writing and some bad design choices which reduces it to no more than an adequate adventure game at best. Broken Age could have been the next big thing in this genre, and Act 1 is a valid gauge, but when modern adventure games like The Book of Unwritten Tales or even the more retro-y Blackwell series (as a whole) exist and provide a (subjectively) better and more fleshed out experience, then you know that something went wrong at some point in your game. Broken Age is still worth at least one shot thanks to its promising Act 1, so long as you lower your expectations in the next act. If so, then this still is a good starter for anyone new who wants to delve into point-and-click adventure games. Otherwise, for old adventure fanatics, I cannot really recommend it; easily skippable thanks to Act 2. To be honest, I could have also easily given this a neutral review if there were such a button on Steam.I am still looking forward to Double Fine’s next project, but what a bummer coming from Tim Schafer.

												Broken Age is really like two games, one of them great, the other not that good at all.First, on the surface layer: BEAUTIFUL presentation, lovely (in act 1) charming characters, great voices, sfx, animations etc, all around, presentation wise it's great.At first glance and initial play, there is a lot to literally love there.So then, going deeper, the two games in gameplay and story:One, the first act, is a quite good classic (if by itself a bit short) adventure game modernized in some nice ways.It came off a bit easy in some aspects and only had two puzzles where i wasn't sure what to do next.(which is a good thing in my book regarding the not getting completely stuck/lost aspect)The puzzles in act 1 were overall for the most part easy and logical to grasp (again, besides two exceptions for me) and most of them were fun or lead to fun/nice/memorable story outcomes.The second act/later part of the game (which was initially also released way later) sadly is way worse though.In the second act the puzzles were changed to a completely ""requires walkthrough constantly for sure"" level and even with a walkthrough they didn't seem logical nor fun.It's like the game was suddenly made massively more ""difficult"" in all the wrong ways.Like ""how many most not logical at all/most not intuitively discoverable things can we stuff in there at every corner?""That would still be much more tolerable to me if the story went on as great as in Act 1. Sadly it didn't =(Sadly, also the story aspect fell apart completely for me in the second act.There were way less fun and charming moments with characters there and the whole plot turned from could totally happen/ realistic/believable and very charming scenario to totally cheese and totally not relate-able to rage causing levels regarding how/why they let it sink there.I read some reviews stating one should best not play the second act and imagine for oneself how the story from the first act could end, well, obviously i didn't go with that recommendation since i wanted to play onwards after the great act 1 part and see where the story goes, but post playing act 2 i can see where they are coming from with those recommendations.I really liked the story and enjoyed the gameplay a good bit during act 1 and i feel like act 2 really tarnished that. If i wouldn't remind myself of Act 1 i would have to give this a way more negative review overall.So, overall i have a bit mixed feelings about it.On the up side, there are extremely charming, really lovely characters, art style, music and sound effects presented in the first act, the whole outset of the story is beautiful and i loved being in that world with those characters (and so charming presentation).I most loved the aspects that one could play the girl or the boy both with their different (seeming) eras, environments, back story etc. and playing through that portion was overall largely a joy._______________SPOILERS FROM HERE ON_______________Sadly the second act completely trashes that all. Basically initially it seems like storywise a few possible scenarios could have been the case. Like the boy or girl could be time traveling to meet the girl.The boy's Mom could be a computer only for real and not his actual Mom so it would pose the question if his parents long died or what. And the question why she/it imprisons him, why he was put on that mission alone. There was also the question (even touched upon briefly) whether the second ""astronaut"" could be an older version of the boy or a younger version of his father, again implying quite interesting story twists.Sadly, none of that all, what was unveiled with Act 2 storywise was basically a way worse and way less plausible and less interesting and less appealing turn of events /plot twists for pretty much every major character that really ruined any connection with the storyline to me completely.All aspects of how the two ""eras""/worlds/characters were brought together felt forced, unrealistic and like complete nonsense. Hey, hooray, it was fake, more fake and most fake and what really went down was the least plausible way more idiotic setup.It went from some masterfully done great story portions in Act 1 to some super sloppy and bad plot overall in Act 2.The whole plotline of the boy was basically turned into complete made up nonsense in multiple ways, and each ""unveil"" making the plot worse than the previous._______________Major Spoilers below_______________Hey, his ""Mom"" and ""Dad"" whom he only saw on the computer screens initially and who there came off as both very computery and also totally not trustworth at all, as if they were imprisoning him with some dark motives, were then unveiled to actually be his real parents, just for some reason had not been around him in person for so long that he didn't remember them even being his parents or real humans at all.Ok, i get it, it plays on the point that many parents work so much that their kids don't see them much for a while, but it is just the lamest story twist option in this setup, where the initially presented setup was so much more interesting with so many more interesting possible outcomes.Then another plot twist, that the spaceships are not actually space ships and have never left earth.Downgrades the whole setup and story potential so much.Then with that also the unveil that they are all in the same era/planet/place.Another big story downgrade.Then that the ""spaceships"" from the outer shell look like monsters and are what's picking up the maidens.Then the twist who let's those monsters do that etc.With each plot twist, one by one, it got worse and worse and less and less plausible/likeable/connect-able.Like really, why did the story have to get worse by every 10 minutes in Act 2 until it was a complete dumpster fire? =(And as i said before, many of the puzzles in act 2 seemed so random, too that i feel like the chances for solving them without constant walkthrough usage are very low to non existent to most players, they were for me despite i played many adventures in my days.Some puzzles are also made in a way where they can't even be solved easily with a walthrough since some aspects are randomized, which is extra enraging when an annoying non onbvious, non logical and not fun puzzle after the other already forces one to play through with a walkthrough and then on top even with that one in between gets stuck at some points.Some of the puzzles in act 2 made me really really not enjoy playing the game at all anymore for a while and i only went on since i wanted to see the end of the story.Sadly, the ending, like most of the entire second act was not satisfying at all.I so wish the whole second act could be rewrittten completely, because i would so love to play through it in a version where the story could have progressed in a  form where it hadn't been turned to this trash later on.So, where does that leave us?Still a bit sad/upset about what happened there with act 2 and i wish it had storywise gone and played completely different.It's a rare case where i wish there could be a director's cut/revisit/remake of a game later on where the first part would be left mostly as it is and the second half completely redone with major changes in plot and gameplay.Still, i think after a while, i will play the act 1 parts again some time, because within those, there is some awesome stuff there.The first portion of the storyline was downright excellent in my eyes, there was so much wit and self and medium aware joy in those aspects making fun of games, hero and decision making or how they are presented as such in games or in the world and how we choose our own paths or not etc, some great stuff there.And for that all in Act 1 i give it a thumbs up =)I just have to get rid of the sour taste of act 2 and play act 1 again some time later to refresh those good memories of Act 1 =)			"

												It’s great to see that Double Fine’s Kickstarter wasn’t a complete flop.There was a lot of anger towards this game for various reasons of which I do actually understand. The kickstarter was launched asking for $400,000 and they ended up with $3.45 million. Yet they blew their money too quickly and ended up having to release a first act to try and raise funds for the second. Which a lot of people deemed the second act to be lazy and rushed. All of that aside, in my opinion Double Fine do great games. I’ve been following them for a while now and so far I haven’t been all that disappointed with anything that they’ve made that I have played. Despite their games always having a somewhat childlike feel to them, I always enjoy them.Sometimes I do wonder if this would have gotten so much hate if the game was released as normal with people being pretty unaware of the recent drama and goings on of Double Fine. If you were to buy this game without knowing anything about it, I think more people would enjoy it.This was kickstarted shortly after the “Amnesia Fortnight” events that Double Fine did, of which I loved. So I backed this since the beginning. From what feels like forever ago, I just never really bothered all that much actually watching or getting involved with it. It’s kind of been just a dusty book on the shelf until now. I finally got around to playing it and can say I think they did a really great job with it. I may actually go and watch the documentary now.The story is definitely interesting. Luckily by the time I played it the second act was already out. I can’t imagine myself being all that happy about having to wait quite a while for the next act. But that’s down to pure impatience. I wanted to know what was going on straight away. I was expecting something a little different when it came to the story, but it surprised me in a good way. The story comes together in ways I couldn’t predict. I think most people’s problem with the story is that a lot of act 1 is the set up. It asks all the questions, it gets you interested and it leaves you on a cliff hanger. After all that waiting, act 2 came out and honestly I can understand people’s disappointment. Most questions are straight up just answered. No real build up. The answers were somewhat brief, vague and honestly there are some holes in the story which made me wonder. I get the feeling most people yearned for more information or something much deeper then what it turned out to be. But I see this game again as almost child-like and light hearted. It honestly didn’t bother me all that much. I still enjoyed it and didn’t at all feel any sense of real disappointment concerning the plot. The art in the game is really nice. It’s smooth and wonderfully drawn. The audio is well done both music and voice acting wise. I can only assume they blew most of that budget getting Elijah Wood in. The puzzles are straight forward most of the time, which again I think rustled some jimmies. But I honestly enjoyed a little bit more simplicity. It helped the game flow a bit better for me. I could progress and find out what the fudge was going on (I can be impatient when it comes to plotlines). The main kind of puzzle at the end I found a lot of fun. As to where to find the solution is annoying, but deciphering what everything means was quite fun for me.  Usually I end up getting frustrated with point and click games (I think many people do) as it can sometimes be pretty easy to get stuck. Admittedly, I still got stuck on this a few times for a fair while but the puzzles and combinations are logical enough to not be stuck (and therefore annoyed) for very long. It’s also a nice feature to the game being able to switch between characters and take a break from what you were doing.The annoying part is the achievements (if you are even into achievements, I suppose). I personally insisted on 100%ing the game. It took me 18 hours and I have to say it was a little tedious. That may be just because I stayed up until 1am no-lifing and ended up quite tired and annoyed with it… but still. If you’re looking for an easy 100% it’s not all that easy. It’s do-able but you’ll need to be meticulous, complete it a few times over and be able to be quite fast about a complete play through to do it.All in all, I enjoyed this game. I thought it was great. Was also nice to see Pendleton Ward doing some voice work for Double Fine after the last Amnesia Fortnight. I hope to see more of that.Keep it up Double Fine!TL;DR : Despite all the recent Double Fine drama, it’s a great story,  it had good audio, visuals and puzzles. It has achievements that actually do feel an achievement to get and it just generally is another great game by Double Fine. I’d think any point and click or Double Fine fan would like this game. If you’re neither or those things, try it anyway. I still think there’s a chance you might enjoy it despite Double Fine’s games always having a slight childlike feel to them.			"

												Broken Age is a wonderful experience that I can’t recommend enough. As someone who grew up on the LucasArts-style adventure games of old Double Fine has pulled through with just enough nostalgia and modern aesthetic, offering up a fresh and funny classic in an age where blockbuster games rule the roost.

												The game itself is very charming, both graphically and story-wise. But it's still just two chapters, 4 hours each. Don't get me wrong - the game is solid in terms of puzzles (though a little too easy for my taste) and mechanics, but 8 hours of total gameplay is just not worth 23 euros. If you have the money and really appreciate the hand-drawn artstyle and good story provided by the game, then by all means, buy it. But if you're like me - looking for some challenging puzzles and lengthy, memorable playthrough for similar price, then it's not a game for you.			"

It gives a really good atmosphere. The point and click controls are very easy and the puzzles are challenging without being impossible.It was intuitive enough that I didn't get frustrated much even though it took me a while to get through. I only got completely stuck twice.I really liked the story. It was very well developed. Each of the main characters and many of the supporting characters were well developed and had a lot of depth. I wish there could be some kind of sequel because I got really attached to the world.			"

												UGGGHHH! IT'S SO FREAKING GOOD!  AND SO FRUSTRATING NOW THAT IT'S OVER!  Episode 1 will last you about four hours, and who knows when the second half will come out. The only official word is ""later this year"", so I am expecting December 30. Episodic adventure games missing their deadlines is the worst thing ever.That said, this game made me remember what a good adventure game is actually like after playing a bunch of lesser efforts recently. The story is absolutely captivating, the puzzles are good if on the easy side, and the art style is this gorgeous ""construction paper art project"" sort of thing. You split your time evenly between two very different characters in very different settings, and each grabs you immediately and won't let go. Hilarious writing, characters, and voice acting too. The ending will make you slam your head on the desk because you will need to know RIGHT NOW what happens next, but instead the long wait begins.Buy it so we can discuss and commiserate.			"

												If you are considering buying this game, you need to ask yourself: ""do I like 90s adventure games?"" If the answer is ""no"", don't bother: you won't like this one either. If the answer is ""yes"", Broken Age is most likely worth your time and money.The most important factors for a good point-and-click are here: great setting, great characters and superb writing. I laughed aloud countless times during my playthrough. Even the music and art style were spot on. However, you will most likely find yourself infuriated by some of the puzzles later on. If you're not the most patient individual in the world and a master of lateral thinking, get ready to look at walkthroughs. To me, consulting a walkthrough at least once or twice during a point-and-click is competely normal, but if you are the kind of person that considers it cheating or refuses to do so for some other reason, you're most likely going to get stuck multiple times during the later half of the game.

												Charming, beautiful, and thoroughly enjoyable!The puzzles are weird enough so that you don't immediately expect the solutions, but at the same time, aren't obscure enough to the point of ""try everything in your inventory on everything."" I also found that I was never blindly looking for clickables, either- If you were frustrated with Deponia for both of these things, you shouldn't have that problem here.There are a *few* moments that feel unpolished, but I'll just tack that up to having played it during the backer beta.Needless to say, though, if you aren't interested in point and click adventures, it may be hard for you to get interested- if you are interested in them, though, what are you waiting for?

												Broken Age started out extremely strong. Act One was phenomenal in almost every aspect, however, I feel like Act Two kind of dropped the ball.Graphics:The graphics throughout the entire game were amazingly colorful and bright. Everything was pleasant to look at and really helped to bring the game to life. Audio:The voice actors did a decent job with bringing out whatever emotion they could from the script. The music was complimentary to what ever was going on in the scene at the time and also helped to add to the excitement.Storyline:The storyline throughout Act One was extremely well done. It gave an in depth sense of what was going on and why, and you knew exactly why you were doing the things you were. However, once you got into Act Two, the storyline almost seemed non existent. The puzzles became increasingly hard, almost to the point of wanting to give up, with very little clues to go on. For a good portion of the final Act, I spent a lot of time looking through walkthroughs just to be able to move on. Even though I enjoyed this game for the most part, I have a hard time recommending this game, based on the fact that Act Two left too much to be desired. I have more questions at the end of Act Two, then I did when I started it. There are still too many loose ends that have not been tied up. The game itself had so much potential, and I think that is why there was so much disappointment at the end.			"

												Edit: Act 2 has been released a while now, but i can safely say I don't feel like going back to this game. It sounds as if I would have to play act 1 all over again just so I can understand stuff in act 2. And Act 2 doesn't sound worth it. So, yeah...The awkward moment where steam tells you when you purchased the game, rather than when you last played... X(I bought this game without any prior knowledge of the kickstarter origins of Broken Age, and I feel that this title supports my arguement for NEVER backing a game through kickstarter, unless you like throwing money at something which may never happen. There is always a risk when giving money to someone for something that doesn't exist, and I think a lot of people have unrealistic expectations, and unfortunately in this case, it was the people making the game that didn't plan and budget ahead.I bought this game in a steam sale not long after it was offically realised, which was the best choice at the time, as I had heard a bit about the game and was excited to play it myself. I played through act 1 and expected a few months wait for act 2, as this is the norm with most multi-part titles. How wrong I was. Over a year later, I am still waiting for act 2. I can't imagine how annoyed people must be from backing this game from the start! However, the signs for problems ahead were there from the beginning.Having only just bought the game, I started looking through sites to see if there was an expected release date for act 2, only to find an article which stated that the profits from act 1 meant they could go on and fund act 2. I was horrified! I had no idea that this game was not even funded for the second part. I had no idea that this game wasn't even supposed to be split into 2 acts in the first place. But I thought to myself, oh well, it might take a little bit longer but I can wait. Update after update, deadlines came and went for act 2 to be released. I think this is what really got to most people. The waiting wasn't the problem, it was the promises that were broken that made people upset and lose faith in Double Fine as a developer. How can you trust someone with your money if you don't believe they know what they are doing? If someone who has 30 years experience in the games industry can't budget for a full game, then we are all doomed! Unfortunately for us, its too late to take back our money or get back our trust. This is the true lesson to be learned from this experience: Research, research, research! If something looks too good to be true, then it probably is!I feel that some of the fault in my buying this game has to fall at Valve's door. The steam page for Broken Age is very misleading, as it gave me no indication at the time that this game is kickstarter funded and may never have been finished. And, even now, it is impossible to tell from the steam page that this game is not finished! This is why I have written this review, to give people the knowledge of the situation surrounding this game, so that someone else can make an informed choice over whether to purchase this game, I choice I didn't have.So, I guess you want to know a bit about the game, huh? Other reviews can tell you more, but the basics are: It's a point and click adventure that follows two very different main characters, with the option to switch between characters whenever you wish. Its a pretty looking game, with amazing voice-acting and simple puzzles.Is it worth almost £20? No. Act 1 took me about 3 hours (I got stuck for about 30 minutes because I'm bad at video game logic :P), with act 2, if and when it appears, to take another 5 hours. I'm honestly not sure I will play act 2. It has been so long since I played act 1 that I will have to replay it all from scratch. And really, there are SO many other games I could be playing, I may never experience this game as it was supposed to be played. My advice: Wait until both acts are out and grab it in a sale. As the second act is currently not out, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.A real shame.			"

												I finished this game today, and I must say playing thorugh Act 1 with the massive cliffhanger at the end wanted me to play Act 2 with the hope that it would be awesome. Instead Act 2 feels like a mess. Pretty much you are doing the same as in Act 1 but the opposite way. I was really bummed out by the ending and some feeling of the developers rushing to finish the game. Story- and puzzlewise I think its messy in Act 2. There are no hints in the gameworld some of the time as to what to do next, and you're almost doomed to read a walkthrough just to get to the next.  I can't in my right mind recommend this game because of this.			"

												Is this it? Really? Mr. Schaefer, I don't mind a short game, but really? This is the best you could muster? A pathetically short story with mind-numbingly easy puzzles and uninteresting characters? I'd have to say I'm pretty disappointed. As far as art style goes, its alright, but it feels....off. I don't even really know how to describe it. It feels really faux-something. It doesn't feel inspired and I know how pretentious this comes off as. But something about it bugged me through the whole thing. Now all of you can defend this game saying ""But part 2 is coming!"" That doesn't matter. This is a review for the product being sold as-is. And honestly I think it's a pretty lousy deal. If Act 2 is really so great then let it prove itself. Act 1 is simply mediocre.			"

												Negative reviews of this game by people I respect put me off playing it for a long time. But I got it for Christmas this year and finally played it and completed it and all I can say is.John Walker, pls...If you want to be moved by a profound treatise on the nature of adolescence then I suggest you find a book. If, on the other hand, you want to play an original adventure game with lots of charm and puzzles worthy of the legacy of the old Lucasarts games (i.e. what the backers actually wanted) then you need look no further.

												It has taken me a day to mull everything over, but I think I'm ready to put an opinion out there, so here it goes.I loved it. I will probably play it again as soon as I have time. The art was well done. The dialogue was genius (as expected). The voice acting was better than I could have hoped for. The story... the story was hands down the best adventure game story I have ever encountered. I spent a good chunk of time today just thinking and wondering about different parts of the story, what they mean, and what will happen in Act II. When a game's story gets me to actively engage it even when I'm not playing, it's a damn good story. I am sitting here wishing I had Act II in my hands already because I want to know what happens.Now, the reason why it took me a little while to say this:I don't consider myself a genius when it comes to adventure games. I expected to get at least 5 hours out of Act 1. When I finished it in under 3 hours, having exhausted every dialogue option available along the way, I felt as though the puzzle difficulty should have been higher or that there should have just been more puzzles. I was honestly a little irate that somebody like Tim Schafer would make the game so easy, considering what he has done in the past.I currently still wish the difficulty had been a little higher, but I've started to understand why it wasn't.  Point & click adventures are known for their DEVIOUS puzzle design. When you're only playing a game puzzle to puzzle and getting stumped at every single one, it is more satisfying to solve them, but that satisfaction comes at the cost of the storytelling (which is and definitely should be the main focus any P&C adventure game). The purpose of the puzzles, however, is not just to make a story interactive. The best designed puzzles give you little nuggets of the story while presenting an interactive, stimulating challenge. Not every puzzle in Broken Age did this, but a lot of them did. If this quality makes for less contrived, more logical and consequently easier puzzles, then so be it. A great example of this is the ""use spoon with cereal"" bit that, on the surface, seems overtly mundane. My advise, should you choose to play this game, is to think about why some seemingly mundane actions are there. Also, it think the game is very much meant to flip back-and-forth between the two stories, so I would recommend switching after every major ""happening"" you encounter. I'd also recommend starting with Shay's story.Thanks for reading, and I hope you choose to enjoy this fantastic game.			"

												Huge Tim Schafer fan. Monkey Island is by far my fav. point and click adventure game and overall love all his work.I got this game through the kickstarter which got me extremely excited when I heard he is making a new adventure game, especially since he has 100% full creative control, no publishers.. AWESOME!That being said, this is a good game... It's slightly below my expectations, I don't consider it to be AMAZING, however I do think it's fairly good.I've been following their documentary that covers the development of the game and since I also am a game developer I fully understand (and I was expecting) that they ran into financial and deadline problems. Especially for a point and click game where you have to basically build the engine yourself if you want anything decent, since it's an unpopular genre nowadays.The game has small problems here and there like various depth issues when it comes to certain animations, and also the game was dropping frames for me when I was using an item to interact with something. (Keep in mind that I'm playing this before it's officially out on steam, so they will probably fix these problems by then)All those problems don't affect the experience, however I don't feel like the experience comes anywhere close to Monkey Island or Grim Fandango. That's probably just me being nostalgic.. or playing too many games and being desensitized.But if you are a Tim Schafer fan or just a point and click adventure genre fan, this is worth getting. It's an old genre game with beautiful graphics. I say in the end, it's worth it. "

												1st Act was great and engaging, the second act introduced the villain and then completely fell apart, ending with an infuriating puzzle which stuck out like a sore thumb next to the impressive design of some earlier puzzles. I backed this game, and at the end of the 1st Act I felt like I was getting everything I'd wanted. Then after waiting AGES for the conclusion, I got something that felt lazy, introducing literally NO new environments to explore and only a few throw-away characters. Truly dissatisfying.			"

												* Updated to contain Act 2 and represent the whole game *Overall I'm glad that I backed the game, it did take more time than they thought and it did came out in two parts but as a whole I feel that it was money well spent. Let's start with the good:The art is great, they have used this style very well. The soundtrack is amazing and also the dubbing with several celebrities (Elijah Wood, Jack Black, Wil Wheaton and others). The story is pretty interesting and I enjoyed revealing it bit by bit, playing some time as Shay and then as Vella, it's useful when you get stuck on a puzzle to switch to the second charater. As I hoped the second part took me longer to beat and overall Steam says that I played the game about 15 hours, I took my time, although the actual time should be a bit less it's still a nice amount, the average time to beat should be about 10.5 hours or so.And for the bad:I kinda hoped there would be a bit more to the story and somwhere in part 2 I could guess where it goes.Most of the puzzles where fine but there were a couple of kinda hard to guess puzzles that really took me time to figure out, one of which was a really bad choice in my opinion and I'm sure that many players got stuck in that place, it was kinda annoying and I decided to use a guide just for that one puzzle (still not sure if I'de get that one without it! they needed to add some kind of hint there, I was just clueless on what I needed to do next and wandered around the screens looking for a hint).Also some puzzles were a bit tiring (fetching things, going from one place to another and back again several times etc'), mostly on act 2.To sum it up, as I said I enjoyed the game overall, I'm happy that we got the game but indeed it could have been a bit better, the first part was shorter and easier but more interesting and fun to play. Still if you like adventure point and click games you should give this game a try, I thought it was worth the 15$ I paid for it, but you can get it on sale for much less (lowest so far was 6.24$).I hope Tim will be up to the task of creating another original P&C game in the future, we need more of those! :)			"

												The puzzles are probably a little too easy for point-and-click adventure game veterans - finished it in around 6 hours and I didn't attempt to rush through it. So if you're expecting a challenge, look elsewhere.In all other ways, it lives up to expectations as a Tim Schafer game. The setting is adorable without being outright twee. The dual PC/split POV narrative has promise and some really fantastic bits (can't say more here without spoilers). The writing is never as outright hilarious as, say, a Monkey Island game, but it does stay consistently amusing throughout.Also because of its pedigree, the gameplay is gratifyingly streamlined. As an example: in older games, getting from one side of the map to the other was a chore, consisting of watching your character amble along each screen. In this game, if you double click an in-room destination, the character will jog there. Double-click an exit and you warp to the next room immediately, bypassing the walk animation completely. This may be one reason the game is so much quicker to complete, but I'm a huge fan of the feature and others like it. Adventure games should be challenging, but never tedious.Is it worth full price? I received the game as a gift, so it's hard for me to say whether you will get $20 worth of fun out of it. But now that I'm hooked on the setting and story, I'll be picking up the rest of the game without a doubt.			"

												Having played through the first act, I have to say I'm deeply impressed by the quality of this in whole. Beautiful animation, art and voice acting with peculiar alien undertones. Seeing a product this finished is a rare occurence. Puzzles are fairly easy though, and some have mentioned about pixelation issues, but I hardly noticed it. Great work and I can warmly recommend trying it out. Some of the plot twists are really quite thought-provoking, I for one am excitedly waiting what the next Act II brings along.Updated 23rd of Jan after the playthrough.			"

												What can I say?  Tim Schafer has done it again.Broken Age is an enjoyable point-and-click adventure with the right mix of character dialog, puzzles, and humor.  This all leads into decent character development throughout the game, and sets up the ending of this First Act perfectly.  The dynamic of shifting between the stories of two characters worked well throughout the game.  The two stories were balanced in terms of content, and I really didn't favor one over the other.  While it's important to play and appreciate both stories you aren't forced to switch throughout most of the game.  This allows the player to enjoy each story and character independently, and not be arbitrarily ripped out of the experience.  I enjoyed being able to switch between the stories when I wanted to, without consequences.And the ending of this First Act?  I won't spoil it, but it's brilliantly executed and memorable.  It certainly makes me look forward to Act Two.  As far as which story to finish first, I will say that I finished Shay's story first and found the ending very profound.  It was truly an 'OMG' moment where the two stories merge, and suddenly everything makes sense and shocks you at the same time.  Please take your time and enjoy both stories before you get to the ending, as you'll appreciate the results.I highly recommend Broken Age to both fans of point-and-click adventures and first-timers.  Tim Schafer and Double Fine have delivered a high-quality experience that is well worth the money.			"

The first half's puzzles are great but a little easy and the second half if perfect. I really wasn't sure how to solve some of them and was stumped for a while but when I figured them out I was relieved to find they all had logical reasons to them.That's just how an adventure should be. I know some people don't like the challenge but if you breeze through it without having to stop, go away and think outside the box then it's just an interactive cartoon. Wonderful characters, witty dialogue, gorgeous music and a delightful art style.I don't usually leave reviews but I really liked this and thought it an underrated delight.Thank you Double Fine!			"

I finally plunkered down and played the second act, and it wasn't bad. Graphics, voice-acting, puzzles, etc was once again, top-notch.  Also, at least for me, the length of the game was pretty long. Just look at my hours played.  TRUE, the game would be shorter if you are better at puzzle-solving than me, and... if you solved puzzles through Google. I saw one reviewer claim that they beated the game in 5 hours. 5 hours? Are people doing speed runs on adventure games? "

												This game deserves to be played by absolutely everyone. If you grew up playing and loving the classic LucasArts and Sierra adventure games, this will be right up your alley. And if you didn't? Well, then you're in for a treat! The humour throughout is spot on, and I found myself smiling or laughing at nearly every turn and every conversation. The extraordinary Double Fine feeling eminates from beginning to end,  and the story will most likely captivate you and leave you guessing where it's going to head next.Broken age is yet enother example of the amazing and peerless work that Double Fine keeps producing, and it definitely gets close to the level of quality that they have produced in the past, including their own Psychonauts as well as games from their LucasArts days like Grim Fandango and Monkey Island. The puzzles in the game never reach the absurd levels that the old classics could achieve, but I did run into a handfull of headscratchers along the playthrough. The good part was the ability to switch between the two characters if I got stuck, or wanted a change of perspective in the story, very similar to the mechanic from Day of the Tentacle.Overall, I can't recommend this game enough, it is a masterpiece in the genre, and it's only half-done! I for one can not wait untill part 2 is ready. Judging from the absolutely amazing work Double Fine did on part 1, there's no chance in hell that part 2 will dissapoint. Mark my word.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I went into it having read mainly positive reviews and having grown up with point-and-click games. Unfortunately the game is let down tremendously by Act 2 and the poorly-explored story. The ending puzzles are also stupidly frustrating and artifically difficult - after many hours of getting nowhere I didn't bother to finish the game and just watched the ending on YouTube. I was glad I did because I would be annoyed if all my hard work resulted in it!This is quite a gentle, slow-paced game for the most part. While there are some timing puzzles that require you to be quick, overall everything takes a leisurely pace. This didn't bother me but some may find it too slow.Act 1 of the game is the only part of the game worth playing. You play as either Shay or Vella up to a certain point, and then switch to the character you didn't choose at the start to play through their story until the two stories align with each other. While Vella's story is more interesting, there are moments in Shay's that genuinely made me laugh. The NPCs are interesting and have some well-written dialogue and the environments are rich and colourful.Act 2 is very confined to the areas you can explore and doesn't tread much new ground. I was disappointed by this as I'd hoped that it would add more new areas or expand old ones - you barely get a glimpse of the final area which ws built up to be this large and menacing place. The puzzles spike in difficulty, with some being made artifically difficult and frustrating. The second part of the story is also rushed through at a tremendous pace and almost entirely through dialogue with the antagonist. It was interesting that the tone of the game became a lot darker,  but it was never fully realised. The execution is clunky.Overall this game was a big disappointment. If you want to play I would advise keeping a walkthrough handy and having a phone nearby to take photos of some puzzle elements that need to be memorised, but even then you're going to be frustrated.Pros:- Gorgeous art style and smooth animation- Writing that's actually quite funny in places- Act 1Cons:- The story attempts to be grand but falls flat- Very few areas to explore overall- Some puzzles require big leaps of logic or remembering a lot of information- Unsatisfying ending- Act 2			"

The pacing was enjoyable and the dialogue fun, though it was unfortunately a little too simple in my opinion. The second half is a botched, rushed mess with an utterly ridiculous story and puzzles that require incomprehensible logic to complete.

												If you've ever played a point-and-click adventure before, you will immediately love Broken Age. If you haven't.. consider this a great opportunity to be introduced to the genre of clever puzzles and storytelling. The art style is gorgeous and comforting, the voice-work is all spot-on, and the humor... well it's Double-Fine!Act 1 presents us with two seperate, highly imaginative worlds that seem to have no relation at all, apart from the two protagonists' desires to lead their own lives. When you figure out the shocking relation between the two segments of the game, which can be played in any order you like (even switching from one character's story to the other's at any point you wish), you WILL be hungry for the next installment. You may even play through Act 1 all over again just to see the story in a different light.There's a good reason this game was such an immense success on kickstarter, and I'm happy to say all of the time and money did NOT go to waste.

I highly doubt we will ever see it, and it is not worth 1 hr of gameplay for $24.99 an hour.			"

												Finished both stories and I must say I really liked them. The art style is great, great voices (spoons FTW!), game has many humours elements and I think both stories have more to say than meets the eye in relation to our own world. At least I see it this way.But unfortunately there are some flaws too.1. First and most severe - length. It took me about 4h to finish act 1 and I think I clicked on everything that was clickable. I also talk with everyone using all dialogue options that were available. I didn't rush it and I didn't resolve all the puzzles in a first attempt. And yet the game has ended. I hope second act will be out fast and will be much longer then this. Especially because...2. Puzzles are really easy. Too easy on my taste. I don't think that classic adventures games were so easy. I saw Broken Sword lately and there was more puzzles and they were more challenging as well.3. There is no proper ending. You finish story and...game switches to second character. Even if you finished that one as well. And there should be anything at this moment. Some info about act two or something.Overall I would recommend this game but in my opinion it deserve 7/10 at most.			"

												After a bit of turmoil over their release structure (with the 'solution' being the two-part release), we now have the first half of Broken Age, and I must say, it was worth the wait. If you're a fan of the point-and-click adventure games of old (LucasArts games coming to mind immediately, as well as The Longest Journey), Broken Age is worth playing. The game doesn't have the length that some of the old ones had (assuming Act 2 is roughly the same length as Act 1), though that may be largely due to the puzzles being a little more logical than those in the older games were, so you spend less time aimlessly clicking on the environment and trying to use random items with each other in hopes of finding a solution, and more time enjoying the stylized art, amusing dialog, and interesting world.Is it a good game? Yes, perhaps even if the adventure genre isn't normally your cup of tea. Is it worth $25? That really depends on whether playing half of the game now and half of it ""later this year"" bothers you... chances are you'll have the opportunity to get it on sale before Act 2 is released, so that might be something to consider.

												Broken Age is an absolutely *gorgeous* game. The art is so lovely you feel good just by looking at it :DThe voice acting is perfect. The music is adequate: there is no track that made me go ""OMG must make my friends listen to this!!!"" but they all work very well in the context of the game.The story is fun, with some pretty cool plot-twists. The characters are very lovable, you really root for them.The vast majority of the puzzles are quite easy (a little *too* easy tbh), although Act II has got a sudden spike in difficulty with some extremely irritating wiring puzzles. However, while those specific puzzles were no fun, they were only a very tiny part of the game as a whole, so just swallow your pride and grab a walkthrough and you'll be perfectly happy with the other 98% of the game.

												Broken Age does many things right in the first half of the game, however it is the second half which falls flat in providing an engaging experience. There is a difficulty spike that takes place half way through  which causes Broken Age to become less adventureous and more monotonous(spelling?) Broken Age's shortcomings wouldn't hold it back from recomendation if it weren't for how the game fails from a storytelling perspective during the second act.			"

Posted: January 17, 2014
												so i just beat broken age.it took me roughly three hours to do so.i think i liked the game?  the voice casting and acting was excellent, and the story itself was pretty interesting. I switched back and forth between shay and vella after they reached major points in their respective stories, so for sure saw the ending coming from preeeettttyyy far off. theres a lot of good points but i also have like, i guess, some issues.  lets discuss.artistically this game is amazing. every area you go to is beautifully rendered and the characters actually have a nice highlight layer that respects lights located throughout the level, so even though its technically 2D they still feel like they navigate a 3D world in a way that is subtle and convincing.  all the characters had a great feel, and each area you went to had a clear artistic theme that worked well and created a good identity for the individual characters and the world itself.  Each village Vella visited had a great sense of fashion that reflected their purpose in the world, and in Shay’s case he just had a whole bunch of amazing everything friends to hang out with.  That being said there are a few places where i noticed the assets looks pixelated and improperly rezzed, but it was infrequent and it was never an object that was important to the story.the sounds design was great.  the music was very well done, and the variety of voice actors was pretty impressive and full of wonderful and recognizable people who really did an awesome job of selling their characters. The characters were also great. Shay’s friends were are hilarious and the way they interacted with him when on and off duty was entertaining.  The people in Vella’s world were also pretty interesting, although they all blindly love Mog Chothra which would get old if not for it being an integral part of the story, so i guess i don’t mind? It kinda bugged me that all the female characters in Shellmound were super ditzy and shallow though.  This could have been subverted by making one of the temple guards a dude, as their shallow nature ends up being a gag, but all the girls who were offered to mog chothra and the two temple guards kinda just blend together.the gameplay was pretty standard point and click stuff, and the puzzles themselves were rarely very challenging. to be fair i’ve played point and click adventures for like, my entire life as a gamer, so these things are kinda second nature to me. there were some design choices that were a little strange - like the snake. why is the snake there? it is a dead end and misleading. there was no reason to get past the snake, and as far as i coudl tell, no way to get past the snake. why is there a snake?  the story itself was pretty interesting, and how the two stories come together is pretty obvious, but i cant fault the game for not surprising me with it’s plot twists.  Shay’s story is interesting because it all happens in a very small scale - he explores the ship to do a thing.  Vella, on the other hand, goes on this big winding adventure around her world (but really only like 3 locations).  Her story seems like a race against time, while shay’s seems far more casual and meandering.overall though my biggest complaint is in the story.  it took me three hours to beat the game, and at the end of those three hours the story gets interesting.  the whole game is building up to this specific point (which again, is pretty easy to see coming if you like, you know, know how stories work) and when it finally happens the game ends. imagine, dear reader, that you are watching star wars, and just as luke gets on board the millenium falcon the credits roll.  Technically, yeah, you know luke is like off on an adventure, and leia needs to be rescued but NOPE. you’ll find out about it later.I know that tim put out an apology for making the game too long and how he wanted to release SOMETHING because its been what, 2 years since the kickstarter? and so the game was split in two parts so we can play half now and half later.  but to me, this felt like maybe 1/3? speaking from my other P&C adventure experience: telltale games released a new season of sam and max every 2 years. each contain 5 episodes that take roughly 3 hours on the first play through - about the same size and substance as part 1 of broken age. they also cost the same amount of money. for 5 episodes released every month, instead of 2 released i guess like 6 months apart? they haven’t really been clear on when more is coming.i know each studio has its own way of creating games and i’m not trying to say double fine should have made me more game, but i just feel like in 2 years and with 3 million dollars i was going to get something a little more substantial.broken age is pretty good. it didn’t blow me away, but i enjoyed playing it. i look forward to part 2, whenever that gets finished  but like, if i am being honest, i enjoyed it more for the art and acting than i did for the game parts. the old lucas arts adventure games were challenging and engaging and really shaped my sense of humor and love for adventurous stories. the dig and monkey island will be with me the rest of my life because they impacted me in a big way.  act 1 of broken age is not memorable or impactful in the same way.  so i’m looking forward to episode 2. because episode 1 is great, but pretty forgettable.

												oh hell no.The art and voice acting and story of Act 1 were very good and enjoyable. Act 1 should be played. The Shay ending could have been designed *slightly* better visually to make it hit harder but the stories make sense and drive themselves. Act 2 was very very bad. I will now get into specifics so watch out: spoilers. Act 2 there are no new environments = bad. Many puzzles are tedious and require copious walking and cutscenes many times over = bad. The game requires you go get info from one protagonist's world to help to the other protagonist, although how this would work in-universe makes no sense because they aren't telepathic/have photographic memory. Every NPC serves only as a means to your end-- case in point sometimes NPCs who should be on your side and want the same things you do must be ""tricked"" into letting you take the wheel. In Act 1 the rebellion of the young protagonists made sense in the plot: Vella wants to live and Shay wants to not be helicopter parented. At the very end of Act 2, Vella and Shay both want to not die to the missle barrage and same with Alex and Shay's mom. But instead of just telling them the plan and getting them to cooperate, Shay and Vella have to distract them in order to get their plans into action. And the upshot of that ""climactic"" final plan is that they jettison their respective ships which were under attack (um... why didn't they just do that anyways?????). And why is Shay's mom completely freakin useless while a miraculously brave and resourceful teenager launches a nuke out a trash pipe to destroy an evil empire's death star? Why was so little ""story capital"" used in explaining the motivation for the evil empire, destroying the death star of the evil empire, and fleshing out what life was like inside the evil empire? This empire and its motivations were RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE TIMELINE OF EVENTS THAT CONSIST THE PLOT-- why was it given the screentime of a side quest? The evil empire as revealed is an extremely one-dimensional ""pure evil and creepy"" antagonist that kicked the events into motion but does not deserve our attention as the main conflict in the story... which I guess is instead solving stupid puzzles? In Act 1 we knew what the story was about: it was about kids finding themselves and rebelling against the system. All the NPCs are focused on maintaining the status quo, and we outsmart them in order to do good. But in Act 2 we realize a great and horrible truth that should shatter the worldviews of everyone and wake up the sheeple. And it absolutely doesn't. All the NPCs are just sitting around having a grand old time and it just feels so helpless and stupid that we have to e.g. partially consume a cupcake so that an old man will frost the cupcake for us so that we can borrow his cane so that we can fence with some juvenile druids to get the robes they stole it's like HELLO THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE SOME EUGENICS/GENOCIDE STUFF GOING ON! Act 2 *tells* us there is vague bad stuff going on when it should be *showing* us. That's my main issue. Being told there is evil stuff is not enough to make a game interesting-- besides, there is hardly any action in the game devoted to fighting the bad stuff. Why would anyone play this game instead of just watching a playthrough? Since the art, voice acting, story are the enjoyable bits, the only reason I could see is if the puzzles were satisfying to solve. I recognize it is a very hard balance to make a puzzle which is not too easy but also not just simply ""anti-logic."" And I grant there may have been a couple of actually satisfying puzzles in the game, but by and large in Act 2 I was so desparate for there to by any sort of hint of a plot payoff for the level of frustration that I faced. When none was forthcoming I resorted to partial walkthroughs in hopes to keep the pacing of the plot at tolerable levels. Act 2 made me think ""this game is too long"" and a game should never do that. When a point and click player goes from thinking ""I need to outsmart this environment/situation"" to ""I need to outsmart the stupid twisted game developer"" they break the fourth wall and the challenge isn't fun anymore.I have specific little gripes, like with specific puzzles or the fact that the final of very few times the music was given space to shine it was blaring repetively in the final scenes and overlapping with my musical hexipal. But there were some nice musical portions. In essense I would say this game was good to my eyes and ears but not to my brain.RockPaperShotgun explains the disappointment well: ""Broken Age Act 2 is a poor game because of its terrible puzzles in repeated locations with little purpose. But the disappointment I felt playing it is so much more extreme because of its betrayal of everything it implied it would be about. Broken Age is, it turns out, not a game about the complexities of being a teenager, of the transition from childhood to adulthood, but in fact some dumb thing about funny looking birds and evil space aliens. And it’s this that most surprised and let me down."" That's the key. Throughout Act 1 there was a thought that maybe this game was about something. Then Act 2 comes along and says ""here forget about exploring characters and growth, knock over this banal punching bag (evil aliens, trust me they are evil) and let's just resolve the plot by having the two protagonists meet on terra firma and call the game done at that point."" So probably don't play Broken Age, but if you do, stop after Act 1. Please.FINAL VERDICT: 1/2 of a cupcake out of 5 hexipals (1/2 because Act 1 was good but Act 2 was trash)			"

												It took me a lot of stopping and starting to finish the first act of Broken Age. An interesting world with some fun moments, but overall a bit of a mediocre adventure game; one of the stories had pacing problems, and the other had serious structural and character motivation problems. Finally I managed to push through and was pleasantly surprised by the excellent ending to Act 1.It was on the strength of that ending (and a kind of masochistic pig-headedness) that I played through Act 2, which is a complete DISASTER. The puzzles are obtuse and nonsensical in the worst tradition of bad adventure games. The mechanism of switching back and forth between story lines to gain information is ridiculous in a story where the two characters cannot communicate (What, are they telepathic?). There's an entire elaborate multi-stage puzzle sequence where your progress can be completely reset by doing things in the wrong order. This wouldn't be so bad if we had a goal, or some sort of logical progression of steps to be following, but for much of the second act I honestly couldn't have explained to you what the characters were trying to accomplish or why what I was doing would in any way help. This culminates in a series of actions that every piece of information you have indicates will lead to your horrible and gruesome death, without actually gaining anything meaningful.A pointless, stupid, and frustrating experience. If you haven't bought this game already, for god's sake DON'T.			"

												TLDR (Analysis further down): In short, Broken Age Act 1 is a masterpiece, but it is very short. The short length could have meant ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and be absolutely doubly-fine... if not for cut-down tablet-style gameplay, where the most fun part of questing is absent. This means: ""poking around and performing a lot of available actions to achieve an initially non-obvious goal (to get closer to bigger goal)"" VS. ""clicking around to find a SINGLE next action that will nudge the game to reveal next single action"".So gameplay disappointed me a little. I was very surprised to see that I finished it in 3,5 hours, despite clicking on everything and trying to milk every line of dialogue and funny interaction.==The long version:==Any praises for this game could not be more spot on: the sophistication and delivery simply knocks out anyone who has ever seen an animated film, played a quest game or read a good story. In any aspect, this is an artistic triumph. Nevertheless, there are some nagging questions behind the excitement of discovery and heart-pounding plot realizations: namely, does Broken Age succeed as a game? Sadly, this is not so clear-cut.Every location is a stunning gallery of quirky characters and beautiful backgrounds. But each time, there are only one to four active objects on-screen, and only one way to solve the one puzzle that game feeds you at the moment. The gameplay is, sadly, as straight as an arrow and as bare as a plank. Even if you think and fantasize about how the objects may interact and what it could mean for the characters and NPCs, it ultimately boils down to trial-and-error, simply because there are so few options. Meaning, you are better off sticking everything into everything, because it will take less time than figuring out the answer. No matter how good the story and setup, the actual gameplay is to exhaust dialogue options in any order without a chance of failure, then combine two objects, then repeat. It may seem like a normal quest experience, but there are good reference points: content-wise, Broken Age Act 1 amounts to about 2 chapters of Curse of Monkey Island. Gameplay-wise, it is less than one (and one of the shortest at that). Curse of Monkey Island had six. Moreover, you can't perform various actions on objects or people, so every step is reduced to one try; one line to make a joke; one obstacle. Whereas classic LucasArts quests were, essentially, a search for a hidden action among the multitude of highly entertaining failures to act. You literally get less bang (trademark Schafer humor, which is still hilarious) for your buck.So in the end, you fly through very rich and insanely beautiful locations with no time to appreciate or explore them and make mistakes - like you're watching a cool animated show. The locations are packed with possibilities - but the only ones available are the ones you MUST utilize to move the plot along.The ""length issue"" is even more sad because of the 2nd part of Velle's quest. I say it this time from a perspective of a writer.****SPOILERS****The Meriloft section does nothing to the plot, and doesn't change the character in any way - it's just an interlude to get from Sugar Bunting to Shellmound. It's crazy good looking and ripe with plot possibilities (at the very least, the mystery of the cloud prophet/charlatan who (maybe?) duped these people into his religion). But inside Act 1, it doesn't mean anything at all. It's all the more obvious when you play both characters intermittently: I finished Shay's part (basically a single-part affair) while Velle was in Meriloft, and then he lay unconscious while Vella was getting through Merriloft and then got to actually move the plot in Shellmound. So it's 1 or 2-part vs 3-part (where the middle part is disposable). Again, Meriloft is rad - it's just sad that it doesn't matter much (maybe it will matter more in Act 2? still applies though).****END****Anyway, Broken Age still kicks♥♥♥♥♥and is gorgeous. I sincerely recommend it to EVERYONE, not only nostalgic quest players. This includes people who have kids. And maybe especially them. Kids will be super-grateful for this when they grow up. And for a reason.			"

It looks deceptively cartoony, but if you look closely you can see how well they've managed to mesh the dimensions.Music: Creepy ambience and a fantastically subtle score.Voice Acting:  Elijah Wood, Jack Black, Pendleton Ward, Wil Wheton, Jennifer Hale... need I say more?Gameplay: Everything you'd expect from a point and click adventure; puzzles, dialogue quests, inventory management (that isn't done poorly), item combinations etc etc.Writing:  I don't think I can properly comment on this yet, but it contains Schafer's typical comedic aspects with a hell of a lot of creepy undertones.I've followed development of this game since it was announced on Kickstarter and I can happily say that with only a couple of hours play time, I already see it as money well spent.  Not only does it revive a 'dead' genre of gaming, it does it in a smooth manner that hopefully shouldn't be daunting to those that have never played a game like this.  Shay's opening sets up the story and teaches the player how to play these sorts of games flawlessly.  I find myself repeatedly clicking things ""just in case I missed something"", just like I used to do with Monkey Island.I'd love to have written a more concise review, but I am so full of feelings on this game right now that anything more will be unintelligible fangirling.

												I backed this game on Kickstarter, and I would have got my money's worth following its development even if the finished product wasn't particularly good. Fortunately that hasn't happened, and Act 1 of Broken Age is the most fun I've had playing a game designed by Tim Shafer since the last one I played! It's a beautiful game in every respect, the art and animation is wonderful, the music is of the highest standard, and the voice acting is excellent without exception. Really, as a demonstration of what a modern adventure game can be, there's no finer example. It's mildly amusing throughout, with a couple of laugh out loud moments. The puzzles aren't particularly challenging, although I did get modestly stumped a couple of times, having to come back the next day before the solution presented itself. Frankly, that's about my speed, but I still hope Act 2 is a little more challenging. Even if it isn't I would have had a great time. Overall a great success then, as far as I'm concerned. Like any good two-parter, the story ended on a suitable cliffhanger with some burning questions remaining unanswered, hopefully Double Fine don't take too long completing it.			"

												I will recommend this game, because I am a fan of point&click adventures, and because it has some funny moments,But overall it is as average as they get. I finished the Act and didn't feel much entertainement throughout. The puzzles are extremely easy, it is more about searching each scene thouroughly and pushing the story forward than solving anything, the story itself isnt particularly engaging, and this is quite problematic when it comes to adventures games since the story is the heart of the game and genre.It can be an ok experience for most, but do not expect a memorable one, not by a longshot, Voice acting is good, visuals are just ok. Passable game at best.Im surprised that such a game can cost as much as it did, I struggled to find a justification for it. Play it as a passtime, but there are much more epic adventures to embark on in the genre.			"

												Having not played a point and click adventure since I was eight or so I found Broken Age to be quite enjoyable. The story is fairly entertaining and the puzzles fun.There is a marked difference between Act 1 and Act 2. The game is quite easy in Act 1 while Act 2 is much more difficult. While a game getting harder as you play is to be expected (otherwise where would the challenge be?), it is not a gradual progression. The game goes from being fun for all ages to overtly complicated at a moments notice.Though some of the puzzles can give you a migraine; if you muscle your way through this is an enjoyable little game. It hasn’t rekindled my eight year old love of the genre but it was an enjoyable game that reminded me of why I loved and hated that genre.While I wouldn’t advise purchasing this game at full price it is worth it in a bundle during a sale. My copy only cost $1.25 and at that price I certainly felt I received my money’s worth.			"

												Broken Age Act 1 is a beautiful adventure game where you follow two different people in storylines that feel quite different to each other. It's got an art style that feels quite unique, the voice acting is on the level of Shiny's Sacrifice - in other words high profile names doing their best quality voice acting giving their personas a very distinct character. The story is really well written and funny, and the world adds to that - there are also lots of hilarious things about both the environments and small side things happening.Shay's story is like a teenager stuck in a spaceship where the computer treats him like he was still three years old, and the environments are full of props to that effect. Also, lots of things seems to be vowen, knitted of crocheted, like the yarn buddies, the arms of the computer, the warping effect when travelling in space, the present, the weaver etc. It's also quite heavily lampshaded. The story does a good work of giving the feeling that you as a character are bored and need to find a way to get out of the grudge while still not boring you as the player. It also gives you a great feeling of wanting to be doing something to help others.Vella's story is the tale of a girl who is chosen as sacrifice to a monster to save the village, but who instead wants to fight the monster. The setting is such that nobody except her grandfather sees anything wrong with the sacrifice, instead seeing being sacrificed being a great honour, but you can see in it moments of despair about losing daughters or those daughters dying while still being an honourable sacrifice. The setting is more a renaissance faire with some fantastic elements to it, and a good lot of humourous dialogue.What is the game missing? Well, in the LucasArts games of old, you generally had tasks like Monkey Island's sword fighting puzzle, where you first had to do an item quest, then you had to do a collection of lines, to eventually beat the Sword Master. It felt like you were actually achieving something by solving it. There were also moments in the game where you got stuck for a while and had to search for a solution, trying to figure the puzzle out. In here, the solutions are always really close by the problem, and there is no procedure to figure out you need to go through to solve it. There was not a single puzzle that made me stop and actually think about how to solve it, everything was obvious from the outset. The good thing about it though is that there is no pixel hunting, no missing items far away and having to backtrack, no banging your head on the table in frustration of not being able to get past a point and eventually dropping the game in frustration.Despite those faults, the first act is storywise about as great as any point'n'click game has ever been, in looks, dialogue, humour and music it's spot on. The game throws a few screwballs at you, and I feel that depending on your game play order you will get a very different experience. If you play Shay's story first then Vella's story, you will suddenly get a shocking reveal that casts your actions in Shay's story in a very different light. If you play Vella's story first you will at the end of Shay's story get a different screwball where you at the end suddenly realise that an assumption you will probably make in her story's later part was dead on wrong, but not the shock of the reveal about your actions as Shay. If you switch characters at natural boundaries, and this is probably best done with playing Shay first, then switching when quest giver changes to Marek, and for Vella changing between Sugar Bunting and Merriloft, then Shay for the linear quests given by Marek, then Vella changing after escaping Merriloft, then play Shay to the end, then finally Vella to the end. The big picture of the story will be revealed way earlier, but it will not have any great reveals. It ends with a great cliffhanger that makes you really anticipate the second act.If you wonder about the inspirations for the story, Tim Schafer has pointed to 1948 story The Lottery by Shirley Jackson, with a spoiler warning if you read it.Over all, it's a very good and humorous story experience, if you're a lore fan you will probably really get into the game, but if you're looking for hard thinking nuts to consider, the puzzles of the first act will not give you full satisfaction, but I think you will have a hard time finding somebody that played the first act that is not eagerly anticipating the second act.A warning though: Don't view any let's plays of this game, or you will spoil it utterly.

												My review of Broken Age can be broken in two (pun!). First, the bad: This is a very simple game that puts up only a ghost of a challenge. What's worse is that unsolicited hints come in like crazy, treating the player like a kid. I'd compare the gameplay to some of Telltale Games' easier fare (Wallace & Gromit, Back to the Future), but with the hint system on. Secondly, the good; and there is a lot of that. This is a beautiful game. It's 2D, it animates like a flash game, but man is it the most gorgeous, eye-popping flash game out there. I've seen a lot of Lead Artist ""Bagel"" Stapley's work for Broken Age in documentaries, but seeing it so crisp and clear in the game does his talent justice. The animations are also very fluid and charming, despite the limited technology. In terms of story, it was also one hand or the other. The story of Shay, the boy protagonist, feels a bit dreary and uninspired - which may be unfair considering he was trying to escape a dreary and uninspiring situation. However, playing Vella, the female protagonist was a treat through and through. Great scenes, great characters, great situations. It's like the game saved most of the great bits for this half. Broken Age Part 1 also ends in an unexpected cliffhanger that still continues to have me wonder what happened and what's going to happen next. I can't wait to play Part 2, which is a good sign that I enjoyed the game despite the few issues I had.In short, this is a game for those who are really into story, and will forgive gameplay that is almost condescendingly easy. If that's you - it's definitely me - then I highly recommend this game.			"

												I was one of the people who backed this game on Kickstarter years ago. I like point-and-click puzzle games for their stories, and Double Fine has done some other games that I've loved.Broken Age was... disappointing. The review would have been rather glowing if I'd written it when we were still waiting for the second act to be released. But with the release of the conclusion of the game, it feels... lazy? The first act introduces two interesting storylines with colorful, interesting landscapes (Or, sort-of landscapes) to explore. True to P&C adventure games, you meet all manner of interesting, quirky people, and get to ask them all manner of interesting, quirky questions.The second act offers... very little. For the most part you're revisiting the areas you saw before, but with the other character. Dialog options seem less varied and numerous, and puzzles begin to feel more like legwork than puzzles (Get X item that's on the opposite side of the game and bring it back to me).The ending feels sort of lackluster, but it may simply be that it's a letdown after the outright grueling back-and-forth grind of setting things up required for completing the final puzzle.

												++ Charming characters and amusing dialog, as expected from any Double Fine production+ Competent voice acting+ Not-bad story.  Not great, but good- Tumblr nose.  In fact, the only likeable thing about this game's art style are the backgrounds-- Extremely short;  Act 1 only took 4 hours to complete, and word has it there's only going to be an Act 2 after this.  Unless Double Fine really digs in and amps up the elements of what makes the adventure game genre great in the forthcoming Act 2, I wouldn't recommend this game.--- The most significant negative:  No challenge at all;  this adventure game has the easiest ""puzzles"" I've encountered in any point-and-click to date.  I'm not saying it should be Sierra-level difficult, but it's not unfair to expect a few good head-scratchers once in a while.  Alas, there were none.Verdict:  Not Schafer's best.  I know he can direct and produce a better game than this.  Play Psychonauts and Grim Fandango instead.P.S.:  If Act 2's development makes a 180 degree turn and ends up being awesome by not repeating Act 1's more egregious mistakes, I will happily eat my shoe and give credit where it's due.

												Wow! This game did everything right, even the ending. So it starts off in act 1, you get to switch between two characters (Shay and Vella). The puzzles in act 1 are mediocre not too difficult not too easy, act 2 the puzzles get more difficult and complex. You need to use clues from Vellas story in Shays puzzles and vice versa. The art is amazing aswell its sort of cartoony but still gives the characters life. Now the real gem of this game is its story, incredibly unique ive never seen a similar story. As you play the story unfolds in unimaginable twists. Not to mention how immersive the atmosphere is. This game is a diamond if you like puzzle games, if you end up buying it i hope you enjoy it as much as i did.			"

The puzzles were interesting but many times required a strategy guide to figure out.			"

												Broken Age, is a beautiful little point-click game full of cute wonderful characters. I bought it around when act one was first released and enjoyed the cute humor that it brought. The stroy telling was wonderful. I waited eagerly weeks, even a few months for act two to come out. When it finnally did, the game felt diffrent. The puzzles where harder, the storyline felt rushed, and the art style felt changed. Act two was a disappointment for me, I felt like I wasted my time waiting for it.I really wish I can say, ""yes buy this game"", but I have to say, ""NO don't buy it.""			"

												Tim Schafer and friends made another cool game. The Writing is Double-fine quality: Great writing with bits of humor thrown around. The Gameplay is what you come to expect from a point and click adventure game. click to walk around, Item Inventory to use for puzzles, etc. Nothing truly groundbreaking but compared to old 90s point and clicks like Day of the tentacle and Sam & max the interface is way better. It serves it's purpose well. Would say it feels better than the recent telltale games.The Puzzles have a sense of logic to them, they arn't Phoenix-Wright/Ghost Trick style Logic-Leaping but it isn't  ""Fit round object into round slot"" easy.The Voice acting is really well done. it is easily the highest quality part of the game. Nothing felt out of place and nothing got annoying to me.The Characters are great too, From the crazy cloud people to the Blind Guardians of the Dead Eye God. Even the Hipster lumberjack (now named Curtis) which was made fun of early in development is funny.The Soundtrack is great for what it does, but it's not something i would loop on my Music player when im not playing.The art style is beautiful. I Pressed the screenshot button alot to get some desktop wallpaper out of it.It's quite obvious that the ending part was slapped together quickly because it randomly became a two part series in development, But i can't wait for part 2. Don't want to spoil anything.I would recommend buying it. If you have a longing for a classic point and click adventure or want something like the Telltale Sam and Max Games i would get it. Though if your expecting something like the Walking dead or Wolf Among Us with ~~choices~~ and stuff like that don't get it.also, it got me to write a review thats more than two sentences, it's that good.

												The good:- The characters and their banter was rather entertaining most of the time- Voice acting was great- The art is beautiful, albiet cartoonyThe Meh:- The soundtrack while enjoyable wasn't all that memmorable- Spending time backtracking through reused enviorments - Doesn't take itself seriously, which isn't a bad thing as a whole, but that doesn't make it all that gripping either.The bad:- Some rather forced/tedious puzzles    "" Some required knowledge unknown to your present character that you gained when playing the other one    "" Some didn't really make sense, and required a guide to finish (at least for me, though I doubt I'm alone in that)    "" Some made me abuse print screenshot and paint to keep track of some reused puzzles that were 'randomized'- Reusing enviorments - No replay value, unless you crave achievements- Weak plot/setting - The ending/puzzle almost made me appreciate Mass Effect 3's endingOverall?It had tons of potential, and prior to the 2nd act, I would have recommended it in a heartbeat. Yet, the middle/late half othe game dragged most of the way until the so called 'ending' was the final nail in the coffin, destroying what love the 1st half had garnered. Don't purchase this game, even when it becomes cheap.The characters can't carry the weak plot, the art can't cover up the reused enviroments, and the gameplay is not only lackluster but it lacks replayability. It might be beautiful at first, but this candle will burn itself out rather quickly. Your time would be better spent elsewhere.			"

												I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this game.  Well, actually, story with puzzles.  I liked that most puzzles were not too difficult, but enough to make it fun. (Remember the wiring!  That will make sense the first time you play and realize you paid no attention.)The story was deeper than I thought it would be and, happily, longer than I thought it would be.  Don't let the unusual art work deter you.  It is more sophisticated than it seems from the previews.  It fits well with the story and I enjoyed this.As for playability, I've played through once so this is from a one-time play-through perspective.  Let me put it this way, if you enjoy reading a story, setting it aside for awhile and then reading it again, you could replay and enjoy it. If, however, you are a person who reads a book once and never reads it again, you may not enjoy playing it again.  But I bet you enjoy playing it at least once. Though the story seems to be set, the fact that you are allowed to solve the problems in your own time, and some interaction is done differently, I think you could play it more than once.I definitely recommend it.

												Very brief comments because this game needs no more reviews:The good is that it is beautiful, well acted, clever, unique, and solvable without hints.  It does not overfill your inventory, and it has Jack Black in it (briefly).The bad is that the story gradually fell apart because you see so little about the real antagonists, and we all know the story was contrived to suit the split gameplay, not to mention the badly split development schedule.The game is almost a 10 anyway, and probably would have been if they had developed it all at once and I had played it all at once. That also killed my opportunity to get many of the achievements on one run-through. They weren't in place when I played the first half of the game.			"

												Story of the game tries to be something more than it is but its still ok I think. I'm not going to argue about that. Maybe about really disappointing and uninspired ending. Act 1 has good and well maybe not logical but intuitive puzzles that are relaxing. Act 2 on the other hand... Act 2 starts off as good as act 1, but as the story unfolds more and more puzzles seem to be getting rushed and just be like 'do everything with everything and maybe something will push the story'. As the first half of the game was great, the second part, and to be precise around last 10% - 20% of the story was frustrating and I had to go to check walktroughs. I just couldn't force myselft to grind solutions. I think that may be why the game has such a high recommendation percentage. It just gets poor but very late and not a lot of players stay to see this. I feel baited and robbed of good closure.			"

												Recommended for:- people who love point-and-click adventures- younger gamers (it's ""family friendly,"" as they say)- people who are willing to suffer a little to see some pretty, whimsical design- people who don't have too much pride to use a walkthrough at timesNot recommended for:- people who get frustrated or bored with long, tedious point-and-click puzzles- people who want to feel emotionally attached to the charactersOh man, there are so many good things about this game, and I really want to recommend it. :( The art is colorful, the settings are interesting, and the story is really cool. The character design is splendid. Actually the overall design of everything is splendid. The female protagonist is pretty awesome, and I think the story has some good messages. Some of the dialogue is really witty too, and all in all the game seems really well thought out. I like the story, too -- lots of good plot twists, interesting, unique.But... maybe it was too well thought out. It started out fun enough, though at times I had to wonder to myself ""I feel like this game is meant for an age range of about 8 to 13???"" (But it is marketed as ""family friendly,"" so I shouldn't complain now.) By the second act, everything starts to feel extremely tedious. It took me forever just to get through the puzzles. It felt like I'd have to walk through a million rooms and do things *just right* just to get things to work. Whereas I didn't have to use any walkthroughs in the first half of the game, I kept getting so frustated at how slow things were in the second half that I resorted to them multiple times near the end. By the end of the game, I just wanted to be done.In addition, despite having a really cool story to begin with... the tedium somehow ruined it for me. I felt completey unattached to the characters. I liked the female protagonist well enough, she seemed really strong and daring and at least that gave her some kind of characterization. The other protagonist, well... if he'd fallen into a pit and died at some point I really couldn't have cared less. Which is sad, because his backstory is interesting enough and I feel like there could have been more... introspection there? Even a little?In all fairness, point-and-click adventures aren't really my thing, I guess. I hadn't played one in a long time and I wanted to try this game because of all the good reviews. But... I WAS SO BORED. I want to give other point-and-click games the benefit of the doubt, because I'm certain I've played some that aren't quite so tedious. If you're into this type of game, maybe you'll like Broken Age anyway -- after all, it does have a lot of cool elements in it. I just feel like they missed some things in the execution.Saving grace: It has tree jokes. And makes fun of hipsters, whom we all love to hate. Feels like there's some of that classic Monkey Island humor in there, too.So... time to make like a leaf and... no, never mind.			"

A thoroughly enthralling experience from start to finishBroken Age tells the story of a girl and a boy, living very different lives, whose paths eventually converge in a rather unexpected way. Throughout the game, you have the option of switching between Vella (the girl) and Shay (the boy) at any time. The game plays out like any other point-n-click adventure game, with full voicing throughout. Puzzles comprise the typical adventure game obstacles, as well as a few teasers that require a bit of logic, thinking, or working out.The Good- Superbly high quality production (well, it did cost $9+ million to make[www.gamesindustry.biz])- Absolutely gorgeous artwork and graphics- Excellent music- Top-notch voicing (Elijah Wood plays the male lead, & Jack Black one of the characters you meet along the way)- Engaging gameplay & story- Humorous in bits throughout the game- Great writing- Switching between the 2 characters adds an added level of interest- Lots of beautiful environments to explore- Game world is detailed & immaculately conceivedThe Bad- No way to skip just one line of dialogue; skipping will cause the entire dialogue to end- Story is rather short- One of the puzzles is very tedious and involves trial & error until you get the correct configurationConclusionThis is a must-play if you consider yourself a fan of point-n-click adventure games. Broken Age's brilliantly crafted world is magical and highly immersive, and the story well plotted out with clear direction and goals. I grabbed this during sale at S$5, which I consider a more than worthy price to pay for such an epic and enjoyable experience.			"

												Lacking the charm, intelligence and writing of some of the better point-and-click games of the past decade, this seems to be a rather lackluster experience and one of the worse written games that came out of Tim Schafer’s production company.The bad:-A really lackluster story; and seeing how the story seems to be the game’s focus, this is saying a lot. A good setup for a story that starts out strong but turns out to be quite a mess in both character’s cases. Either lackluster or just completely stupid twists thrown in for good measure.-Completely simple puzzle solution that most people probably won’t even want to think about. Use everything with everything wins the day here; and even then it is just way too easy to advance.-Really bad, sometimes grotesque humor. Characters seem to try to be funny, but fail miserably most of the time. While some lines are worth a few chuckles, this does not come even close to some of the amazing writing and humor of other games of the genre like Sam and Max or the Monkey Island series.-Short. Very short.-Just really bland characters in general. Some of them can be entertaining, some of them even memorable, but most of the time you will just get thrown more and more characters onto your face without them having any sort of character development, interesting traits, stories, or anything else that would make them stand out.  The good:-If you like how point-and-clicks work, this is a fairly clean UI that works well.-Graphics are interesting, but obviously might not be for everyone’s taste. It has a unique art style though, and is visually interesting, so that should be noted.-Voice acting is mostly really good.-The atmosphere, especially at the beginning of the game, is really well presented. The game might make you feel uneasy, and even if it doesn’t, it presents its world very well at the start. Sadly, this somewhat falls off as the story progresses, and by the time you hit the end of Act 1, you will notice that the best part of the game was actually the beginning.In general, it is a game that is hard to recommend to anyone. Horrifyingly short, quite silly mess of a story, uninteresting characters for the most part and just a lack of anything great besides the interesting art style and good voice acting make this a game that only die-hard fans of the genre or Tim Schafer’s games should check out. The rest might want to wait for a sale or just skip it completely.			"

												I might recommend this game, yes, but at this point, only if it's on sale.The game is over fast. We're talking 5 hours gameplay at most, with little or no replayability.It's well written, but there drama doesn't work as it's supposed to.The talent is great.It's a very, very pretty game.The soundtrack and special effects are amazing.The game is very very easy at times.There's only one bit where you're completely stumped, but you can work it out with enough time.It's an ok game, but there are parts where I think a movie would work better. I was all excited for Shay's (the guy from the future) story, but honestly, it's so simple I think a movie would have worked out better. There's like, one puzzle with different parts in it, and it's not complicated or hard, it's just tedious.This is not the best adventure game of it's time, at least, it isn't yet.The price isn't worth it. for this amount of money, I could get Machanarium and still have enough money left over to get another cheap one, that would not only have more game time, but would also have more replayability.The game feels like a letdown for me at this point.

												I'll have to play more of this, but for now i unfortunately have to give this game a ""not recommended"". While I love the artwork, voice acting, and general concept; this game just seems to not deliver. What I mean by this is it's a bit boring and bland; the story line is not the best and the game play a bit slow and dry. I've played quite a few point and click games, choose your own adventure games, and interactive novels; and I have to say story is everything. I never got engrossed or interested in the characters, and got really bored on three seperate occasions of starting it up. While having previously said I love the graphics, soundtrack, voice acting, and concept of two seperate character plots played at the same time until they merge; it suffers from lack of fun.			"

												Act I is easy, act II is a bit too difficult and frustrating. If you don't follow a walkthrough atleast once in Act II colour me surprised. I'm sure it's possible to not follow a walkthrough but when the game starts to bore you to death with back and forth walking then what are you gonna do. That's right. Time is precious. To the walkthroughs we go for some sweet solid guidance.Best wishes An axe wielding psychopath			"

												I honestly can't understand why some people claim that ""this isn't even a point&click adventure! it's dumbed down and made for tablets!"" or ""oh my god, WE paid 3 millions for a flash game!"". I finished this today and here are some of my thoughts:- It looks gorgeous. I totally loved some of the hand painted sceneries. I can understand why it might not appeal to some people; however, if you don't like the style, that's no reason to qualify it as a ""cheap looking flash game"". Even if they have a childish vibe, the backgrounds and the characters are well polished. Moreover, I feel that they have a little more personality than the regular cartoonish or detailed fairytale-ish style of recent point&click adventures. But as I said, it's a matter of taste. Look at the screenshots and decide for yourself if it's your kind of game.- It is easier to play than most of the old school point&click adventures. If you're looking for pixel hunting, engineering puzzles and running around with 20 items in your inventory, this might not be your kind of game. I found it to my liking, since I'm not a fan of spending 2 hours on a puzzle or constant alt-tab-ing to check the walkthrough. They said the second part will feature harder puzzles, so you might want to wait for the reviews of the full game, if you're not sure it will be enough of a challenge for you.- The music and voice acting are great, and that means a lot. Most adventures released in the past few years have very bland, if not outrightly bad voice acting. Elijah Wood and Masasa Moyo did a great job voicing the main characters. I also enjoyed the performances of David Kaufman (as Marek) and Wil Wheaton (as the hipster lumberjack).- I didn't find it as funny as the old Lucas classics (Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle), but it made me chuckle several times. It is definitely a charming game. - As I started to grow fond of the characters and feel warm and fuzzy inside, the first part was over. Yeah, I agree it's a little too short. Not 2.5-3 hours long, as some complained, more like 4 or so (it took me 5 hours to finish it). Still short. Ending the first part on a cliffhanger didn't help.So, tl;dr:DON'T buy this game if:- You're not a fan of point&click adventures;- You don't like this particular hand drawn style of graphics;- You like your puzzles ruthless with a touch of illogical;- You hate playing games in a seasons/episodes format.

												There are certain animated children's movies that strike an emotional chord, which compel adults to keep watching them over and over again.  This game manages to capture that emotional chord.  I'm sure kids will love it, but there's something special about the story that will draw in adults and make you feel something.The scenes are gorgeous, as is the music.  Controles are simple, and the puzzles are challenging enough without forcing you to figure out, say, how to connect your chicken to a pulley.  If you're a point and click puzzle adventure afficionato, this game will be easy.Reading some of the negative reviews, I'm surprised how much dislike there is for part two.  Personally, I really enjoyed getting to revisit locations as they change and watching the two main characters get to know each other indirectly.  The puzzles got harder in part two, but given how easy they are in part one, that's not a bad thing.  You get to see all the characters you've met earlier change, develope, and grow.In terms of plot, the one thing I wish would have been changed was part one.  I felt like there wasn't really time to establish Vella's character the way there was for Shay.  I had a very strong sense of who Shay was as a person in part one, but since Vella's story was so driven by her adversity to the obstacles around her, it wasn't really until part two that I began to get a sense of her personality beyond being willing to stand up for herself.  It would have been nice to have her do some small puzzle unconnected to the maiden's feast to define her personality to the player, before her adventure started.I'll admit also I bought this on sale, so I didn't mind so much that it was short.  (I took my time and it lasted about 14 hours.)  Never the less, I will definitly be replaying this game, just like I rewatch Toy Story and the Iron Giant.			"

												Great point and click adventure/puzzle game. The beginning of the game made me go ""Wha-? What is this!? WHY?"" but as the story unfolded I got more and more into it. The mechanics of the game is pretty great; you don't get annoyed by waiting for your character to walk across the whole area before going into the next screen and the cameras are dynamic. But maybe I've just played too much of the early-2000 point & clicks. Stunning graphics with unique style. Great voicing.			"

												Being one the people who got this game gifted after the second act came out, I think I can give it a look that isn't sullied by backer's disctontent. So let's go and try to do it.The game starts off great - you got 2 pretty different characters in rather different settings going on about their rather unusual daily lives. The world is bizzare, characters are colorful and voice acting is great, music score while nothing spectacular does compliment the tone of adventure very well, so it really drags you in for the first 1 or 2 hours. At that stage puzzles are almost trivial and you spend more time listening to dialog and exploring the world, rather than getting frustrated filling out charts and solving equasions, it feels like you playing a lighthearted interactive movie more than playing a game.After about 4 or so hours in, with a bit of twist at the end, 1st act of the game ends and unfortunately what follows it up is one big mess. Act 2 is pretty much a dissapointment in a variety of ways - you meet next to none new characters, 95% of the locations you will visit are rehashes of the old ones, the plot unravels itself but leaves holes and doesn't really give a satisfying ending to the story. One important thing to notice about second act is the difficulty of puzzles - it racks up in a big way, so much, you would be excused to think devs have tried making second act feel longer by making you spend majority of the time scratching your head. Main strengths of the game so far: characters, dialog, bizzare setting, fade out at this stage in favour of trying to figure out what's the trick behind another wiring puzzle. It really kills the mood of the whole story and leaves a sour taste in a mouth.At the end I feel troubled recommending this game, for even though I still managed to squeeze some fun out of it, I also didn't have to spend any money, which made me far less judgmental. Since it doesn't really doesn't have interesting satisfying puzzles, or at least a decent enough ending to the story, I urge you to purchase this product at your own discretion, for it can really get your hopes up only to crash them down and leave you feeling dissapointed.

The puzzles are amazingly intuitive despite the unrelated nature of the puzzle pieces.... or am I just able to read Tim's mind?Anyhow I was surprised by the plot twist at the end of Act 1 and could not help thinking about was must lie ahead....

												A very beautiful. compelling, and hilarious adventure that's sure to keep you entertained for a good while. I bought this game on a whim during the summer steam sale, and I very much enjoyed it. The characters were very fun and colorful, and all of them were fun to interact with. The puzzles range from simple to very complex, and the story had me guessing in quite a lot of ways. My only complaints would be that some of the puzzles seemed way too difficult and I had to look up some answers, but that might just be that this was really my first point and click game like this, and I wish the story was a little longer since I though somethings could've been fleshed out a little bit more. Other than that this game was a fun experience and if you want to fun game to get into, this game will do just fine.			"

												TL;DR: Supremely entertaining and gorgeousRichly-imagined and lovely worldbuilding, characters and story. Great twists, hilarious dialogue with brilliant voice-acting, funny and clever puzzles, so much charm and attention to detail, and looks and sounds absolutely beautiful with its painted imagery and orchestral score. In the game you get to switch freely between two likable young teenage protagonists in very different worlds, rebelling against a system imposed on them, and as the player advances their storylines they can begin to see the connections between them and use that to get them to help each other out.Vella has the 'honour' of being offered as a sacrificial maiden to appease a monster attacking her village, but she decides to fight back instead. Shay has grown up on his own on a spaceship programmed to serve his every need and coddle him, and decides he needs to break free and try to make a real difference.			"

												This game took me back. It's fortunate that I waited for both episodes to play, since the wait between them put so many people off. Now that it's one complete package I think it works fine. This is a good example of why episodic games can either work or fail. If episodic means you tire everyone out, it hurts your game. If it means everyone is thrilled by a cliffhanger by the new episode, it helps your game. I am recommending this now, but I think breaking it up hurt this game, and I think that is unfortunate. It's still a gem, and Double Fine has an opportunity to learn from their mistakes.			"

												edit:This review was written long ago in the past, when only Act 1 (half of the game) was available & I didn't know when (or if) I will be able to play the rest of it. Act 1 was released on January 2014 and Act 2 just now (April 28, 2015), so as you can see it was a long wait for many people. I will rewrite this review as soon as I'll complete the second part of the game. :)----------Broken Age is a classical in nature point & click adventure game, that focuses mostly on the story, characters & dialogue. Puzzles themselves aren't challenging, although they are logical and support the narration nicely. Visuals are really charming - a distinct painted 2D art style. The setting (or settings, as there are two protagonists) is fresh and manages to grasp and keep the interest up.Too bad this is just Act 1, or in other words - it's half a game, and ends with a cliffhanger. Certain parts of the plot are explained by the end, but not nearly enough & the ending scene just made me want to immediately play Act 2, which is unfortunately unavailable at this point.The game itself is quite short. It took me 4h 20min to beat it and I certainly didn't rush it. I visited every location, talked with everyone about everything and tried to interact with every object.Even though I would prefer to play both Acts at once & not wait indefinitely for 2nd half of the game, I'm still recommending this game :) It's charming, intriguing and enjoyable, provided one likes story focused adventures.

												This game is short, but so sweet that I'm glad there's to be an Act 2 some time later this year, or so I've heard (About the later this year thing, not about the act 2, that's been confirmed). I've seen some reviews that list this as a game they wouldn't recommend, and I think in some cases that may be because the game can be considered a bit too linear. Choosing different dialogue options won't throw you in a different direction like in some games, and for the most part you can figure out where you need to go and what you need to do next by exhausting every line of dialogue available to you. Before I bought the game, when I saw that there were different dialogue options available to the player, I wouldn't have thought that would be the case, but it didn't bother me, per se, and here's why.The game is beautifully rendered and a joy to look at, it has an air of whimsy and a tongue in cheek flavor that I couldn't get over. There were some jokes that would go right over kids' heads, which is probably for the best, but which didn't fail to get a laugh out of me.  You know, those kind of jokes. I always count those as a plus.Also, despite thinking a few times that I had the game pinned down, in other words thinking that I knew where it was going, I found with good humor that I was wrong. It managed to provide a twist that I didn't see coming, and for that I have to give it some more points. I finished the game in a few hours and I wish I had part 2 right now. I picked it up for 40 percent off (14.99) and I would say that it's worth more than that, counting the fact that there's more on the way and that I'm a sucker for a good story/twist.			"

												With charming art and animation, together with stellar voice-acting, Broken Age is an enjoyable adventure.However, the combination of a somewhat lackluster story and puzzles that sometimes become quite head-scratching does deflate the experience a bit.Occasionally the story gets a bit interesting with the two protagonists' experiences mirroring each other. Also, while the story itself isn't very deep, the characters that you meet along the way are well-written and often funny. While never causing me to wipe tears of laughter from my eyes, Broken Age often made me smile.If you're looking to enjoy lovely visuals, well-written dialogue and excellent voice-acting, this is the point'n'click adventure for you. If you're looking for an engaging and thought-provoking story, I'm afraid this game simply doesn't offer that.			"

It's a great point-and-click adventure with an intriguing plot and very interesting characters although I didn't got attached to them as much as I would've liked. The voice acting and the overall design of the game are just plain beautiful.But yes. The puzzles in act 2 are just plain annoying and I had to use a guide to complete them. It was just hell to get through even though they were so hexa-cute!I'd recommend to get Broken Age on a sale and even if you don't like difficult puzzles, there are plenty of no-spoiler guides online. If you do like them, the Act 2 is perfect for you :)➡️️Final Rating: 7/10			"

												To be honest, I looked into Broken Age because one of my best friends said ""Hey, I saw someone playing this game and it looked like something up your alley."" With that in mind, I wishlisted the game. Time passed and I saw that during the Summer 2014 sale that Broken Age was on sale. I picked the game up and fell in love immensely. Broken age is GORGEOUS. It could just because I really like hand-painted games but Broken Age has a special place in my heart for sure. As a child who grew up playing Point and Click games, to return to the genre is actually rather refreshing. The story of Broken Age is a coming-of-age tale about a boy and a girl from two unlikely worlds who's stories connect in some way. I'm very happy that I picked this game up, and I am looking forward to Act Two!			"

												Terrible ending = terrible.This game had a lot of promise, act 1 set up the premise of two teenagers strugging with the situation thrown at them, one with an overbearing 'mother' isolated on a space ship while the other is rebellious of the paccifist nature of the sacrificing madiens ritual to the 'mog chothra.'   Then act 2 came along and slapped us across the face, not only by poorly completing the tale but giving us a really lame ending that makes you feel like you've accomplished nothing.  With all the money pooring in this game you'd think i'd be more than eye candy, but sadly that's not the case.  The puzzles themselves were, okay I guess, except the ending puzzle in act 2 the wiring the robots puzzle can go straight to hell.  It's even worse that if you dont memorize the pattern for them, and progress to a point of no return, you can softblock yourself and have to start over from your last save file because you can't remember the formula to solve the rewiring puzzle.  All in all this game is dissapointing, not a bad game, just dissapointing, you might want to skip this one.			"

												My impressions at length, if you're not sure why I reached this conclusion: http://xander77.livejournal.com/27144.htmlAlso, your steam playtime counts the time the game spent paused while alt-tabbing. I have in fact played through the game once, and it took about 7 hours of actual playtime. Part 1 was a nostalgic, traditional (charming) point and click adventure. Part 2 is very much not.The puzzles in part 1 were very much typical, nostalgic point-and-click adventure puzzles that could be solved by talking to everyone and clicking on everything. They were mostly logical, congruent with their setting, and solvable by understanding how the locale in which they are found works. The puzzles in part 2 are ""puzzle game"" puzzles for the sake of puzzles (does puzzle look like a word anymore?), in the tradition of Myst or (a better example) Puzzle Agent 2. They are arbitrary, have little to do with their surroundings, and interchangeable.The thing is - no one at Double Fine ever designed a ""puzzle game"" before and (consequently?) they are really really terrible at it. In (say) Puzzle Agent, you solve a puzzle by figuring it out logically (mathematically, whatever). In Broken Age act 2, you solve a puzzle by following instructions. The only difficulty you're facing is the fact that the instructions were written by a drooling retard, and you have to write them out and puzzle the meaning from the gibbering.(Also - almost everything in act 2 is also recycled from act 1, and the conclusion to the story makes absolutely no freaking sense.)I rather enjoyed the first act, though it was over in 2 hours or so (fairly complete exploration with no walkthrough). Act 2 had very little joy, and was mostly frustratingly obtuse. I would not recommend you purchase it. In fact, I really should have youtubed a playthrough of act 2 after completing act 1, even though I already had the game.			"

												The game was delivered in to parts - Act I and Act II. If you play the game fresh without knowing that it'll immeidately become obvious though because Act I is full of beautiful art and storytelling and puzzles thar are creative but overly simplistic. Unforatunately the designer took heed of the massive complaints on the ease of the puzzles in Act I and apparently vowed to fix that in Act II. He did.  Act II continues to use the same wonderful intuitive UI and fantastic art and music but the puzzles suddenly jump from a small part of the overall game to stupidily hard. As in - even if you have a walkthrough telling you exactly what you need to do it's still tricky to solve. To make matters worse most of the puzzles in Act II have no rhyme or reason to why you're doing them. Luckily you'll be rewarded with a mediocre story and ending.			"

												Double Fine set out to make a classic adventure game, and they succeeded. Broken Age is intriguing, hilarious, and the only downside is that having the game split into two acts has had fans sitting on a cliffhanger since the start of 2014.			"

												Ok, so I finally finished the first act.  I'm a little slow on these games sometimes except for the most part, not this one.  I figured out all the puzzles in Shay's story pretty easily; it was only when I got to Vella's story that I started having trouble, and even then it was only one or two things that kinda didn't make sense to me (until after the fact).  The voice acting is mostly good, though I'm not fond of Vella's voice.  Everyone else feels like they fit very well, especially Shay's ""Mom"".  The graphics are kinda like what you'd imagine if someone had to painstakingly create each scene out of construction paper cut into various shapes.  It looks better than that, but it still has that feel to it.  The music is nice and fits very well; but unlike the Soundtrack to the Monkey Island games, few tunes make me really want to hear them again.Certain characters in the game really stand out though, and make me wish they had much more of a role to play (maybe they'll show up again in Act II?).  The humor is great and made me laugh out loud in a few parts, but again, if you compare it to Monkey Island, it doesn't hold up as well.  Otherwise there's lots of cleverness in the game, but clever doesn't mean funny in a lot of cases.I'm definitely glad I was a backer for this game, and I really look forward to Act II, and I'd say you should definitely buy this game if old school adventure games are a thing you're into.  It won't quite reach the same standards as the classics, but yet nothing else comes closer than this. "

												If you've ever heard of a game being Kickstarted, you can thank Broken Age for it. It was almost two years ago when Tim Schafer decided that he wanted to make another point-and-click adventure game, and he wanted the internet to fund it. Needless to say, it was a resounding success, and for a while all we wanted to talk about[thenexus.tv] was games on Kickstarter. The first half of Broken Age is out now, with the second half coming later this year.The game is split into two different stories, with two different protagonists: Vella on the left, and Shay on the right. Once you choose one of them, you start their story, but you can switch between them at any time. I used this once when I got frustrated with a puzzle I was having trouble with.Vella's story starts off in her village, which is made up entirely of bakers. Every generation they have the Maidens' Feast, where several young women are offered up to a big monster called Mog Chothra so it won't destroy the village. Needless to say, Vella is not thrilled about this and decides to fight back. Her adventure takes her to a couple of other villages, one that just had their Maidens' Feast, and another getting ready for its Maidens' Feast.Shay on the other hand lives a pretty boring life: he's been living on a spaceship his whole life, and the simulation missions the ship throws at him have gotten pretty boring because they were designed for a toddler. Eventually he breaks out of this rut and discovers a whole new part of the ship that he has never seen before, and some real missions to embark on.Visually the game is gorgeous. Everything looks hand painted, and in typical point-and-click fashion the camera is usually fixed, at most moving left or right as you move around the environment. There were a few places where I thought the textures looked low-resolution, but honestly it wouldn't have made much of a difference because of the art style.Mechanically it plays almost exactly like a point-and-click from the 90's. Or at least that's what I assume because I wasn't doing much video gaming in the 90's. All of the ""puzzles"" involved finding a specific item or combination of items to use in a particular way in a particular place to solve a problem. Most times it was pretty clear what needed to be done, and failing that just a little snooping around would uncover the solution. There was that one time though where the solution involved going back and forth through several areas to get different items, and I completely did not understand what I was supposed to do. Yeah, I looked up the solution to that one.One of my favorite things about Broken Age is the voice cast. Having people like Elijah Wood, Jennifer Hale, and Jack Black in the same game is delightful to my nerd brain. And Wil Wheaton playing a hipster lumberjack hiding from the talking trees was the best moment of my week.It took me just over four hours to complete Act 1, and they left us on quite the cliffhanger. It's definitely worth getting now, because Act 1 is a good length to finish in one or two sittings. This is one of the few games I have played that is appropriate for both adults and kids, so if you are a parent check it out. It's a little hard to name a good price because I have no idea how good Act 2 will be; if it keeps up the quality that Act 1 had, I would say that $20 is a good price.			"

Totally worth the price!True, puzzles aren't what you'd call even moderately difficult, but I understand that.Nowadays no one has the time to ponder upon unsolvable puzzles for days, like in 90's.There's plenty of other competitive product out there, people can just go and play something else and Double Fine realizes that.They've made a gorgeous adventure game, that has fine humour, great voice acting, original story and characters.Also, it runs just great on my Core2Duo elementaryOS Linux Laptop with 2GB RAM and crappy Intel integrated graphics, which made me extra happy!Enjoyment level: 90%Cons: Not enough Jack Black in the game :(Re-playability: Not really :(P.S.

												I wish Steam had an option between positive and negative.  I didn't HATE this game...it had some things going for it like gorgeous animation, spot on voice acting, and a few times it genuinely made me laugh.  The ending of Part 1 was so fantastic and I utterly did not see coming.  But then in part two it wastes no time in bulldozing everything interesting about the first half and turning it into a very different much less interesting story. It almost felt like a betrayal. Nothing is really explained, there's plot holes big enough to fly a space ship through, and worst it doesn't even have much in the way of an ending rather then just stopping.  A good puzzle is the kind of thing that's challenging, but when you finally figure it out makes you go ""oooooooh!"".  These puzzles were not like that.  Some of the solutions were unbelievably obscure, even for a point and click adventure game.So while I can't say it's the worst thing I've ever played, based on all this it really just left me unsatisfied and wishing for it to have lived up to the potential the first half presented.

												I can't recommend this game.Act 1 is short, fun, and whimsical. Its puzzles are easy, which allows you to explore the beautiful environments and meet all of the interesting characters without too many barriers in your way.Act 2, on the other hand, is just a frustrating mess. The entire act merely retreads the areas visted in Act 1, which removes the element of exploration that makes act 1 interesting. Worse yet, a lot of the puzzles are just ridiculous. Obvious solutions never work, and the actual solutions often make no sense in terms of why they would work or why the characters would try them. I've spent hours going through the levels clicking everything and trying to use my items on every object, and this is a common trend among players. For some puzzles, you have to go to the other character's perspective in order to find the solution, but the game never tells you when this is required, and it goes counter to everything you've done in act 1, so you might go through entire levels looking for answers that aren't there.After Double Fine spent over a year developing act 2, it's such a disappointment to see recycled environments and puzzles that are just badly designed and badly thought out. Perhaps those problems might be more forgivable if the quality of the story made up for it, but it doesn't. Despite the brilliant setup in act 1, neither of the two main characters undergo much if any character development in act 2. Instead, we're treated to a bad science fiction plot which tries to explain the superficial elements of the world, and yet still leaves many questions unanswered in the cliffhanger ending. The villains expose themselves as something out of a children's cartoon, and some of the dramatic reveals only make sense if you don't think too deeply about act 1.This game is a huge disappointment to me, and thinking about it still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. If you want to see the interesting environments and the story that could have been, watch act 1 on youtube. If you must, watch act 2 on youtube as well. The game itself is absolutely not worth playing.			"

												If you want to play half a game; by all means buy this game. I have been waiting forever for Act 2 of this game, and when it came I was disappointed beyond belief. This game was going so well, the storyline was perfect, there was good humor! Yet, when this final act of the game finally came out I wish it never did.Storyline:The storyline in Act 1 was perfect. It had the perfect setting with the perfect amount of humor. Act 2 completely obliterates all of what you know and love of the original setting and storyline (and not in a good way). To add to this; humor is less present and even when it is it is poor. The characters in Act 2 are so disconnected it isn't funny. I began to ask myself ""Why can't I meantion this to that person?"" questions. There are so many things any logical person would tell another if they were in Shay's or Vella's position; but they aren't options. It feels like most of the dialog was thrown together without anying logical thinking in Act 2.Puzzles:Act 1 took me quite a while to finish but Act 2 took  forever . Act 2's puzzles are more of a chore than an enjoyment. I tried for  three hours  to finish Act 2 without cheating; but it was inevitable. I finally looked up a guide and had to use it basically the rest of the way. Even after I got past my struggle; the puzzles were still basically impossible. Act 1 required no transfer of knowledge between characters or to write anything down. I loved Act 1's puzzles because I didn't have to write anything down; I could actually figure out the puzzles without a paper in an enjoyable and slightly difficult way. Act 2 you suddenly need to write things down. Act 2 you also have to take your knowledge of one character's environment to anothers: this is horrible! While other games have done it, Act 1 did not. This should not have been just thrown in like that for Act 2.Overall:I have lost all love for this game as a whole. I can never give this game a positive vote with the way Act 2 has been made. I loved this game so much when it was just Act 1; when it had a storyline, when it had humor, when it had puzzles, when it  was  a game, but Act 2 has sent it into the ground and made the last six to seven hours of the game a chore.

												I'm not sure that this game feels like a traditional point and click adventure to me. There is no really difficult puzzles, no pixel scanning with the cursor and no revisiting areas and dialog trees over and over again, causing that all familiar frustration that comes with most point and click adventures. I know from being a backer and watching the documentary that Tim Schafer wanted to avoid this type of frustration and he certainly has achieved it. At the expense of more difficult puzzles? Yes. But that's not a bad thing. I kind of do wish they were just slightly harder, but truly I am not that bothered at all.Instead, this game is smooth and fun to ""play"". It's like walking into a piece of art, not only visually but the music and voice acting are also brillant. I have seen a couple of comments where people have mentioned the Spoon character, which is just awesome. He reminds me of ""Talky the Toaster"" from Red Dwarf.The best bit about playing this game is that it takes you into another world from a collective (double fine) imagination, where you really want to see what happens next and how it all pans out. The story is really quite compelling. And just wow, that ending :) Vella's side of the story is the most artistic and fun to play, but to get the best from it play Shay's side first right to the end. Although, you can of course switch between the girl/boy side at any point and continue from where you left off. Just don't complete Vella's side before Shay's. At least for me, I'm certainly glad I did it in this order.It should take you around 4 hours to complete Act 1, not the two hours that many mention. I wonder if they have even played both sides yet? Or just followed the first guide that was released? At the very least they didn't take the time to explore the content and dialog. ALthough I did get stuck on the helmet puzzle for a bit (no spoilers!).To all those wondering about the cost of this game (£17.09 with 10% off pre-purchase) all I can say is.. How much does it cost you for a ticket to go watch a movie nowadays? £8-10 for 1.5 hours of entertainment? If Act 2 is another 4 hours long, you do the math. Overall, I really enjoyed it and couldn't put stop playing just for the story. Can't wait for Act 2!			"

												I have completed the first act, and I have to say I am very pleased with what I have seen thus far of the game. The art style and animation are top notch. The game play is pretty limited, and the puzzles are relatively easy (which could be a good or bad point, depending on one's point of view). The story does have me engaged, and I am very much looking forward to its continuation. Without spoiling the game, I'll say that I thought I had the game figured out, only to have my pre-conceptions blown apart by the end of act 1. If you enjoy the adventure games of old, and were more into them for the story than the puzzles, I can't recoommend this game highly enough. If you are the sort that could care less about story and want gameplay however, I'd look elsewhere.			"

												Unfortunately, a good game was made bad by a terrible second half. I loved the game through the first act. The story kept itself interesting, there were some good twists, and I felt accomplished with each puzzle I solved. The beginning of the second act seemed good, but the further I got, the more awful it became. Terrible story progression, no good plot points, instantaneous ""character development,"" and insane puzzles that are very obviously hard for the sake of adding difficulty, where I was not pleased with solving them, rather I felt like I wasted hours of my time trying to figure out illogical things that can be done in (literally) mere minutes. I was heartbroken to see such a good product turn sour when it was at its peak. It turned into a ""try everything with everything"" extravaganza where even doing that wouldn't get your solution sometimes. Think of it this way: there's an achievement for finishing the game in under an hour, and the poor implementation of puzzles stretched my game time to nearly 10 hours. It's exactly like having two games, with the first game being amazing, and the second one being bad enough to regret buying. Personally, I think the entire last quarter of the game should just be redone so that I can like this game. I really want to, but I can't.			"

												So I was slightly dismayed by the price point initially, especially with the reported length of ~4 hours, but I did not initially realize that this game is using an episodic structure. If you are at all familiar with Telltale's adventure game work over the past few years- Tales from Monkey Island, The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, the Sam&Max games... so you're buying not only the game, but an unknown number of future acts in addition. Judging by history, you will probably get your money's worth by buying in on this.As for the game itself... initially I was expecting pretty much what I got; something silly, cute, and DEEPLY ♥♥♥♥ed up on a psychological level (as I fully expected and hoped for from something from the mind of Tim Schafer!). However... once I got to the end of the act and the plotlines were finally tied together, the ""♥♥♥♥ed upped ness"" reached a whole new wonderful level.If you have enjoyed ANYTHING in Tim Schafer's stable of products... Costume Quest, Brutal Legend, The Cave, Grim Fandango, Psychonauts, Full Throlttle, the first three Monkey Island games, Maniac Mansion or Day of the Tentacle...You will enjoy this game. And probably find in it a worthwhile purchase.			"

												I have to say that playing Act I was fun and did remind me of the olde adventures of the past.  The artwork and music are both stunning and extremely well done, and the voice acting is pretty great with Elijah Wood, Jack Black and others making the game feel well put together.Unfortunately, Act II is repetitive, boring and frankly feels like a cheap rip-off of Act I.  The scenery is almost identical.  The wiring puzzles are a pain in the proverbial (so much so I resorted to checking walkthroughs online) and the whole thing feels smashed together into a big pile of useless goo.I, like many others dropped $35 or more on this as a backer. I am thoroughly disappointed with it.  The wait was way too long and I still would like to know how something this poor could blow away millions of investment from backers so easily.  I miss games like DOTT, and this certainly doesn't compare with those high standards at all.A true shame, really.  It could have been so much better if they'd changed the scenery (secret rooms in Mog, other locations for Shay for example) and thought outside the box about the puzzles, but so many are too complex or obscure, or simply too easy, to enjoy.

												Almost one and a half year ago I praised this game for how interesting the setting was in Act 1: a boy trapped in a spaceship that doesent want him to be in danger, and a girl who haves to be sacrificed to a monster to save her village, but she's the only one who wants to fight that monster.In act one the story is so well driven, and the puzzles are fair and logical. Also most of the characters are very funny and interesting, but sadly very straight forward with little no backstory.Still, with such good premise, great art style and amazing plot twist at the end of Act 1, you expect that Act 2 would be a thrilling conclusion to this throwback to a different Point and Click era?Well, too ♥♥♥♥ing bad, because after one and a half year and 3.5 million dollars we got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending put togheter with spit and feces.The whole mistery around the plot made no sense, Shay's campain is all about finding some objects, that can really take 30 minutes at best (let's be honest, is way more fun to play with that guy then the other uninteresting character) and let's not mention that to complete some puzzles there's no logic: you're gonna need one clue from one of the two character to complete the other, thing is, they literally have no ways to contact with each others, not even telepaticly, and this is never explained through the whole game.The villian is just pathetic, same for his explanations, that have little no sense.This is just one angry fan talking about one and a half year of waiting and promises, and mostly expectation since this haves the work of Tim Shafer written all over it, the same person who created Psychonauts, Grim Fandango and Brutal Legends. I really had big hopes for this, now, I don't think anyone will trust any of his projects.			"

												This game as whole was a great experience, wonderful art direction, wonderful music, Alot of the puzzles were great, although some were difficult, but not impossible (plus every playthough changes a aspect of some specific puzzles in order to keep it difficult each time). The concept of two stories going at the same time was very well done, at first it felt very seperate, but as time goes by you notice that what you see in one side can help you with a puzzle in the other side, and I believe that was very clever. Story wise though, overall it could have been better, mostly for the ending, but it still was good, had a few good twists and it kept you thinking through out the game. Although from the looks of it alot of people did not seem to like the ending that much and thinks the game as a whole was horrible due to that. For me the journey is what matters and man that was a great journey. Plus it had a few cute ending credits pictures to get a good idea what happen after the game.Overall it was great and I recommend anyone to play it. As long as they don't care about the ending bieng a bit short in delivery.			"

												 At its current state, i.e. only part 1 released, I do not recommend this game. Do NOT buy until part 2 is released, whenever the hell that is ...  Recommending this game is really hard, since we only have half-ish (?) of it, thus making any critique is hard to put into perspective.  For instance, the puzzles are too easy BUT MAYBE in the second part it gets tougher (?).  The game is too short (took me 2-3 hours) BUT MAYBE the second part is longer (?). The puzzles and overall gameplay aren't great, but the writing and voice acting is great, BUT : The cliffhanger is not strong enough to warrant the wait for the second part (at the time I'm writing this, it's been 5 months since part 1 came out, which by itself is reason enough to be angry about this game) and because we get time to think about the cliffhanger ( 5 months +) you get plenty of time to figure out what's actually going on, which I felt ends up spoiling the build-up of part 1, thus breaking the narrative flow of the whole thing. It's just like when you tell a joke, you have to deliver the punch-line or else the whole thing falls flat. They promise they will eventually deliver the ""punchline"", but the joke is already ruined.			"

												At 90 minutes per story, which are not even finished, I absolutely regret owning this game. With no semblance of challenge, progress is dull and despite the all star cast of voice actors the game struggles to be enjoyable in an appreciable way. Would refund if it were possible.			"

												Overly simplistic, very easy with no real puzzles. It's more like an half-interactive novel with no challenge. Short and disappointing to say the least. I really can't recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the old Lucasarts games, you will be sorely disappointed. Maybe fun for someone who mainly play smartphone games and don't want to use more than one button and just watch some pretty images.			"

												It's an alright game but only half done - part 2 is yet to be released due to mismanagement. You'll have forgotten most of the story by the time it will be added. So if you managed to wait so far, hold off on buying it, make sure they actually build the 2nd part, then play the game as a whole.			"

												I don't usually write reviews but I just had to for Broken Age, mainly also because number of negative reviews here.In a short Broken Age is a ""traditional"" point and click adventure set in an interesting worlds. You controll two main charactes with possibility to switch between them any time, sometimes it is even necessary to find out a solution to puzzle in other character's ""world"". Main charactes are Vella, young girl which escapes her fate of a sacrifice for giant monster and Shay, a growing-up boy trying to escape his over-caring space ship. Plot is really interesting and I was hooked to see how will the two story lines cross or join.As for the puzzles, I have to say they are mostly fair. You are given an overall clear idea (or multiple goals) what has to be done and it is up to you to come up with the execution. Many people complain that some puzzles in Act II are unfair because you had to look for the answer with other character in his/hers world. I found it interesting and smart, requiring you to think outside of the box or pay attention to details. Kind of reminded me the old days of Day of the Tentacle.The art style and animation in game is beautiful, voice acting is excellent and dialogues are quite funny, I especially enjoyed Vella's interaction with ""hipster"" woodcutter. Not only because I like poop jokes :) What I didn't like so much is the harsh conclusion of the story. There was potential for Act III, it is shame that authors didn't extend the last part of the game to its own Act.			"

												Okay, so I bought this game because I'm so very fond of point and click games, but I have to say this one was hyped up to be much more than it was. I loved so many things about this game. The beautiful graphics, the voice acting very good, and the soundtrack very nice. But for a point and click game, it left me with few things to click and explore, its so linear that its rather boring. The secondary characters are pretty flat and you aren't give enough interactions to care about anyone in the world, including the characters themeselves. The only character that actually had any depth was Vella, even the second MC, Shay was flat and boring. As for the puzzles themselves, they weren't challenging, and there was no real ""challenge"" to them really, Just find stuff and use it on the right person or place and oooh you've done it.I hate to be the nay-sayer among so many voices crying how good it is, but even from a story standpoint, if this act was supposed to get me interested in the characters and wanting to know more about their plights, this acts fell incredibly short. A real shame because I really really wanted to like this game and was hoping for a fresh and new game with all the beauty this game has.I can't say I hated this game, it wasn't annoying or gaudy in any way, it as just bland. Which is a real shame since the art is so rich and alive, I had been hoping for a story and a game with those things in equal measure.			"

												I liked this game. I think? It's complicated, okay!Well, it isn't that I can't recommend this game. I would, to certain kinds of people and I know for sure that they are out there, it's just that I wouldn't to the majority out there. But let's get into this because as I said: It's complicated...Let's talk about the mechanics first. It's your standart Point'n'Click Adventure. Inventory system's a bit wonky but it does its job. Collect items, drag and drop, solve puzzles. That's about it. The only new and interesting thing - and the one that drew me to it in the first place - is that you switch between the two main protagonists and experience the world from their points of view. They didn't really do anything with it mechanic-wise until Part 2 though, so up until then it was only a gimmick really. But a nice one. I enjoyed switching between charakters every other puzzle and it helped to paint a better picture of the world and its story, in my opinion. Oh, story. In theory I should love this game. For me narrative is more key to a great experience than mechanics (a blend between the two being the ""perfect game"") which is why I enjoy games that do focus on it more than I do ""skill-based"" ones. Adventure games typically one of the genres that shine in that regard. And the story to Broken Age is interesting. Well, the ending of Part 1 that is and some of Part 2 up until its rather anticlimatic finish. All in all it's a story of coming-of-age, paralells and juxtapositions between the protagonists drawn rather well. All characters are likeable, the voice work is well done, the humour keeps your attention but nothing really stands out much.Looking at the other arts as well, the designs are great and so is the music, the animation does its job and all in all they work together well. But never before in my life have I found myself so physically tired while playing a game. Not frustrated, not bored, not overjoyed, not laughing - nothing. And that's a pitty because I like this game. It just does everything well but supposedly not well enough for me to really be enjoying it. And even when thinking back about the games I've played in my life this one will probably be forgotten somewhere down the line and to be honest, I'm kind of sad about it. Well, if you want to give it a try I can't NOT recommend it either. It's a bit pricey for the experience you get out of it, in my opinion, so if you ever catch it on sale and are curious about it, please, do help yourself. And I hope you'll be able to enjoy it more than I have.			"

												DO NOT BUY. The art style, characters, voice acting, quality sound production, and story are very enticing... But what we have as a result of a $4,000,000+ budget is definitely not a ""classic point-and-click adventure game"". Most of the puzzles essentially solve themselves, the entire ""adventure"" is incredibly linear (read: no exploration), and the second half of the game is STILL missing almost a year later. What you'll get for this ridiculous price is at MOST a 5-hour cartoon. This does not measure up to Double Fine's or Tim Schafer's standard. I repeat, DO NOT BUY.Find a longplay or a Let's Play on YouTube if you want to watch it. You won't be missing out on any gameplay.EDIT: The rest of the game is now available. I will update the review when I complete it.			"

												I was lured into purchasing this title because it promoted a throwback to old school point-and-click adventure games like Monkey Island. While indeed it is point-and click, it is by no means a throwback to those of yesteryear. The puzzles were beyond easy. I kept half expecting Dora the Explorer to pop up and ask me, "" Do you see see the triangle?"", with the preceding pause and eventual highlighting of the object. This was only enhanced by the art direction of the game. It is done very much in the style of Nick Jr. cartoons. But, I figured what the game was lacking in animation it would make up for in both storyline and mechanics. I was sadly disappointed. The storyline fit the art direction. Meaning, it would be entertaining for an audience of toddlers. And this same thread followed into the mechanics as well. Which Items could be interacted with were very obvious in the environment: oversized, brightly colored, etc, compared to the old LucasArts games that would take hours, days, or months to discover what needed to be done next to progress forward.  To sum things up, if you loved point-and-click titles, like The Secret of Monkey Island, THE DIG, and LOOM, you're better off replaying them. However, if you enjoyed those titles, and want a game for your toddler, than look no further.			"

												When Double Fine went to Kickstarter, it constantly reminded us of the past great adventure games like Grim Fandango and Day of The Tentacle to get people (including me) to contribute. So why is the ""final"" product NOTHING like these games? The graphical style alone has divided people but the rest of the game feels nothing like the old Lucas Arts adventures - the comedy is lacking, the puzzle quality is lacking, the colourful characters are lacking, the wacky art style is lacking ... it's just ... dull. And to realize how much money they blew on making this game when other Kickstarter games like Tesla Effect did much MUCH more with far less money, it makes you wonder what on earth happened. The free adventure game ""Host Master"" was a far better game than this and it didn't cost 3 million dollars to make. Not only is Broken Age proof that quality games are not made by a single ""big"" name but rather by talented teams, it's also proof that lots of funds can still leave you with only half a game with an indie feel and look that realistically barely even covers 10% of the amount they raised.Basically: big thumbs down.

												The game certainly has its charms, but lacks any real quality to engage the player. I generally find point and click adventures to be enjoyable however Broken Age lacks the crucial elements of tension and investigation which Telltale games like ""The Walking Dead"" and ""The Wolf Among Us"" capture so perfectly.Simply clicking to put things where they need to be has left this game...boring. I can't see myself obsessing for Act 2. A rare miss for Doublefine in my opinion.			"

												PROs: Gorgeous game, wonderful audio, intriguing puzzles that were both challenging and intuitive.CONs: Short, super, super short. Like shorter than a Big Fish Adventure game. Steam says I had 4 hours total gameplay so far... I think it was more like 3 if you don't include pauses. Seriously, ridiculously short! Even with the addition of Act 2 (which is included in the price), even if it doubles the gameplay time, that still makes this game too short. I did not skip any unheard dialogue or unseen cinematics and played through both entire stories.I would recommend if it's on sale (I bought it for 16.99 and even that is more than I feel comfortable with), I cannot justify full price for the length of this game.

												The game is split in two parts, the boy's part and the girl's part. Both parts are too short, even though it's just the first half of the game. I finished it in 6 hours, and I'm sure you could do it in four.The boy part is very babyish. The puzzles at the beginning are extremely simple, which is of course intended, but still I think it would bore even a child of 12. Even when the boy meets the wolf (which actually looks more like a fox), things stay rater simple. The graphics on the screen of the ""rescue machine"" are horrible, this whole rescue thing doesn't feel real, but is very abstract and silly.The girl part is much better. I even actually like this part of the plot. There are some jokes (finally) and even some puzzles that aren't just trivial. (They aren't very hard either, but that's OK.) The part tastes a little too girlish for me, but that's just my opinion. I liked the two sentinels and the puking tree best.The graphics are quite nicely painted in general. This is even the case in the boy part of the plot (apart from the rescue machine's screen). The problem with the scenery in that part is that everything looks so baby-like, I can't help disliking it. In the girl part, I especially like the slow animation of plants in some screens, or the birds in the sky at the beach. When there is a closeup, however, graphics become very blurry. Also, apart from some smoke and a laser ray, there's almost no special effects.I like the fact that the music was played by a real orchestra. Unfortunately, it doesn't make much difference, because the game lacks of a recognisable theme. There is no opening sequence, no central score, so the music stays just in the background. The thing with background music is that it tends to get on your nerves after some time. I would have liked it better if there was one score that appeared in cutscenes, while the rest of the game would stick to ambient sound effects.The overall impression of the game is not very good. It's too short, babyish, girlish, unchallenging, uninspiring. I'm not sure if I am going to be willing to invest six more hours playing the second part when it's out.			"

												I bought this game during the summer sale, and it was well worth the VERY LOW price I paid.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it for the full retail price.  So why do I recommend this game, anyway?  Read on...First Impressions     The first thing you will notice are the well-scripted animations for each character.  The art style is quite appealing to the eyes, and fluidity between actions is definitely there.  The game is played by switching between the perspectives of a young man (Shay) and young girl (Vella); I started my playthrough as Vella and was instantly sold on the story.Game Structure     The game is split into two acts, and for me the first act was more story-driven, while the second act was very puzzle-driven.  As I mentioned, the story is pretty good and I always wanted to uncover more, but the climax and ending fell short of my expectations.  The second issue I have with the game are the puzzles, which I will explain in more detail...The Puzzles     Ah yes, the puzzles!  If you go and read discussions (SPOILERS IN THERE) you will find that many people are complaining that the puzzles for this game are way too hard to the point that they are ""moon logic"" puzzles.  I somewhat disagree.  During my first (and only) playthrough I found that the solutions to two particular puzzles were very farfetched and even said aloud to myself in both instances, ""who would ever think to do that?"".  Near the very end of the game is a third puzzle that is actually very complex and difficult to solve, but I ended up enjoying it since I had some pen and paper ready for notes.  This third puzzle alone easily took me about an hour to complete and is the puzzle that many people complain about.  In my opinion, some of the other puzzles were more confusing and tedious.  All-in-all, I liked the mix of puzzle difficulty and adventure, but I have to admit that I used a walkthrough on more than one occasion when I felt stuck (which is hard to do if you don't want to spoil the rest of the game).  So, if you are not super casual and have the patience to spend an hour or more on a single problem, then you will most likely enjoy this game.Recommendation     Now for the reason I cannot recommend it for the full retail price of $25: a very bad ending.  Everything up to the very end of the game answered enough questions to keep me thoroughly entertained.  However, once you complete the game you are left with a series of images on the credits screen that fill in the final bits of the story.  It helps explain what people ended up doing once the story has concluded, but it fails to answer many questions about the final scene of the game.  I had so many questions about the origins of Mog Chothra, the Plague Dam, Sugar Bunting's past (as Steel Bunting), and why the Volta's and Alex had to be tricked.  Also, the concluding scene never explains how the attack is abruptly stopped, why the whole operation had to play out for ""as long as anyone remembers"", and what happened to Vella's grandmother or why she was in Sugar Bunting.My Final Judgement     If you can buy this game on sale then it is probably worth it, even if the ending is not that great.  The game had enough charm and other positive qualities for me to recommend it, but I would not have bought it if I had to pay $25./Review "

												I am not that good at point and click adventures yet I love the heck out of them... I usually have to find the answers to the puzzles on the net after the first few... with that said I found this game to NEED ALMOST NO SKILL AT ALL... the puzzles are so simple they give away the answers. I kept waiting for the tutorial to be over... but it never got any harder... there was nothing that took me more than 5 min to figure out and 90% of the game I did without even having to think out the puzzle since it was so obvious... The game IS beautiful and the story IS interesting but it’s so short it had me reading the Steam return policy to see if there was a time limit in which I could return the game because it was over that quick...Steam shows I have 3 hours in the game total and about an hour of that was the game on pause to make dinner... I see NOTHING about this game that says 3 MILLION dollars was put into it... I am very disappointed and feel ripped off. Maybe if the game was finished or maybe if it didn't COST $25 dollars? This is a $9.99 game at best... I mean you get 2 to 3 hours TOPS with BOTH story modes and there wasn't much else for side quest or exploration... such a letdown. I will be finishing it when the update comes out only since it’s free... if I could return it and NOT finish it later I would... I knew I should have just watched a let’s play instead of buying it but with all the RAVE reviews I thought ""how could I possibly go wrong?"" Well it did... To sum it up this ""game"" is WAY TOO SHORT & WAY TOO EASY to be a $25 dollar game... and it has almost ZERO replayability... I still to this day break out Monkey Island and give it a run though on my tablet every now and then... I just don't see it with this game... unless they wow me with chapter two... I really got to ask WHERE DID THE MONEY GO? "

												A massive let down. It started out great in Act 1 but then takes a huge nose dive in Act 2. When the second Act came out, I expected more places to explore and better character development. Instead you just wander back and forth in the same areas, but as different characters, and whatever personality the two protagonist have in Act 1, is ignored in Act 2. For example, Shay has lived most of his life in a daycare prison ship, and he clearly wants out to experience something new. When he does get out, he basically goes ""Sweet, I'm outside."" and that's it. Any emotional response from the two characters is nonexistent in Act 2. The ending of the game is bland and unsatisfying. I expected something more on the emotional side, but it just sorta stops in its tracks. If there was a way to uninstall Act 2, I would. For those who bought the game, just stick to Act 1, and for those who don't, just watch a Let's Play of it and save your money.			"

												I like what's there but it's only half a game, half a game, half a game that Tim Schafer double dipped into kickstarter to produce and then didn't meet anything close to his promises in regards to finishing it. When I bought this it was with the understanding that the second half would be out in a few months but it's been more than a damned year. I payed the sticker price for a full game and I got half a game.  I'm not holding my breath as to whether the second part really is ever coming out.Meanwhile Tim Schafer is laying off employees while throwing stupid expensive parties in San Francisco DJ'd by a guy who's now known to be a co-conspirator in a plot to rig an awards show. That is when Tim isn't taking a break to embaressing appearences in videos where he ♥♥♥♥♥ on his own community and calls us all mysogynists.It's all just one giant ongoing fall from grace. Tim used to have something, he was an esteemed and respectable figure who made two of my favorite games of all times in Psychonauts and Brutal legend. Now he's just a sad has been who squeezes gullible crowdfunds and ♥♥♥♥s around. I hate to say EA was right but EA was right, he mismanages money and can't run a project. It's a shame because he is a talented artist, but I cannot overlook what a collossal shitheel he is or how badly he follows through on his commitments.PART 2 UPDATE:So part 2 came out awhile ago and I finally bothered to complete the last chunk of it. In short part 2 is absolutely terrible, the entire story falls apart, all you do is retread the existing environments and I have no idea how Double Fine managed to spend about four million dollars and over a year of additional developement on this. Part 2 seems like nothing more than something put together out of obligation and little else, and it makes me strongly suspect they were just writing the entire thing as they went.Broken Age's story is a classic case of cool mystery leading to goofy revelations, if you've ever followed a show like Lost or Twin Peaks you'll probably know what I'm talking about. It contains several really obnoxious puzzles including one where the solution is to just stand around doing nothing and quite alot of tedious robot re-wiring.Meanwhile Schafer himself continued to be even more of a joke and a jackass than ever, and the way he runs his company I'll be very surprised if it's still in business in five years or doing anything more than churning out IOS shovelware at best. I certainly wont be buying anything else he makes and I'm damn glad I didn't give a cent to either of the kickstarters so at least my name isn't enshrined in the credits with all those other suckers.Stay away, stay far far away.

												It's just amazing, can't wait for Act 2.Tim and the co still have their magic. You can see character on the screen for one minute and fall in love with him/her.On the downside is size. It took me 4 hours, but it felt like 2 and after credits start rolling you have a feeling of how short that awesome experience was. Maybe it's smarter to wait until whole game is released. But even if you want to wait, buy it right away anyway, to support double fine and make sure they have enough funds to make an amazing game.			"

												you could discuss broken age as a commentary on today's attitudes on both work and technology. an over-dependency on having computers and machines do everything for you in an incresingly apathetic world. plus, with the maiden offerings you could draw parallels of a learned helplessness in a sacrificial market. as more and more take the plunge, less are willing to be the dissenting opinion. it's a terrifying reality. but on the other hand, a tree vomits on you once you show it a stool, so, there's that. that was pretty cool.

												Part 1 review: I liked this gentle scifi comedy. I've heard of complaints that the puzzles are too easy and I'd disagree, though unlike some games, if you use the spanner and then the bucket on an item to try to solve a puzzle, it will often give you a hint that you need to use the item on the bucket then spanner, rather than keeping you guessing at every possible combination for hours on end. I liked the riddle, mainly because I didn't have the item in question and only by working it out did I know where to go to solve it. Part 2: the problems definitely ramp up in difficulty and, though I liked the challenge, I have a beef with some aspects of this. MINOR SPOILER AHEAD Several problems rely on using information one of the characters you control discovers with the other, but, in some cases, there's no way the information could be passed on. Sort of like a game in which a person in England in the 1870s discovers a diary entry which gives the combination to a safe which is then used by a character you control in the revolutionary America. No internal logic to justify the transfer of information. They might at least have hinted at some sort of telepathic link between the two or something but if they do, I missed it... This irks me. Possibly unnecesssarily, and the rest of the game is great, it's just that this makes me go Hmmmm. A lack of care in game design.			"

												Having just finished this game I can say it was enjoyable, but I debate if this game is worth the 24 bucks they are currently selling it for. I find it frustrating that there is going to be a second act without an determined release date. I feel It would be worth it if both were released at the same time. But until then I would say wait. I know that the second act is going to be free, but it still feels odd, its like buying a season pass for a game but not knowing what you are going to be getting out of it, or when.But there, that was my complaint about price, not substance. This game is a real gem, everything is hand painted,  and the way the animations work with that make the game instantly nostalgic. Its like a living cartoon. I showed this game to my 1 1/2 year old niece and she was instantly entranced. So the art is captivating and impressive. The voice acting in this game is great, it is splattered with famous actors. Like another review stated saying that the spoon in this game has more personality than most other characters in other games. I feel a lot of the big charm that hits you at the first of the game wears off a little bit after the first few minutes. It's not that it goes away, but the game becomes less captivating as I went along. But this is a great game to mess around with. View it like a film and then you won't be dissapointed in the time that it takes to complete it. plus add in the second act of the game and that should add 2 or 3 hours to the 2 hours it takes to beat the first act.I do have to add that this game has complete support for tablets and that is really cool. I keep on trying to find games to play on my dell venue 8 pro, and this one works perfect. My only complaint about the interface is that I couldnt get the hint button to show up on my desktop, it would only show up on my tablet. So In a way this game is better played on a tablet. Well, basically I would say hold off on this game for now, its not worth the full price just yet, when the 2nd act comes I would say that it would be worth it. I just don't completly understand why the people making this game can get away with selling this game for 10 bucks on the ios store, but sell it for 25 on pc. Its the same game, litterally, there are no differences or cut backs between the versions, except possible the 8 bit mode, but I have not looked into that since I don't own an apple product. This game would be completly worth it for 10 bucks and feels more of an appropriate price. But again I am getting into the price to much. As a game alone this game is great fun, it has such attidute that is easy to get sucked into. The world they establish just feels so strange, and when I say that I mean any one playing can sense something is up. It keeps on teasing that not everything is not as it seems, but it really lets you figure that out instead of just giving it to you. Might sound weird but it was worth it for the minute that I got to jack blacks character in the game. This game will make you laugh, and at the same time squirm trying to figure what its about.			"

												Holy crap, where do I start on this marvelous game?! Ok, this masterpiece came from the brilliant mind of Tim Schafer, the King of point-and-clicks, who hasn't made a point-and-click adventure game in over 16 years. But he still has it! Broken Age tells the story of two vastly different, yet eerily similar, young people, Vella and Shay. You can play whoevers story first and alternate between them, in case you are stuck on a puzzle, which I believe is a brilliant mechanic. The visual art style is absolutely gorgeous and the characters are well developed. The gameplay is, well, point-and-click and if you aren't a fan of this, the game won't change your opinion on it. However, absolutely everyone should play this game, it puts multimillion dollar ""triple A"" games to shame and I can't wait for the second part! (FYI the game is split into two parts, the first is out right now, but the second is coming out later this year as a free update)                                                              I'm giving this game a 9.7/10.

												Excellent art and a feel good atmosphere makes this game hard to resist. I played through the first act and I thought it was flawless. Unfortunately, the second act left a lot to be desired. There were 3 to 4 puzzles that I thought were almost impossible to figure out and while I've avoided cheating throughout the first half, I had no choice but to google for solutions a couple of times in the second half.But that's not my biggest complaint. Actually I would have still given this game a solid mark if not for the direction the plot takes as it reaches its conclusion. I don't want to spoil it for anyone but it was baffling and morally ambiguous. Maybe the guys at Double Fine simply ran out of time developing this game.Overall, it's still a decent ride and commendable for its unique atmosphere and artistic vision, so 7/10.			"

												You've likely already heard a lot about Broken Age as it's been covered in a lot of media... Long story short, it's the adventure game that was publicly funded using Kickstarter, the man behind it is Tim Schaefer (of Full Throttle / Grim Fandango / Psychonauts fame), and was touted to be a revival of the adventure game genre.Whether they've succeeded seems to be open to personal opinion, with the majority that don't agree disliking either the art style (which you can see in the trailer and screenshots, and I think is gorgeous), or that the puzzles are too easy. I'll come back to that point in a moment.The game itself is charming and always interesting. There are two protagonists, you pick one at the start and begin to play through their story. They are in completely different worlds (one science fiction, the other fantasy), and you can swap between the worlds to experience the other's story at any time. This gives you the opportunity to take a break and return with fresh eyes, or just mix up the pacing. These two separate story-threads do start to show hints of coming together towards the conclusion of the games first act (whilst act two will release later this year as a free update).One thing the game doesn't have is particularly tricky puzzles. It is worth baring in mind that as only the first act of two so far, the second act has been promised to have more difficult puzzles when it launches. I don't think the puzzles are SO simple to be insulting, but you certainly won't be stuck on any puzzles for longer than a couple of minutes. Most solutions are readily apparant with a little thought, and there's usually enough clues through the environment or the character's comments that you soon realise what needs to be done.I fully recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good story. As an adventure puzzle game it's a little on the easy side, but the story-telling, dialogue and superb voice acting, setting and music all make for an interesting experience regardless. If the second act has harder / more complex puzzles that's a bonus, but I personally feel there's enough to enjoy here.(Full disclosure, I backed this game on Kickstarter for $30 / £19)			"

I like the twist at the end of ""Act I"" but felt like Act II wasn't quite as good. I have been playing through this with my almost 3 year old son watching and occasionally helping. It works great with a touchscreen, which was occassionally problematic when my son just touched where he wanted to go. I would highly recommend especially to fans of classic adventure games.			"

												As soon as Tim Shafer revealed this on Kickstarter I backed immediately. The old Lucasarts games such as Monkey Island 1&2, Day Of The Tentacle and Grim Fandango are among my favourite games ever created and so I jumped at the chance to play a new adventure game from the same mind involved in those classics. I was not dissapointed. The writing takes on a different mood from his previous efforts in this genre and is less about side splitting humour and more about telling the story about the tragic lives of 2 seemingly unrelated teenagers with drastically different lives. That's not to say there are not funny moments, some of the humour is genuinly brilliant. The visual style is the thing that struck me most about this game though with it's amazing storybook visuals which look amazing when the characters are animated on screen.At the time of this review only act 1 is available and comes in at around 4 hours long. I can already say my money was well spent and cannot wait for act 2. Tim Shafer and Double Fine have knocked it out of the park with this game.			"

												An excellent adventure game.The graphics are beautiful, as is the soundtrack.If you've played adventure games before, you'll be right at home with the puzzles and what to do. I liked all the puzzles. If you think they don't make sense you might be new to adventure games. You possibly might want to start with a different game. Monkey Island 1 and 2 have remastered editions available on steam, and there's also the Deponia games. Several of the Monkey Island series have an easy mode, for beginners.I was thrilled that I beat the entire game without once taking a quick peek at a walkthrough. Something I did end up doing a couple times with the Deponia games. What's nice is that if you are stuck with one character, you can easily switch to the other for a little breather, and then when you switch back you'll be fresh for solving the puzzles again.The game isn't quite that long, but it is on par for an adventure game. The story is actually very intriguing to follow along. I was hooked.I would love a sequel or another similar game from the same folks. Since this is practically the newest adventure game, you might want to get a feel for the genere playing some older ones first before you play this one, but if you think you're clever it would be fine to start here too.

												The twin destines of two children with overbearing parents overlap into an adventure of epic proportions in Broken Age, a point and click adventure game by Double Fine. From the very start of the game, you are able to control either of the two main characters (Shay and Vella) and progress their storylines independently up until a certain point. You can switch to the alternate character at any time and this can be helpful later on in the game for when you need to solve puzzles that require information only accessible to the other character.When this game first came out, there was a lot of controversy regarding delivery of promises and some quantity of millions of dollars for funding. I’d have to argue that the game does indeed deliver when it comes to visual and audio quality. The graphics are quite detailed for such a simplistic style and the animation has a very professional and smooth quality to it. When characters move close to areas the camera moves with them creating very fluid and natural movement. Broken Age also features a captivating soundtrack and a collection of talented voice actors including Wil Wheaton and Jack Black, a big step up from other indie adventure gaming efforts.Unfortunately, the game does fall a bit flat in one important factor: length. I went back over my catalog of adventure games made by smaller studios and wouldn’t you know that they took about the same amount or longer to beat (10+ hours). Considering how they cost half the price for the same amount of entertainment, I can see how some people might feel a bit disappointed seeing as how this was a high budget epic without the epic-sized story. I suppose it’s also worth mentioning that there are a few re-used puzzles in the second act which further cheapen things by artificially extending the game.With all that taken into account, it’s pretty obvious that the solution to the puzzle that is Broken Age is simple: wait for a sale. It’s not a bad game per-se, but grabbing it at $5 instead of $25 can be the difference between satisfaction or buyer’s remorse.			"

												Broken Age is a really good game for those who likes relaxing games with nice gameplay, good artwork, sound effects, and voice acting. The story is easy to follow but not boring. The gameplay is point and click. This is also a light game to play on a netbook. Overall, it is a recommended game!			"

												I love this game so much. The characters are cute and funny, the story lines are extremely engaging. I enjoyed all of the dialogue and jokes. The puzzles had some nice challenging parts but I was never stuck enough to need to google anything. The art and soundtrack are amazing as well. Only thing I didn't like is that it's so short! I AM DYING FOR ACT 2. I'd rank this game as one of my all time favorites up there with Costume Quest, Machinarium and Botanicula.			"

												An amazingly good looking game with a unique art style, Some of the Best voice acting, and a few funny knee slappers thrown in. Yet somehow i could not pull myself together to finish this game. there is just something about it that makes me not care about the story or what happens next. it just seems dull after a while and it is honestly pretty hard for me to decide between recommending this or not. But with there being games so simular but so much more fun, i sadly can't say i would recommend this to my friends. 6/10			"

												I'm just 2 hours into this game and I've seen enough to say this is a very good game.Artwork and soudtrack are probably what this game does best, then you have ""Grim Fandango""-like puzzles (somewhat less elaborate) and an intriguing plot so far.I may decide to update this review as I play throughout the plot but I don't need more time to start recommending this game.

												Although visually charming and inspiring, the second act of Broken Age introduced many frustrating puzzles that repeatedly block your progress one after another, making you explore every room what feels like a trillion times. Worse, some ""puzzles"" have what I would consider ridiculous solutions that I would have spend hours upon hours on, had I not looked them up in a walkthrough.It's a shame, since the story of the game is really unique, whimsical, charming; even throughout the second act. Unfortunately, it too falls flat because of a rushed ending that leaves me with just too many unanswered questions.It pains me to say no, I do not recommend this game.			"

												Broken age is fantastic and terrible. Fantastic:The pastel-colored storybook visuals are gorgeous. The voice acting is some of the best you will ever hear in a game. Period. Seriously, it's incredible. The whimsical world of the game is packed with funny, light-hearted, just plain fun characters and ideas.Terrible:Though they start out strong, the puzzles begin to require pointless trial and error, backtracking. Worse, they become increasingly nonsensical, until the solutions are so obtuse that progression is all but impossible. Unfortunately a good walkthrough is absolutely essential. You'll be consulting it constantly during the later stages of the game. If you don't have anything against playing in a window with a walkthrough open beside the game, this is a fun little adventure. Seriously, the casting and quirky, enthusiastically performed dialogue is really fun. You'll only get around a dozen hours of playtime from this title, so wait for it to go on sale before you pick this up, if at all.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I reserved judgement until I'd seen the whole thing, despite the protracted release, but the end result is so mediocre.Positives:+ Charming art style.+ Shay's story arc on the Bossa Nova was pretty fun.+ The spoon would've been a fitting character in any classic adventure game. + I appreciate that they at least tried to put more puzzles in the second act.Negatives:- The storyline falls apart in the second act. It feels so rushed, poorly thought through, and completely detached from the mood of the first act. It seems like the ending was written and re-written well after the first act rather than as one continuous story. Disappointing.- I realize that not every adventure protagonist can be Guybrush, but Vella is a thoroughly uninteresting character. She's too bland to even be unlikeable. Given what she faces in the story, I can't understand why they directed her voice actress to sound like she's on a high dose of Xanax.- The dialog trees feel tired and rarely capture the charm of Schafer's previous efforts.- There's little enjoyment to be found in exploration, and that's the whole point of this genre.

												Act 1 was perfect, just the right level of hard puzzles and fun characters.  Act 2 was good at providing a satisfying conclusion, though the puzzle difficulty jumped and the puzzles didn't flow as well as they needed to, especially compared to act 1.  But this is not two seperate games, this is one game, and should be appreciated as such.  Strong opening with excellent characters, with demerit for unintuitive puzzles at the end.  Very similar difficulty curve as Psychonauts.Not too long, not too short.  Definetly great value.			"

												I don't know quite how to feel about Broken Age. I want to scream and yell and claim it is a terrible experience, but I don't overtly hate the game. I had a partial bit of responsibility for bringing it to life (funding it way back when on Kickstater). As much as I want to say that I helped make this, I'm mostly ashamed that I got sucked into the marketing that Double Fine did.When Tim Schafer had claimed he was going to make an adventure game in the vein of his classic titles, I didn't quite expect him to literally do that. I figured we would have years of advancement in technology and storytelling play a bigger role with the finished product. I expected this new adventure title to do away with some of the more frustrating aspects of the genre's origins.Instead, Broken Age is a mess of a second half that fails to capitalize on the potential set forth in it's first act. The setup to this game is brilliant; two teenagers coming to terms with the way their lives are playing out. You have Shay, a boy who has only ever lived on a spaceship, breaking free and looking for adventure. You also have Vella, a young girl in a town that believes sacrificing ""maidens"" to some monster is the only way to protect their village. Vella is obviously a maiden and has to deal with the fact that she will die.This plays a lot like most people's adolescent years; the game deals with how one can make their stake in the world. Instead of accepting that nothing will get better and the world is all gloom and doom, these characters venture beyond their comfort zones and explore the world outside.The puzzles may not have been the most mind-bending things around, but that was excusable for the beginning of a game. You never want to throw the hardest thing at a player right off the bat; using a gradual curve to teach the player how the game works and makes their mind adapt to your particular puzzle schemes is a great way to ensure the gamer is left satisfied.Instead, Act 2 brings about some creatively bankrupt scenarios. The game essentially goes on auto-pilot and solutions take no longer than 5 minutes to pop in your mind. Maybe this has more to do with me being a veteran of the genre, but Broken Age does away with a lot of needless items that used to plague the inventory of it's predecessors.In doing that, though, the game's puzzles focus purely on logic. With logic at your side, you simply need to look at the problem, check your limited supply and have at it. Eventually you get to the solution and your brain doesn't feel any smarter. At worse, you feel cheated out of a quality experience.This also happens to the story. Each character, before some insanely convoluted twist, felt like a person with no understanding of their situation. They knew they wanted change, but they weren't sure from what. Come Act 2, we're now supposed to accept that these characters know each other and have some emotional tie (thankfully not romantic).Couple that with some other revelations about Shay's life and you're left with a portrait of a boy who looks selfish. That feeling of complacency he wanted to break from feels more like it was self-imposed instead of happening out of bad luck. Vella's family also deals exceptionally well with the knowledge of their old tradition being a farse.The final puzzles of the game are also some of the worst I've ever had to play. You better like wiring robots and depending on omnipresent knowledge to get through; Broken Age features that in spades. Just quite how Shay should know a pattern that Vella is only able to see is beyond me.I get that the idea was to have players make the characters interact with each other in an asymmetrical fashion, but the execution feels haphazard. A better approach would be if Vella touched something on the ship and then Shay's world changed a bit. Other games have done this and it works great in making the player feel like their actions matter.For that matter, why do we only get a few limited areas? Vella goes through the area Shay explored in Act 1 and vice versa. I know this is supposed to make players get acquainted with their environment, but it feels exceptionally cheap. It harkens back to the classic days of adventure gaming where memory was limited and hardware limitations needed to be worked around.I can only think of Monkey Island and how that game had 4 Acts that all took place in wholly unique environments. The sequels managed to make their worlds bigger, too. Broken Age just feels like developers starting off with ambition and rushing to make their promises half-true.Why not bring up the the voice acting? While the cast is assembled of some great actors and their performance in the first act is quite good, the revelations we get in Act 2 should elicit more of an emotional response. Instead, basically everyone reads their lines in a deadpan manner. I think I'd be screaming bloody murder if I got locked in a ship I previously thought was a monster.You can tell most of the budget was spent on the visual style, because the graphics are beautiful. Everything animates smoothly and transitions feel natural. I'm a bit torn on the slow camera, but it does give you a great look into the detail of each scene. It's like looking at a living water color book; it's whimsical and jovial.But for as much charm the visuals have, the rest of the game just cannot hold up. I may be taking this especially hard as I had wanted this game for nearly 3 years, but I just get the feeling that Tim Schafer and Double Fine got in way over their heads. Their initial budget was a mere $400k dollars. For them to gross around $3 million before the game even came out is obscene.Then again, I guess we gamers are partially to blame for the lack of quality. We all funded this with nostalgia on our brains. We loved Schafer's previous work and just wanted him to return to a genre he had long left behind. Broken Age doesn't make me believe that adventure games are dead, just that Tim Schafer should probably turn his prospects on to something else.We can never get back the past; this is a harsh truth we all learn in life. Broken Age could have been about just that. The premise starts off with a similar idea and then abandons it for familiar territory. If only Double Fine had listened to their own preaching and learned to grow over the course of this games development.5/10			"

												After pre-paying this game through a steam sale for $10 and waiting for the second half to complete the game, I can safely say that Broken Age is not worth buying.Story: Act 1 presented a clear theme of defiance since the protagonists of the story yearning to break free from their own culture respectively and tackle a conflict in their own respective worlds. Act 2, on the other hand, tries its best to answer the players' speculations (or guesses about the lore of the game) from Act 1 but only to end up with more head scratching and confusion that makes you want to say ""How does this makes sense?"" or just ""What?"". I'm not going to spoil the ending but the second half's story just feels like it's just wasting your time but the game is obligated to finish the writing.Gameplay: In Act 1, most of the time, it was a breeze to solve through the puzzles. In Act 2, on the other hand, Double Fine did take the feedback of past players (who played act 1) for more difficult puzzles and made it happen, which I ended up pulling out a guide frequently because I encountered some puzzles that required you to just WAIT and one that you have to fix something with broken wires eats up an hour of the game because there's not much explanation on how this puzzle works which leaves me much frustration for every time the proposed solution doesn't work. I will never understand why hard puzzles complement well with a great story (not this game at least).Art: The only good aspect of this game, I praised the art design because it's like an interactive children's storybook adventure and now I won't be able to play this game again with my little brothers and sisters due to how the second act ruined the overall story of the game.Overall: I gave this game a 5/10, I was going to give a 6/10 for its art and some humor but I couldn't, because this is the first video game from kickstarter that achieved publisher-like funding that everyone hoped for AAA quality, and now, here we are, getting a game that ended up mediocre.Sadly I love playing Psychonauts, and I'm even more sad to say that I'm disappointed in Tim Schafer not able to deliver the game's promise. No matters what others say about cutting him some slack or that we're all too hard on him and his company, this game was funded ""$3.3. million + requested additional funding"", there's no excuses for delivering a mediocre game.Again, I can't recommend this point-n-click adventure game. You're better off spending to other interesting games that are worth your time.			"

												I really did like this game. It had good puzzles, good intrigue- and a fine story (through Act 1). Then it's almost as if the writers went, ""Oh... shoot- we actually should have done it like this. Let's try to slip this in and hope they don't notice."" Act 2 is just a MASSIVE plot hole- literally seems like 2 different people were writing the story with the second left trying to connect the second to the first with a lot of saccharin overtones. In-game tries to explain this massive plot hole but it's like hearing a really unconvincing lie, but choosing to believe it because- ""eh, I'll give the person the benefit of a doubt"". Overall I'd recommend it, it was fun with a few challenging puzzles- you might get stuck in 2 places, (seems like a lot of people did) walkthroughs are helpful on that account. It's probably worth about $25 for ~40ish hours of playtime (you may go through it faster). I've seen worse movies for more than $25 (with my S.O. and I).			"

												Act one was amazing. genuinely amazing. It was an incredible experience, delving into the polarizing lives of the heroes, Shay and Vella. I found myself intrigued by the ideas and curious about the way in which the stories collided. I thought I had stumbled upon an incredible masterpiece of a game. I couldn't tear myself away, and made an effort to interact with every element of the game. But, unfortunetly, act two fell short. incredibly short. instead of being a journey like act one, it was a mess of ridiculously hard puzzles and a lack of intriguing story. it was horrible, i didn't enjoy it at all. I spent too long on puzzles initially, and in the end looked up walkthroughs for the rest of the way. it lacked so much of what they nailed in the first act, and as a result, I have to say that, while act one was amazing, act two was disappointing and therefore, I do not recommend it.

I played this long after ""act 2"" came out and it bothers me that people cherry pick that to say bad things in these reviews, because I couldn't tell act 1 and 2 apart. It was all a single thing to me.I got stuck a handfull of times, but switching to the other character always made me get a fresh view of the puzzles when I returned. Literally beat the game without any help, it's not impossible. Just take some notes at the end and you'll be fine.			"

												When I bought a game written by the great Tim Schafer, creator of legendary game Psychonauts among other things, I really wasn't expecting to be let down by just about EVERYTHING the game had to offer. An pair of two intriguing stories running parallel to each other suddenly shift into a single story that loses all intrigue by the end of it. The plot, which seems to have so much potential at the start, becomes so incredibly uninteresting by the end that I only felt obliged to finish the game because I'd spent money on it. The main characters are bland, unintelligent, and seem to have very little interest in anything happening around them, even when possibly faced with their own demise. The settings, while interesting, are small and will only hold your interest long enough for you to realize how little world-building Double Fine has done with the world they created, and will leave you wishing they put some actual effort into them. And the gameplay: It's a point and click adventure game, so what little gameplay it has can only be based on the puzzles. Almost all of them are too easy, being tasks that a 5-year-old could figure out, or they're so obscure that you'll either need a walkthrough or a bottem-less well of patience as you click on every interactable thing in the game in every possible order, searching in vain for the thread of logic the developers were operating on. To top it all off, the game ends with our two protagonists finally meeting after an entire game being seperated. What happens then? Nothing. They see each other, say nothing to each other, and the credits roll. No real resolution is reached either, as the antagonists (who were introduced very late on, I might add) were neither truly defeated, nor were they even properly explained beyond some very forced exposition. Do yourself a favor, do NOT buy Broken Age. Save your money, spend it on a better game like Psychonauts. That way you can see that Tim Schafer actually had some talent at one point in time before it suddenly faded and he started putting out garbage like this.(PS: The only saving grace this game has a a few key side characters, the majority of which are SILVERWARE. Seriously.)			"

It seemed to struggle with whether it wanted to tell a whimsical or darker toned story, and then it ended without much resolution.I'd recommend it to someone who likes adventure games or someone who wants to try something new that doesn't require twitch reflexes.

												ACT 1: Two teenagers trying to figure out life and trying to break from what's been imposed to them in order to be free to follow their own paths. Characters are likable and relatable. Inspiring, lovely, moving, brilliant!ACT 2: Evil aliens and a lot of going back and forth (without a fast-travel-map) fetching items and puzzle-solving to save your lives. Not only did they fail to explore further the main theme of Act 1 but they also threw it in the trash. And spit on it! Boring, frustrating, uninspiring, irritating!Visuals and voice acting are fantastic, and you can make analogies with issues related to oppression, racism, gender. One thing I liked is that the black female character is more important and relevant than the white male character (usually you'd expect the male-white-character-is-the-hero-and-saves-helpless-girl cliché). Even so, I don't recommend the game. I could maybe recommend only Act 1 and the feeling of wondering what Act 2 could have been rather than actually experiencing it. But if you play Act 1 you won't believe they could actually ruin the game and you'll want to play Act 2. And it doesn't feel right to recommend something that can cause such frustration...			"

												I was one of the original Kickstarter backers for this game and as such my first time playing it was when only the first half of the game was available and it was in Beta. At the time I enjoyed the part of the story that I was shown, the writing, art and setting are all wonderful. However, I found it to be short, straightforward and all of the puzzles were overly simplistic.Recently the second half of the game was released and the game had it's official release as a complete product. I played through the whole thing again and found that the first half of the game works so much better when seen as part of the whole rather than as a separate episode. All the puzzles from the first half of the game are the building blocks for puzzles later in the game and they gradually increase in complexity. The storyline as well really builds on everything from the first half in the second half and the whole thing comes together in a very worthwhile and impressive package.Because of that, this game should never have been split into two parts. I understand that Double Fine did this so that they could create a larger game overall and generate funding, but at the same time, the experience of playing it as two separate acts took away from the overall experience for me.That said I do highly recommend this game now that it is available as a complete product. Be warned the puzzles are very easy and overly simplistic in the beginning of the game, and the whole thing can likely be completed in 8 hours or less unless you run into any major snags. All the puzzles had fairly easy to understand solutions with only 2 or 3 instances where I really felt that the solution was too obtuse. In addition there was only one time that I had to look up the solution online (SPOILER the part where Shay has to simply let the snake attempt to strangle him until it falls off, how was I supposed to know I just had to stand there the whole time? SPOILER) and there was one instance where the solution is only shown by switching between the two characters which I found annoying.I recommend this for fans of adventure games, and also those who can just appreciate the writing and art style that Double Fine brings to the table. If you don't like adventure games you might still find this accessible due to the simplicity of the puzzles and the engaging story. Otherwise, stay away.			"

												I was a backer on Kickstarter for this game and I'm also a huge fan of Tim Schafer and his Double Fine Productions. That's why I backed this in the first place, but also because I'm a fan of the adventure game genre, of course. Nevertheless Broken Age is the first game which I've played on Steam which I can't right out of my heart recommend, but why is that?The game is split into two acts and while the first act is just brilliant not only because of it's warmth, colorful visuals, lovely soundtrack or its charming characters, but also because of its well designed and thus entertaining puzzles. So everything's fine up until the end of act 1. It's ending will eventually already make your eyebrowes raising, but since everything is still open you may advance to act 2 to see how it's going on only to discover that starting from there everything is getting really worse just in every aspect.First and foremost act 2 is filled with convoluted, weird, very hard puzzles which often require much more trial-and-error then logic. This gets very frustrating especially at the end of act 2. Other than that you have to do a lot of boring backtracking, but what really disappointed me the most was the fact that none of the characters, their relationships, motives or anything at all story-wise gets a satisfying, logical explanation (or no explanation at all). All of it makes just no sense at all whether it be the connection between Shay & Vella, the whole Mog Chothra festival and the villains motives behind it nor the reveal of a secret villain in an blink of an eye which just felt totally random. All of it just feels weird and totally out-of-place. I could go on and on with other things that really made me sad just because it all started so well with act 1.So no recommendation from me unfortunately.			"

												A nice puzzle game with pleasant characters, lovely art and, in my opinion, an unforgettable story. Some of the puzzles are actually quite challenging which makes it quite rewarding too. I was uncertain about the price at first, so I got this with a Humble Bundle for much cheaper but after playing it I can definitely say that it is worth its full price. I'm so genuinely sad that I finished this game. It's one of those games I wanted to last forever.			"

												A good, albeit forgettable point and click adventure game that's well animated and acted. Requiring only a few online hints, especially for the final puzzle. The humour isn't 'laugh out loud' like Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, or Costume Quest - it's more the sort of thing that makes you occasionally exhale air through your nose. It's gentle, relaxing, and safe.			"

												I... Don't know exactly WHAT to say.I just finished the game and while I sympathize with many on a few issues in it (namely the background pixalation at times and the overly challenging Act 2 puzzles), I must recommend.The story is incredibly charming, in my opinion. I didn't mind the development in Act 2 as much as others seemed to in their reviews. Maybe I'm blinded by how much I love Elijah Wood's voice acting, but I respected the growth between parts. Shay and Vella's development run in parallel to each other well, and I liked how you could always switch between the two mid-play to further them together. The main problem in Act 2 for me is how you eventually need player knowledge for both protagonists to progress. Something you learned as Vella you need for Shay's side, and vice versa. It removes you a bit from the immersion you should have with this adventure game, ESPECIALLY near it's climax (where this is occurs).All in all, I give it about an 8.5-9/10. Somewhere around there. Buy this on a sale if you fear you may be disappointed by anything. Read around for more reviews to get an understanding of what irks people.			"

												I thought other reviews were exagerating the ""Act 1 is amazing/Act 2 is terrible"" thing. No. They weren't. The first half of Broken Age is beautiful, with a great duel storyline of young teens rebelling and clever intuitive puzzles. Using items on inappropriate things produces loads of clever dialog. Then Act 2 comes along. Just go ahead and pull up a guide because the puzzles are annoying and unintuitive now. Several depend on getting timing perfect or referring to things from the other character's side of the story. Item interactions go down significantly as well. The story doesn't really hold up either.I got Broken Age cheap, from a Humble Bundle, and I'm glad I played Act 1. But Act 2 makes me glad I didn't pay more. Consider this a ""barely positive"" review, for Act 1 and excellent voice acting and art.			"

												I backed this game over two years ago. I have always loved Double Fine's games and like most people, it was a gamble to shell out the money on something that could be bad... Needless to say, I'm more than happy with the results, so far! The game is beautiful and the story is really exciting. Though short, the promise of a future update will make me hungry for more.As for game-play, the point-and-click adventure stays very true to its name and manages to weave an exciting tale with interesting characters. I've spent hours doing nothing just to hear dialogue! The puzzles were fun, though a tad easy for my tastes. I would have been a bit more happy with the game if the puzzles were a bit harder to crack. As for the graphics, the design of the game was well put together and stands out beautifully against most others out there. However, I encountered quite a few graphical glitches in cutscenes, which I felt like were quite annoying to deal with.Overall, this game is a solid 8.7-9.4. The game is very much in need of more polish, with perhaps more care into the cutscenes to prevent visual glitches, and more sound effects to emphasize certain important actions. But the story and characters ring true to Double Fine's standard.Buy this game. It is worth every penny. Since it's being released in stages, I have no doubt that the team will look at reviews and address the major concerns in the second act. Meaning this next part is going to be even better! ... I hope. Either or, it's a wonderful experience and I don't remember the last time a game has made me gasp for excitement.			"

The hand painted art was great, the voice acting was great, puzzles weren't difficult so your progress doesn't become stagnant, tons of subtle humour that was also great and I found the story Interesting and different and I love how things tie together and yet leave so much to uncover.

												Okay so here's the deal. The first half of this game? Amazing. Second half? NOT worth the wait and a complete drag to pull yourself through.The first half of this game throws us into two completely seperate worlds. The fantasy realm of Vella and the sci-fi world of Shay. Both are works of art visually and plot wise, with mechanical creatures covered in kid-friendly yarn and controls made out of baby toys to sacrifices to ancient monsters and snakes who hate the sound of tubas.The characters are interesting enough, with plenty to say and the protragonists willing to chatter on about almost anything you click on. Plus the mid game reveal? It will have you on the edge of your seat.Sounds good right? Then you get to the second half...WHICH immediately strips the game of most of its most charming qualities, re-uses almost all the stages from the last half (there is only one new stage you really explore) and ties everything together with a rather shoddy villain collaberations which I really feel was a last minute descision. Especially the fact that they plucked a character who had minor screen time in the first act and settled her into the villain conglamorate where they REALLY stuck out with how different their character design was from EVERYONE ELSE and reused the same exact lines they used during their limited screen time before rather than have the voice actor come back and at least change the inflection of the voice to be more dramatic. Also the puzzles in the scond half are an absolute chore, there is a difference between a good puzzle, and a tedius one. Many of the puzzles in this game are defintely the latter in the second half, and also pull you out of the storyline as they require info from one protragonist be used with the other protragonist with no communication between them they just ""magically know the answer"" due to you (the players) intervention.All in all, if its on sale I guess get it but know that only half of the game is really worth playing and the final resolution will feel cheap and unfullfilling despite the first halfs quaint charm. Definitely not worth full price.			"

												Broken Age is a point-and-click adventure game that is the result of Double Fine's massively popular, record-breaking Kickstarter campaign. You alternate between controlling Shay, who is overly coddled by his spaceship's computer, and Vella, who is just about the only person who takes issue with human sacrifice in her civilization, and figure out how to help them battle injustice in their own way.A lot of money went into this game, and it's easy to tell. The voice cast is star studded, with Elijah Wood doing an amazing job as Shay, and all-around great voice acting otherwise. The art has a beautiful, painted style. The orchestral music is definitely enjoyable.As for the gameplay, well, it's a point-and-click adventure game. Some of the puzzles are tricky, but I never got completely stuck. The interface is pretty easy to use. All in all, it's a standard adventure game with modern design sensibilities.The story is pretty interesting, and the game did a pretty good job of holding my interest. Act I is short, however, and at the moment, Act I is the whole game. It took me about five hours to beat. I really loved the humor, and Broken Age is full of it.Overall, I'd definitely recommend Broken Age to just about anyone, and I'm definitely glad I backed it. The only real issue is the price, especially since this game is short. If this game looks interesting to you, then Broken Age will probably be worth the price.			"

												Even though the game isn't episodic on Steam, there really is a clear difference between Act 1 and 2 - Act 1 is basically brilliant, getting to know the world and its environment is a joy, but Act 2 is very static. The second half takes the environments and adds nothing to them except a bunch of puzzles, some of which are almost literally in a checklist. This is really not fun, as part of the fun of these games is uncovering the world and feeling a part of it.That said, this is cute and nice, just expect it to peak halfway through.			"

Don't forget Jennifer Hale as well! :D The game has two 'campaigns.' One is the story of Shay and the other is the story of Vella. I decided to play Shay's first and Vella's second but I believe you can switch between them at will. Both stories are very interesting and I can't wait to play Act 2!			"

												I cut my teeth on adventure games as a kid—that and RPGs—so the puzzles were very simple for me and there wasn’t much playtime as a result. But!I’d rather have a very tight game (and only the first half at that) than a lot of padded content for no reason. The amount of detail that’s gone into that game is fantastic and I’d expect nothing less from that creative team. I hope a lot of people fall in love with adventure games because of this title, because it’s full of moments that I remember kind of delighting me as a kid with Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle. Like, trying to combine two objects you don’t expect to do anything—but getting some kind of very specific dialogue for that action when it fails all the same. Try to combine fruit + ladder =""No, I don’t need a fruit-scented ladder right now.""Why on earth would they need to record that instead of just making an error sound! Because everything is fun in that game even when you’re getting things wrong. It really puts an emphasis back into EXPLORATION. Which was always the appeal of those games and really makes me feel like a kid again. Because the emphasis isn’t on FINISHING the game or getting achievements or anything like that. It’s inhabiting that world and clicking on everything gleefully and exhausting every dialogue tree.I really hope that people get this game.  "

												Act 1.  Masterpiece.Act 2. Pile of Steaming Dog Poo.Act 1, had the perfect mix of comedy, acting, puzzle solving, heartfelt emotion and pure gold.Act 2, had story contrivances ... one character knowing that the other character needed something in a specific way for them to progress... when said character had NO CLUE WHATSOEVER what the other character needed.  Oh but the player did.And the puzzles, annoying to solve and it takes a lot of switcing between characters and, to me, breaking up narrative flow.At the end of Act 2, my hair was pulled from it's resting place, my game also BSOD my computer at least once and I had screamed to high holy heaven in aggravation.It's like Tim Shafer created a masterpiece... then went on to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sequel that takes all the previous wonder, comedy, fun ... and RIPPED IT RIGHT OUT.Act 1 - Laughed 9-10 times.Act 2 - Two giggles... lots of hair pulling.5/10 ... and it's only that high because of Act 1.A waste of money at its current price however... and I feel sorry for the 1500+ people who donated millions to Tim Shafer for this piece of awesome game and crap game at the same time.  I could just feel their wonderment after playing Act 1 ... quickly turn into ""WHY THE F DID I GIVE TIM SHAFER MY MONEY?!"" when they got to Act 2.Tim... for the love of god ... where did all the money go? Into paying the actors right? Did you waste it all on the actors and have nothing left for Act 2? Is the reason it took so long because you were out of money to make a decent end to your game?			"

												The puzzles of the first act is pretty easy, perhaps too easy. In the second act some of the puzzles were of the try-and-experiment sort that was fun to solve, but most of them were rather obscure with rather hilarious solutions, similar to Monkey Island. I really liked the part where I got stuck on a puzzle for a while and the main character started drawing up a table as a hint.The story wasn't in-depth or thought provoking, and in fact had some plot holes, or twists that were quickly brushed aside. The big bad felt rather signle dimensional, and you couldn't even visit the big-bad-evil's lair, only watch cutscenes from it, making chunks of the game feel like a missed opportunity. Some of the object interactions were pretty verbose but that's more of a relic from old-school games. Now, that said, the writing was filled with junevile fun with heaps of jokes that didn't feel particularly wooden. Voice acting was phonomenal too.The visuals were pretty and hadn't noticed/encountered any graphical glitches since the second act update. Animations ran slick as butter and had graphics had a well drawn painterly style. Music was subtle and well made, which helped set the tone of the scenes and set up an enjoyable environment but were hardly memorable.So, now, you're wondering why despite the critisms I'm giving it a positive review? That's because I went into the game expecting a light-hearted and cheerful game, and got what I wanted. To me the great bits of the game outweighed the bad bits.Is it perfect? No. Is it good. Yes.There aren't many games like this and the only one I can think of is the Deponia series, but that game relies on being mean and offensive all the time, which just leaves a bad taste the further you go. Broken Age is *the* game you should pick up if you are looking for a light-hearted, point and click adventure game.			"

												Firstly, I didn't know anything about the kickstarter and surrounding controversy (until reading the reviews, after the fact) and I waited until Act 2 was available before buying and playing this game, as usually I like to keep playing these kinds of games until the end (I'm pretty impatient when it comes to finding out what happens next!). I thought it would make for a better gaming experience.Secondly, I am a huge fan of point and click games, having played dozens of them over the last twenty years or so. I'm usually pretty forgiving when it comes to dumb, illogical puzzles - it kind of comes with the territory with these sorts of games. I don't mind the occasional glance at a walkthrough to get me back on track.So, now, the game. As many others have said, Act 1 was great. Although some the puzzles were really very simple, I didn't mind that, it meant the game had a good flow. The art style/look and feel of the game is great. You're introduced to some interesting characters and a lot of intriguing plot lines are started. You're compelled to keep playing, and that's always a sign of a great game.Unfortunately you then move into the second half of the game, and it was so bad that in several places I almost stopped playing (almost - I haven't abandoned a single point and click adventure yet...). Some of the puzzles were nothing short of absurd, and repetitive game-padding to boot. Unless you really enjoy pretend wiring robots. Strangely, that's not on my all time top ten list of fun stuff to do. Actually, it's not even in the top 1,000. Still, if you're getting really stuck and frustrated and want to progress, you can just consult a walkthrough, right? Wrong, because this game actively hates you so much it had randomised some of the solutions, so you either solve it yourself or you don't finish it. Why the game would want to stop you progressing when you're already at the brink of 'I give up' by removing a walkthrough option, I don't know. And whatever happened to games giving you gentle hints? Almost as bad are the controls - sometimes for a puzzle you need to click and drag, sometimes you just click and click again, with seemingly no rhyme or reason behind the change, which adds to the frutstration for no reason at all. There's just no excuse for having inconsistent/clunky controls like this.Don't worry *too* much about the gameplay though, because the story is far worse. Did they stop writing this halfway through and chucked an intern at it to finish the rest? I'm only exaggerating a little when I say the 'pay off' in the second half equates to 'because reasons.' Most of the 'plot', such as it is, is relegated to a few lines of dialogue while you play as Vella, whilst Shay is busy on fetch quests for nearly the entire second act. Without wanting to give away any spoilers, don't expect this game to have an ending, because it doesn't. It just stops without any of the story telling 'this is what happened' finesse that viewers and players would generally expect. As an example, something major about a character is revealed towards the end and it passes by without comment from any of the other characters - at all. I prefer plumbers-rescuing-princesses type stories to this.The other main issue with the second half is that there are no new areas. (A couple of new screens I think but nothing else, other than slightly altered versions of first-half environments) It's just the same places that you already explored in the first half of the game. That's it. Walking endlessly back and forth through the same scenes, because as I've mentioned, this game dislikes you and does not want to give you a quick-travel/map option. It wants to see you walk back through 10 screens again and again. Because reasons.I really didn't want to hate on this game as it started so well and it's the kind of game I love so much, but come on, Although the audio was great, it's not as critical as gameplay and story -please spend less money on Jack Black and Hobbits and orchestras, and more money and effort on writing and places to explore.By the way, my playtime is so high because I fell asleep twice whilst playing this game (again, the second half of it). That should be indication enough of how good it is.If you want a more modern point and click game, play the recent Sam and Max games, or Book of Unwritten Tales, or even some of Pendulo's stuff. Because this game is likely to disappoint you, even if you didn't back it on kickstarter/wait years for it to come out.			"

												This game is not one of my favorites. However, the story was adorable and unique.But the puzzles were a bit annoying. As some have said, some puzzles were not intuitive.I do not recommend this game to everybody, but for those who love Point-and-Click games.Playing on Shay’s space ship and Alex’s space ship was very nice, but it was really boring to play in Shellmound and Meriloft.I almost got stuck in the game because I forgot to write down the swinging pattern (wires in the back of the robot).I was happy that I had not saved the game after the robot has started to tickle the Space Weaver.Maybe I would have had to restart the entire game just to know the pattern? Because you can not come back into the room after Mom has entered.I spent a lot of time to solve the riddle of Yorn, I didn’t know what to do with the Holy Tear Gas Shooter and with the Talking Tree, I was surprised to know that I had to put a ladder inside the mouth of Mog Chothra.Well, I was very curious to know the course of the story and the main protagonists were so lovely. 5/5 Story2,5/5 Gameplay5/5 Graphics			"

												First and foremost as when you begun this game you're given a choice to play two protagonists, Vella (girl) and Shay (guy) first ; While you could switch around between their stories, I'd recommend in Act 1 to play (and finish) Shay's story first before getting to Vella. I find it more interesting to start off Shay's story first as whatever in the contents of the plotline, I still had no clear idea what was really happening until I got to Vella's story and realize the load of references to Shay's side.I have not played Act 2 yet although I heard that it's only starting from Act 2 that you're required to switch around between Vella and Shay to complete some puzzles, i'll probably edit this review again after I'm finally done with this game. In regarding to Act 2, I want to stab myself in the face when I got to the puzzles ofassembling all of the parts to repair the ship in Shay's story.Overall about the gameplay, the puzzles are pleasant and interesting to go through, there're some interesting and lovable characters in the game especially in Shay's story, somehow I had a fondness for the little machinary characters. Art otherwise is adorable with beautiful environment. This game's a yes go.			"

												The game was phenomenal in the first act, but fails to deliver in the second. Contrived puzzles to pad time on and poor writing causes the game to fall fall flat. Act 2 recycles all the levels and characters in an effort to save money on artwork I assume. The ending is vague and unsatisfying. The main threat is poorly explained and there are large gaping plot holes. The dialogue being clever is one of the few redeeming qualities for the game.Overall, I would not recommend this game. If this game had not been kickstarted, it would have been a financial trainwreck. I am sad that my name is in the credits. Tim Schafer promised a steak, but delivered a hot dog.			"

												Okay, so here's the important part: DON'T GET SCARED OF ALL THE BAD REVIEWS LATELY! So, let's continue..This game is pretty damn good. The first part is awesome, and the second part continues the goodness. But that's where my opinion differs from the most. The second part had better and more interesting puzzles, but the story isn't that surprising from there on.If you love a good story, great puzzles - and I got through all of them without a walkthrough! That's pretty rare in the point-n-click genre! - that are very rich in design, yet very demanding, then this is a no-brainer. There's a couple of parts where you really need to stop for a moment and think what's happening, but other than that, it leaves a very rewarding feeling when you manage to understand the tricks there. Some point-n-clicks are pretty basic what comes to the puzzles, but this one has some very interesting designs there!Also I am going  to repeat the most important part of the game: The story!Oh my god. When I first started off, I was very confused and in the greatest way. The plot opens little by little, in a very satisfying way (especially the first part). The visual style is also very nice.This game just felt right for me.Really, if you love point-n-clicks, stories and puzzles, you really should get this one. At least on sale. It's very much worth it.P.S the voice acting is great too!			"

												A fantastic point and click adventure game where you play through 2 seperate storylines starring a young girl and a young boy. As you play, you learn how these stories relate and intertwine.The writing and humor are top notch, and the characters are very enjoyable, a talking knife was my favorite!The puzzles are mostly logical and you can't miss required objects. The only problem you may have is that some of the later ones can be tricky becuase you can easily overlook the clues you are given.Very recommended to anyone who likes a good adventure game!			"

												When I backed this game back in 2013 I was excited to see Tim return to adventure games after Grimm, yet $3 million and 2 years later was it worth it? It pains me to say, no.To start its very hard to see why this game took so long to create, when the second act reuses the majority of levels and assests from the first. What you have here is a game that is not only disappointing but lacks any real closure on the stories of Shay and Vela, leading to an ending thats just there. The story while starting strong ends on such a wimper that you'll wonder if any of it was worth it, especially after some late game puzzles that will make you remember why this genre died.It upsets me to say this but don't waste your time or money on this game, go play the ""remastered"" Grimm or the HD Monkey Island games for a classic fix of adventure.

												It's just really not as good as the trailers OR the kickstarter make it out to be (and I backed it).One of the best things about adventure games is the beautiful environments to explore.  This game does have beautiful art, but not a lot of it-- every region you find in Act 1 is recycled in Act 2, so you miss the sense of exploration that is present in games like The Longest Journey, or even a low-budget adventure like Primordia.  Prepare for 2 villages, 1 cabin, 1 mountain, and 1 ship to be 99% of the game's actual setting.The story started out really intriguing and promising, and just rushes through to the end with little explanation and much badly-written plot twisting.  The boy character doesn't contribute much to the story other than being charming, and neither main character EVER speaks a word of dialogue to the other main character.  Not even at the end.			"

												If this game is supposed to be a return to the classic point & click adventure games, then I will go back to playing the actual point & click adventure games from the 90s and early 00s, like Sam & Max Hit the Road and Sanitarium.Act 1 was good and promising, but Act 2, the part we waited for 2 years, was very bad. 2 years for this? Really? I know Schafer has lost......... pretty much from talent to touch with what people want, but it's bad. Hell, I haven't backed it on KS, and it's♥♥♥♥♥♥ I would be even more frustrated if I backed it. And they got 3,3 million dollars, they release 1/2 of a game, release the second half two years later, which in that time, Schafer and Double Fine have credibility and trust with everything they did, and people support them?I am sorry, but don't buy this game at all. Watch it on Youtube.Also, for Psychonauts 2: it won't be good when it comes out.			"

												Let me start by stating this - I could recommend this game  only  when the second half is released or a big sale occurs. There are many reasons for this including playtime, replayability and puzzles, among others. I will be mentioning some scenes found in the game so if you haven't played it yet or don't like spoilers, skip to the conclusion at the bottom of this review.Broken Age has an interesting premise; enter the lives of two teenagers worlds apart as you point-and-click your way through amusing dialogue, varying puzzles and vibrant locations. I really enjoyed the colours and art scheme, as they fleshed out the characters and created a unique atmosphere for the player to explore in. Upon entering the game, you will have the choice to select which character you would like to start with first, Vella or Shay. Out of the two, I preferred Vella's story because the puzzles seemed more varied and she was the only person to have a boss battle in the end of the first act, leaving me slightly disappointed in Shay's tale. The characters feel different and made me laugh quite a bit, especially a certain tree. I feel that the main reason I prefer Vella is because the environments and characters in her story are more plentiful and vibrant than the secluded setting of Shay's. There was a lot of repetition in the levels aboard Shay's spacecraft. Sure, the repeated visits to his four missions had a certain charm to them, but the rescue mini-game felt repetitive and boring. One of his puzzles later on in the story requires the player to shrink their head to fit in a small helmet, but I only solved this by accident while trying to explore the spaceship. There was also a lot of backtracking involved, especially in Vella's plot, where I had to keep revisiting certain locations to retrieve items necessary for completing puzzles. I believe that DoubleFine not only needed to spend a bit more time increasing the difficulty of the puzzles (because some of them were too simple to solve) they also should have spent more time on Shay to balance out the two stories. Vella's is more unique and fun to experience because of the variety of characters, locations and overall aim of the plot. Would you rather slay a giant beast threatening towns with annihilation or avoid the AI aboard your ship?Broken Age is what I would call an 'interesting game'. Not in the sense of challenging to complete, but more so being really conflicted in my overall opinion after finishing the first act. The way the stories of the two protagonists play out makes it feel like two separate games, but not entirely in a good way. The focus on character development feels unbalanced, as well as the amount of content and a certain boss battle only Vella experiences. I expected a lot from Broken Age, but instead of a sense of satisfaction I feel like my cup is half-empty. Once the second act comes out (if it ever does) I will add more content to this review but until then I will say this - a half-empty cup is not worth $25 to me.			"

												The storyline didn’t really have me intrigued but it didn’t have me turning away. It kept me interested enough to continue playing although I felt no drive to. The puzzles were a bit on the easy side, not really reminiscent on the nostalgic feel of point and click adventure games, which I assumed this, would be resembling.  The story kind of drags itself along at points which makes me wonder if there’s really any emotional investment involved in this game. The soundtrack is beautiful, the voice acting amazing, and the art style is fresh. The gameplay is lacking, and the storyline; I’m just not sure how I feel about it. I think charging $24.99 for part one is a bit stiff but I’m hoping that includes part two as well because for a few hours worth of gameplay I’m not satisfied.  Overall, this is one game I would wait for the second part to be released because it just feels odd without it. For what little gameplay that is currently available, I’d have trouble recommending getting it now and not just waiting. It just feels like this game has been shoved through a pipeline for the sake of creation. Worth a few hours of your time and a couple bucks. I’d wait for this one to be completed though before getting it. 5/10			"

Nice pictures, but I don;t get all the praise for this game. Absurd and weird story is fine if the jokes are good, but this game is not even remotely funny. On top of that the game lacks comfort fynctions like a hot spot key, which are standard in modern point and click adventures. Most important where the heck did the 3 Million dollar crowd funding go for this adventure? It is way too short and actually just half the game. The second half gets extra funding.Seriously as a Double Fine Fan I appreciate the Art of this game, but overall a serious dissapointment.			"

												The saving grace of this game is it made me stop buying half baked games like this one in the future.I used to trust Double Fine to prouduce content, after enjoying their first few games and after seeing this being the most well funded game in Kickstarter history I decided to give it a go.The cost to live comfortably in San Francisco is around 5000$ a month, while in Ukraine it is only 300$ a month. I'm not saying that Schafer should have made his team move out to Ukraine, just that it's something to be reminded of. Besides that it's only about 4 hours of content, which I'd be okay with if the story's ending felt concise. Anyway none of that really matters when the game isn't finished, for all intents and purposes it deserves an ""early access"" tag.			"

												I really wish Double Fine stuck with their original scope for this game.  I feel like seeing their funding well exceed all expectations led to a project they couldn't quite handle or manage properly, which resulted in multiple delays and the game being split in to two parts and almost 2 years past their initial projected release date while still needing more money from sales and other backing to even finish the game.  The game itself is mildly entertaining, if not somewhat boring and uninspired.  If Telltale didn't bring adventure games back by storm prior to this, it may have been looked upon more fondly but otherwise the puzzles and story are both tame and fairly unimaginitive, with unattractive art and characters.  I'm really hoping Part 2 is a much stronger effort.			"

												Broken Age Act 1 was an incredibly beautiful, deeply interesting game with simple but fun mechanics, amazing art style, and a story I couldn't wait to finish and learn more about. It had good writing and voice acting, plus a twist that actually surprised me at the end. I was desperately excited to play Act 2.Broken Age Act 2 took every plot point set up by Act 1, every character detail and known fact, and threw it in the trash. All the questions I wanted answers to were resolved in throw-away dialogue and boring cop-outs. Plus it introduced a huge new plot point for no reason that tied up no loose ends and just made the whole thing confusing. It felt fake. It felt like a betrayal after how good part 1 was. The puzzles were increased in difficulty for no reason and they were mind-numbingly difficult. The solutions were usually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It took 9 hours to finish this act (only 4 hours for act 1), with no breaks, and I was playing with a friend! In most cases I'd say my dislike of the ending or plot choices was my own opinion but Double Fine really dropped the ball on this second half.Would I recommend Act 1? Absolutely. It's still a fun and beautiful game, it's worth playing. I do not recommend Act 2 to anyone. Just stop after you finish the first part and let your imagination do the work for you, I promise it'll be a better ending then what Double Fine gave us.			"

												A Fun an beautiful game. It was made to recreate the old point and click adventure, but the level of story telling, characters and the art makes it feel like an old fairy tail. Personally it reminds me of a story of Askeladden with art by Theodor Kittelsen. (see also the Askeladden stopmotion series from the 80s(?))That's what I connected it to be like, but that might also be a product of my childhood experiences. The game might look like a childrens story but it includes many references and jokes only 20-30++ people will get. (ex. Terminator 2) seemlesly stitched in even for those who don't get the references. There are a few puzzels that end up feeling close to impossible but don't give up, put the game down for a day and sleep on it. Internet search can be the death of that accomplishment feeling.			"

												Back in the day I played plenty of point and click adventure games, and I really enjoyed them. I'm not sure what I was expecting going into Broken Age, I guess I assumed it would be better than it turned out to be. This is just not my sort of game I guess, I just didn't find it at all entertaining or compelling. The story is incredibly weak in my opinion, and I was under the impression that was supposed to be the strong point. The artwork is really nice... But that does not make up for the lack luster story and uninteresting plot. Apparently millions of dollars went into this, but I fail to see where it all went. There are better games in this genre, made for far less money. But considering kickstarter made the game profitable before it was even released I'm not really surprised. Broken Age is not a bad game, its just not at all what I would expect from a title with such a massive budget and exponential waves of hype. I'm just not satisfied with it. And I can only recommend it if it goes on sale, $5, $10 if your interested. I just don't feel its worth $24.99.			"

												[OLD REVIEW: When only the first part was out]Now to the actual critisisms of the game. The game is incredibly short and since this is supposed to be about half of the game, I am very worried for the total length of this game when it's complete. The puzzles are very simplistic and straight forward which means that the story, characters and enviroments is what has to be good to carry this game. And they are. The game oozes of atmosphere with great characters, great enviroments all realised with a beautiful artstyle. The story is also good so far but I can't put down a real opinion there as the game is not finished.[UPDATE: May 02 2015]The second part is now out and I have to say that the game all in all, is a disappointment. The first thing that is important to mention is that there are very few new assets or anything new to experience in the second part. All characters and enviroments are reused although re arranged and modified a bit to be the setting of the new story and the story in it self is not very good. It doesn't make much sense and the end doesn't manage to satisfy in any way. The length of the game, as I was afraid of the last time I reviewed the game, is indeed very short and is mostly hold up by some puzzles that will take a long time to figure out. This is because the difficulty spike in the second part is enormous. While the first part was way too easy, the second one can be frustratingly hard. All in all there is one word I would describe Broken Age with and that is disappointment. It might be worth to play if you catch it on a sale for the art and atmosphere alone but otherwise, stay far away from it.			"

												As a preface, I was not a backer and knew nothing of the origin story of this game when I decided to purchase it.Pros:- The artwork is gorgeous- The music is lovely- Neat concept of telling two stories / giving the player the option to play two characters- Imaginative story elements (love the space weaver!)- I like the self actualization / empowerment theme Cons:- Based on reviews I had read, I thought this game was aimed at adults.  While charming in its own way, it is aimed, in my opinion, squarely at small children.-  Cause and effect are not strongly correlated in this game.  While whimsical and perhaps dreamlike, this makes gameplay feel rather unrewarding.- Storyline issues - one of the main characters has to fight for her life within the first few minutes of gameplay.  Unfortunately, this is not at all a stressful event because I 1) haven't been given enough time to really care about her, 2) no tension is built up b/c none of the other characters seems to be very concerned about her, and 3) during the actual fight scene, making a wrong choice has no negative outcome. I understand that as a point and click puzzle, you may need several tries to figure it out, and can understand why the developers made the choice to limit the negative consequences of missing the puzzle.  However, I would argue that a life or death situation requires negative consequences - otherwise, you are proving to the player that there is no real ""problem"" to be solved in the game - you have eliminated the biggest ""problem"" there can be.  -  There is no finesse needed to interact with non player characters;I found myself simply clicking through the options as quickly as possible to get on with it already.  Several times I didn't even really pay close attention to the dialogue - but this largely did not affect my ability to complete the puzzles.- The puzzles, while at times cute / funny, were pretty inconsistent.   At times they were overly simple or simply bizarre / illogical, leading to a ""click until you find it"" strategy being a valid method of progressing through the game.  All in all, my critiques can be ignored if one looks at this game as aimed at children. If it is a children's game, all of these choices make sense - don't make the game too scary or too hard, put most of the emphasis on the whimsy and a positive message. So maybe I was just mislead by the reviews.  Pretty on the fence with this one; I really want to like it.  The storyline problems and lack of challenge ultimately led me to my thumbs down designation.  Waiting for Act 2; maybe this will change my mind.			"

												This game exemplifies all the worst parts of point n' click adventure design.The first half hand holds your way through. There are a couple interesting puzzles, but most are bring item that does X to place that needs item that does X. The plot here is good though; it has a lot of good build up and interesting characters.The second half is a mess of dead ends and bizarre logic. I felt like a third of the puzzles I stumbled upon their solution accidentally, and another third I would have never figured out. Also, the plot goes straight into the gutter with a weird disappointing ending.			"

												There is much to like about this game, the graphics are gorgeous, it's quite funny and I enjoy the characters and the story, so far. I can not recommend getting it yet, though, because it feels like more of a prologue than an act. It's been a very disappointing experience to have to wait so long for the 2nd act, and while that doesn't directly impact what is there of the game, I just don't feel I can support the way double fine is managing their projects, as much as I understand the scope of this one growing massively because of the unexpected degree of their kickstarter success.When (I'm an optimist, so I won't say ""if"") the second part gets released, I'll be happy to edit my review and recommend it, if the second part turns out anything nearly as good the first act promises. I would suggest to wait until then and play some other game on Steam. I've heard there's quite a few.			"

												Ultimately, for a game to be more than just good, it has to provide something that sticks with the player. It can be something new or unexpected. It can be the developing on, or the perfection of, a preexisting genre, mechanic or idea. It can even be a single transient inconsequential moment when a game made you laugh, cry or – dare we hope? – think. When writing this review, BROKEN AGE invoked words like “well-presented”, “pretty”, “excellent voice-work” and “interesting.” What it failed to invoke was anything that I will be referencing or discussing one year from now. The paper cutout design is a high-point and should be praised, but I feel that the developers could have done more with it if they had not been aiming for a  smooth “nostalgic” style, originally imposed from technical limitations rather than artistic thought. The obligatory challenges are extremely easy, sometimes appearing more as parody than puzzles. The story is decent, but heavily telegraphed. As for the characters, they are well-rounded, with some witty dialogue and funny back-stories.In the end, BROKEN AGE can probably serve as a very good example of a archetypical point-and-click adventure, tempered by the 2010s decreased focus on puzzles (and accompanied puzzle-related frustration) in favour of story and charm. If that is what you are looking for, BROKEN AGE will most likely suffice. But if you are looking for something 'more', you will not find it here.ADDENDUM for Act 2:Frustrating backtracking through the locals and people of Act 1, with the added addition of what I think is some kind of overlay graphic bug (not present in the ipad version) that makes two puzzles practically unsolvable.

												this is a long review, so i'll the tldr up topTL:DRI appreiciate the work put into this game but it far too simplistic and childish for my liking... and this is coming from someone who at the age of 21 enjoys pokemon on the 3ds. I got bored with it rapidly. if your into games with a cute setting or like the ps1 games of old it may be worth a play. it isn't a full game. verra's story is better than shays.the game is broken into acts and two seperate stories. shay, the guy in space follows a young adult who is being mothered on a ship. He is sick of going on pointless childish missions set up by the Ships Computer. One day he meets a stranger who convinces shay to break away from the norm and take on a mission on a galatic scale. shays story losses alot of potential because the of it's cheesy presentation. star system for example have names such as ""prima doom"" and ""Smile Cluster"". the warp drive is controlled by a tabestry creating robot. take note that the display of the ship is set up like a childs room for the sake of the story.Verra's story although apprearing to be aimed at a young audience feels less corny then shays. it is about a young woman who is put up as a human sacrafice. rather than seeing it as honor she decides to escape and fight the monster she is being presented too.  the story is light hearted but slightly darker than Shays. the Gameplay in both stories is loaded with unintresting puzzles and repetative sequences. it gets old fastIf you find the ps1 games of old to be enjoyable then for $15 it's worth a play. keep in mind the game is meant to be sold in acts so there is no current ending to the stories. neither come close to the edge of your seat that a tell tale point and click would provide.

The second act has some seriously stupid-hard puzzles. (most of which required me to look up hints online) The puzzles in the first act were more fun, and I didn't need hints for any of them.Second act feels rushed, the entire second act is fetch quests and chain puzzles. Give this to this guy, take what he gives to this guy. Etc. While that can be said about any point-and-click adventure, it feels much worse here in the 2nd act.Do I reccomend this game? No.			"

												If you loved Monkey Island retro style adventure games of old, you will quickly fall in love with this game. It truely is a vision of Tim Schafer in every way. The detail and quirky humor brings out a subtle charm to a somewhat robust combination of artwork that entails an interesting story of two halves. At the beginning of the game you get a simple choice of either starting as a boy or a girl. The character development is entrenched in the way you play so to get a better feel of the game never rush, always take your time.

												Honestly, this is an amazing game; great voice acting, story, puzzles, and writing. However, I'm still not done (I'm at the knot puzzle in act 2 which is a pain) so my opinion is subject to change, but I doubt it. It's a just a simple point and click game similar to Day of the tentacle or Monkey island; well it is made by Tim Schafer. The puzzles start off rather simple but then spike in complexity in Act 2, but doable nonetheless.A lot of the puzzles aren't straightforward and require a good deal of thought and time. The game mechanics aren't bad and I don't really see why other people are complaining. Literally, you point at an object and click. The cursor changes shape  when you can interact with an object/person. In the inventory bar you can combine items. You can pick an item for your inventory and use it to interact with other objects or people in the overworld. Really, just basic funtctions thats in any other point and click game.The writing is filled with a lot of sexual innuendos (or maybe I'm just a really sexual person, I don't know) and satirizes hipsters a lot (All I'm saying is that Wil Wheaton's role in this game is better than his role in TNG, because in this game he actually contributes to the story in a meaningful way). The plot, without spoliers, starts off simple: Vella is preparing for a festival and Shay is a Space captain. The actual story shifts between two main characters: Shay and Vella, and you can between them at any point throughout the game and sometimes it proves beneficial to jump (Hint: The Toy Puzzle).  Eventually the two do merge in an unexpected manner ( well at least I didn't expect it) and it becomes epic as well as a bit more difficult. . The music for this game is amazing and fits in exceptionally well. Every location and scene comes with complimentary music.Some reviewers who complain already have some experience with Tim Schafer games and can attest to the quality with respect to Schafer's other games; I, however, can't, so sorry for the lack of greater detail in this review.  So all in all, an excellent game, a bit pricey, but well worth the play so I recommend you get this game when it's on sale.[update]So I finished, and well the puzzles only get more difficult in Act 2 (there are only 2 acts in case you didn't know). Story wise it becomes more vague as in we never really get a fleshed out motive for the enemy. Dialog options with any character no longer provide us with insight into that character as much as the options are there to tell us how to progress on with the game. Even then the dialog doesn't help much. Act 2 essentially becomes lackadaisical towards the end. The actual ending (without spoiling anything) is very similar to a Studio Ghibli film, I can't really explain in but it just is. If you know what I mean then great if not then well you'll see. I, personally liked the ending and felt satisfied with it; however, others didn't since it doesn't so much wrap the story up. Some fans are asking for an Act 3 to tie any loose knots, but I doubt there will be another installment considering the way it ended. Don't get me wrong it would be awesome to see another but with what we have now I'm happy with.Finally, my overall outlook on the game is still the same: I really recommend it !!Great game, 8/10			"

												I picked this game up after hearing about it online and watching some of a playthrough on YouTube. Overall, I really enjoyed it. Beautiful art, great voice acting, lovely music, and really neat characters. The story was interesting as well, although it was weak at times in act two; there were things that could have been explained better, for sure. The ending was weak as well, and left me wanting more (I was really hoping for a real interaction/some dialogue between Vella and Shay, and was pretty disappointed when I didn't get it), but overall, I was satisfied. If you played point-and-click games as a child, like I did, this game has some nostalgic qualities to it. I know that act two was a negative for a lot of people who bought this game when it was first released, but since I bought the whole game a while after it's full release, I can't speak for them.The puzzles weren't too bad; I actually enjoyed the challenges some of them offered, although I know not everyone would. The wiring one was annoying, but once you figure it out, it isn't as bad as you'd think.For me, the characters are what really made this game; I fell in love with them. All of them were just fun and loveable, voiced perfectly, with witty, well-written dialougue. Shay was my personal favorite, but I really loved Vella as well.Overall, I'd defintely recommend this game, unless you don't like the point-and-click genre. It's a fun adventure with really likeable characters and really pretty graphics. Act two offers a nice mental challenge, for those who like them, although you might end up looking up answers online (I had to, but I don't really care that much; if you can't figure something out, help is never a bad thing). The story is nice, although as I said before it may leave you wanting more. Overall, a very nice, fun game that is really worth a look.			"

												A relatively calm, very enjoyable experience. There are some points that may drive you a bit mad at first because you don't know what you're supposed to do or find, but once you figure them out you laugh at yourself and keep going. Great voice acting all around, witty writing, and a fantastic art style come together in this world that's fun to explore and gives you a genuine sense of adventure and accomplishment.			"

												Having not played a really good point and click adventure in a while, Broken Age was a pleasant surprise.  The beautiful art and design of the game, really keep your eyes happy.  The characters are fun and good humored, so you find yourself laughing occasionally.  It's filled with plenty of puzzles that require different items that send you on search missions to figure out where they are.  Highly recommend it for a relaxed and fun gaming experience.			"

												Broken Age is a point-and-click adventure game, featuring two separate characters controlled by the player interchangeably. Vella and Shay, two teenagers living very different lives, find their worlds thrown into chaos as their fates are intertwined. GraphicsThe graphics in this game are gorgeous. Not in the “Wow that looks so real” sense, but the “Such a beautiful work of art” sense. Every visual asset in the game appears to be produced by hand, leading to a stunning experience. The nice thing about Broken Age, compared to some other point-and-click adventure games I have played, is the interaction points do not immediately stand out. You know how sometimes an object in a 2D game that is intended to move just looks different? This game does not do that.StorySo, Broken Age was originally released as just Act 1. Double Fine have since updated the game, and it now contains both Act 1 and Act 2. And I have to say, I almost liked it better when it was just Act 1. Act 1 was definitely focused on the character development, and fleshing out the game world. Act 2, on the other hand, was far more puzzle-orientated, and not what I was expecting after going through Act 1.Why I hated itCutting this review short here, as I have less to say about this game than normal. The puzzles, especially at the end, became very frustrating. I may not be that great at puzzles in general, but some of these just seemed entirely counter-intuitive. Final RecommendationIf you are a fan of the genre, this game is definitely a good one. If you are new to point-and-click adventures, this may not be the right place to start. It is a little… unique.

Story was a little weak and really dove off after the second act. The ending makes it seem like there'll be an act 3 but, I haven't heard anything about that. All in all a pretty fun game...

												I'm one of those who backed the game on Kickstarter three years ago and, being a long time Tim Schafer fan, with a substantial amount of money (and boy, does my now completely worn backer t-shirt look great!).I hate episodic gaming, so I was really disappointed when I came to know the game would be split in two chapters. I decided to wait until the whole game would be out, which resulted in a LONG wait. Eventually, the game came out and we played it. Was I happy with it? Well, yes and no... If you're wondering whether I recommend the game, the answer is yes. But don't expect the masterpiece that we were all waiting for, considering the names involved.The two chapters are so different in terms of story and gameplay that you cannot help but talk about them separately: you probably already heard up to the point of nausea of what everybody talked about. Of how more story-rich but incredibly easy the first part was, and how the puzzles were much harder in the second part where they forgot adding some story though. That's completely true, and depending on your inclination towards adventure games you'll most definitely like one of the two parts much more than the other. I personally prefer richer puzzles and so I enjoyed the second part more, gameplay-wise, but I totally agree that the first part was much more interesting in terms of scenarios, characters, dialogues and story. The second part seems to almost completely cast them aside, which is a pity.Anyway, since this is supposed to be a review on the game as a whole, let's focus instead on what unites the two parts. First of all, the UI: I don't think I ever hated the UI of a point'n'click adventure so much. It was so obviously conceived for touch interfaces that you cannot help but feel deprived of a much richer experience. There is just a single button for everything: no one was expecting the SCUMM verbs, but was a left/right click interface too much to ask for? This results in a much limited experience in terms of user interaction, as watching/using/talking/etc. are all done the same way, and the game decides what to do for you. Apart from that, I'm also not a fan of how the game looks: I guess the cardboard look&feel was specifically conceived like that, but it feels cheap, especially considering the budget. The music, while decent, is quite forgettable as well, which is a stab in the heart if we think Peter McConnel composed it.At this point you might be wondering: well, if all of this sucked so far, why are you recommending the game? Well, it's still a Tim Schafer game and it feels like it. Dialogues are (most of the times) funny, and, especially in the second part, puzzles are clever and rewarding. The music is often dull but pleasant and, while as explained I'm not a fan of the graphics, there is some art that is really good to look at (the clouds world, for instance).Just don't expect a masterpiece and you'll enjoy some 12-13 hours of your life.

My only gripe is that the puzzles in the second act of the game are fairly convoluted and frustrating, while the puzzles in Act 1 were more light.  I know they wanted to harken back to the olden days of Lucasarts puzzle games where most of them make no sense, but that really harmed killed some of the fun for me personally.

												Broken Age is a point and click adventure game that I could not put down. I had to play through the whole game as much as I could and keep getting lost in the world that this game created. The first part may have been a lot of fun, but it felt short. I rarely got stuck on any puzzles and when I did it did not take me very long to figure them out. However Broken Age shines in it's story and I must say it's an amazing one. With a jaw dropping conclusion I was left only wanting more and can not wait for the second part to come out. In fact directly after beating the fist part I went to Google to see when part 2 would be released sadly I could only come up with later this year(2014). I would highly recommend Broken Age to anyone who loves a good point and click adventure game as well as a game with a great story.			"

												""Broken Age"" is an adventure game that lets you dive into the adventures of Shay and Vella - two young people who live their lives without a connection to each other. Shay lives in his own, colourful spaceship run by his mother and Vella lives in a bakery town that prepares for the traditional ""maidens feast"". Unfortunately Vella is one of the maidens to be sacrificed to the hideous monster Mog Chotrha. But she is unwilling to bow down to senseless traditions while Shay is unwilling to play childish games practicly as a prisoner every day. But big events will offer them new perspectives and tasks...In ""Broken Age"" you pretty much solve puzzles the old school way (like in the classic LucasArts adventures or in ""Simon the Sorcerer""): you talk to people in order to squeeze out information, you collect items, you explore environments and objects and you figure out specific patterns for puzzle solutions. And when I mean ""old school way"" then I also mean that the puzzles are far from easy. Sure, some are quite obvious but many others are very hard to figure out and some also demand perfect timing. This makes the game challenging and thanks to its length it will keep you entertained and occupied for a couple of hours (personally I needed about 16 to 17 hours in total). But prepare for a few frustrating moments as some puzzles demand you to think around a few corners to figure out a possible solution.The gameplay is easy - point and click. Also you can switch between Shay and Vella anytime (which reminded me of ""Day of the Tentacle"" where you switch between three people).But what about the story? Personally I think it's very fine. I dig the characters and the environments they're in. I just couldn't quite get the evil plan from the villains. I won't spoil it here but let's just say that I think this could all sound more logical.Also I really like that this game obviously spoofs cults and superstition, the ways people are made to believe stupid things in order to enrich a leader or to establish rituals that do nothing than silence one's conscience (and hurt others).There's a lot of humour in the game and it gave me a few good laughs wether it's due to absurd dialogues or to funny visuals and animations but the jokes never felt flat.I wanna say about the graphics that they are just beautiful to look at. Pure eye candy! This all looks like a hand-painted, colourful story book (only with moving, talking people). I enjoyed the visuals and also the animations to the end.The soundtrack is very likeable, too. I bought it as a DLC on Steam and don't regret it. Different but fitting tunes and styles give the game another awesome touch.The voices were very well selected, in my opinion. Elijah Wood voices Shay, Masasa Moyo (who I know best as Sarah from ""Team America"") voices Vella and both do a great job in giving these characters their personality. But the other voice actors and actresses are great as well.The most criticized part of ""Broken Age"" is the second act (of three). Many people complain that the story feels half-done or just not good enough. Personally, I don't quite get what the deal here is. I enjoyed the second act as I did the first one. What disappointed me was the ending that felt too sudden and short. In the end, can I recommend ""Broken Age""? Absolutely.If you love solving puzzles and playing (old school) adventures then this is certainly for you. Give it a chance!In my opinion it's not the best adventure game ever but at least one of the best and most beautiful in the last few years.			"

												Tim Schafer does it again in this point-and-click adventure game funded by fellow backers of Kickstarter. This game reminds me of the old Humongous Entertainment games I used to play as a child except intended for older audiences and the puzzles are very creative in this game. Both the themes of the characters you play as are similar in that they are ""breaking"" away from a tradition- a young man who has been treated like a child for most of his life wants to ""break"" away from his computer mother in order to prove he is old enough to handle himself while a young woman wants to ""break"" a custom in her village that has been done for years in order to prevent further villagers from sacrificing their lives.The artwork in this game is truly amazing. One of the most beautiful games I have ever played to date. The orchestrated music really fits the atmosphere this game delivers. Best of all, the dialogue is well written and funny to listen to. In fact, most of voice actors in this game are big name voice actors like Jennifer Hale, Richard Horvitz, Wil Wheaton, Elijah Wood, Jack Black, and even Pendleton Ward (creator of Adventure Time)!I really enjoyed Act I of this game and cannot wait for Act II!

Got quickly addicted and played through the whole first act in one night. Very addicting and with a unique and funny storyline! Another great point-and-click adventure by Double Fine! A+ all the way! Highly recommend if you like classic point-and-click games, such as Monkey Island and Grim Fandango, or any other adventure games, from the minds of Tim Schafer and Double Fine, with a humorous twist and unique storyline (such as Psychonauts, Stacking, and Costume Quest).

												'Broken Age' is a delightful, whimsical and funny adventure game from LucasArts alumnus, Tim Schafer. It features some of the most beautifully animated and visually unique graphics in adventure games I have seen to date. The puzzles are not particularly challenging, but creative enough to keep you entertained. This is particularly so for Act 1, and it's unfortunate that Act 2 fails to realize the game's full potential.The game was released in two parts, sadly almost a year apart. Act 1 features one of the more creative stories in PC adventure games. It is full of surprises and intrigue as we do not quite know how our two playable protagonists' storylines relate to each other -- if at all! The similarities and differences between the protagonists, in their upbringing and relationships with those around them, told through parallel gameplay make the introductions to these characters all the more enjoyable. Act 1 plays like a game about adolesence, rebellion, empowerment and curiosity that ends with a great cliffhanger, making you yearning for more of this ""something (thematically) different"".Now, in the time that it took for Double Fine Productions to churn out Act 2, one would expect them to produce something worthy to follow the (doubly?) fine first chapter. Sadly, no. Unlike Act 1, Act 2 feels like an average classic adventure game, in which you solve a long series of isolated puzzles to achieve a single objective -- and you get to do it for two characters! This may be more acceptable if it weren't for us visiting the same locations and interacting with the same characters again. Plus, the protagonists do not seem to be at a disadvantage despite being in wholly unfamiliar settings relative to their prior experience. Such wasted opportunities for adding a new layer of challenge to the gameplay!Act 2 does bring a few new twists. While these twists are interesting, they fail to enlighten or completely surprise me. In fact, these twists confuse me more, making me ask questions that I surprisingly find the characters not asking throughout Act 2. If questions are asked, they are asked by the wrong protagonist, as if the protagonists share a psychic connection through the player. The inconsistency in characterization and storytelling perspective make the gaming experience slightly jarring.Perhaps Act 2 will be more enjoyable if 'Broken Age' were not released in two parts. If so, perhaps the wonder, magic and intrigue of Act 1 would have spilled over to the second act, and I would not have felt the ""been-there-done-that"" effect as greatly. (Hmm, maybe that's why Tim Schafer recommended replaying Act 1 before playing Act 2?) Despite my criticism of Act 2, 'Broken Age' as a whole is a good game. It is one of the better adventure games out there; it is easy to pick up and enjoy, and I recommend this feel-good game. As long as you keep your expectations in check, you are unlikely to be disappointed by it.			"

If the game had carried the awesome aspects of Act 1 into  Act 2 I wouldn't be so disappointed.First we can talk a bit about Act 1 before I highlight some issues with the overall game. Act 1 is a great level of storytelling, put into beautiful and creative environments. I honestly couldn't stop playing throughout Act 1 just to see what would happen next. Vella and shay's stories both had me wondering how they could possibly be connected and what this world was like. The puzzles were also creative and mostly made logical sense.Unfortunately as other reviews have said, this falls apart in Act 2. Act 2 feels rushed and unimaginative at best. Very few of the actual plot points are answered adequately, if they are answered at all. Most of them are answered in a very short dialogue with Marek, in which he vaguely hints about the reasons for their actions. This seems like Double Fine came up with the initial concept, then just slapped the first idea for an ending on it and called it a day. This however is only a minor flaw in comparsion to the puzzles within Act 2. The puzzles in Act 2 are riduculous, obtuse and lazy. It is almost impossible to solve the puzzles without having some sort of guide to show you what you need to do. Many puzzles in Act 2 give 0 hints on what you need to do and don't seem to have any reason behind them. I was only able to complete the game by using a guide and even then I thought they were frustrating and dumb. The puzzles also seem to go against or have no basis in the characters motivations. Often it doesn't seem like the characters have any reason or understanding of why they are doing these actions or the goal they are trying to accomplish. This just gets worse as you near the ending of the game.The last section of the game make no sense in terms of the plot or in the way you accomplish puzzles. You need to get both characters to do independant actions that they would seemingly have no actual reason to do. It doesn't help that part of these actions is distracting the competant characters so that your characters can complete the game. If the game had an actual ending that left the player satisfied rather then frustrated, this could have been a great game. Unfortunatly because of what seems like a phoned in ending it takes what could have been a 5 star game to 2 to 2.5. If you can get this game for really cheap and you are really into point and click adventure games, then its an alright buy. however, at the current full price of $27.99 CDN I can not recommend it.

												This game is such an excellent example of what can be done with current tech for the timeless point and click genre. The visuals are bold, bright, and colorful, and I love how they achieved an illustrative effect for an interactive game. The voice acting is superb, and I loved hearing actors I love as hilarious characters. The story is so fun, it has funny and heavy moments, and they did a good job of executing a story with complex elements and character development. It was great to have such unique and brave male and female characters, with a story that touched on very 'human' elements. My only criticisms would be: (1) at times, the puzzles veer into being too simple or too abstract, which can make for a frustrating problem that limits player brainstorming (hate being forced to check online for hints, it suspends the story), and (2) the second part of the game loses a lot of its wonder and becomes a bit monotonous. It's still an excellent and enjoyable story and I have shared it with eager players. Those problems just feel a bit disappointing for an otherwise fantastic game. I would still recommend giving it a try, and the sale price is definitely worth it!Pros:-Fun story that is both funny and complex-Wonderfully interwoven experiences of the main characters-Great voice acting (hilarious cameos of well known actors)-Visuals are top-notch, love the color pallette -Part 1 puzzles are fun and intuitiveCons:-Story gets a bit slow in the second part-Part 2 puzzles sometimes get complexly abstract or lack intuitiveness  "

												There is a lot of details that I wanted explained in the second part that weren't really. While the first part was mind blowingly good the second part was just pretty good (They didn't really add new areas and some of the puzzles just weren't as cohesive as they should have been). I think that's why a lot of people were disappointed. I really liked the whole game and it's completely worth  the price. It's a full, finished, highly entertaining story-driven game and that's more than most new games can boast.			"

												Double Fine poses the question of what could adventure games have become if they were as popular now as they were back in the nineties, and they delivered what I consider one of the most memorable adventure games of recent years; while it comes short in comparison with adventure games of yore like Tales of Monkey Island and my personal favorite Grim Fandango, it still manages to communicate that sense of discovery of an unknown and charming world with mysteries, twists, puzzles, and of course a great sense of humor that adventure games are known for.While the story does fall short in act II when compared to what act I promised, it still is a good tale of coming of age, the puzzles are challenging but fair, and while I needed no hints or guides to complete them that doesn't mean that newcomers to the formula will have difficulties on the later half of the game, nevertheless that's also part of the charm of adventure games and the feeling of genius when you finally complete that puzzle that has been stumping you for the past half hour is what I miss the most on modern adventure games.The art style and animation are gorgeous, at each new scene I had to stop playing for a second and soak in all of it, and the places where the game goes are truly delightful, I've played other hand painted adventure games but none other comes close to the beauty of these environments.If you have finished the game I'd recommend watching the documentary series of its making on youtube,

												[Currently at the beginning of Act 2]This game has so many good things. The animation (which is what it truly is) is beautiful. I felt many times that I was watching something, rather than playing a game, because the actions were so fluid. The dialogue/voice acting is on point. Witty with a sprinkling of sarcasm, but definitely whimsical.The action/gameplay is a point-and-click, which appeals to me. It reminds me of the 90's computer games, but the setting and the styling make it seem fresher rather than retro-cool.The puzzles can be challenging, but not so much so that you rage-quit. Two things on my con list, and they're connected: Shay's story and the game as a whole seem too short. While I didn't finish in one long playthrough, it could easily be done (and in fact, one of the Steam achievement's is to finish the game in less than an hour). I'm not finished yet, but I can already tell that I'll be left wanting more.			"

												Broken Age was a fun point and click that had an interesting story with a suprise plot twist ending that left me wanting more. You have the option to play between two story lines, one of a boy named Shay and the other of a girl named Vella, both living in two very different worlds. Vella lives a life where young girls are sacraficed to a monster in order to keep their villages safe and Shay lives a life of solitude trapped in a space station he's grown up in all his life. I've played Act One so far and I can't wait to play Act Two when it comes out. For sure a recommended game. If you're still unsure of whether or not to buy it, I did a let's play on the game. Go to my videos and check out the first few episodes, hopefully it'll help give you a better idea if this is the kind of game for you.			"

												Experience on Linux so far:+ SolidThe game:As a huge fan of point-and-click adventures this game tickled my old school nerves in the most pleasant of ways possible. The artwork is wonderful, I wish they would have a replay button just to replay certain scenes for their artistic attributes alone. You play as two main characters (a boy and a girl) and you can switch storyline between them as you please.This is a nice way of getting away from the monotamy of the old-school point-and-clickers.Voice acting is a big part in PAC games these days and this game nails it. I recognize a few names, most notably would be Jack Black, but overall the dialogs and characters come to live both through the beautiful animations and the excellent voice acting.The game comes in two parts, the first part (out now) was outstanding, albeit short compared to even the mid 90's games in the genre. For the price I paid, yeah, maybe another two hours of gameplay, but I still think it was well worth it for maybe one of the best games in the genre ever.Score:5/5			"

												This game came heavily recommended by friends, but even so I had some trouble getting into it at the beginning. The characters were nice enough, but the story just seemed a bit... bland. And so this game sat in my library with just an hour of playtime for months.Decided to give it another shot today, and man, am I glad I did. The ending of Act 1 had me on the edge of my seat and I am writing this review at 3.30 AM, having played through the game in one swoop until I finished it. Aside from that, all I want to say is: All hail Gary. <3Also, I want a Hexigal for my next birthday, please and thank you.			"

												This was an amazing game. Fun characters, great story, interesting point-and-click game play, gorgeous art on the characters and the scenes. It's just phenomenol. I  can't recommend it highly enough. If I were giving stars on games, my experience playing this game would have to be top. It took me about 9 hours to get through and I got stuck a fair number of times. Some parts of the environment were just not obvious to me.For controls, I suggest rebinding the dialogue skipping to your right click and inventory to middle scroll or something, and then you can practically play the entire game from your mouse. That skip cutscene gets super useful when you're just throwing invetory at objects on the screen in hopes that something will present an unexpected dialogue, grant some hidden achievement or just progress you in the story. This was seriously one of the best games I've played in a long time. Play it and tell me what you think.			"

												Broken Age gets a thumbs up for great writing, voice acting, music, art and animations.  The pacing was generally very good throughout the story, but there were a few things in Act 2 that I either did purely by accident, or by getting out a pen and paper to help keep track of (which I don't think should be necessary in point/click games).  Despite some minor gripes about puzzle elements, the aesthetics of Broken Age show a great deal of polish.  I like point/click adventures, but not enough to ever pay full price on Steam, including this one.  I would still recommended it though, especially to fans of the genre, if it's on sale.			"

												In general this is a very fun easy-going game. I wouldn't necessarily classify it for children as some of the puzzles are challenging to solve, and there are some adult-themed jokes. However, there's not really any violence per se, nor profanity, etc. The game play is pretty simple click and interacting. Some of the puzzles while if you put some thought into them , they are solvable, a minority of solutions I think would be difficult to come across if only by chance. The storyline itself is very unique, and I love how the two worlds of Vella and Shay come together in an unexpected way. For the price it is actually very reasonable. I got about 10 hours of some very enjoyable time out of the game. I would say it might have some replay value but not much. But if I compare it to spending $10 on a movie ticket that entertains me for 2 hours, I would say I'm getting a deal out of this game. I definetly would purchase games like this from Double Fine, and hope they come out with similar games in the future. I already have their Hack in Slash was is humurous, but not as story rich.  "

Very homocidal and always looking for knives or bombs.As a puzzler, the game has some points where you literally have to give everything to everyone to figure out something, or click everywhere in a room to find something.Where I could give 10/10, would watch Vella terrorist again.I'm giving 6/10, Recommend guide to avoid turning 11 hours of interesting story into 3 weeks of wondering a hopeless maze until you accidently find the answer.

I spent apparently 9 hours this week struggling through act 2 because it could barely hold my attention, so I'd be alt-tabbed for a lot of that.ACT 2 is marred by long loading times between each new scene. Coupled with extensive backtracking, I spent a lot of time looking at my phone. There is only one new area in the entire game and you spend at most 10 minutes in it. It's a great way to kill any drive one would have to continue playing the game.The story in ACT 2 just fumbles about over nothing and the big bad's entire plot just reeks of Tim pushing a social agenda.

												Like most things, whether you like this game or not is really just going to depend on who you are, what you like, and what you are willing to put up with.Personally, I was very disappointed with this game. The first act set up a really interesting story! And as much as I hate cliffhangers, I was totally on board for the second half of the game. Storywise, for me, it was like getting a wet dishrag for a christmas gift. The story goes completely tepid by the end, which is extra unfortunate because it made doing the ending puzzles that much more tedious. I can be totally into a tedious puzzle if I'm actually interested in the story outcome of the puzzle, but it really felt like a movie where all the actors stop acting and just start reading their lines from a prompter. By the end, I honestly didn't care what happened to any of the characters. Which is kind of really bad in a game that's essentially all story.Also, wrapping up a story in little sketches during the credits is just asinine. I used to love you, Double Fine, but I don't think I'll be buying your stuff anymore.			"

												Sadly a failure. While the game is both beautiful, funny and engaging, it fails in story and length,Act 1 proved to be well made and promised a longer and more complex act 2 that would wrap up the storyline. Sadly the game is rushed, many plot points are never resolved and the puzzles are less intuitive (although not very difficult or impossible, as some reviews will have you believe). The second act is also about the same length as the first, and almost no new environments or characters are introduced. In many ways I enjoyed Broken Age, but after waiting three years it really feels like a rushed disappointment. I wish I could give a good review, but I cannot in good faith do that.

												Even with a beautiful art style, animation, and voice acting, Broken Age turns into a dreadful game. The puzzles start out whimsical and somewhat charming, eventually becoming frustrating and downright asinine.  The gameplay relies heavily on backtracking, trial and error, and obtuse ""logic"".  You will be forced to run circuits throughout the same 6-8 scenes over and over and over again, deseperately seeking to stumble upon some absurd situation, or item-combining nightmare, for which no precendent was set.  This leaves you swinging blindly most of the time, just trying to trigger the next element to some puzzle that really has nothing to do with anything.Imagine, as a child, it is your birthday, and your parents throw a wonderful party; it's nicely decorated, and your friends show up in elaborate costumes; the presentation of it all is amazing.  It is not announced, but now it's time for party games; it's time to break the pinata!  ...because... well, you know you have to break a pinata.  ...but, you don't know where it is.  So you run back and forth across the various sections of the yard, and all throughout the house, looking for any sign of the pinata.  The clues to its whereabouts also probably involve calling random strangers in the phonebook until you discover someone who is also having their own birthday party.  You should probably get them find and take apart an old VCR though (hint: they don't own one; nobody does anymore), because ...WELL, JUST DO IT.  Then, with the VCR in pieces, which you know has something to do with the solution to something somewhere, it still doesn't make any sense.  Instead, you wander and cry for an hour before you finally stumble upon where the pinata is hidden.  Except, you have no implement to destroy the pinata, and are not tall enough to reach it. Then you realize that trading your aunt some string for a piece of gum, which you then place in the path of the Roomba that is vacuuming the house, will cause it to make a loud whining sound that causes someone outside at the party to trip and fall into the pinata, breaking it apart.  Except there are no treats inside, only tears -- tears of the fallen gods, who died out long ago after playing this game.There is some genuinely funny humor in places, but it is peppered in among cliches, and contrived circumstances built seemingly to make a joke.  The dialog and voice acting is otherwise top-notich, though the quality of Act 2 overall, especially in cutscenes, did not feel well-honed, giving it a sense that the project was rushed.  There are some good ideas in places, such as with sharing puzzle solutions between protagonists, but they are executed in such a frustrating way that makes playing the game an exercise in patience and tolerance.Perhaps all of the shortcomings of the puzzles and backtracking could be overlooked if the payout of the story delivered something surprising or exciting, but it never does.  The only twist in the game comes early in Act 1, and the rest of the narrative just leans on absurd puzzle situations without actually delivering an interesting overall story.  For as odd, and deeply imaginative as the setting and situations are, the story falls flat and doesn't deliver any incentive to see it through.  There is just no payout, and that's what makes this the most disappointing.  If you must play this, do it with a walkthrough at the ready.			"

												Broken Age, when looked at as two seperate parts, starts out very promising and then starts to decline around the beginning of Act Two.Act One is short and sweet. It introduces the characters and world with a beautiful, handdrawn, storybook-like aesthetic. It presents enough plot elements to keep you interested and intriged enough to see the Act to its conclusion. It explores themes centered around coming of age and rebellion as well as the potential dangers associated with each. A number of interesting characters are introduced and it evokes a sense of Schafer's classic titles.Insert a year and a bit of waiting. Now take everything established in the first game and swap the characters. Very few new locations (usually single, one-off rooms), only a few new characters and a number of awkward puzzles to lengthen playtime. Also, the story goes a bit off the rails.The fundemental problem with Broken Age Act Two is that the more of its story it reveals, the more ridiculous it becomes. When you finally learn the antagonist's motivation for everything you realize it has almost nothing to do with the core themes presented in Act One. It's underwhelming in every regard.This would all be forgivable if the gameplay was worthwhile. While some of the puzzles are clever and funny, others are an exercise in tedium. The worst part is that some puzzles play by their own rules. For example, I had an idea of how to complete the knot untying puzzle before I presented the necessary items to complete it. Because I remembered a previous knot and requested instructions to untie it after I had all the items, the solution was no longer valid. The correct order was to have all the items first then present them to the NPC then look at the knot then go back to the NPC...... then do this two more times (at least there was a fast travel)...... Why did it have to be three times?Then the wiring/rewiring and final puzzle was a royal pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ If the order you had wasn't perfect for the final puzzle, you had to restart, rewire, reswitch, and reposition yourself until you got it right. If you made a single mistake you had to start from the very beginning.It also brings into question how two characters in seperate areas are able to reference things from the other's perspective. You could argue that Shay remembered the wiring pattern from looking at his mom's photograph, but how could he possibly know the wiring pattern for the bot that Vella fixed?Yes, ""video game logic"". I know. All-in-all I have mixed feelings about this game. As a complete package I would recommend a buy to Point-And-Click adventure fans but only when it goes on sale. As for the general consumer: avoid. If you want a better example of Schafer's work, play Monkey Island 1, 2, and 3, Full Throttle, Psychonauts or Grim Fandango. Despite its pretty design, Broken Age is hardly worth your money or time.			"

												Never played any games like Broken Age before. It is simple yet beautiful. You basically follow a story about a girl and a boy, in a different place, solving their problems. You can change who you control at anytime. The puzzles get a lot harder on the second act, although it gets funnier. Oh, and the story is engaging and new!			"

												Act 1 was great.Act 2 took 1.5 years to arrive,was set in the same damn locations, puzzles were repetitive, story crashed and burned into a crappy mess with no mystery throughout, or closure at the end. Literally the ending leaves you like ""Uh, really? The credits are rolling?"" PoS game because of all the time invested for LITERALLY nothing.TL;DR - It's like the developers didn't even try in Act 2. They must have whipped up Act 2 on their private yachts partially sinking (from the money weight) with a Piña Colada in one hand.			"

Despite the first half being passable, the second half is terrible with stupid and repeated puzzles and a plot so weak and stupid it hurts.This is the bigger Double Fine disaster. I think Tim Schafer should give an apology to everyone has bought or financed the game through the scamstarter.			"

												A nice little point and click adventure with a great twist to the story that I had not expected.The puzzles are all really fun and solvable until you get to the 2nd act, where some puzzles become unnecessarily more difficult, to the point where it's just not enjoyable anymore. Story-wise I was really blown away by the 1st act: they did some things I had not seen before. The 2nd act was still good, but I felt like the ending was rushed, like they just wanted to have it finished quickly. They could have done a lot more with that!Overall I'd say it was still a great experience! I had a blast trying to use the spoon on every object and character: It has the funniest dialogue!			"

												As a long time fan I just had to play through a new Schafer game, even though the other negative reviews mostly confirmed that I wouldn’t find it too much fun. They were right. I don’t really understand what the target demographic here are. It’s silly in a childish sense, but also extremely time consuming with a lot of overly frustrating puzzles that no one except seasoned point and click players can withstand. Sure, the characters were mostly good - especially the supporting cast, and everything had great production values, from the graphics to the voice acting. But wow it was boring. The puzzles mimicked the worst from old school adventures, especially in the second act and the story that built up during the first act was mostly brutalized in the second one. But the biggest crime here was the ending. After putting in over twelve hours it seemed like a rushed joke on the poor kickstarter backers.There are so many great new point and click adventures out there and Broken Age can’t even hold up to the more lackluster ones. Absolutely not recommended.			"

												I expected the game to have the halo of the good old LucasArts graphic adventures, but it's very different. It's a point&click game with a very complex story. It reminds me a little to The day of the tentacle because it uses two characters with different stories that overlap in some points of the game. But there finish the similarities.I had to follow a guide to be able to solve the puzzles, which were extremely hard for me, even having played almost all the LucasArts games in 90s.			"

												While some parts were rushed in the 2nd act and I feel like they could have gotten deeper into certain moments and characters, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Point n click adventures with good writing, animation and quirkiness. Maybe like two of the puzzles are complicated but not that annoying. When you're made to actually write stuff down on paper to remember it, you know you're getting invested into this. Tim Schafer and the other crew at Double Fine, you guys are geniuses who prefer quality. I understand alot of people are bitter at this game for not meeting expectations and a long wait since they might have helped back the kickstarter, and that's fine, but personally I had fun with this adventure.

The rest was easy or not to hard to work out and fun at the same time. I loved it and replayed it when part 2 came out.Part two was the flip side. It's like they said to them selfs ""Part one was two easy and people completed it to fast. This time we will make it harder so it's more fun"" and ended up killing it. One puzzle you have to look at a knote and try to tell a person a lot of clicking away what it looks like. If you get it wrong you have to go from the start with a NEW knote. There was also a LOT more swapping between both people and some parts that I just picked a random answer becorse there was no clear way to know what was right and once more if you picked wrong it's BACK to the start to do all over. I still have to end the game but each time I think it's time to do it I think back to how hard it became and move on to another more fun game.			"

												tldr: Part two is not as funny, the puzzles are unintuitive and the game patronizes you. I don't plan to finish playing.I enjoyed the first part of this game. The art style was unique, the sountrack set the tone well and I thought the characters were mostly pretty interesting. I loved all the cameos, too. Jack Black, Pen Ward and Wil Wheaton are all in there and play appropriately funny roles. The puzzles weren't super difficult and relatively sparse, but I chose to reserve judgement until the second part came out. The story ended on a cliffhanger that made me pretty excited to find out what was going on. I was looking forward to part two.Upon starting part two, I'm instantly hit by the fact that they're done introducing interesting characters. I think so anyway. I got about halfway through part two, I think. The game continues and I'm not enjoying myself as much. It's like they told all the jokes in the first part and now they're trying to drag them out as long as the audience will listen. ""Whatever"", I thought, ""I just want to finish the story!"" Like a mantra, I chant this to myself every time some puzzle with an unintuitive solution comes up. There are a -lot- more this time around.I had to stop playing. Apparently they got the message that the puzzles were too easy because they managed to confuse the hell outta me. And then they do that thing that games do when you've messed up enough times that they begin to wonder whether or not you actually made it -through- second grade. They try to make it easier like ""Hey, have you tried looking at all this stuff here? Cuz you know we put all this stuff here for you. No, not like that... Okay, well let me draw you a chart and put it up on the wall for you. That oughta help.""That's not an exaggeration. That happens.So I'm not going to finish this game. It's frustrating and not as funny as part one. But the condescending attitude of a developer that feels the need to give unsolicited hints to someone struggling with a puzzle is too much for me. I'd rather stick with the trial-and-error that I was forced to do for nearly every other puzzle in part two.			"

												I bought and played Broken Age after playing the remastered Day of the Tentacle. Whilst BA didn't quite scratch the itch I had for playing more of the same of DotT, I would still recommend BA. At the time of playing I did feel the puzzles were quite easy for much of the game, but towards the end the puzzles did become harder. I didn't become completely stuck at any point, and don't feel that there were really any 'random' or 'illogical' puzzles.The story and characters in broken age are quite pleasant, and some of the not-particularly-subtle adult puns and humour were well appreciated.I think that I would definitely recommend this game to anyone wanting to play a good point and click puzzle adventure.

												The early stages of the game made it feel like a kid's game. Until the wolf came along...What I liked about this:Great art, nice environments, great character designs, looks like a show from cartoon networkGreat voice acting (well it has to be, after all, it has big name actors behind it Elijah Wood, Jack Black, etc..)Some funny moments/dialogues (the yarn dolls, Jack Black's Harmn'y, Curtis)Interesing story, great pacing, unexpected plot twists (I like how it presents the plot from two interconnected perspectives)Most* puzzles can be solved with plain common sense - no nonsensical, convoluted, mind-numbing solutionsThe ability to switch between two characters and their storylines. e.g. playing through one character helps you solve a puzzle in the other character's storyWhat I didn't really like,Puzzle difficulty jumps from really easy kid's stuff (like eating ice cream) to something like a Sherlock-Holmes mystery. Although I try as much to complete a playthrough without  a guide, I had to do it more than a couple of times for this game. Like how was I to know that the snake would eventually faint after ""hugging"" me, wasn't it I who was supposed to faint?Lack of a guide or tutorial. The game directly throws you in with no instructions or guides of any sort. I guess its part of the puzzle solving to figure out how to work the game. Though this isn't much of a big deal to me since I've played alot of point-and-click games before but still having it would be nice.Not sure if this happens on all systems or if its something in the settings but sometimes the character seems to follow your mouse cursor around even if you haven't clicked on anything yet. It gets annoying at times when the character stands in front of an object you need to interact with.Overall it was a fun experience and a great game. Definitely worth its price even when its not on sale. :)			"

												As a huge Double Fine and Lucasarts fan I backed this game at one of the higher tiers, bought more merch along the way to support the extended development, and quite enjoyed Act 1.That said, now that the full game is here, I can't really recommend Broken Age, and I'm pretty disappointed with the game itself.I think the game suffers from a lack of a single cohesive world, two main characters that have no relationship, and what turns out to be a pretty ridiculous and silly plot (which would be fine in a comedy adventure, except it doesn't pay off the expectations that are built in the early parts of the game, i.e. it's a total let down). Many of the characters don't seem to have any purpose other than to be an artificial road block for puzzle business in the story line, and only a couple of characters I found to be memorable (often the characters that had the least screen time unfortunately). The second half of the game also spends the most of its time recycling the same environments and characters for the sake of some pretty tiresome puzzles. The timing puzzles are particularly irritating and don't communicate well visually. I worked through most of the second act without needing any hints, but eventually I hit a point where I just wanted to be done with the game and so I read the solutions. No regrets there.I really like the art in the game, but I think a different, more traditional adventure game art style may have helped get the game done sooner, and I would have rather played a game with worse art, that felt more polished, with more environments, better developed characters and more refined puzzles, than this game, which feels like made a lot of compromises simple because it was so damn time consuming to paint and animate.Finally though, I have to say that I don't feel ripped off and I still hope Double Fine can come back from the damage that Kickstarter and Early Access have done to their reputation in the past year or so. The documentary is great (particularly the first 10 or so episodes before development started getting into trouble) and was worth the price of entry alone, and it's clear that the people at Double Fine care a lot about what they do, but this project had  some fundamental problems right out of the gates and the result is a game that I can't put up alongside classics like DOTT or Full Throttle.

												I’ll make my review short and bitter.Part one: Brilliant, charming, and witty. The characters were likable and the environment was something new and exciting. Overall a very entertaining story.Part two: All the magic from part one was destroyed in part two. Anything unique was made ordinary and the ending was so cliché. Part two killed it for me. "

												As a huge Double Fine and Lucasarts fan I backed this game at one of the higher tiers, bought more merch along the way to support the extended development, and quite enjoyed Act 1.That said, now that the full game is here, I can't really recommend Broken Age, and I'm pretty disappointed with the game itself.I think the game suffers from a lack of a single cohesive world, two main characters that have no relationship, and what turns out to be a pretty ridiculous and silly plot (which would be fine in a comedy adventure, except it doesn't pay off the expectations that are built in the early parts of the game, i.e. it's a total let down). Many of the characters don't seem to have any purpose other than to be an artificial road block for puzzle business in the story line, and only a couple of characters I found to be memorable (often the characters that had the least screen time unfortunately). The second half of the game also spends the most of its time recycling the same environments and characters for the sake of some pretty tiresome puzzles. The timing puzzles are particularly irritating and don't communicate well visually. I worked through most of the second act without needing any hints, but eventually I hit a point where I just wanted to be done with the game and so I read the solutions. No regrets there.I really like the art in the game, but I think a different, more traditional adventure game art style may have helped get the game done sooner, and I would have rather played a game with worse art, that felt more polished, with more environments, better developed characters and more refined puzzles, than this game, which feels like made a lot of compromises simple because it was so damn time consuming to paint and animate.Finally though, I have to say that I don't feel ripped off and I still hope Double Fine can come back from the damage that Kickstarter and Early Access have done to their reputation in the past year or so. The documentary is great (particularly the first 10 or so episodes before development started getting into trouble) and was worth the price of entry alone, and it's clear that the people at Double Fine care a lot about what they do, but this project had  some fundamental problems right out of the gates and the result is a game that I can't put up alongside classics like DOTT or Full Throttle.

												I bought and played Broken Age after playing the remastered Day of the Tentacle. Whilst BA didn't quite scratch the itch I had for playing more of the same of DotT, I would still recommend BA. At the time of playing I did feel the puzzles were quite easy for much of the game, but towards the end the puzzles did become harder. I didn't become completely stuck at any point, and don't feel that there were really any 'random' or 'illogical' puzzles.The story and characters in broken age are quite pleasant, and some of the not-particularly-subtle adult puns and humour were well appreciated.I think that I would definitely recommend this game to anyone wanting to play a good point and click puzzle adventure. It is good quality.			"

												The first act was pretty good even if the puzzles were for the most part incredibly simple. The second act is a complete let down however, as the story goes absolutely nowhere and the puzzles are frustrating and nonsensical. It is a real shame that the second chapter amounts to little more than two separate mostly meaningless fetch quests with minimal character development which destroys what made the two characters interesting in the first chapter.

												Act 1 had so much potential (I actually thought it was amazing), but all of it was squandered in Act 2. Characters suddenly became 2-dimensional (especially the villains, who turned out to be laughably banal, unlike the mysterious stowaway we started with in the first Act) and so many plot points were left hanging at the end of the game that I stood up and screamed, ""THAT'S IT?"" at my screen like a crazy person. I think recommending this game will send the wrong message. It's not alright to end a game in the half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥way Broken Age ended, even if it started out like the dream adventure game everyone's been waiting for for 17 years. Double Fine should've just admitted that the 3,3+ million dollars they raised from Kickstarter was nowhere near enough to finish a complete game and split it into parts that can then be funded separately. I certainly wouldn't mind paying more for Act 2 if it didn't turn out to be the lazy, convoluted mess that was the Act 2 we received bundled with Act 1.			"

												I haven't finished it yet but Act 2 is not very good at all so far. What the hell happened? The puzzles suck and involve a ton of backtracking through mostly recycled but slightly altered environments from Act I. It seems they took the criticism of Act 1 being 'too easy' too literally and decided to bring back the worst puzzles from the old point and clicks. Maybe it was supposed to be some kind of jab at the critics but all it did is make the game worse. So good job with that.I can only stand to listen to the same dialog so many times as I try every god damned combination to solve some inane puzzle. I can't play more than an hour at a time before getting bored. I can't really recommend the game like this. There are other much more fun adventure games available on Steam.As a backer this is super disappointing though not really surprising given how late and over budget this went.

												Story is well done, but the game itself has no fluidity to it.The first half is incredibly easy and takes no time to really do. The second half is incredibly hard and takes quite a bit longer to do. The second half has certain puzzles that are just mind-boggling how you are supposed to think those things should happen, or you have to do them in such an order, that if you don't do it perfectly correctly, or forget one step, it resets you quite a ways back and doesn't just set you back one step...Not to mention, the budget was poorly handled in terms of game-length and voice actors, and how long it took the second half to actually come out...I was excited for this game, but it let me down in every fashion other than hearing specific voice-actors, and a decently written story (albeit a short one at that).

												Overall I think the game is great (on sale). After playing through it I was browsing some threads and saw all tha hate against Act II... and all I have to say to that is ""quit whining already"". Sure Act II was a bit more crazy than Act I, but it was still a fun point and click puzzle adventure. Some great lines, some nice writing, and decent reactionary events.I only got stumped once, on the boots puzzle, until I broke out pencil and paper and figured it out. I wasn't expecting to have to actually jot down notes, which caught me off guard. But, needing notes was nothing like say, Myst level note requirements! Broken Age was very casual in its execution, and a cute game.Anyhow, take it for what it is, fun little game, easily spend about 10 hours in it if you don't let Achievement OCD ruin it for you.			"

												After a year of waiting time, the second act of Broken Age finally arrived! Unfortunately it has not been worth the wait in my eyes. These are the main reasons for me not to recommend:REASONS TO BUYAct 1:- Beautiful artwork- Gorgeous soundtrack- Superb voice cast - one of the best I've seen in a video game up to this point- Interesting characters and narrative focus on the ""broken age"" of two teenagersAct 2:- You get to know what happens after Act 1REASONS NOT TO BUYAct 1:- The puzzles are pretty boring- No one really listens to you (That may be part of the story though)Act 2:-The puzzles are difficult but annoyingly repetitive; obvious answers are often wrong; some puzzles can only be solved by randomly repeating steps in different order- No new places- Absurd story line that connects to the events of Act 1, but not to it's message Why would they replace the wolf by an Alien? This concept is not further explored in the ongoing game either.- Still nobody listens to you or is at least somewhat interested in other people. While there may be a narrative reason for doing so in Act 1, it makes all kinds of conversation flat and uninteresting in Act 2 (story wise at least - there are still some funny characters, such as the talking tree, whom I enjoyed talking with.)CONCLUSIONBuy in a Sale, to enjoy the overall atmosphere of Act 1. Don't waste your time with Act 2 though.			"

												This game could have been so much more, but on the whole it falls a bit flat. The puzzles suffer from what is commonly called ""adventure game logic,"" meaning they were horribly designed, and the solutions only make sense to an insane person. You will back-track a lot. Like, all the time. There are also only a handful of unique areas to the game, which makes the game feel repetitive. Additionally, there is no hint system to be found, so the game is best played in a relatively short time-frame.What I do like about the game is the humorous dialogues and the overall art style. The few unique environments present are colorful and vibrant, and the rough painted aesthetic is pleasing to me. Some of the dialogues are extremely repetitive, such as ""I don't want to fork that"" and other failed interaction lines, though on the whole I enjoyed a lot of the jokes.I am really close to recommending this game, because I did have fun and the game is very charming. However, I feel it is simply not worth the price it is being sold for currently. Unless you are a die-hard Double Fine fan, I would recommend waiting for a sale.			"

												I'd like to give this a ""so so"" rating, but I only see ""Yes"" and ""No"" buttons, so... I'll rate according to the sour taster after playing this.I loved the art (the character design is fantastic IMO), the music, and some of the history. Not so much the acting, which I think is hit or miss (to me, the spoon and knife are better characters than Elijah Wood's... whose acting I found wooden) The ending sucks, I think. It smells like ""We ran out of money, that's it"".I think the criticism towards the second act is fair, it doesn't make any sense to have Shay do some actions ""interacting"" with Vella, without each other knowing what the other is doing. Also, the first act feels like a modern game (and kind of easy), but you are never prepared for what's to come on the second act: ""Here, there you have this non sensical contrived puzzles"".I mean, when you already did the puzzles they may look like more logical, but YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE NOTES (or at least take some pictures with your phone). You are never advised to do so. What the ♥♥♥♥, this is not 1989.I'm not against some challenging puzzles, and it's good to have some ""Aha!"" moments, but I think some of the last puzzles were far too contrived. Well, I don't know, play it if you want, but I expected something better.7/10 would use a guide.			"

												I was worried that somewhere between Brutal Legend and managing an entire studio for Trenched, Tim Schafer had lost whatever ""it"" is necessary to write a clever, funny, adult adventure game. I was a ♥♥♥♥ing fool, because Broken Age shows Schafer and the entire Double Fine team are in top form. The art is beautiful, the music is enchanting, and the dialogue is witty and well-crafted. VO work is handled by a group of voice acting stars who push you into not just feeling for your character, but acting in a way that shows you feel what they'd feel. I'm halfway through the scheduled two acts, and I can already tell that my sole regret will be that this game won't last longer -- no matter how long it ends up being. So maybe this review sounds overblown. But if you've ever enjoyed a LucasArts adventure game, this should not be missed.			"

												What an enormous disappointment.Act 1 was enjoyable though perhaps not as great as I had hoped. And I had read that Tim Schaffer, lead designer, had said that people should replay Act 1 before playing Act 2 so that you don't forget all the callbacks.And I did. What a terrible waste of time.Act 2 throws away so many story elements that made Act 1 intriguing. And so making me play Act 1 *again* and then tossed aside a bunch of the story felt like a complete betrayal. And the sad thing is that Act 2 retroactively makes Act 1 feel much worse... because all of the intriguing setups have terrible payoffs and therefore make the setups no longer enjoyable in retrospect.Act 2 is like the Matrix sequels. Matrix 2 didn't seem that horrible until Matrix 3 came out. If Matrix 3 had been amazing, people would remember Matrix 2 somewhat fondly. But since Matrix 3 was terrible, people simply wish The Matrix had never got a sequel at all.I guess this is my roundabout way of saying that I wish Broken Age didn't get made and I hadn't wasted my time playing it. This game is a big reason why I stopped using Kickstarter. Don't buy.			"

												Disappointing game. The characters are very flat and uninteresting, the story is poorly written, the voice acting is emotionless. I mean, I didn't manage to care for my protagonists even by the end. Some of the NPCs were more interesting, and had more character to them, which is pretty bad.The overall plot is very weak, and it's never fully explained even in the obligatory Evil Boss Monologue. And it's not the suspenseful kind of unexplained, but the ""wait, that does not make sense"" kind, like the writers were too lazy to make up the proper background. Just like Shay's robot parents, who turn out to be his real, flesh and blood parents, and yet no longer interact with him directly. We even see a family picture showing this has been otherwise, yet Shay seems to be genuinely surprised to see that they are human. Why did they stop seeing him in person? Why doesn't he remember? There are no answers, and there is no narrative point to make. It's just random, like much of the plot.Other than that, many of the puzzles are more tedious than exciting, and the level design forces you to travel back and forth over an area, without any map or quick-travel feature. Again, tedious.Also, a whole unavoidable conversation back and forth elaborating on stool jokes. Not funny. At all. I actually cringed. And it was as much out of character for Vella as she has character.The only plus point is could say is that the robot puzzles in the last part of the game by utilizing different patterns was actually clever and inventive.

Hell,I'd have been fine with just a glorified Flash game as far as visuals were concerned. And on that,BA delivers,unfortunately. It really does look like a glorified Flash game.What I was really looking forward to was the humor and a fun story. With games like Psychonauts and Brutal Legend under their belts,I expected fun dialogue and insightful commentary. What I got was a cold read through and a bland story that basically rips off Destroy All Humans.Met Shay and Vella. These 2 robots are the lead characters. Voiced by Elijah Woods and Masasa Moyo. You should probably know who Elijah is and what he can do,but as far as Moyo goes,she played Candy in Arkham Origins where she at least did a decent job of voice acting. Here,they're both so boring,so bland,so completely without any passion or character,it's mind numbingly insane. Even the great Jack Black,well known for not holding back in any of his performances and voiced Eddie Riggs in Brutal Legend,is just so dull. It's like they had the joy sucked out of them. These are not amatuers and there's really no excuse for turning in performances this soul crushingly bland.Being saddled with these 2 lumps of blah would be bad enough,but the story is a forced march through cliches and twists so predictable they have no real turns at all. You'll pretty much guess the plot within seconds of the motivations of a character being questioned. And the whole thing could have been avoided had anyone in the cast shown an ounce of common sense. Not just the main characters,any one.The jokes are so bad,so devoid of any real humor. I didn't even register them AS jokes half the time until a character laughed. The whole thing is just boring and dull and most of my time sitting there playing was wishing the whole thing was over with and that there'd be some kind of pay off.And at the end of it all,there isn't. The heroes are the heroes and the villians are the villains and at the end of it all,everyone is friends. Good god. Just ""hey,all's forgiven even though you tried to kill us several times."" And this♥♥♥♥♥♥was from the same people who gave us Psychonauts! And Brutal Legend! Games with fun stories and relatable characters and funny dialogue. I just don't even wanna think about what this means for Double Fine.I'm just done. ♥♥♥♥ Tim,♥♥♥♥ Double Fine,♥♥♥♥ this game.			"

												A fantastic adventure game and one of the best games I've seen from Double Fine, period. It might be worth waiting for the second part of the game to arrive before picking the game up, but the content that's there is fantastically done and the act ends at an incredibly good cliffhanger that sets off some fantastic implications about previous parts of the game.

												Yes, the art is great, the soundtrack is great, the story is great, but the actual gameplay itself wasn't very fun at all. This feels like it should have been a movie and not a videogame. You are almost always locked into one path. It didn't feel like an adventure at all- there's no real danger. Also it's very short. I definitely can't reccommend it until Act 2 comes out.1) The game doesn't explain itself. Especially in the Vella story, I got through all the puzzles by clicking on things in my inventory randomly. Also, at one point in the Vella story you come to a puzzle that can only be solved by an object from much earlier in the game that, at the time, you didn't actually need to have. I ended up having to go all the way back for it. Then there's also the part with the snake that blocks the path. There's no way to get past the snake. It's basically an invisible wall. But I didn't realize this, so I spent a good amount of time trying to get past the snake because I thought that that was how I was meant to progress.2) Yes, I get that there will be a second part, but even with all the wandering pointlessly and clicking randomly that I did, I still beat the game (both storylines) in 5 hours. Again, half of that time was spent wandering around between the beach and the woods. I beat the game the same day that I bought it.3) Maybe this game isn't supposed to work this way, but there's no way to lose the game. When you finally confront Mog Chothra at the end of Vella's story, you can stand on the beach as long as you want, and even when Mog Chothra finally grabs you, you just dangle in front of its closed mouth for a minute until Vella frees herself automatically or you do something. There is absolutely no pressure on you to do anything. Take your time.			"

												No, not yet anyway (unless you buy it on sale). There's absolutely nothing wrong with the game. Everything from the story to art to voice acting is perfect. My issue is that it (consisting of a single Act with a cliffhanger ending at the time of this writing) is too short to justify the $25 I spent on the game.			"

												This is not a game. It's an interactive story. Don't expect to have to use any brain power to get through it. You basically just need to point and click where the cursor changes, and whenever that isn't enough, start fiddling with the stuff in your inventory. You'll never have more than five or six items at a time, so simple trial-and-error will suffice.If it took any creativity or knowledge to get through it, I might have enjoyed it more. But as it is, I really didn't feel like I got my money's worth. Actually, I wouldn't like it anyway, because it contains one of the cheapest, stupidest, most overused plot devices ever invented, which I cannot mention without getting beat up for spoilers.			"

												The best part of this game is the story, the ends feels more like a cliff hanger though. Get it for the story, and the puzzles ine the first act, but not the second.Worst puzzles ever in the Second Act. The only hint is in the family picture. The Wires on the back are no help what so ever with where the wires should go, and don't bother looking up wire patterns they are all randomized. Who would have thought looking at a family picture would be a right off hand a clue... There were a lot of things you never would have thought of so far in the Second act it's so... SO frustrating! While the 1st Act was prefect, the Second Act felt so sloppy, like they made it with the full intentions of knowing people would look for a hint online instead of better made hints inside (the hints in game in the second act are barebones).If you are human you play a game you pick one side and finish it, then switch, with this game it won't let you know you have finished one side until you are 100% frustrated with clicking and on everything, and you look it up... It was time to switch, wtf didn't just switch for me when you came basically to the dead end until you played the other side further?			"

												A lot of people are complaining about the kickstarter, and how much money they made from it and I only half agree to this.First of, I think the game is great. Some people call it low budget assets, I call it beautifull artwork. It gives the game a certain vibe (no not the low budget vibe), a bit like it is hand drawn and animated paper. The puzzles are clever for most of the game and I only sometimes ran in to the run X on everything problem due to developers logic. The story is great and it is nice that you can play both characters stories at the same time. First I was afraid it would spoil the other story if I played them one at a time, but this was not the case and the end result was satisfying. It also played great on my Surface with touchscreen only so this is also a plus.Now on to the Kickstarter issues. These are mostly centered around 2 things: money and time.First the time issue: this game has been out for almost a year and there is still no part 2. I completely agree on this point that it is unacceptable. The game is currently fairly short, and I have no illusions that part 2 will be any longer. Due to this part two should have been out a half year ago at the latest. I agree that it feels that time is spent elsewhere while the Kickstarter made enough money to do this in a relatively short time.Then the money issue: people feel that not all the Kickstarter money is being spent on this game. Well, that might indeed be the case. Aside from the issue with the game not being finished yet, I don not agree with the comments that the game should have been different. The way I see it they have made what the Kickstarter promised and the rest of the money is profit. I don't think they should be obligated to spend it on this game, if they build another game from that money I'm not complaining. Should you buy this game? If the above video looks like it's your thing then yes. If it's on sale, then you really should.			"

												Oh jeez. What happened between Act 1 and Act 2, Double Fine? I mean, aside from the year-long wait, of course.Act 2 was notably less enjoyable than Act 1. Where Act 1 felt whimsical, fresh, funny... Act 2 felt frustrating, obtuse, stale. Yes, sure, Act 1 had its fair share of problems. Shay's side in Act 1 was very monotonous, for example, but overall Act 1 was good. But Act 2 overall just... isn't. Act 2 introduces a lot more puzzles, except they're all extremely difficult and frustratingly obtuse. Some of the puzzles in Act 2 directly reference and are parallel to similar puzzles from Act 1. The only problem is, Act 2 launched OVER A YEAR LATER. By the time I played Act 2, I had forgotten everything I had done in Act 1, including prior puzzle knowledge.Without getting into spoiler territory, the ending and lead up felt very lukewarm. The big reveal kind of fell flat, and it was mostly in the way it was presented. There wasn't really a sense of accomplishment. The story as a whole basically gets swept under the rug in Act 2, after all these plot developments and hooks in Act 1. All the questions are pretty much just handwaved away, leaving even more questions and a bunch of plot holes. So... 3.3 million dollars and 3 years later for a 10 hour game, with a year in between the releases of Act 1 and 2... And it's honestly just not worth it. I actually feel bad not recommending this game, as I did enjoy it... mostly... But then I look at it as a whole and the disappointment sets in. Grab it on a sale, I guess. The writing is funny, the characters are great, the 2nd half of the game sucks and overall it's pretty meh. But you might get some enjoyment out of it anyway. I just wish Double Fine did better.Really, the big question is, where did the money go?			"

												If you are looking at this game as ""Adventure GAME of Double Fine"", you are mistaken.It is ""A mediocre STORY, which includes just 3 or 4 puzzles""I love adventure games. And I respect that there are different styles of adventure games. Monkey Island, Longest Journey, Walking Dead, etc, all great games with their own styles.Some of them are more funny, some have cool puzzles and some have better stories. But Broken Age is bad in all of them; humor, puzzles and story.If you can click the left button of the mouse, you'll probably finish the game easily. I'm sure you know the feeling that, you can't leave the game because you just want to finish one more level/puzzle and end up staying awake until 4am. You won't get that feeling with this game. No where near it.I LOVE Double Fine. That's why I bought this game even with bad reviews. But at the end, didn't like it. "

Though appearing childish, the dialogue and surroundings have some great subtextual themes that anyone can get into. When one story gets a little monotonous you can just switch to the other. First episode is only about 3.5 hours but so worth it... With the expectation that something else would be coming out.Though when the second episode comes out... I can't imagine paying the same thing for it. It should absolutey be included free if you bought the first. Now I had a good time with the game, but paying $25 for half a game... just bad business.

												Sweet jeesus, what the hell guys? This game is not worth the praise it's gotten just because it's, at best, ok. I don't really care for point and click games that much, but even I've played way better - what the hell have you guys been playing?YEAHYEAH the music is good, the art is neat in it's own way blahblahblah. The voice acting is decent (save for the ultra-mousey and annoying as hell Vella) but I expect that with the cast that's on it. 3 million dollars you accomplished that much - congratulations.First off, I wasn't expecting to beat this in about 5 hours, that's bad. I know it's in two acts, but we're sitting at 10 hours play time total? And I was lazy while playing it since I was bored by the ""amazing"" story.Revolutionary? By no means. I mean, how is this at all advancing or re-defining the genre? I get that there's not a lot of point-and-click titles, filled with crap like Anna and Gone Home... but if you think this game changes anything for the better, you just aren't familiar with the genre. At all. Maybe that's why everyone keeps gushing out the word ""nostalgia"" - as if boasting about rarely playing a genre makes you a better game reviewer. Honestly, you can get the Deponia series for cheap thru the frequent semi-annual sales on steam, and all three acts are good games on their OWN, you don't even need all three. They are filled with at least 10-12 hours *per chapter* and with more interesting and inventive puzzles and game mechanics. You know what else you get as opposed to this game? An interesting story, amusing dialogue, and much better characters. I cannot see anyone playing the Deponia series and coming out praising Broken Age. This is just very boring pretty fluff.			"

												(a recommendation written after completing the full game)+ Awesome graphics. Good choice of character models and I enjoyed the warm color palets and brushy textures.+ Great voice acting. Some dialogues and stereotypes are really enjoyable. It made me giggle, occasionally.+ Huggable technology never gets old. Neither do cranky old trees or talking spoons.+- Some of the more technical puzzles can get a little bit repetitive or frustrating, but I liked figuring out the patterns quite a bit nevertheless. Hell, I worked myself through the Myst series, this was a less then a cakewalk in comparison.+- Story is fun and somewhat original (not going to spoil anything here), but not every element has gotten enough attention to be explained in a satisfying way. Could have done with a little more elaboration towards the end of the game.- The adventure puzzles are often too simple though. There’s always too little objects or set piece details to interact with or even just look and comment at to really get into that old school adventuring feel. - A wider variation of locations would have been welcome as well. I didn’t get the feeling I have seen enough of this world; I had been stuck in interiors for the most of the time instead, especially towards the end. While I very much enjoyed my time inside I was kinda hoping to see a bit more of the outside world nevertheless. Compare this game to Grim Fandango, Sam & Max Hit The Road or even Monkey Island 1 & 2 and you’ll know what I mean.In conclusion: YES, this game was well worth the wait for me. I’m never in a rush to play a game with so many old games still unfinished, so I didn’t mind the delay all that much. I don’t regret backing it up and I would recommend it to any adventure game lover out there. If above points or the way this backer project has went down don’t bother you too much, buy it. And don’t forget to put a pen and paper on your desk while playing.			"

I was amazed all the time how well everything was made, until I realised that the game was allready over. The ""puzzles"" weren't puzzles.

												Where do I begin, I'd like to start by saying, I would, without a second thought, recommend this game to anyone that loves stories, beautifully inspiring artistic graphics, and both fun, humorous and at times mind wrenching puzzle click based games.ACT1 of Broken Age is, to put it bluntly, a work of art. It has humor, soul, depth, absolutely breath taking graphics and a story line that is as rewarding to follow through as any top selling novels out there! What sets this game apart from others, is not only the story line, the graphics, but its ability to skip from purely hilarious story telling to dark almost brutal and thought provoking moments. Act 1's story is purely amazing. It's a duel story game where you can switch from playing as Vella, a young girl who refuses her fate as a sacrificial meal to a horrifying creature, or as Shay, a young, over sensitive and  somewhat lonely cosmonaut who may very well be the last human alive. The story line and script in general is jam packed with hilarious references and pure comedy gold that had me giggling all the way through...but there was more. What caught me off-guard with Broken Age was how deep the story would go into topics of loneliness, self-discovery and sacrifice too. From a game-play standpoint I loved the duel story-line modes because you could be playing as Vella and get stuck on a puzzle needing a little timeout, you could instantly jump into Shay's world and continue the other story line for a fresh perspective on the other puzzles later on.No amount of words or compliments can actually describe how beautiful this game is, it's like your all time favorite comic book or coloring book come to life on the pages right before your eyes as the story is being told. The worlds are massive, creative, inspiring, and the experience of playing as either Vella or Shay is memorable to say the least.Now the much awaited review on Act2... let me start off by saying that the universe you find yourself hurled into in Act2 (which picks off right after the insane cliffhanger of Act1) is as beautiful and inspiring as Act1! Everything you loved graphically is right there, only it'll take you twice as long to get through it all than before, so more eye candy and heart warming moments to enjoy! New characters, crazy puzzles, and the most unexpected story line yet!The main difference in Act2 is that, the universe is the same..I know, i said difference, that's because you expect to explore more beautiful worlds, only you sort of backtrack to all the places you've already been to as you meet new characters and the story yet again develops into this fantastic tale of inspiring goodness! While I would have loved for an opportunity to explore even more cities and places, I was more than happy with how things went because the characters kept me on my toes and interested the whole time!The puzzles in Act 2 are at times super super super hard, and by super hard I mean Grrrrrr!!!!! hard!!!! Almost to the point of leaving me with a strange feeling that someone didn't think a particular puzzle through all the way, and some took far too long to complete, but overall I can't complain, the experience gained by solving them and playing Act 2, as well as all the fun I had, just made up for every moment of frustration! Act 2 wraps up the beautiful story and I can only say this was a gaming adventure I'll truly cherish! To all my friends and those reading this trying to make up their minds, trust me, this game is truly worth it if you're into this genre! If you have any questions leave a comment or add me to chat I would be more than happy to help you further!			"

												I did have a positive review at one point...  I did.  But ever since Double Fine missed the ship date for the 2nd half of the (pretty short) game by almost 9 months, having an incomplete game from paying so much money, being proven that the devs don't know♥♥♥♥♥♥about managing money (even I cannot believe I'm agreeing with Bobby Kotick), not bothering to complete the game (especially seeing the stories of the Space Base one), and then Tim Schaffer not only coming out as pro-corruption\anti-GamerGate, but also agreeing with Anita Sarkeesian of Feminist Frequency in a video saying that there is such a thing as ""male priviledge"" and I'm oppressing women because of it.

												I enjoyed the story and the twist at the end of act one. The art and voice acting are really gorgeous and top notch. However, there are some major problems with the game including the rather rushed ending that doesn't really makes sense (I mean how does Yay bridge = Yay defeated the overlords?) and that act two finale includes some truely impossible feats of logic to beat. I would have never completed this game without a walk through and that's pretty frustrating. Still overall, it kept me occupied for 10hours and I had fun.			"

												Everything about this game is awesome, and it was well worth the wait. - Music is great- Puzzles are fairly challenging at times- Voice acting is very enjoyable and funny :D- Loved the art work and style of the game- There are lots of things to see through multiple play-throughs such as different dialogue you may have missedIf you like these time of games then I think you'll love it, if not don't get it. If you are upset it too so long to come out just know it was time well spent instead of being rushed. This is a lovely game and I recommend it highly :D hope this was helpful to you. I can't wait to play through it again and get all the achievements this time!			"

												Don't believe the naysayers, this is an excellent, fully voiced and animated AAA adventure with a special sense of humor that lasted me 14 hours.Like Peter Molyneux's ""Godus"", Tim Schafer's ""Broken Age"" gets dissed by a lot fo fans who supported it on Kickstarter. As with Godus, I set out with the expectation to find out if its detractors are right, or if the game is being unjustly treated. I didn't like Godus, but Broken Age delivers all that I want. Note that I never played the unfinished game.All puzzles are logical and have the clues needed to solve them available at all times, though they can be difficult to find or to figure out. Perservere! I got stuck 3 times and in hindsight wish I had perservered, I was never far from making the final connection that would have let me figure it out myself. It definitely has that old-school adventure feeling.You get to control two characters, Shay and Vella, who are separate at first, but in act 2 you have to learn to coordinate their knowledge in order to progress. The way the initially separate storylines have been intertwined is quite original!Conclusion: I'd say I disagree with pretty much every criticism of this game that I've read so far, except that the ending would've been more awesome if the events hinted at via the vignettes set into the credits were fleshed out more.

												While I enjoyed Act 1, the story in Act 2 was atrocious and the puzzles were about as much fun as performing cosmetic surgery on myself with a claw hammer.Act 2 creates plot holes, resolves absolutely nothing, requires the player to break the fourth wall (solutions to Shay's problems must be found by Vella and vice versa with no communication between the two of them). It also seems to undermine much of the plot from Act 1.The ending makes no sense; I cannot fathom why Vella or Shay would feel compelled to do what they have to do, especially since they cannot come up with a plan or tell each other what they need to do. It resolves absolutely nothing, and is in general so half-done it seems like this was meant to be a bridge for a third Act. But it's not, this was the end.Terrible. Not worth the wait, and definitely not recommended.			"

												A very well done game, with a perfect dificulty curve and cleverly thought out puzzles. The dialauge is very natural sounding, with an all star voice cast to boot. The charachters personalities are hilariously quirky, yet still down to earth enough that they dont seem overly silly. The artwork is masterfully done, perfectly capturing the feel of a picture book while also taking the look to new levels of beutiful. Either story in Act One alone is interesting enough that they could just be sold as seperate games, and the twist ending brings up very interesting questions and answers ones you didnt know you should be asking. It's clear that when the game is finished, the story will sit beside Tim Scaffers earlier work on Grim Fandango as one of the adventure game greats.			"

												This is a review for the final game. There are two ways you can look at Broken Age. One, is to see it as just the product it is upon final release. The other, is to see it as the experiment in Adventure gaming that it was. I'll be looking at it both of these ways, separately.As a piece of gaming SoftwareBroken Age is low on bugs, fluid and fast. The art style is interesting, and the voice acting holds up well. While there are a few hiccups and inevitable bugs, Broken Age is a polished-feeling product in the end, that feels very solid.Being an adventure game, one of the biggest parts of the title will be the story. The story is strong for the first half of the game, though through the second half it has issues maintaining tension once it resolves some of the lingering questions introduced in Act 1. For story reasons my recommended play order is Shay, Vella,  Vella, Shay, until you reach the finale.Unfortunately the problem with having a free switching mechanic when it comes to narrative is losing control of pacing. By letting the player choose to jump in an out at any time, you do let them escape a puzzle to rest for a bit when they are stuck, but you lose any semblance of control over story pacing for the majority of large arcs unless you design around it. This is particularly evident in Act 2, where depending on who you choose, something is immediately revealed, or held off as a surprise much later. In my opinion, the latter was much better executed.Finally, as a adventure game, the last part is the gameplay and puzzles. The game plays as a very simplified point and click adventure title. With no on-screen highlighting of items, selectable actions, and limited inventory, it is up to players to investigate and locate nearly every object they need. This is not Monkey Island, where two pages of items and 50 things to interact with could baffle you for a time. In this regard, it is fine, though finding a balance is difficult and quite often, solutions seem rather obvious because your inventory at the time is never larger than 5 items on average. This is compounded by a few puzzles that felt padding. Some will require a piece of paper to take notes perhaps, or screenshots, but there are a few that simply require a few attempts before you will solve them, and being required to shuffle to the information and back to the problem, feels lengthy.Conclusions?As a product, I would give Broken Age a recommendation, with caveats. It's solid, it's pretty, and it's silly. But it's not going to make you feel terribly clever too often, and the story is good, but loses control of it's pacing. A worthwhile addition to the library, but not the crown gem of the genre.As a project and experiment?Broken Age is a resounding success, period. Double Fine delivered on every promise of their Kickstarter campaign in spades, providing a game much larger and longer in scope than most could have hoped for, and with a very high production value. This was done using their own funds, and by giving up all their profits from Act 1. The engine and mechanics all work great, and the product fantastically proved that Adventure gaming is not dead at all. There is plenty of potential for other games like this to take off, and for Double Fine to be one of those making them. If you feel their vision grew too big or the game tried for too much, that is your right. But the promise was only ever for a Tim Shafer Adventure Game and a documentary of how it was made, and backers received exactly that. Double Fine never went back and asked for more money. Instead of doing that when faced with the project failing, or proceeding, they used their own resources and IP to double down on the project to finish it, funneling company funds from all other sales into this. In the end, it may make them some money over the long term, but until completion it was most certainly a labor of love.			"

Act 2 is way better than Act 1First of all: don't watch a single episode of Double Fine Adventure! before playing this! I've read in the forums that I could watch up to episode 14 before playing Act 1, but I got some minor and medium spoilers.Well, Broken Age is a game designed by Tim Schafer, known for some adventure games like Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, and Grim Fandango. The game was funded on KickStarter with about $ 3.5 million when they had pledged only for $ 400k. The whole production process is involved in a lot of controversy, and I won't get into details here. The only important thing to point out is that Broken Age is divided in two Acts (the second Act also has a shorter ""finale"" which some people call Act 3), and that Act 1 was rushed out for financial reasons, and I think it affected its quality.Anyway, I'll list the most distinguised aspects of the game (good or bad) below:👍 The story is solid, well-woven and not something I'll forget anytime soon.👍 Different from a lot of games known for their awesome plot twists, Broken Age's plot isn't obvious. There were a lot of jaw-dropping moments for me, which are always nice.👍 I can see this game appealing to a very broad age range (despite what other people say). Of course, it won't reach all audiences, but it's not age-related, even though it's a ""coming-of-age"" story.👍 Most of the puzzles are really smart and just hard enough to give you that little frustration that makes puzzles interesting, but not too hard that makes you rage-quit (I beat the game without any help, btw). This applies especially to Act 2. You definitely get those eureka moments.👍 The level of the hints the game provides you is also spot on (again, mostly on Act 2).👍 Characters are interesing, fun to interact with and talk to, and have very distinguished personalities.👍 Voice-acting is really good, which brings even more life into the game.👍 There's a lot of extra additions to the game that really brings flavor into it. There are many things you can try out that will result in unique reactions, even if they don't help you advance in the game (a lot of them don't even provide hints). And that's a lot of work that really makes a considerable difference in your gameplay experience.👍 Graphics are stunningly beautiful--just take a look at the screenshots. Very good hand-drawn art.👍 BGM is also memorable. I even caught myself humming one or two songs when I wasn't playing the game.± While it's a good game, there's a lot of unexplored potential. I know you can only ask so much and that's not a bad thing per se, but it makes you wish you had more.± Playing with two different characters is a really nice aspect of the game. But I wish the game would explore that a bit more, making me go back and forth between stories more often (I beat Vella's Act 1 not switching even once to Shay). On Act 2, you'll need to switch between characters a few times, but they're still rare occasions.± I've played the whole game bug-free on my PC, but some people report a few bugs, especially in other platforms, so I thought it was worth mentioning it here.👎 A few of the puzzles were illogical (like the two characters sharing information via the player's mind -- in other words, for example, Vella learns something, you as the player learns that as well and have to use that information to help Shay, even though there's no way Shay could've known that), but those were excepetions to the rule.👎 Act 1 was way too easy. It was more like a story than an adventure game. More like a prelude, even. It made me question the quality of the game while I was going through it, but as soon as it ended, everything changed for me (for the better, of course).Basically, if you're an old-time adventure game fan, don't take critics on Act 2 too seriously. If you can handle some frustration of not immediately knowing the answer to a puzzle (and resist the temptation to look up the answer somewhere), then you'll enjoy this game, especially act 2.			"

												I had been sitting on Broken Age since it was released, however I didn't want to play it until all the episodes had been released (two). Finally earlier this year the second episode finally came out. Broken Age is a point-and-click game. The game features two characters, each located in different worlds. You can switch between the two characters at any time you want at the click of a button, other than this; the characters don’t have any real interaction. It has all the usual adventurey type things such as an inventory and very good dialog options. The game looks absolutely gorgeous, animations are all done brilliantly too. Music and voice acting is all top notch.As with most point and click games, you have to have some nicely put together puzzles, and Broken Age certainly delivers, they aren't so hard that you are stuck for hours trying to work it out, but they aren't so easy that you can do it without thinking. I won't spoil anything with regards to the story, but it is beautifully written, and the characters are some of the most likable I have ever encountered in a video game.This is one of those games you just have to have in your library, its fun and worth the time and adventure. Don't let other reviews discourage you from a good time!If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												I decided to give this game a try because of the artwork. It was your basic sort of puzzle solving game. The art is really great and the stories kinda-ish interesting, but the game didn't really hook me in terms of gameplay. Not unlike 'The Cave', which operated in a similar way and which I enjoyed a whole bunch. I honestly don't get why 'The Cave' and its puzzle solving was so enjoyable and this game's wasn't, but that's the way it is. In the end, I feel kinda bad for giving this game a thumbs down because it's really not THAT bad, but it didn't manage to be good enough to stay in my memory.			"

												Overall I recommend everyone pick this up if you are fan of puzzle games. It contains a high amount of polish and should give you a good 10 hours or so of gameplay. There are some flaws, but I found it to a challenging and fun experience. I think it works well to play it in small periods and take breaks so you do not get too frustrated. Pros:Graphics: Beautiful hand painted game. Each area and character looks distinct. Since they are all painted, the game will probably still look good years from now. Sound: Fully orchestrated score and high quality voice acting. The personality of the charcters come alive through their dialogue. The investments and time they spent on the music and voice acting really pays off, especially with the main characters. Gameplay: Game is point and click and functions with a vareity of controller options including touch screen. The standard game play is to travel to different areas and solve puzzles to further the game's plot. The puzzles start off fairly easy and progress in difficulty towards the end of the game. Most are fairly fun and can be solved by following established mechanics or using information from items/characters. A few near the end can frustate you, but even then the game tries to give you hints for these. So if you get annoyed, take a break and clear your head. There are some fun chemistry puzzles and ones that use SAT question like logic and even one that involve tree jokes. Near the end, I needed to take pictures of some of the clues, so have your phone or paper handy. Story: The story is fairly straightfoward and a bit flawed, but the characters and dialogue really shine. Vella is one of the best female protagonist I have seen in a game for a long time. Shay shows some nice growth throughout the game and brings a nice opposing view to the world compared to Vella. All the side characters are are fun to talk to and will make you laugh. In fact every side character feels unique and memorable. Some highlights for me include the tree , the space weaver, and vella's family. Cons:Gameplay: The puzzles are interesting, and the game tries to give you hints, but it can be inconsistent about it. One of the aspects I did not like is that its not always obvious when you cannot yet complete a task/puzzle. Some puzzles require other ones to be completed first before you can solve them. The game is not great in explaining this always, so you can feel like stuck and frustrated when trying to solve a puzzle when you simply need some item from another puzzle first. So dont focus too much on anyone puzzle, try switching characters and tasks from time to time. Some puzzles are great at giving you hints and even teleporting you where you need to go if you mess up, but others seem to only clue you in once. Stacking had a nice hint system that might be helpful in this game. I think several big site reviews are frustrated by the boot, knot, and wire puzzles. The wire one is probably the most challenging though the game does try to give you some hints. Graphics: There not many new areas in Act 2. Most of the places you visited in Act 1 you will see again in Act 2, but through a differing perspective. There are a few new places, but do not expect a lot of new art. All of the characters have new dialogue at least.Story: The story does not feel entirely complete. On the surface it works and is satisfying enough, but the game definitely leaves a lot of questions about the world and its history. The characters go through their arcs and complete their goals, but there is a lot left for the player to fill in.  It definitely feels like changes were made or story was cut for the sake of time/money. The final puzzle is fun to solve, but from a story perspective, it feels like the motivations could have been better explained.			"

												If you are the type of person that loves games for their story, then this game will be worth the price tag. Some people have given this game negative reviews not because the game is bad, but because the price wasn't right for them. Yes, the game can be completed over a single weekend and yes, the price is steep, but it's been nearly a year now and I still think about the storyline of this game. It has more charm and personality than Deponia (which is saying a lot) and gives an immense amount of feels despite the small package it comes in.At the very least, keep in mind that Part 2 of this game is coming out very soon and will be patched in for free. Maybe you'll want to wait until then to buy it, but if you wait, please keep away from any forums, videos, or comments talking about it.

												This game is very good, but not as good as Grim Fandango.Broken Age is a point and click adventure game by Tim Schafer, about two teenagers who live two seemingly different lives.  First there is a girl who has been chosen to be sacrificed to a monster but decides to fight back.  Second, is a boy who has been raised on a spaceship by an overprotective super computer, but now he wants more excitement in his life.The art style and environments are gorgeous and Imaginative, the characters you interact with are colorful and memorable, and the humor is well written.  The story, while not as good as some of Tim’s past work, is a pretty decent story with some interesting twists and turns along the way. And while I do believe the game’s ending does leave some questions unanswered, I personally found it satisfying.My personal problem with the game was that some of the puzzles felt a bit too cryptic. I felt like I was forced to find the solutions online, and after finding the solutions, it made me wonder how any normal person would figure them out without having to resort to a walkthrough.  It would have been helpful if the game had a hint button like they had in the Monkey Island special edition.  Despite this, it didn’t really ruin the experience for me.If you in the mood for a nice, charming, adventure game then I would recommend checking it out.  It may not be perfect, but is still an experience worth having.I give this game a 7.7/10. "

												Great first act, not quite as good second act, terrible ending (imo).Really becomes apparent that they ran out of money.First act is gorgeous and well written, a lot of fun to play.  The art style is amazing and the high quality voiceovers contribute greatly to the game.  The second act starts to fall apart as they reuse nearly all assets and locations from the first act, and resort to simple item swapping puzzles (fetch quests, effectively) across multiple characters and NPCs to stretch the length (seemingly).  The end of the second act, if you can even call it that, is about 5 minutes long and consists of several scenes of exposition and a fairly poorly explained 'ending', where you get little to no actual information about what is going on, just a brief explanation and then credits.The villain provides little to no motivation outside from one sentence as to why he is doing what he is doing, and even then, never explains at all why he has chosen the specific path he took to complete his action.  He exists almost solely as diabolus ex machina for the plot.  His motivation is unclear until the very end, and even then it seems completely weakly written.Save your $ unless this becomes extremely cheap.  There is no real pay-off at the end, you spend a lot of time getting excited about a few things that you never end up seeing and that never get explained, only to get a really short throwaway ending that exists solely to tie up one or two plot threads while leaving many, many others dangling.

												Coming from Double Fine, I admit I really, really wanted to like this game. And some parts are very easy to like - the gorgeous graphics and talented voice cast was always its strongest selling point. ""Broken Age"" sets up an interesting premise for Act I, which is then completely squandered in Act II, making the rest of the game's shortcomings all the more apparent. The writing and dialogue is disappointingly banal, the plotting is threadbare and as the game progresses the puzzles become increasingly clunky, illogical and repetitive. That may sound a bit harsh–don't get me wrong, ""Broken Age"" is not an entirely bad game–but it doesn't have much going for it beneath its lush visuals and it certainly did not fulfil my lofty expectations.

												I was one of the intial Kickstarter backers who helped it reach that magical 3.3 million funding bux.I had high hopes for this game after remembering Grim Fandango and recently replaying a lot of adventure games myself, as well as new the new ones.First I must say, for 3.3 million, I expected a lot more. The game when I played it had glitchy animations, graphics and overall felt rushed and unfinished. I can't even remember the music, or the voices. The level of polish and attention to detail I expected from the creator(s) of Grim Fandango just wasn't there. I can still recall Manny Calavera's voice, Glottis, the festival theme, the little jingles, and the rest of the strong characters in that game. That game made an impact on me which lasts to this day. Somewhere along the line, something got lost. Regarding the gameplay, the puzzles were a bit on the easy side, but at least they were a bit more straight forward and logical than some of the puzzles in Grim Fandango (The Petrified forest driving sequence almost broke the experience for me in comparison). Still, I was not pleased when I saw that this was it. I expected more.So for the price you are seeing, I will not recommend this game, and since it is only half the game still, I don't think I will ever recommend the game based on the fact that I was promised a full game and the developers backed off from that.

												I thankfullly got this game while on sale so this will not be a butthurt review of this wonderfully done game. Aside for the fact that the developers failed to live up to their backer's expectations, I find this game hauntingly gorgeus. Even if I did back this up with my own money, and they failed to deliver on time, I'd probably forget I ever funded it and when it finally reached my doorstep I have sweet litte surprise for me.Broken Age was done with taste. That's what I think of it. It might not appeal to 'gamers' in general or even hardcore ones puzzle-wise, length-wise, heck story-wise even; but I regard this game as a piece of art that was created with impeccable taste. The art, the music (original orchestra music? C'mon, gotta give them credit for at least that), inspired voice acting (I mean the cast is splendid), and innocent but captivating story all blend in to make a fun little game. I say little because with a story this simple and slow gameplay, it'd be painful if it lasts 12 or 13 hours.All in all I'll give this an 8.5/10.			"

												(this review isn't completely done yet, buuut it still might help you)Since the release of Act 2, some reviewers have written about Broken Age being a point&click heaven, while others seem to hate almost everything about it. I don't think it's perfect, but neither do I see a sharp decline in quality if compared to Act 1. Let me tell you why I think so (spoiler-free, of course):Act 1 has absolutely funny dialogue, bizarre characters and a twist at the end that once left me hungry for more, but it lacked clever puzzles. True, Act 2 doesn't have as many surprises when it comes to the story and yes, most areas you'll visit have already been established before, but its dialogue and its characters is still absurdly funny, and its puzzle design is absolutely great and much more challenging. Of course, the solutions to some puzzles are so creative that you might silently shout ""How the hell should I have known that?"" but COME ON, Monkey Island 2 wasn't all nicely logical either, and I'm not going to start talking about the puzzles from the Runaway series ;)I understand why critics might be disappointed in what Broken Age has turned out to be, but that is not because Broken Age would be a bad game - on the contrary, you feel the love that Double Fine have poured into it, and it's still one of the best adventures I've played in the last decade. Critics are polarised because people got too hyped. It happens.I think you will like Broken Age if... + you like the old LucasArts adventures or adventures in general + you enjoy the Schaferian sense of humour + you liked the other DoubleFine games for its dialogue, story, characters or artstyle (especially Psychonauts or Brütal Legend) + you haven't played Act 1 before and therefore are open to perceiving it as a whole game, not two separate partsI probably wouldn't recommend it if... - you love your adventure game puzzles completely rational - you hate revisiting old places - you're impatient when solving puzzles - you're expecting a five-act-blockbuster with a life-changing story			"

												My first introduction to Adventure games was way back (perhaps not as far back as some), to the days of ""Day of the Tentacle"". This led to a lifelong enjoyment of Point-and-Click Adventure Games, including King's Quest, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango, Deponia, Whispered World, etc. This game piqued my interest early, and I was VERY happy to back the project.As a Kickstarter backer, this game has met and exceeded my expectations. It's a well-developed throwback to the Adventure games of yesteryear and has a good amount of heart. The humor is on-target in almost all cases, and never groan-inducing. The animation is WONDERFUL, and the world is detailed and has a very Double Fine feel while still feeling fresh and new. There are a few spots where it feels as though the animation is not as fluid as others, but it doesn't interfere with the enjoyment.As for the gameplay, the puzzles aren't terribly hard, and make a good amount of sense if you take a moment to think. This is the game's strongest ally; many adventure games rely on randomly assembling/using objects to progress the plot. This does an excellent job of helping you through puzzles through clever dialogue writing and timeliness. No more carrying around 10 useless items for the duration of the game HOPING that one will be useful.This is easily one of my most favorite games of the year so far, and no Adventure fan's library will be complete without it. Bravo, Double Fine!			"

												I don't recommend this game at all and really it's not worth buying this game. Now don't get me wrong Broken Age is a refreshing point and click adventure game from Tim Schafer but what absolutely ruined this game was Act II of the story. Act I on the other hand was very enjoyable, the story was intriguing and I genuinly connected with the characters. The puzzles in Act I varied from simple to difficult but overall fun and exciting to solve which I thoroughly enjoyed. But DEAR GOD TIM SCHAFER, HAVE YOU NO SOUL FOR CREATING THE♥♥♥♥♥♥YOU CALL A STORY IN ACT II! The game was in my eyes a masterpiece until act II started. Just a reminder that act II took 1.5 years to release and in those 1.5 years we got the following:1.) No new characters2.) No new Environments3.) Plot hole filled storyand last but not least:4.) A piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥endingIf you wanted to even call it ending! the game ends with you having more unanswered questions then when you started! My Personal rating for this game 6/10			"

												It's pretty if you like the art style, not a massive fan of it myself but you can see how people would find it beautiful. Everything is a bit sparse, very few things to interact with.Puzzles are absurdly simple, there's a couple of odd leaps of logic as per standard but since you have such a tiny inventory and so few things to interact with it's hard to get stuck.  Given this was backed on the love of oldschool adventure gamers, this should've been way more of a focus.  Also for people who are used to exploring rooms you'll find a lot of dialog is out of place - your character is suddenly asking around about things they've not yet heard of.The two stories are charming but shallow, old adventure games were marketed at kids but the complexity of them was what made them stick.  This has none.It's hard to picture how DoTT had a budget of 600k, while they only managed half a game with a tiny fraction of the depth, with 3.3millionIn Act 2: Puzzles go from barely existing to frustratingly vague, random and even glitched to impossibility.  They don't even make sense, the two characters need to share knowledge on several occasions through the player, there is no possible way each could get the solutions the other needs to find out for them.  For one of them there is NO way to find out the answer, you have to just rely on the fact it's not the other 3 options and the game has given you a fourth out of the blue. A lot of the fail states are mind numbingly boring to reset - do it enough times and the game will actually step in and cut out some of the steps so it's not like they weren't aware the puzzles kinda sucked.I'm sort of imagining this is the backlash from everyone complaining act 1 was too easy, but there's a thing called balance and this is both of the worst ends of the spectrum.Story wraps up in record time - but still makes no sense - and then the finale is forced and anticlimactic, dialogue is much shorter, much less witty, character development is nil.  Revelations that should be earth-shattering and psyche-breaking are shrugged off in seconds. The ending not only doesn't make sense, it doesn't even solve anything.All in all if this were a quirky bargain bin game then sure pick it up, play for a bit and then forget. As a story it's a mess that clearly wasn't planned in advance. As a promised hark back to the old school games of yore, it's a nail in their coffin. This is not the game we backed.			"

												How could you go wrong with a game comming from Double Fine studio?  It's amazing in every aspect! Where should i start? The virusals.. the musical score.. the voice acting.. Just the very first scene of Vella waking up under a tree sets the tone for the rest of the adventure. It's enchanting. It's like watching your very first cartoons with children's eyes. There are quite enough puzzle, mostly very easy, but the adventure focusses more on the dialogues which you souldn't miss a single line as they are so well written and acted. Elijah Wood, Jack Black, Will Wheaton, ... even Pendleton Ward is in it :)  For the french speaking person i am not very much used to recognize english actors by their voice, i was surprised and pleased to recognize them in the game! The subtitles are very well translated, by the way. Really, it praises quality ... over quantity, which is the game's only downside. The game is very short (typical for point'n'click adventure games) and Act2 isn't even released yet, but it will be soon and for free. I just can't wait for it. Thanks Tim Schafer and Double Fine production. I knew from the start my money was on the right horse.			"

												A pretty terrible children's story full of walking on clouds, plot holes and ridiculous characters like maidens who want to be murdered. There is a lot to like here, the art and voice acting are all top notch.  The progression of puzzle difficulty as the game progresses is good but the puzzles themselves are never terribly interesting and are often silly or the last couple break immersion with characters knowing how to do things they shouldn't. Overall, pretty but stupid.  If you're just here for looks and Elijah Wood's voice then you might be able to stand the atrociously bad story, constant failed attempts at humor and uninteresting puzzles.  Well, probably not.

												Broken Age is a beautifuly crafted point & click adventure that challenges you to use a long lost tool vital to all human beings; logic. The absolutely stunning hand painted art style accompanied by whimsical and inspiring orchestrated music easily sets this game apart from many other adventure games within it's genre. Without a doubt, I would recommend this game to anyone who has the ability to think for themselves, and are yearning for a challenging game that won't hold your hand throughout the play-though.I also feel that I have to address the negative reviews that are slowly encroaching upon this wonderful game's reputation.A: I would have to agree that the second act is slightly lacking in the overwhelming epiphany department, in terms of the awe struck feeling it leaves you with at the end of act one, however, that shouldn't warrant people throwing the entire project under the proverbial bus as a result.B: As I previously stated in the introduction to my review, this game heavily relies on the players ability to utilize their personal logic and problem solving skills throughout the duration of the game. If you read the negative reviews, you will encounter a plethora of individuals complaining about the difficulty of particular puzzles, with which they defeated the purpose of the game by selling their own intelect short and merely looked up the answers. Once again, this game will not hold your hand, and assumes that YOU the player, actually has the ability to think for yourself via deduction and analysis of your surroundings.  C: Many gamers within the playerbase of this project constantly complain about plot holes and ""unexplained"" circumstances of intuition between Vella and Shay, as well as their overall importance to the Thrush. Within the second act, it's my personal opinion that players were too busy looking for things to hate about it, rather than actually paying any bit of noteable attention to conversational clues; albeit rather vague, but clues nevertheless. Tim Schafer himself has even explained some of these things within a post on the DoubleFine Forums, which you can read for yourself on this link: http://www.doublefine.com/forums/viewthread/16964/P25/#385125 -- 6 posts down.In conclusion,  everything is up to the player to decide, if you actually have the capacity to decide for yourself.

												This review is in regards to Act 1, since Act 2 is not available yet.Personally, I gladly recommend Broken Age, but I'm going to say right now that it's DEFINITELY not something that will fit everyone's gaming tastes. It's a point-and-click adventure, of course, but a very simple one; sometimes the only difficulty that arose was from temporarily looking over an item that needs to be used. I'm not sure if it's even possible to truly fail this game, to be honest. The game is short, simple enough if you pay attention, and doesn't particularly fall prey to the Sierra Logic issues that sometimes come with point-and-click games (Sierra games were infamous in particular for occasionally having puzzles with solutions that were so absurd, they didn't make sense). If you're looking for a complex puzzle game or something involving some combat, then you should look elsewhere.I recommend this game mostly on the merit of the story, music, and art style. If you've ever played Double Fine games before (Psychonauts comes to mind), then you'll have an idea of what sort of tone this game's story has. I enjoyed the characters and settings, short as everything was, and I'm glad I played it. I wish there had been more to do at least in some of the interactions, but considering this is part 1 of a 2-part game, I'm not going to hold it against the game.What this review basically comes down to is if you can like a game mostly for the story and style, then this may be good to look into. If you want a challenging sort of gameplay experience, though? It's probably not worth your time.			"

												For those of you expecting a return to the old-school point 'n click adventure games, you won't find it here. It's the genre reimagined for these modern times. This means the UI is optimised for tablets. No menu's, only one interaction prompt and drag & drop inventory. The level of interactivity is very poor as well, only essential objects can be highlighted. All really unintuïtive, so it'll take some time getting used to. Once and if you get over these modernisations the game will present itself as a charming adventure game. The artstyle is amazing, voice-acting superb and the music hits all the right notes. Though very enjoyable there's no crude humor like you'd expect from Tim Shafer, the whole thing seems rather harmless compared to the old days. Part 1 will only take about 3-4 hours to complete, because the puzzles aren't hard. You'll breeze through it, but at least that keeps the pacing going. It sets up part 2 to have some intruiging plot development and I'm excited to see where they take it.Pick it up if you havn't yet, this is one adventure you don't want to miss out on.			"

												A tenuous reccomendation from me. If you've played any adventure games in the last 10 years or so, Broken Age wont surprise you in any way. What is available in Act 1 is very well produced, and there are more than a few interesting spots to explore, but overall the worlds feel rather empty. There aren't a lot of random things to click on that aren't a part of the story, which is one of my favorite parts of any adventure game. You can try to combine some of the items to humerous effect, but that's pretty much it. It's a very straightforward and linear experience, and characters vanish as soon as they are no longer useful. It feels rushed storywise, which is insanity considering how long it's been since we all put down money on the Kickstarter. Of course, a story's beginning without its end is almost useless, so I can't be too hard on it right now. In any case, it is worth a playthrough, but I'm not sure that $25 is the right price, even with another half of the game yet to be released.			"

The Humour and Cleverness which Schafer and his team are synonymous for does not fail to disappoint, once again. The Art style is really what sets it apart from their previous games, this coupled with brilliant voice acting makes this a well backed game from my wallet (although the requirement for a… well, B-List Hollywood talent WOODn’t he be these days?…. wasn’t required – but HEY waddaya-gonna-do-with-the-extra-backerayola-cash-lol) and of course Schafer had to bring along his old buddy from Brütal Legend, which probably didn't cost him as much :)Without ruining the ending, the melding of both worlds - once both chacters are completed - is quite a nice touch and makes me hold on tightly for the next Act. Whilst it so far hasn't made as great of an initial impression to me personally as Cockroach Inks 'The Dream Machine', I would still rate (this Act at least) a quite capable 3.5/5 Stars. Let’s just hope the release of the Acts aren’t dragged out as much as those from the aforementioned Cockroach Ink team (but one could make reference to the funding comparisons between developers but one would not dare :).

												I seriously don't care what all the naysayers have to say about this game anymore.  It is well worth the wait!  I really appreciate its art style, I like the music and voice acting in this game (all twenty of the voice actors did a phenomenal job), and the puzzles are very memorable!  Double Fine stayed true to their word that the second act would be much tougher than the first!I was so glad I got to back the game, as well as beta-test it.  It was a joy to play a year ago, and it still is a joy today!  I would like it if Double Fine made more games similar to this one (Sam and Max next pls kthx). "

												I'm having mixed feelings about this game. I played Act 1 about a year ago and I waited patiently for Act 2 to come. The ending of first act left me with so many questions, I had a bunch of theories going on in my head and was super excited to see if I got it. Well, turns out I didn't. The story turned out to be a bit more predictable than I would've liked. Remember that ""Indoctrination Theory"" of ME3 that we all rooted for and then it didn't happen? Kinda like that, but on a smaller scale.I recommended this game wholeheartedly after act 1, and made several people buy it just cause my enthusiasm was all over the place. Now I'm a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it IS a good adventure game, the characters are funny pretty much all the time and you'll get your lols and you'll scratch your head at some puzzles. The art is amazing too. And the voice acting. But in the end, most of us adventure games lovers want a good story. Something unpredictable that will make you go ""aaaah!! ohhh!"" not ""oh, mmm okaaay"". And let's not forget the ending, which was abrupt and I kinda wanted a bit more closure instead of dem credits rollin' and me hatin'. I will recommend this game because it's a good one all things considered. It's just not as good as I had imagined. So probably if you don't get your hopes up you'll enjoy it more. But buy it on sale maybe?			"

												Act 1 of Broken Age is an incredible modern take on the Adventure game, with a fascinating story supported by quirky and hilarious characters. The puzzles are straightforward and prioritize progress over complexity-- not to the extent of something like Valiant Hearts, but just simple enough to never keep you bogged down.However, Act 2 is a disappointment. It more or less retcons some of the story ideas that made Act 1 so interesting, Furthermore, the puzzles become very tedious, and character growth halts.If Act 2 had lived up to its predecesor, I really think this could have been something. Instead, it's just another game that I played through and for the most part, enjoyed.			"

												I can't say how much I recommend this game. This game is literally the reason I got into gaming (I saw the NPR piece about it and I knew I had to get my hands on something that lovely). Story:The first half is fantastic story. In the documentary they pointed out that things really kick up once Merrick shows up and that's definitely true. You don't really know what is going on or who to trust. Then you have the end of the first half and the beginning of the second half. The big mysteries in the first half are pretty quickly filled in within the second half but personally I loved the ways they were revealed (for one my husband was watching over my shoulder and exclaimed in surprise) and that the focus of the game was then executing specific tasks, rather than hunting for clues. I also really liked the ending; it reminded me strongly of the ending of Transistor with it's understated approach and use of the credits. Overall the story was just suspenseful/unnerving enough without being something I wouldn't recommend to younger players and fantastically winsome and memorable. Character Balance/Development:In the first half Vella's world is more flat than Shay's. She's less clearly motivated and the objects she carries don't result in really any clever dialogue at all (as far as clicking on them in inventory, offering them to everyone, etc). Shay's world on the other hand was amazingly rich. The spoon and knife I didn't really discover until my second play through and they alone make his entire world more charming. In the second half that's much more balanced. While Shay still has more interesting tasks since he isn't trapped as much in one locale, Vella picks up the knife and a fork and some new characters show up in her locale (along with an old one I was really hoping we hadn't seen the end of!) that give her more engagement. Shay has more of the ""I don't think we can use that that way"" lines in the second half. Shay is in my opinion more rounded and makes more sense than Vella. We don't get a good sense of Vella without really digging into one or two lines; otherwise she comes off as needlessly and oddly intense. But they are both very winning and you feel a vested interest in them. One thing character wise that bugged me in the second half was the fact that one character stands around on a beach and you can't really talk to him. His big issue is pretty easily solved and then he's just there for most of the game. If you try to talk to him you get the auto ""Never mind!"" line and have to walk away. That seemed really pointless. Puzzles: They are definitely uneven but not unduly so. The first half of the game they are realizing things are not as they seem. The second half they are trying to cope with certain big revelations and new realities. It makes sense that other things are suddenly harder as well. I have NO idea why people hate the second half so much. The puzzles are clever but not so obscure that you would never get them (I found the knot puzzle easy while I would miss certain more obvious items, like how to get the shell). Most of the time if one side got old I would switch and play the other and suddenly things would make sense to me. So I felt like it played very smoothly. You need to diagram some things out but please, that's point and click standard. If you don't see that as the sign of a good game then don't play point and click. I also didn't understand the claims some have made about not having a hint system. When your character tells you ""Maybe I should look for X"" how is that NOT a hint? Same with your character asking another repeatedly if thing X will cause reaction Y. I like all others would have liked more new territory, but again, that's point and click standard to have one environment you really scrub over again and again. If it had all been released at once it would have been less striking. I know there's more I could say here but these were the reasons I got into the game and these are the only things that really matter to me. It's a gorgeous game that is incredibly addicting and charming. If this appeals to you at all, buy it! It's well worth every cent!			"

Some of the puzzles are a little more confusing and tend to shift more into the non-logical random puzzle solving like using a..... actually I wont spoil it for you here, good luck though >:3But yeah the game is still fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone who likes point and click action adventure games (and any Double Fine game for that matter)			"

												Broken Age is a beautiful game, and it's first Act is a wonderful introduction to the old-school adventure genre for a new generation. The story is intriguing, and the puzzles intuitive and fun ... in Act 1.Unfortunatley, everything seems to start falling apart in Act 2. Massive plot holes are introduced to the story, and the puzzles become convoluted and frustrating. I can't imagine ever solving the final puzzle without consulting a guide - something I never had to do in Act 1, or for any other part of Act 2. But the puzzles in Act 2 are everything that was wrong with adventure games in the 1990s. Double-fine paid too much attention to the hardcore player's feedback about Act 1's puzzles being easy and ramped up difficulty (i.e. moon logic) enough to kill the enjoyment for all the other players in Act 2.The characters and world are still engaging, but everything else in Act 2 is a massive let down compared to the first Act of the game. I tenatively recommend the game if you can catch it on sale, just because Act 1 is so flawless and enjoyable, but Double-Fine dropped so many balls with Act 2 that it is a tragedy.			"

												After having played this game through twice, I think I can safely say that it, for the most part, does justice to classic adventure games. Though the puzzles (with some exceptions, but I will get to those in a second) are really very easy, the game itself is extremely enjoyable; this is mostly due to the fully realized characters, the fantastic setting (which does start to dry out with the second part), and great humor and conversation.That said, the second part saw a pretty large detour from the first. It starts off on a relatively weak note, with astonishingly stupid plot twists (such as that of Shay's family) and long lists of tasks that the player has to do. Though a dedicated player will get past this section without pause, it provides very little motivation to keep going. In Vella's case, for instance, your first task (with the zero-gravity re-enabled) involves more timing than it does any intelligence. After this sort of ""introduction"" to Part 2, you are immediately hit with the aforementioned long lists of tasks. At this point, your primary goal in Part 2 is to wander the countryside and click on everything. You are stopped every now and again for a bout of puzzle-solving, but it feels very much like the puzzles are mixed throughout a game of wandering aimlessly. Even the puzzles of Part 2 are of varying quality. There are some that take legitimate thinking and reward you with a great deal of satisfaction, but there are others that involve screwing around with wires on the back of a robot (I am aware that the solution is hidden in the setting, but it was really very obscure). More than that, however, a number of the puzzles require you to get solutions from the other protagonist's story. This is irritating, but only because there is never any indication that this is the case. This can lead to some serious jumps in logic, as seen in many early adventure games.The setting, on the other hand, is absolutely fantastic. I won't say much about the setting, because figuring out more about it is probably the thing Broken Age does best.Is Broken Age worth your time and money? Yes, I would say that it is. Broken Age is a fun, lighthearted adventure game with less tedium than a number of classics; I recommend this to anyone interested in adventure games.			"

One of those where you really want to go down all the dialogue trees just to see the responses.			"

												I'm having a really hard time deciding whether or not to recommend Broken Age.On the one hand, I absolutely loved the art style, the soundtrack, the characters and the world. All top notch. The hand-painted art is consistently amazing, even breathtaking at times. The game runs and flows very smoothly with slick cuts between scenes. The ending of Act I left me in awe of what had just happened and hungry for more. Definitely a page-turner of a game.Yet the game is unfortunately a victim of annoying, unintuitive and, at times, very frustrating ""adventure game logic."" The puzzles were mostly OK, but a few too many didn't quite work. Trying to use all your items on all environmental points of interest gets old fast. Some puzzles require solutions that aren't mentioned or taught to the player before (easy stuff like combining items, but in a specific and seemingly arbitrary order, and less obvious things that I won't spoil here.And the difficulty ramps up to 11 really fast near the end. It came out of nowhere, getting in the way of my enjoyment and destroying the pacing and flow of the experience. Lots of repetition if you fail to do exactly what the game expects, and it's not even clear why you're doing things. Is the player just supposed to do something because the game permits it, not because it's an obvious way forward?Maybe I just had a particularly bad time. I think I'll recommend this game in the end anyway. After all, walkthroughs exist (THANK GOD) to remove some of the frustration. I would never have finished it without looking up a few solutions. Don't be afraid to use one, and you may really like this game, as I did. Just expect some frustrating design, especially if you're not an avid point-and-click adventure game player.			"

												As one of the backers fromtye original Kickstarter campaign, I ought to be really cross and take my annoyance out on the game in this review. But I won't, for the simple reason that it was never a factor to begin with. Even as I was finding the game my then computer was in no shape to run it, so had it been released sooner I still wouldn't have been able to enjoy it before now. Therefore, this will be a more objective look, removed from the drama.The first thing I wanna say is just how nice it is to have a point and click adventure that I can control with my wireless 360 controller. I know that's odd but the way it's set up using the mouse to drag by default is just awkward; I know you can change it but I got so used to the controller it felt nice. In a way, the game feels optimized for controllers, especially when you factor in that ludicrous 1 hour achievement - but more on that later.Visually and audibly the game is wonderful. I love the seemingly hand drawn art style, although I can't actually say if it is or merely simulating it. The voice acting is great and the music was always fitting and pleasant. I'm not sure the game NEEDED to have top o' the line voices actors like Elijah Wood, but their talent adds to the presentation.The gameplay is... It's a Point & Click adventure game, you would expect nothing more than inventory management and some puzzles of various natures. Instead we get a couple of really awkward timing/reflex puzzles and one that is completely awful due to two things: solutions being unique per run and needless trial & error. There's another that some people feel is in the same vein but that just takes a little imagination for the interpretations to make sense. By and large, though, the puzzles are actually fairly clever and all have logical solutions. Even if one DOES kinda make you wish you had a notepad.I'm giving this a recommended because I really did enjoy the game and felt I got my money's worth out of that initial crowdfunding attempt. A couple of bad puzzles just mean I'd take it down to 4 stars instead of 5 on my Backloggery. Incidentally, about that achievement... Who the hell puts a ""beat the game lightning fast"" objective for a point and click. That's like telling someone to finish a visual novel in an hour; it's DOABLE, but there's absolutely no enjoyment anywhere to be found. Unlike a VA, though, there's little room for error here. I actually got it, but it made me put off wanting to replay it for a while.			"

												My first introduction to Adventure games was way back (perhaps not as far back as some), to the days of ""Day of the Tentacle"". This led to a lifelong enjoyment of Point-and-Click Adventure Games, including King's Quest, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango, Deponia, Whispered World, etc. This game piqued my interest early, and I was VERY happy to back the project.As a Kickstarter backer, this game has met and exceeded my expectations. It's a well-developed throwback to the Adventure games of yesteryear and has a good amount of heart. The humor is on-target in almost all cases, and never groan-inducing. The animation is WONDERFUL, and the world is detailed and has a very Double Fine feel while still feeling fresh and new. There are a few spots where it feels as though the animation is not as fluid as others, but it doesn't interfere with the enjoyment.As for the gameplay, the puzzles aren't terribly hard, and make a good amount of sense if you take a moment to think. This is the game's strongest ally; many adventure games rely on randomly assembling/using objects to progress the plot. This does an excellent job of helping you through puzzles through clever dialogue writing and timeliness. No more carrying around 10 useless items for the duration of the game HOPING that one will be useful.This is easily one of my most favorite games of the year so far, and no Adventure fan's library will be complete without it. Bravo, Double Fine!			"

												I would be hard pressed to call Broken Age a game; it's more an interactive story.  Coming from DoubleFine though, you get what you'd expect: goofy and endearing characters that hint at a deeper, darker lore that permeates the environment.  While I enjoyed Vella's side more than Shay's, each character stood comfortable (and confidently) on their own - heading towards an inevitable conjunction.			"

												If you are the type of person that loves games for their story, then this game will be worth the price tag. Some people have given this game negative reviews not because the game is bad, but because the price wasn't right for them. Yes, the game can be completed over a single weekend and yes, the price is steep, but it's been nearly a year now and I still think about the storyline of this game. It has more charm and personality than Deponia (which is saying a lot) and gives an immense amount of feels despite the small package it comes in.At the very least, keep in mind that Part 2 of this game is coming out very soon and will be patched in for free. Maybe you'll want to wait until then to buy it, but if you wait, please keep away from any forums, videos, or comments talking about it. You may get spoiled on one of the game's most incredible moments.			"

												I was one of the original kickstarter backers for this game back in March of 2012.  As I expected to happen, over the course of these 22 months my anticipation for this game steadily grew, ever so much more as its appetite was fed a diet of documentary episodes, game and art design updates, and an engaging dialogue with the reinventers of Adventure.  My fear was that this ravenous anticipation of mine would spawn an equally monstrous set of expectations that no game could hope to live up to; never have my tribulations been so firmly laid to rest.Irrespective of which story, Shay's or Vella's, you start out with, you are immediately drawn into a beatifully imagined and fantastical world filled with well developed characters following a meticulously laid out story.  I would often find myself having to briefly pause in my play of the game when the humor left me laughing too hard to continue for several moments.  The most enjoyable moment of the entire game was how the ending of the first Act caught me completely by surprise and desperate to continue.  This very satisfied backer's only real disappointment is the delay in continuing my exploration of the world and story.  Double Fine did an excellent job resurrecting a nearly extinct genre and I am very much looking forward to finishing the game when Act II comes out.			"

The sheer amount of creativity is astounding and it really goes to show how shallow and lifeless AAA games are right now. The atmosphere is great and so is the writing, which is darkly humorous in its own unique way. The voice-acting is pretty great too. The puzzles are logical and not convulted, I never had to use a FAQ once, which is pretty damn good for an adventure game and I love the genre.One could easily criticize Double Fine for blowing their budget, and I even did, but its pretty clear that the money was put to great use and this is a truly a labor of love. I really do recommend this game and its a great thing that it is so good because it proves that despite the inherent risks crowd-funding like Kickstarter can really work to make great games that would otherwise never exist if the money is given to the teams that can make it happen.

												Coming from Double Fine, I admit I really, really wanted to like this game. And some parts are very easy to like - the gorgeous graphics and talented voice cast was always its strongest selling point. ""Broken Age"" sets up an interesting premise for Act I, which is then completely squandered in Act II, making the rest of the game's shortcomings all the more apparent. The writing and dialogue is disappointingly banal, the plotting is threadbare and as the game progresses the puzzles become increasingly clunky, illogical and repetitive. That may sound a bit harsh–don't get me wrong, ""Broken Age"" is not an entirely bad game–but it doesn't have much going for it beneath its lush visuals and it certainly did not fulfil my lofty expectations.

												Choose your Character - Vella or Shay...Both Character's reflect the Age Old ""Perfect World Setting with Sinister Undertone"" story, told brilliantly by the team at Double Fine. The Humour and Cleverness which Schafer and his team are synonymous for does not fail to disappoint, once again. The Art style is really what sets it apart from their previous games, this coupled with brilliant voice acting makes this a well backed game from my wallet (although the requirement for a… well, B-List Hollywood talent WOODn’t he be these days?…. wasn’t required – but HEY waddaya-gonna-do-with-the-extra-backerayola-cash-lol) and of course Schafer had to bring along his old buddy from Brütal Legend, which probably didn't cost him as much :)Without ruining the ending, the melding of both worlds - once both chacters are completed - is quite a nice touch and makes me hold on tightly for the next Act. Whilst it so far hasn't made as great of an initial impression to me personally as Cockroach Inks 'The Dream Machine', I would still rate (this Act at least) a quite capable 3.5/5 Stars. Let’s just hope the release of the Acts aren’t dragged out as much as those from the aforementioned Cockroach Ink team (but one could make reference to the funding comparisons between developers but one would not dare :).

												I'm sorry, please forgive me.  I'm co-responsible for this dullness: I was among those who kickstarted this (so I got early access and already have it).We gave Double Fine over 8 times more money than they had asked for.  Yet somehow it turned out it still wasn't enough for them: they went over schedule, needed some extra funding, made some cuts and are releasing it in parts.  But the worst is......it is just as insignificant, inconsistent  and boring as Monkey Island and Grim Fandango were fabulous, great and funny.  What happened?By far it doesn't look like the same Schafer we knew and loved.  Pity, pity, pity: mine and everyone else's hopes were so high.  We really believed he coud give us another gem, but it seems time has had it's toll and he's spent.  So sad.Please Tim, making things strange and weird does not make them interesting.  Oddness that has no motive and ends nowhere can titillate curiosity for a short time, but ends up being only boring and irritating.We still love you and many of us are longing for great adventure games.  We would love to get more of those from you.I'm sure you can still be a great team-leader and motivator, but maybe you should pass the creative leadership to some other artist who still has something innovative and interesting to say.

Wonderful stuff.EDIT: Many people who are convinced they're right are saturating these reviews with negative ones, simply because they (erroneously) believe Double Fine ripped us backers off.

												This review is in regards to Act 1, since Act 2 is not available yet.Personally, I gladly recommend Broken Age, but I'm going to say right now that it's DEFINITELY not something that will fit everyone's gaming tastes. It's a point-and-click adventure, of course, but a very simple one; sometimes the only difficulty that arose was from temporarily looking over an item that needs to be used. I'm not sure if it's even possible to truly fail this game, to be honest. The game is short, simple enough if you pay attention, and doesn't particularly fall prey to the Sierra Logic issues that sometimes come with point-and-click games (Sierra games were infamous in particular for occasionally having puzzles with solutions that were so absurd, they didn't make sense). If you're looking for a complex puzzle game or something involving some combat, then you should look elsewhere.I recommend this game mostly on the merit of the story, music, and art style. If you've ever played Double Fine games before (Psychonauts comes to mind), then you'll have an idea of what sort of tone this game's story has. I enjoyed the characters and settings, short as everything was, and I'm glad I played it. I wish there had been more to do at least in some of the interactions, but considering this is part 1 of a 2-part game, I'm not going to hold it against the game.What this review basically comes down to is if you can like a game mostly for the story and style, then this may be good to look into. If you want a challenging sort of gameplay experience, though? It's probably not worth your time.			"

												Just finished Broken Age, and I have mixed feelings about it.As a backer, and a game developer, I'm still a little miffed that Double Fine couldn't finish the game on the $3+million they got off kickstarter.  Contrary to what you hear, it IS actually possible to set a budget for a game and stick to it... even a creative, art-driven game like this one.Part of me kept thinking while playing, what game were they planning on making if they had only gotten the $400k or whatever they originally set out to get?  And, is this game WORTH $3 million?But as I played and got caught up in the story, I started asking different questions.   Is the game worth the $25 I pledged?  Is the world a happier place with this game in it, even unfinished?I think the answer to both those questions is Yes.  It's a little bit simpler/easier than I remember the classic P&C adventures being.  But in every other way it's as good or suprerior.  The writing and voice acting are great.  The art is beautiful.  And the story is interesting.  I won't give anything away.. but I really liked the ""ending"" to this Act.Now I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that Double Fine can keep it together and manage their budget enough to actually finish the whole game.

												Well clocking in at 3.8 hours, 30 mins of it spent looking for one object that seemed to be the background, I don't think it is worth the 25$. It is fun, it did fulfil its kickstarter promise of bringing back adventure games. I know there will be another act, but if it matches this one a total of 6 to 7 hours, well it will be disappointing at the 25$ range. I know I am happy to see an adventure game get published, and hope there is more to come. Which they have promised. But as it stands now, it is not a buy. I would rather have waited. Maybe because they have the engine built, and the major assets in, they may have a much longer second act.... maybe. If that will be the case I will definitely change to recommending it.			"

												Very short. A few hours. Only has first act. May not be worth the purchase, yet. The story is shaping up to be interesting once complete. The cliffhanger of Act I certainly has me chomping at the bit for Act II.Decent voice acting and writing. Has the whimsy, but not the wit of certain old school adventure games such as Monkey Islands. Though the lack of wit is a result of the story and characters being somewhat serious. (at least in comparison to the slapstick antics of Guybrush Threepwood Mighty Pirate) Contains a good bit of dramatic irony as well.The art style may be the best part. It's wonderful to look at. With the fanciful interesting character design we can expect from Doublefine.There are big names lending their voices, but it never felt like anyone but the character's themselves where talking.Due to not being the complete story. I would not recommend this game. Know what you are purchasing so you don't regret the purchase. I'm happy with my purchase but I have a soft spot for adventure games.			"

												A beautiful game. Sounds amazing, great art assets. Very fun to play while if you don't get stuck. This is exactly what I expect and enjoy in an adventure game.However, if part 2 is as long as part 1, the game in total is only 6 hours long. (or 8 if you tend to get stuck like me)I do not think it is worth the listed price, if only because the shortness.With the amount of money in the kickstarter, I would have expected more from the studio. Expect to play it in one sitting and then once again when the next part comes out.			"

												TL;DR: Don't buy this game.I got it as part of a Humble Bundle. I will just finish it and then never touch it again. It has not the style, loving charm and wit of games like Brütal Legends or Psychonauts. But I wanted to give it a try.Pros: Interesting Look and Style, Very good Soundtrack and Voice ActorsNegative: Repetitive scenaries, many total abstract non-logical puzzles, mostly boring story (with some interesting twists and aspects), not funny like other Double Fine Games.It is a waste of time and I regret the precious time that I invested in this one.

												I kinda loved this game. Given that now, if you come to this game, you might know it's history, you might know the negative reation behind the time and money it took to make it, or, and this bit would be wonderful- You could have no idea at all. The people with an idea, or any involvement in funding the kickstarter, might have a bitterness attached to some proceedings, but they're too blinded to see the truth. The people with no idea? You may well be in for a very awesome treat.One thing people don't get about kickstarter is that you ask for what the minimum amount you need is. If you got 100% funding, would it be able to be the game you want to make, completely? No, but you'd be able to have the story told. You might have to have less staff, it might take longer, the graphics probably wouldn't be as good, the story wouldn't be as long, and you might have to trim the number of locations down.In an ideal world, you'd ask for 3 million, you'd get 3 million, and the game would be exactly what you wanted it to be. However, people see that it got so much more than it was asking for and were thinking 'great, it'll be here sooner, be graphically superior, and with the ability to pay so many staff and so much electricty costs, they'll be done in no time!' Only that's not how it works.3 Years ago we got a glimpse of a game, and now it's complete. you ask any game creators out there, and that is an a-typical story, only we got a glimpse sooner than most of them would give, because that's how they needed to get their funding. I think, if people expanded their thinking on that, there might not have been so much anger towards this game.On the game, however, it is a funny, engaging game, filled with everything I've come to expect from Double Fine and point-n-click games. I recommended it to anyone who fits into that venn diagram!			"

												To start, I just want to give a brief overview: Part 1 was brilliant, charming, and in my opinion, alone worth playing through for the purchase of this game, albeit not at full price. Part 2 did not deliver in regards to puzzles, and has had mixed reactions to the story (which I'm personally neutral on, I can't bring myself to dislike it, but the ending is by no means satisfying either).I think I speak for the majority of players when it comes to one thing, at least:Part 2 was not fun. It is as simple as that. After over a year of waiting upon completing part 1, I'll damit, the story could have been fleshed out more, but ultimately that is a minor complaint when it comes to repetitive and convoluted puzzle design that gets in the way of the more logical, more straightforward, but simultaneously still-difficult puzzles that really provided a sense of achievement when you completed them instead of giving you a sigh of relief to finally be done - just to move on to that same laborious struggle.That said, I believe this story is meritable if not for its puzzles, then for its artstyle and, in some part, story. This game is gorgeous from start to finish, in an artstyle that truly matches up to the very nature of the game and is pleasing simply to be walking through. That said, that is the only point that gets by without flaws, in my opinion. The music, whilst excellent, I found to be far too repetitive, although this likely comes from the fact that the puzzles in part 2 forced me to associate them with the unpleasant experience, which is really a pity.On to the story. I will avoid any spoilers but I will say that I have seen complaints that the story does not continue with part 1's themes of teenage struggle. This, at least, I disagree with. Part 1 heavily showed through Shay's story the struggle of dealing with overprotective and overbearing parents, and Vella's shows dealing with living and dealing with life outside of parental influence (and to a more minor degree, dealing with parents' beliefs  and their contrast to her view of the world). Part 2, on the other hand, shows the point of view of their respective families, moreso, and allows for a less one-sided view on the issues. I feel like if not for this, the story may have had the opportunity to flesh out more interestingly, but thematically was essential to take players out of their comfort zone when it comes to understanding both sides of an issue that directly affects what I believe to be the majority of players. Some plot points were not fleshed out, but I personally feel that that would have pulled attention away from the themes of teenage struggle we otherwise have.Broken Age, for me, has sated my hunger for adventure games and kept me engaged in a story that remains focused and rooted in its themes. Whilst as a story, it is weak, and for the second half the puzzles are tedious and disappointing, a beautiful artstyle paired with a thematically focused narrative means Broken Age, for me, reamins worth playing.It's no masterpiece, like I hoped that it could be, but it does just enough to make it worth playing through.

I will say even though I highly suggest Act II, I felt it was also a little hard to understand at times but turned out better than the Act I in my opinion. I highly recommend this amazing game full of detailed Art and Amazing Music. I've long forgotten and never wanted to touch an adventure game again but Double Fine has brought back all my memories of playing Point, and Click games.         9/10        I hope to see even more great games to come :)			"

Posted: May 2, 2015
												My Review - This is a very descriptive review and states only what is correct and true. If you don't like reading why would you be in the review section..Alright, first off, ignore everyone else's review for this moment when you are reading my review, this is for the people who are interested in buying this game seeing as it is one of the most anticipated novel games last year. This review could also be for the people who had known about Act One and just found out about the Second Act being processed with the first. I did my best not to spoil anything when I typed this review, solely because it's up to the Viewer to decide which is wrong and which is right but there are some SPOILERS to be had.First off, this game consist of differential momentum in terms of environment, character, plot, and structural themes. This is what makes this game specifically unique than other novel games, this comes from my experience of playing at least 113 novel games for the past five years of experiencing different approaches in terms of genuine plot line that goes from you excited in the beginning, curious in the middle and satisfied at the end. Second, i shall list the pros and cons that truly defines this game as a whole review that will sum up your decision whether to like it or not.Pros - (1.) Genuine Characters (protagonists Shay and Vella are uniquely made through their origins and how they collaborate with each other and other characters), (2.) the plot line is not straight forward to players but that's part of the excitement and curiosity! (two different characters, as the player get closer to the plot, the closer both protagonist collide both their worlds), (3.) Dedicated aspects of the game, including well made environments that sets the atmosphere for the character as well as the player, (4.) Compelling, Mesmerizing and Humorous detailed puzzles, these are the eccentric part of the game, all made perfectly; easy for players who doesnt like puzzles and confusing for players who loves puzzles (does that even make sense!? I guess not but we'll go with it anyways!). (5.) The interaction between both the protagonist worlds are much more in Act Two which is rather impressing and needed because they switched. Cons - Now this part is what i hate to do while doing a review unless the game i'm reviewing is extremely horrid, since we're at the Cons of things, let me just say, these statements are to CORRECT the cons, not to directly tell you it's true. (1.) The fact that lot's of players who played Act One of Broken Age, built themselves from a eerie, curious, mysterious and unexpected adventure to a disastrous plot twist really sets it off for me as well but not quite, it is due to the fact that the creator wanted to give the players a taste of how a family succumbs to lies and betrayal as well as being utterly ignorant to which things are real and virtual. I didn't like how it ended but it wasn't that bad giving players reasons to say it was trash or garbage. When we put logic to these kind of games, it shows nothing but plot holes and disappointment. These games aren't suppose to be played like that. I was kinda relieved that the mother wasn't the antagonist because she was sweet, and she gave you that feeling of being 'cared about'. What i hated was that the father's plot line had no recognition as to why he had revealed his truest potential. (2.) The Grandmother having part as an antagonist had no surprises but gave no player interest because she reveals herself for at least four seconds and never gave the player another debut from her. (3.) Puzzles are straight forward, and need a keen eye for it, players need to actually think about things around you like every part of a scene are truly needed for a upcoming puzzle. (4.) I hated that they showed no scene for the reuniting of the character's family, it should've revealed the after math of both worlds being in peace which would of been a more satisfying ending but i could live with the one they gave.Now bear with me through this long review because my conclusion should give you the right edge to decide whether it's worth playing or not.As much as i was 50/50 on the Second Act, building yourself from the first Act is what makes it a lovable and memorable game, because a much as i gave away things that aren't right, I loved every single bit of it, because of it's unique characters from beginning to end. My conclusion- You should really try this game, it's lovable, it's exciting, it's genuinely awesome and humorous at that! My rating is 9.7/10 with it's truest form, no lies and no deceit, this game made me love my parents and it should do the same to you! Thank You for Reading my awfully long review, remember, it all comes down to your personal opinion!			"

												When Act 1 came out, I played through all of it in one sitting. Then when the full game came out, I played through both acts in one sitting.The game feels like a natural evolution of adventure games into the modern day. The puzzles walk the fine line of being difficult but not disrupting the flow of the story. The game drops good hints and in some cases cuts out travel between locations to keep everything moving at a fun pace.I'm surprised so many negative reviews here are floating to the top. They all seem to tangle with Kickstarter politics and whatever. Here's what matters: The game is great. The writing is lovely and clever. And the art is BEAUTIFUL. Definitely worth playing if you like or are at all interested in point-and-click adventure games.			"

												Loved it! Act 1 is short. But wow is it sweet.People complained that the puzzles were too easy in Act 1, so DF made them get progressively harder in Act 2, until they reach the level of a ""classic"" adventure -- which was just about right for me.What an amazing and beautiful experience this game is from start to finish. Wonderful stuff.EDIT: Many people who are convinced they're right are saturating these reviews with negative ones, simply because they (erroneously) believe Double Fine ripped us backers off. We weren't ripped off, we got more than what we hoped for. Ignore those reviews if you're just interested in how good this game is.			"

												Just finished Broken Age, and I have mixed feelings about it.As a backer, and a game developer, I'm still a little miffed that Double Fine couldn't finish the game on the $3+million they got off kickstarter.  Contrary to what you hear, it IS actually possible to set a budget for a game and stick to it... even a creative, art-driven game like this one.Part of me kept thinking while playing, what game were they planning on making if they had only gotten the $400k or whatever they originally set out to get?  And, is this game WORTH $3 million?But as I played and got caught up in the story, I started asking different questions.   Is the game worth the $25 I pledged?  Is the world a happier place with this game in it, even unfinished?I think the answer to both those questions is Yes.  It's a little bit simpler/easier than I remember the classic P&C adventures being.  But in every other way it's as good or suprerior.  The writing and voice acting are great.  The art is beautiful.  And the story is interesting.  I won't give anything away.. but I really liked the ""ending"" to this Act.Now I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that Double Fine can keep it together and manage their budget enough to actually finish the whole game.

												Well, at least the game is honest in it's name: yeah, it's broken.No spoilers:- There are less unique locations in this game than rooms in a flat. And just to be sure that they are even less unique, first you visit half of them with a character and half with the other, and then you visit them again switching the two characters.- Having few locations means that the designers have very few places for you to interact. This translate in ""traverse 10 screens to speak with someone, then traverse back the same 10 screens to get a new quest to get an object to solve the first, then traverse 4 of the same screen as before plus other 2 to find an object..."" and so on and on and on. You spend 99% of the time going back and forth and across the same screens, thousands of time.- The game is ridicolously cheesy, childish and boring.- The riddles are mostly so easy a child could beat them, apart from few that are really hard to solve. And, finally, there are some totally illogic where you have to use totally disjointed information to solve them.Then, the story is amizingly ridicolous and plenty of holes. And for a plot which is less than 100 words long, it's an accomplishment in itself :-DSpoilers:- You meet a guy dressed as a wolf, secretly hiding in a dark part of the ship you have lived on for years. So, an hiding guy dressed like a wolf...and he's the bad wolf of the game. It's so plainly obvious and phoned, that you get surprised that some designer has even thought it would have been a surprise for someone.Not to add that the main character never ever doubt about the entire thing. I mean, you discover a wolf-masked guy who's be hidden in the basement of your house, why shouldn't you think it's strange, uh?- Yeah, the guy has lived for years in the basement of the ship, alone, sleeping on a mattress on the floor. For what? Well, waiting for the hormons of the male protagonist to kick in so that he (the protagonist) could choose by instinct the best chick around. Lol.- The male protagonist spent all his time alone on the ship. All those years. With a couple of AIs. Knowing that he is the last of his species.Then at the end of chapter one...know what? The two AIs are his parents. I mean, they are not AI, they are human beings!!! His father has spent years outside the ship fixing it, and his mother piloting the...nothing, the ships needs no piloting, she spent year sitting. Not only the idiotic children never recognize his parents (the ""AIs"" are actually their real faces), but the parent never ever noticed it :-DAnd so on, and on...and on...I've seriously never ever played a more terrible, annoying, slow, and broken game like this. And I'm not recommending this just because it is from Double Fine, I don't care, the game is ridicoulos anyway,			"

												I can see why people like this game. The art is really pretty, the music is really pretty, the characters are done well enough and are memorable.Well now with the good out of the way, we can get on to the bad. Yes as everyone else has said, you're buying half a game at this point, with no end in sight because Double Fine couldn't manage a hot dog stand. The gameplay itself is nothing really to write home about as its all fairly easy. That could be overlooked with all the positives, if it weren't for the aforementioned no conclusion in sight. Hell even the ""half a game"" thing could be at least mitigated slightly if the half that we do have took longer than 3 hours tops to play.I want to recommend this game, I really do, but until that second half is actually out and not just a promise I say stay away from this game.ACT 2 EDIT:Well, I finally got off my♥♥♥♥♥and played Act 2, how long it took me should tell you how hyped I was after having to wait over a year. While that fact shouldn't matter to those buying the full game now, you will no doubt notice some contrasts between the two halves. While the first half was quite easy, the second half is brutal at times. Pulling up a guide in the Steam overlay is at times REQUIRED due to how unintuitive the puzzles are sometimes. One such puzzle is almost literally a rorshach test, except its not open to interpretation. You have to get the correct interpretation, then give step by step directions in language that also sounds like it was pulled from a rorshach test. You COULD fiddle with it for an hour as you try to use just the right language, or, you could just look it up online because you ain't got time for that♥♥♥♥♥♥ Another such puzzle prevents you from so much as looking up the solution online, as you're forced to either gain clairvoyance or just guess at something for an hour. Many noted that in Act 1, you could play either side of the story all the way through with roughly zero need to switch back and forth. Double Fine apparently saw this as a flaw to be corrected, because now you are forced to switch back and forth at times. No, you will not know when those times are. Yes, it is infuriating as you once again are required to have clairvoyance. Yes, you will just look it up on a guide. Gameplay for the second Act can be summed up as ""tedious"". In any video game puzzle, completing it should make you feel smart. Like you did your work and gathered the clues, or you were able to follow a logical progression to the end, possibly even having some sort of epiphany. When completing the puzzles here, you just feel like you got lucky. The story in the second half is still alright to good, but it does contain some moments where you'll think that the writers were ""just pulling that out of their♥♥♥♥♥quot;. Aside from that, the ending is fairly unsatisfactory, with the feeling that there is a lot more that needs to be tied up. Normally that would have me hoping for a sequel, but we all know that Double Fine has never made a sequel. And after this, no one will ever give Tim Schafer money again for a project. Speaking of money, let's get this out of the way. For a game with a 3.3 MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET, at no point do you feel the 3.3 million dollars and years of work that went into this. At its ""best"", the game only feels good. Nothing truly shines about this game. Yes the art is pretty, but its not 3.3 million pretty. Yes the music is nice, but none of it really wows you. The writing is good and has some twists, but it won't win any awards. The voice acting is good and they got some big names, but its surprisingly...dull? Actually, that might be the single aspect of this game that most reflects upon it as a whole. The voice acting is good, never bad exactly, but very few characters ever show strong emotions. Huge revelations are treated with minor surprise and then brushed off. Life changing events are also quickly brushed off. And that seems to be the theme of Broken Age on a meta level, doing good but never truly shining. I don't recommend this game because there just isn't enough noteworthy about it, aside from all the external drama. If you really need to get it, get it on sale, play it once, then forget about it just like the rest of the world has.			"

												I kinda loved this game. Given that now, if you come to this game, you might know it's history, you might know the negative reation behind the time and money it took to make it, or, and this bit would be wonderful- You could have no idea at all. The people with an idea, or any involvement in funding the kickstarter, might have a bitterness attached to some proceedings, but they're too blinded to see the truth. The people with no idea? You may well be in for a very awesome treat.One thing people don't get about kickstarter is that you ask for what the minimum amount you need is. If you got 100% funding, would it be able to be the game you want to make, completely? No, but you'd be able to have the story told. You might have to have less staff, it might take longer, the graphics probably wouldn't be as good, the story wouldn't be as long, and you might have to trim the number of locations down.In an ideal world, you'd ask for 3 million, you'd get 3 million, and the game would be exactly what you wanted it to be. However, people see that it got so much more than it was asking for and were thinking 'great, it'll be here sooner, be graphically superior, and with the ability to pay so many staff and so much electricty costs, they'll be done in no time!' Only that's not how it works.3 Years ago we got a glimpse of a game, and now it's complete. you ask any game creators out there, and that is an a-typical story, only we got a glimpse sooner than most of them would give, because that's how they needed to get their funding. I think, if people expanded their thinking on that, there might not have been so much anger towards this game.On the game, however, it is a funny, engaging game, filled with everything I've come to expect from Double Fine and point-n-click games. I recommended it to anyone who fits into that venn diagram!			"

												To start, I just want to give a brief overview: Part 1 was brilliant, charming, and in my opinion, alone worth playing through for the purchase of this game, albeit not at full price. Part 2 did not deliver in regards to puzzles, and has had mixed reactions to the story (which I'm personally neutral on, I can't bring myself to dislike it, but the ending is by no means satisfying either).I think I speak for the majority of players when it comes to one thing, at least:Part 2 was not fun. It is as simple as that. After over a year of waiting upon completing part 1, I'll damit, the story could have been fleshed out more, but ultimately that is a minor complaint when it comes to repetitive and convoluted puzzle design that gets in the way of the more logical, more straightforward, but simultaneously still-difficult puzzles that really provided a sense of achievement when you completed them instead of giving you a sigh of relief to finally be done - just to move on to that same laborious struggle.That said, I believe this story is meritable if not for its puzzles, then for its artstyle and, in some part, story. This game is gorgeous from start to finish, in an artstyle that truly matches up to the very nature of the game and is pleasing simply to be walking through. That said, that is the only point that gets by without flaws, in my opinion. The music, whilst excellent, I found to be far too repetitive, although this likely comes from the fact that the puzzles in part 2 forced me to associate them with the unpleasant experience, which is really a pity.On to the story. I will avoid any spoilers but I will say that I have seen complaints that the story does not continue with part 1's themes of teenage struggle. This, at least, I disagree with. Part 1 heavily showed through Shay's story the struggle of dealing with overprotective and overbearing parents, and Vella's shows dealing with living and dealing with life outside of parental influence (and to a more minor degree, dealing with parents' beliefs  and their contrast to her view of the world). Part 2, on the other hand, shows the point of view of their respective families, moreso, and allows for a less one-sided view on the issues. I feel like if not for this, the story may have had the opportunity to flesh out more interestingly, but thematically was essential to take players out of their comfort zone when it comes to understanding both sides of an issue that directly affects what I believe to be the majority of players. Some plot points were not fleshed out, but I personally feel that that would have pulled attention away from the themes of teenage struggle we otherwise have.Broken Age, for me, has sated my hunger for adventure games and kept me engaged in a story that remains focused and rooted in its themes. Whilst as a story, it is weak, and for the second half the puzzles are tedious and disappointing, a beautiful artstyle paired with a thematically focused narrative means Broken Age, for me, reamins worth playing.It's no masterpiece, like I hoped that it could be, but it does just enough to make it worth playing through.

												 I loved the art and storyline of Act I and II, they were played out very nicely and had amazing plot twists that had me playing for hours. I will say even though I highly suggest Act II, I felt it was also a little hard to understand at times but turned out better than the Act I in my opinion. I highly recommend this amazing game full of detailed Art and Amazing Music. I've long forgotten and never wanted to touch an adventure game again but Double Fine has brought back all my memories of playing Point, and Click games.         9/10        I hope to see even more great games to come :)			"

Kickstarter money wasted not in vain.Tim Shaffer once again proves that he indeed can deliver a great game only if he has a somewhat decent funding. This is indeed what everyone hoped for - a great, unique yet old-school-style P'n'C adventure, with a touching story, rich with unexpected plot turns, and all of that is enhanced with awesome voice acting and beautiful score.It is great.

												Act 2 is out and the game is finished. Finally.The game is still charming, the art is still great and the voice acting is still superb.But it's a frustrating mess. Honestly, I got fed up with it one hour into the second act. The story's slow and predictable progress simply gave me no incentive to trudge through the sheer tedium of solving the puzzles. The puzzles in act 1 weren't great and have been a major point of critique from the start. You'd expect Double Fine to do a better job in act 2.Instead, puzzle solutions are unintuitive to the point of being arcane. And when they are obvious, they are tedious. I gave up when I had to solve a certain knot-related problem. The solution becomes obvious quickly. But so does the realization that it involves mind-numbingly slow backtracking across several screens (ALL recycled from act 1) over and over again until a certain permutation of choices is made. If this is any indication for the remainder of the puzzles, then I'd rather watch a Let's Play. I don't know how the story ends and frankly I don't care anymore. Which is a shame, because it looked so promising. This is not a bad game. But it's still a disappointment and simply not worth its price. I expected more. "

												Overall, this is a very fun game.  Interesting characters, clever puzzles, funny dialogue.  Beautiful animation.  It's definitely a game you should get if you enjoy quality games with a good story.  My biggest pet peeve is with act two when somehow knowledge "" magically"" transfers between Shay and Vella.  In my opinion, the game shouldn't have scenarious where, for example, Vella does something/learns something, and then you later apply that knowledge with Shay.  I mean, looking at it from the story's perspective, that makes no sense.  I got stuck on some puzzles because I figured I could get the answers from just one side.			"

												I thought that Broken Age was a fun adventure game. Was it a masterpiece? No. Did it live up to the amount of hype and money put into development? I think not. But putting all the preconceptions about Tim Schafer and the delay of the 2nd part aside, and approaching it simply as a game, I enjoyed it and thought it was worth the sticker price that I backed it for.I didn't have any issues with the amount of backtracking in Act 2, although the some of the puzzles in Act 2 can be frustrating at times and poorly designed. Mainly a certain knot puzzle that is very difficult, or at least annoying, to parse, and the final puzzle resets itself when you leave a room, which can be hair-pulling.The plot does have some plot holes, and ridiculous aspects, especially in Act 2. While they do stretch the limits of the imagination, they are not impossible to believe, especially since the universe the game is set in is a little bonkers and cartoonish.Overall, the game was fun, and saying otherwise is really a stretch. It wasn't a classic or a masterpiece, but it was good enough to pull its own weight. The question of whether it lived up to the amount of money put into it is another story. I don't really think it did, since there have been some very competent and funny adventure games made by indies on a shoestring budget. Most of the money from the Kickstarter really went into keeping the studio afloat and paying for star power rather than towards making an impressive game. That isn't to say that the game doesn't look nice - it definitely does. And even if the game didn't live up to the hype, it's definitely something that is ""worth playing"".			"

Then when the full game came out, I played through both acts in one sitting.The game feels like a natural evolution of adventure games into the modern day. The puzzles walk the fine line of being difficult but not disrupting the flow of the story. The game drops good hints and in some cases cuts out travel between locations to keep everything moving at a fun pace.I'm surprised so many negative reviews here are floating to the top. They all seem to tangle with Kickstarter politics and whatever. Here's what matters: The game is great. The writing is lovely and clever. And the art is BEAUTIFUL.

												Overhyped from the beginning, this game had a lot to live up to.Unfortunately, while it's charming in some aspects I also found it rather dull in many others. The characters don't have a lot of personality and the game just fails to create a strong emotional connection with the player. Also, as expected, the gameplay is very simple and not challenging.Inititally scheduled to be released as one game it was split into two parts when the developers ran out of money. That was very damaging to this game and it ends just when it starts to become a bit more interesting. Despite what was claimed in the original kickstarter video, adventure games are not dead, they never were. It's a genre that is thriving with many innovative titles. Compared to those Broken Age is not the worst but it's also far from the best.Overall an ok game but I recommend waiting until part 2 is released as hopefully that might fix some of the game's problems.

												I can wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's gorgeous, it has a nice story beginning to end, the characters are likeable, and the music and voice acting is excellent.I'm pretty okay at adventure games, but not the best. I've played quite some (among my favourite are Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max Hit the Road, Machinarium and Book of Unwritten Tales), and I'm familiar with the general way of how adventure game puzzles are structured. The puzzles ranged from simple to challenging, but I never found them dull or illogical. I reached for a walkthrough once, and when I read the solution to that puzzle, I immediately realized where I had forgotten to connect the dots. I had disregarded some comment by one of the characters as irrelevant and forgotten about it, but it turned out to be relevant after all.  That's something that happens to me a lot more in adventure games, and I'm fine with that. Never have I thought ""Well how was I supposed to come up with that?"". As is common in adventure games, sometimes you do think ""Why can't I just solve it this way? That would be way easier!"" or ""Surely that other character has the necessary qualifications to solve this issue for me"". But obviously, if it were way easier, or you would let someone else fix things for you, you wouldn't have a puzzle to solve, now would you? :).There are some puzzles where Vella or Shay will give a hint when you do it wrong a few times. Sometimes I thought they were a bit soon with that, I would have preferred to muddle along a bit more without any hints.The characters often have funny things to say, and I've laughed out loud on many occasions. I have properly enjoyed myself playing the game, and I found the end satisfying. Sometimes a game is very nice while you play, but they botch up something at the end that leaves you unsatisfied even though you enjoyed it right up to the end. Luckily, this is not the case here. Oh, on that subject: the pictures surrounding the ending credits give a sort of epilogue to the story, so even if you usually click through the credits, you might not want to do that for this game.It runs fine on my Linux machine, which is nice, because I only boot Windows for games that don't run or don't run well natively on Linux. But I could use my preferred OS just fine.I could only find one problem with the game, related to clicking on objects in a scene. It turns out I need a lot of explanation to make clear what the problem is; so here goes.When you try to use an object from your inventory on an object in the scene, the object in the scene is highlighted. However, when you simply hover your cursor on an object in the scene, it's not highlighted. The cursor does indicate you can click, but the thing you're clicking on is not indicated. This can get confusing when you're trying to determine if something is clickable or not; whether it's background or a usable object. Say there's a person in the scene, and a space ship control panel next to that person. When I hover over the control panel, the cursor indicates I can click. But when I click, it becomes clear I've chosen to interact with the person. This can be confusing: is it indeed the case I can't click the control panel, or was I clicking too close to the person? After several clicks which initiate talking to the person, I'm concluding the control panel is part of the background scene. This can be annoying, because knowing what you can interact with is very important in a point-and-click adventure. Note that there is no pixel hunting in this game; it's not as bad as that. Everything you can interact with has a decent size, it's just that not everything that has a decent size can be interacted with :).I'm surprised by the amount of negative publicity around this game. These negative reviews are the main reason for me to write this review, because I think they paint a wrong picture of the game and might put off people who would love the game. So I'll admit I might be somewhat biased in my review, although I'm really doing my best not to be. But I feel a lot of the negativity and bashing is also not because of the actual game itself but because of other things surrounding it. People seem to be actively looking for things to fault the game for because there is something else they don't like for some reason or the other. Whether that be consciously or unconsciously.This game might not be your thing, and that's okay. But I find it very hard to find fault with the quality of this game. If you think this could be your thing, don't be disheartened by the negative reviews. It would be such a shame if you decided not to buy this game because of those, and missed out on the great joy you would have had playing it! "

												You'll either hate it or love it - as such, it's a game about duality and how seemingly unrelated paths through crazy circumstances lead to one point.While I was not a backer for the original Kickstarter campaign (I didn't start backing games on that site until last year), I did follow their journey through the DoubleFine Adventure via epsidoes released every so often on YouTube, and let me tell you - it's a whole other experience watching a game being made, and THEN playing it. In short: it was an intimate experience, and I have much better understanding as a gamer about how the other side of the coin operates.I played Broken Age all the way through in one sitting - due to the anticipation from fans, I felt it was most appropriate to play it that way since serveral people complained about the ""broken"" experience where they whizzed through Act 1, then waited, waited, waited, got impatient, then brute-forced Act 2. If your experience was like that, I'm sorry you feel hatred towards this game, but your particular experience casued your particular reaction. The game, while it may feel unevenly paced, is still an enjoyable game in what many modern gamers consider to be ""A dying genre"". Adventure games are here to stay, as long as people play them, classics, remakes, or modern ones, it makes no difference.The art direction is great, the music is excellent, the animation (while not Disney calibur), fits the artwork appropriately and tolerable. The mechanics are as-expected for a Point-and-Click adventure, along with controller support (if that's your thing). The story is interesting enough to keep you moving ahead, even if some puzzles are frustrating until you look up hints or draw a diagram on a post-it or two (like I did for that Hexpals wiring puzzle) - it only makes you more satisfied once you finish. Depending on your first playthrough, you may or may not want to do it again to snag all of the achievements (for you Perfectionists/Completionists/Achievement Hunters out there).Overall, if you love the magic of Double Fine games, if you love Adventure games, if you like games that try to do something different and pray somebody will appreciate it, play this game. Whether you come to love it or hate it, at least acknowledge the money, the hard work, and most of all, the love that Tim Schafer and friends put into the game.It's worth the experience.			"

The game doesn't bring anything new to the table, nor does it ""hearken back to the days of yore"" or whatever. If you are excited about the optional 8-bit mode, this game is for you! This is a gaming hipsters dream.There really isn't too much gameplay, most of your time is spent watching the story unfold because you clicked on one of the handful of things you could click on.The hardest puzzle in the game was figuring out the UI. The minimalist design is initially very confusing. (probably very intuitive on a touchscreen device) This isn't a bad game, and you wouldn't hate yourself for playing it. I like the idea of being able to switch between the two stories, but it would have made more sense if there was a point in switching between them. When I discovered you could switch, I assumed I would somehow find clues for one story inside the other story or something.Had I not read how short the game was, I probably wouldn't have bothered finishing. It wasn't until the end that I was actually intrigued.According to the IGN rating, this game ""ushered in a new age of point-and-click"" that is absolutely false. if you're wanting a point-and-click adventure that takes the genre to a new level, play The Walking Dead, another game from Telltale.

												This game has some good elements such as the artwork and soundtrack, but it feels more like an interactive movie to play. The puzzles are extremely easy; it is not really possible to fail at all and there are no bad choices to make, or consequences for bad decisions.It only takes about 4 hours to complete chapter 1, and even when chapter 2 gets finished it cannot justify the retail price at all. There just isn't enough game here.			"

												1. Too short 2-4 hours playthrough time to ACT1.2. Way too easy, there really is no puzzles.3. Story was uninteresting, didn't care about any of the characters.4. Story was very obvious.5. ""Your character knows more than you know"" problem, there were parts that didn't make sense because story did not tell you why your character wanted to do some tasks, but you have to do them so that story can continue. Not one of them bring any difficulty to game however, because there were only few places and only something like 4-5 items at any one time on your inventory.So, this game was first kickstarter success and at least ACT1 become one of many examples why it really is not good idea to give money to developers before game is ready. This game feels like it had to be done, because of money, but it does not feel like there was soul, love and intelligence used to make this game.and ACT2 is out, it was not any bit better, although puzzles were a tad harder that was due to faulty puzzle logic.

You can tell is not their first adventure game ;)+ long enough (please, notice i played act 1 twice)Not PRO nor CON:+- I wouldnt have minded a longer game :)+- story wise, i liked it... but i wouldnt have mind more details at the endCONs:- The last part of vella's puzzles are different than the rest of the game somehow... as if they had been designed by somebody else... You fail to execute what you know you have to do... I found myself wandering around trying everything lots of times without any progress... even though i knew what i was supposed to do...- The final battle suffer almost the same problem... you know what you have to do, but it has to follow a very particular set of rules for it work... kills the fun and the game flow a little			"

												Broken Age is a story-driven experience in the same vein as sleeper hit Gone Home, which delves into the world of a pre-op mtf transgender named Shay facing oppression from his cisgendered parents, who are robots and therefore cannot understand the fluidity of gender. It also has a second story involving a bisexual otherkin named Vella and her growing relationship with a lumberjack who over time learns to check his white male privilege. Jack Black also makes a cameo as a religious zealot who the player has to take down in order to stop their culture-shaming. An overall heart-warming story that should not be missed.			"

												Very beautifully crafted point and click adventure game. Fantastic art style, great and dedicated music score, interesting world and story, great voice acting. Some chuckles here and there thrown in for good measure. To people worried if Double Fine delivered, I say, yes, they did, it's pretty worthwhile experience.Can't wait for second act! I mean, act 1 is a complete experience, if maybe on the shorter side, but it definitely leaves you craving for more. And, sort of.. for what it is now, even though I said ""worthwhile"", I can't shake the feeling it should cost less xD But the purchase does contain the second act once it comes out, it's just not released yet, so be aware of that. I have to say though that I am dissapointed with the puzzle side. Exploration, wonder, amusement, enjoynment of vistas and music and story etc - that is there, but having to think? Not really. Puzzles take an obvious backseat compared to the other mentioned elements. There are not that many things to do and not that many items at your disposal to do it and to me it was always pretty obvious what to do next and how to do it, can't fathom why they are actually making it even more obvious with hints from other characters. I think Telltale's Sam & Max series hit the puzzle difficulty nail better (avoiding the frustration of unfair puzzles of yore but not being too obvious, either).There is no question if it is a game or not like you might question something like To The Moon, as the gameplay/puzzles are above being just nominal, but I kind of expected more from them. Nonetheless, I did enjoy the ride and I heartily recommend it to others. With the caveat that to get the fullest out of its price range we'll really need to get the rest of it :3			"

												This game is somewhat inconsistent with some puzzles where hardly any clues are given, mixed with other puzzles that offer hardly any challenge at all. If you still have your instincts from 80s/90s adventure games you'll probably get through the tougher sections, but then the challenge is not always there. The art style is beautiful and the story's interesting enough. Buy it. We need more games like this.			"

												What a gem of a game. It exudes charm, humor, and lightness in only the way Tim Schafer and crew know how to do it. And it's so wonderful to see a point and click adventure game like this, in this day and age, harkening back to Schafer's older, most respected works. On top of that the art is brilliant, the voice acting top notch, the script clever and hilarious, and so many fun little easter eggs all over the place. I spent a good portion of the game just talking to everyone and combining every kind of item just to hear the knee-jerk responses. Double Fine are some of the best comic writers in the entertainment biz, games or otherwise.The only downsides are those typical of point and click games. Some objects really do blend in with the background too well, you'll do lots of backtracking, various puzzles need to be solved in very specific order, etc. I must admit I did have to use a guide later in the game as some of the puzzle solutions were just not obvious enough after lots of back and forth trying out many different things. I can't really fault the developers for this, as I think these sorts of games do need to have some tougher puzzles, not everything can be elementary. Certainly nowhere near as perplexing and complicated as some of Machinarium's puzzles.I can't recommend it enough!!			"

												I backed the game in the initial Kickstarter and I completed Part One a while ago, but I just replayed it in order to refresh my memory for Part Two, which I've played for a couple hours. After a slight letdown at the release of Part One due to the easiness of the game, I'm really happy to see the difficulty ramp up in Part Two, and I also discovered that I really enjoyed playing through Part One again to find some of the jokes and details I had missed the first time around.I find the art absolutely beautiful, the dialogue witty and well-written (first time in a while I've laughed out loud at a game), and it's all accompanied by an excellent soundtrack (I'm definitely a sucker for games with good music). The story is interesting and compelling, especially once you start delving into Part Two, and I'm having lots of fun trying to guess where it's going to end up.Overall, I'm happy with the product Tim and the Double Fine team came out with - it's a very high quality point and click adventure and I'm having a blast playing through it!One thing I wish was included in the game is an in-game hint system for the more frustrating puzzles though.

												I loved every minute of this game. However, it's far too short and pretty much incomplete. I won't go ballistic about the injustice of how the community invested a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of money into a kickstarter and only got a small part of what was promised to them; I didn't participate in that kickstarter and I only recently bought it, about a month before the release of Act II, so I can't really comment on that. If I had to grade it as a standalone game, I certainly wouldn't recommend it; it being an incomplete experience. But considering how the second installation is right around the corner, and how intensely I enjoyed the two meager hours of gameplay this first miniature installation had to offer, I will recommend it heartily anyway.As a caveat though, I have to say it's probably not for everyone. It's not incredibly thought-provoking, nor is it a particularly thrilling gameplay experience. It's just a charming adventure game that some might write off as childish and lackluster. And while I'd disagree with such a negative judgement, I can understand why some would think of it as such.I loved it. Will you? I honestly don't know, but one can hope.			"

												A wonderful point and click adventure game.Puzzles:The first act is to easy puzzle wise, but the second act fixes that a lot. Multi-layered puzzles that actually makes you think, still not as hard as old-school adventure games, but much better than the first act, where each solution had only one step. I find the solutions to puzzles to be more in the ""Aha! That makes sense"" column than in the ""WTF!"" column.Story:The game has great characters and a good story. I wish the game was longer at the end, so it would flesh out the bad guys more. Maybe even more scenes/puzzles in the city. Art:When the art was first revealed, I wasnt really sure about. Truth be told, I expected the art style to be closer to Full Throttle or Day of the Tentacle, but it grew on me and now I really like it. I can't imagine that it would look some other wayReally?:This is a hint for the second act, so if you do not want to read it, stop. Half the fun is finding out on your own. Though there are some players that don't like it. In the second act, you can get hints about puzzles from the other character's point of view. The characters dont interact, but you can switch between the characters and notice some details in Veila's part which help you solve a puzzle in Shay's part. It really comes out of the blue and you basically have to figure it own on your own. This didn't frustrate me or anything, but I can understand that some gamers are annoyed by this. I don't know, maybe it's the mileage of playing adventure games.If you want to play a great adventure game, buy it. This game made me laugh and lately adventure games don't really try to do that or they just think they're funny (Deponia).Plus, watch the credits, there is some nice art there ;)			"

												Great dialogue as expected from Tim Schafer. The puzzles are harder in Act 2 for sure, but definitely not unsolvable. And although the second act didn't have as great a plot twist to match the first, I still really really loved it. The characters and locations are great, and the way they are reused was excellent - often Adventure games tend to 'discard' characters once their role is over and their puzzle solved, and seeing Vella and Shay react to everything in their own way was fun to see. Go play this game right now! Preferably both acts in sequence!Would rather have more games like this than Advanced Battlecraft Warfare 24 anytime.			"

												Broken Age represents the return of the classic “point-and-click” adventure game; it promised to feature the same wit, humor, and odd-ball puzzles that made games like The Secret of Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle such timeless classics. I grew up during the hey-day of the point-and-click computer games and still have a box filled with floppy discs for games such as Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2 and Day of the Tentacle. My sense of humor was shaped by the comedy that Tim Schafer and Ron Gilbert wrote into their games.Now, after a controversial development, Broken Age arrives in full on the PlayStation Vita making one thing absurdly clear: it makes good on everything it promised. It is an adventure game that is as deep and rich as any I’ve ever played.2015-04-27-043646Broken Age tells the story of two young adults with one thing in common; they’re unhappy with their lot in life. Shay is a young man who has spent his life aboard a spaceship and has had his every need catered to by an overly mothering computer. The only excitement in his day is when he embarks on scripted expeditions to “rescue” creatures in peril. Day after day his life trudges on the same, and day after day he goes through the same charade – wishing each time there was something more.Vella is a young woman who lives in a village of bakers. Every 14 years the village offers up the best maidens in town as an offering to a horrible monster that ravages their land. Despite having such an honor bestowed upon her, Vella wonders why the people of her village cower in fear rather than fight the beast. She has chosen not to be a sacrifice; she has chosen for something better in life.2015-04-21-161855Shay and Vella are both unhappy with where their lives are going, but they also question what is real in the world around them. More than anything, what they really want, is to peer behind the curtain and discover the truth.The story in Broken Age is a deep and philosophical one that ironically doesn’t take itself too seriously. Shay lives on a spaceship where his companions are all knitted out of yarn, while Vella comes from a place where young women compete to be eaten by a monster. It’s the juxtaposition of these conflicting ideas that brings an elevated sense of humor to the story…Wow, that was deep. What I’m trying to say is that despite the underlying story, the surface is full of wild and wacky elements that are not only fun but hilariously funny. Often times this humor is derived from our two naïve heroes entering strange, new situations. Shay is a bit of a bumbling hero, much in the vain of Guybrush Threepwood from Monkey Island, while Vella is a headstrong go-getter with only one thing on her mind. Their dry comments in the oddest of situations would frequently make me laugh out loud, sometimes uncontrollably.And it’s good to have a sense of humor when playing a puzzle game like this. The puzzles presented in Broken Age feel very familiar and fresh at the same time. They’re the same twisted puzzles I grew up with where clues hide in plain sight and the answer is often more absurd than you’d think. Sometimes these puzzles get solved in a matter of minutes while other times you may have to think about them for a few hours.2015-04-23-0805262015-04-21-194850The game is broken up into two acts. Act I introduces us to our two protagonists and allows us to guide them on a new adventure. You can play as either Shay or Vella and switch between them at any time. The puzzles are challenging with a number of “A-ha!” moments, but it goes by rather quickly.Act II starts with you having to deal with the consequences of your earlier actions. Shay and Vella want to peer behind the curtain, but what do they do once they have? The second act is much longer than the first and the puzzles get more intense. In total it took me around 13 hours to complete the entire game.The interface for the game was designed with a PC in mind, and while it does make the transition to a controller fairly well, it still feels a bit awkward at times since you use the thumb sticks to move an on-screen cursor and interact with the environment. A nice feature is that the right stick will automatically snap to “clickable” objects so you don’t have to scan the entire room for something to click. It works decent enough, but it’s still not very precise. However, the PS Vita does have an advantage over the PS4 version – you can use the touchscreen to select items in the game. It works amazingly well and really speeds things up.2015-04-25-083347Visually, the game is absolutely stunning. The 2-D art style retains the feeling of the pixilated adventure games of old but adds a brilliant layer that creates a hand-drawn look to the game. The characters have a bold and unique style to them and the environmental art is all top notch. Everything runs smoothly with the performance never being a problem.Likewise, the voice acting is superb. With notable talents such as Elijah Wood, Jack Black, and Wil Wheaton (whom I didn’t even recognize until the credits rolled), the characters are all given a great sense of depth and humor. And as good as the acting is, the musical score is even better. It’s composition is grand in ambition at times befitting the heroes’ journey, but it can also be tender and intimate. It’s by far one of my favorite game scores to come out in a long time.2015-04-23-074403As great as Broken Age is, it’s not perfect. I often had trouble with the audio late in the game where the characters would speak but audio would be delayed for several seconds (or get drowned out by other noises). It’s a problem that happened in isolated areas but it was persistent. It also appears to be a Vita issue as the same problem would not occur on the PS4. I also had problems with the game crashing occasionally which seemed to go hand-in-hand with the Vita losing a connection to PSN.Any other issues I could point to would be nit-picking. It would be nice if there were more areas to explore, and it would be cool if the world felt a little bigger. Some characters get criminally underused while others get a bit too much screen time. In the end, I found it clever how the story would weave back into itself and reuse a lot of the same locations.Broken Age is a masterpiece. It manages to capture everything that made point-and-click adventure games great in the first place. It is the perfect blend of interesting characters, wacky humor, and head-scratching puzzles that constantly have you wanting more, and represents everything that made these games so wonderful to play.REVIEW OVERVIEWPresentation	5/5Gameplay	5/5Lasting Appeal	4.5/5Execution	5/5SUMMARYBroken Age promised to be a return to the classic point-and-click adventure games from yesteryear and manages to succeed on that promise in every way. It's a game filled with brilliantly absurd puzzles wrapped around a beautiful story that's told with wit and humor. It is both laugh out loud funny and head banging frustration. Broken Age manages to blend all these elements into a wonderfully charming game that should not be missed.4.9/5 "

												So, there it is. Broken Age is finally out. I haven't touched it before tonight (bought it sometime last year during a sale) and waited patiently for it to be ready for a full-on, one-session playthrough. The question is: Was it worth the wait?The (spoiler-free) answer to that is: Yes it was, if you have been patient and didn't raise your expectations too high.Now, something to say right away - Broken Age is not the adventure to end all adventures. It has its strengths and weaknesses. But what makes assessing them hard is that they switch around. In Act 1, the story was very strong and somewhat mysterious while the puzzles were mostly fairly easy. In Act 2, the story lost a lot of its pull (in my opinion) but the puzzles became more complex and challenging, some of them just the right amount to be satisfying, some pushing it a little (or well) into the realm of the frustrating.But I will not blame Double Fine for experimenting with some of the concepts behind puzzles. The fewer developers keep recycling the same concept, content and game over and over, the better, so I can admit I was satisfied with that part of the game even though I eventually had to look up a hint or two.The story left a somewhat bitter aftertaste, though. It's not that it's bad overall - The presentation is brilliant, the setup stellar (particularly Shay's Act 1 was great) and the cast of experienced and skilled (voice) actors add to it, as do the beatiful soundtrack and catching visuals. And the writing also doesn't leave a lot to be desired: It's witty, but not too over-the-top and just the right amount of educational to be played by all ages.It does, however, suffer from what I would call the ""Mass Effect 3"" effect: By the end, it seems like nobody really knew what to do with it, so it was just wrapped up in whatever way they could. It's not as bad as Mass Effect 3 but I found the conclusion unsatisfying and the last few scenes made me wonder where the good writing with its surprises and twists had gone and why I was now watching a B movie.I know that doesn't sound like a hearty recommendation but that doesn't mean you shouldn't pick it up. Broken Age is still a great adventure; it just isn't without faults, just like the story of its development. Be aware, though, that you are probably only going to get one playthrough of 8-10 hours out of it (maybe another some years later). But during a sale, this is a good pick.			"

												I've only played a few hours into Broken Age, but I'm not sure I'll ever fire it up again.Although the art style is respectable, the dialog is stilted, silly, and repetative. It's quite childish, but not in a way I think children would enjoy. The girl's story was somewhat engaging, but the boys side just failed to capture my imagination. Perhaps it was having to repeat the same 'quest' and dialog options multiple times. I get it, I'm supposed to feel like the boy who is bored out of his mind by endless repetition. Mission accomplished. Even when things started to pick up, the boy's lack of concern (or even moment of pause) that something has changed was too much for me to handle.Again, I didn't really get too deep into the game, so maybe it picks up a little later, but I also found the gameplay completely lacking. The objects you need to find are basically handed to you, and what you need to do with them is painfully obvious for an adventure game. They really only serve as a means of advancing the plot.In a word, I found Broken Age to be: boring. "

												Broken Age is a game that focuses on two protagonists, Shay and Vella. They're very different but it turns out they're important to one another's story. Broken Age is their story and about how the two of them change things.This game is very creative. Not only is it really pretty but the characters are so much fun and the puzzles are unique. It also features some famous voice actors like Elijah Wood and Jack Black. The only major issue is the very end. It felt rushed but it doesn't really ruin the game completely. Yes, it's a bit disappointing but that doesn't really make me feel like I wasted my time. I still enjoyed myself and the game is replayable.If you're a fan of adventure games, then I highly recommend this.			"

												Just finished the complete game, including my 3rd play through the first ""Act"", and I have to say I definitely felt I got a $10 million experience—Double Fine put in the time, effort, and funds, and it paid off. Beautiful artwork, fun & interesting characters, quirky settings, and the layers within layers of ""twists"" in the plot were fun even though they were pretty obvious [to me]. With the full game in perspective, the ""half"" formerly known as ""Act I"" feels more like a prologue; it teaches you the interface, introduces the characters, setting, and plot, and it isn't until you reach ""Act II"" that the game really seems to begin. The game wouldn't work at all without the first act, but its value doesn't really become clear until you reach the second.Having recently played through some ""classic"" adventure games (e.g.: Monkey Island 1 & 2), I am grateful for the advancements of modern gaming & interface (thank goodness verbs are gone!) design, while still challenged by some of the puzzles and sometimes-tiny-and-obscure clues. In my opinion, Double Fine is taking adventure games in the right direction and, with all the time & effort they've invested in the engine, I look forward to seeing more adventure games from them in coming years.

												Broken Age is an adventure game by Double Fine that was initially funded via Kickstarter in 2012. Now in 2015, the game is finally fully released! But the question is: does it deliver?The story describes the coming of age of a boy (Shay) and girl (Vella). You get to play with both characters by alternating their storylines, which are interwoven in a clever way. After a certain point, alternating between characters becomes essential for progressing in the game. I found the story compelling and it motivated me to keep playing the game.The puzzles in the game use the classic object manipulation and character interaction staples from the adventure game genre, which are executed in a appropriate and traditional way. Unfortunately, some puzzles do suffer from being too easy or having an unclear context. A bit more polish here and there would have definitely made all puzzles great. Overall, I enjoyed solving the puzzles.From a visual perspective, Broken age has a unique and nice art style, which is definitely a selling point. Animations are crisp and the world feels very much alive thanks to a quirky cast of characters with great voice actors. The ambience the game breathes is great and it is an enjoyable environment to walk around in.The soundtrack is also very enjoyable and it always suited the mood for the story.In conclusion, from the perspective of an adventure game player, Broken Age might feel underwhelming, since it never tries to go beyond the classic adventure game mold. What remains is a charming game that any gamer with an open mind can appreciate, given its sense of adventure and positive spirit.			"

												This game has great visuals, genuine humor, and stellar voice acting, but puzzles can be unintuitive and dialogue regrettably stitched together.Watching the trailer, you can see and hear the pros I listed. A great cast and imaginative art make this game worth playing. What you can't see from the trailer are the cons I've pointed out.As others have pointed out, the second act of this game has a sharp difficulty spike. A good portion of my play through was simply being stuck in the second act, not actually playing the game. All in all, I had to look at hints 3 times to progress in the second act (not at all in the first). If you don't mind using a guide, this game will likely be great for you. If having to toggle between two characters to get answers to puzzles bothers you (immersion breaking because characters use knowledge they otherwise wouldn't have) then this game is definitely NOT for you.Other than the difficulty in the second act, I wasn't entirely pleased with how the dialogue flowed together. The lines by themselves were not the problem, but following one line of thought and then having to jarringly switch over to another to get a hint or key to a puzzle really bothered me.For me, I liked the game, but I would have preferred to watch someone else play it (stitching together the dialogue best they could) or for this to be a short movie.

												I don't not-recommend this as a hard No. I might very likely recommend it to someone I thought would enjoy it, albeit with reservations. *SPOILERS*Weeellllll, I just finished playing Broken Age. Hmm. First off, it's so beautiful. SO beautiful. I can see why I paid full-price for it after knowing hardly anything and watching the trailer. The game is just as beautiful as the trailer looks, with a whole lot of tiresome monotony thrown in. Broken Age is split into two acts. Act One has fairly simple puzzles which follow the fun story. Vella and Shay, the two main characters, each inhabit their own world with no knowledge of the other (but you know that's gonna change). Playing either character is possible at any time. In Act Two, Vella and Shay switch worlds, and while each world is expanded on and new characters introduced, the puzzles became so tedious and not-obvoius, I found myself walking around the same places over and over. The puzzles were tough in a way that didn't feel very stimulating, or creative, or challenging. Just sort of a shiny cute laborious thing to sludge through, with the help of walkthroughs that I very quickly turned to. I really want to make this sound more positive than I am, but I think the best part of the game for me was finishing, haha. Being done brought a feeling of satisfaction and relief that the game itself mostly hadn't. I did find Vella and Shay both to be interesting characters, largely because they're their own people and don't align so much with gender stereotypes. That said, a lot of other characters are pretty cliche and boring. Like, there are some married parents in Act Two, and the mom's main activity seems to be worrying about her kid, while the dad is gettin' all scientific with the PH balance of a mud puddle and patching holes in a spaceship. I recommend buying Broken Age on sale, taking lots of screenshots, enjoying Elijah Wood's voice (as Shay), turning to walkthroughs as wanted, and maybe having the snacks you like best nearby. Because this game, like any, is a whole lot better with some nice ridged chips and a towel to wipe the grease.			"

												Very good entry in an almost extinct genre (well outside of germany). Act 1 is around 3-5 hours (It took me 5, but if you rush through it, you will be faster) and the story, setting and characters are fascinating. The puzzles tend to be on the easier side though, but they already announced that Act 2 will be a bit harder. If you like adventures, you have to try it. It's a modern take on an old and beloved formula. And it excells at it.			"

												Double Fine did it again!So far, Broken Age is a beautiful game, with amazing writing and voice acting, that takes us back to the golden age of adventure games and tells a story about growing up, facing life's challenges and embracing its mysteries.I am really glad I decided to back DFA/Reds/Broken Age on Kickstarter.I had the opportunity to witness the game's development process - thanks to the great DFA documentary series by 2 Player Productions - and now I get to dive into this awesome world that Tim Schafer has created.Congratulations to everyone at Double Fine. You guys did an amazing job!			"

												Let me start off by saying, this game was fantastic. The sotry is entertaining, the puzzles are enjoyable, its not very hard though. But I have to say the thing that upsets me the msot about this is the fact that you pay for both Acts, and we have been promised Act 2 for almost a year now and there has been nothing. There has been no news, no videos, absolutely nothing. In fact he has released other games in the same time, some how I have a feeling that Act 2 will never be published and that infuriates me. I have lost all faith in the developer and after being funded many times over on Kickstarter ther really is no excuse for why Act 2 could not be relased, its pathetic. Let alone to promise a date when it would be done, and then to juyst say nothing about it and later change the date once again with no information. Its just insulting.I sincerly hope no one buys this game until they decide to finnaly keep their word and deliver Act 2.			"

												The game looks beautiful, the voice acting is great, but the story is just boring, and the puzzles are too easy.Plus, you'll probably beat it in 5 hours or less, which is really short, even for a game in 2014, and they've still not set a date for the release of the next half. Who knows how long it'll take them to even start on part 2.And, on top of all that, they're selling it for $25. That's nowhere near worth it. Save your money for something else.			"

If there was a full story to the game with all of the above, this game would be 100% worth the buy. Maybe not at full price, but quite close to being worth it.That being said, it's been over a year since I've bought the game and I've still only received half a game. It's absolutely ridiculous.

												Broken Age Act 1 is pretty good. So Act 2 comes out and the first thing on the Steam Game Page is a scathing RPS review, what gives.Imo storywise it is abit weaker if only because theres alot more revealing and alot less mystery and some of the less obvious stuff which couldnt be guessed in Act 1 already left me with a sense that it should have developed abit..slower, maybe with a third Act. It works but feels like ""Bam Bam Bam here are the facts"".This time some of the solutions for puzzles of one character are more or less hidden in the other characters scenario which is somewhat problematic in that a) how would the characters know (a ""link"" is implied but ehhhh) and b) if one is stuck now theres the possibility to wander around aimlessly even more. The last big puzzle of the game resets part of progress upon failure so i had to redo certain actions and walking multiple times to ""try again"". Sensible ingame but not that fun.Most of the Areas of Act 1 get reused but id say thats not too uncommon for an adventure game and the characters encountered in Act 1 get some development.I wouldnt say those flaws reduce the whole thing to a ""Broken Mess"" tho. Good stuff, recommended.			"

												Broken Age was the very first project I backed on Kickstarter. As such, it will always have a special place in my heart. It also revived my interest in adventure games, which I didn't think possible in my old, jaded age, but it's a consequence of the game that will stay with me long after the game itself is finished, which is an impressive feat.The first act is a love song to 2D adventure games. There are tropes that play out like you'd expect and others turned totally upside down. It's fun and light-hearted and whimsical. You won't find another voice cast including the likes of Jack Black and Wil Wheaton in an adventure game any time soon. It's funny, and at times, poignant.Sadly, the second half doesn't follow nearly as strongly. The puzzles are more obtuse. The writing is more matter-of-fact, and a lot of the situations, artwork, and even puzzles get heavily re-used. In some cases this allows for a creative twist on things, but in others it stinks of laziness. Personally I think the issue is that the success of the Kickstarter and Act I gave Double Fine some room to maneuver, so they got distracted: they made several new games such as Massive Chalice and remastered some old adventure titles in between the releases of the acts. The second act feels like it's a necessary conclusion to the story, but one that they rushed through creating rather than taking the time and care needed to make it something truely memorable.My other complaint is with the achievements. Most of the time I feel that achievements are neutral - you would've done the requirement for it anyway - or positive because they force you to play the game in a new or interesting or challenging way. But here the achievements are almost all neutral or negative - actively detracting from the experience. First, they were only included for Act I after Act II was released, which forces another run through just to get credit for things already completed. Furthermore, some of the achievements require you to get something right on the first try. For me, this is the worst kind of achievement because it discourages experimentation and encourages relying on guides. It's exacerbated by the fact that there is no chapter select, despite the natural break point in the middle and the forums shouting for some kind of way to jump into Act II when it came out.Finally, there is a speed run achievement. Simply put: it has no place here. An adventure game is the not the kind of game where you want to skip all the cutscenes and dialogue and use a guide for all the puzzles. That's like purposefully ignoring all the best parts. It's stupid. Some people have theorized it's only there because Xbox Live requires games to have leaderboards. It's just speculation, but if it's true it's awful reasoning and it's fustrating that they kept it included in the desktop version, where there are no leaderboards. And to top it off, because of the included manual save feature the speed run is not even challenging, since you can just save when you only complete a section in the optimal time. So it's an achievement that is a worthless chore requiring no skill that forces you to skip past the best parts of the game. I can't imagine what they were thinking.Broken Age has some beautiful moments and engrossing puzzles set in a unique world. It can't carry the magic all the way through, but it doesn't have to for it to be a game worth playing.			"

												Tim Schafer is known for his quirky brand of the Monkey Island adventure game. For those new to the genre of point and click adventure games, you explore and solve puzzles within a highly stylized environment as action and narrative gradually unfolds. Understandably, there are both strong and weak points to this style. Since the genre has been around for three decades, the weaknesses have integrated themselves into the appeal of the game. There is an audience who enjoys having ten unique items in a sack and endlessly manipulating them to unravel the story. Other games, such as Telltale's Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, estimate the majority of the greater potential audience dislikes this style of Trial and Error, and streamlines the experience. Thus, I will cut right to the chase, Broken Age is consciously archaec. If you have played Monkey Island, The Longest Journey, or Grim Fandago, you know exactly what to expect, since you have played this game before. The story unfolds along an intriguing ark, you obtain and interact with ten items in a sack, appealing humor and characters are involved, and the overall experience is entertaining, moving, and of high quality. If you are new to the genre, and are open minded toward it. Broken Age is one of the Top Grade titles of its class. Tim Schafer himself is a product of the Steven Speilberg, Disney-Pixar, Nintendo craze of the 80's and 90's, and his work is a luminous reflection of his influences. Schafer does have a few off-beat conventions in his style, which you would not expect from a Disney or Nintendo show, but his games deviate only a couple of steps from first base. Did I enjoy Broken Age? Yes, I was entertained and moved. Is it a classic of the overall genre? As much as Grim Fandago or Monkey Island is in my mind. Would I recommend it to someone else? If you like Tim Schafer's product, then yes, if you have not enjoyed his Adventure Games in the past, there will be nothing here to dissuade you from your prior bias. If you haven't played an adventure game before and you like the Speilberg-Disney-Pixar-Nintendo product, Broken Age is a good place to start and you will have a great time. There's no shame in following a walkthrough.			"

												Broken Age is every bit as charming as hoped coming from Double Fine and following the development since the start of the Kickstarter campaign. The visuals, the soundtrack, the humor,... everything just fits.It may be a bit on the easier side compared to other point and click adventure games, but that's because the puzzles are way more logical compared to other games, which often make their puzzles non intuitive for the sake of difficulty or length which can get rather frustrating.Finished it in roughly 3.5 hours, of course that's just Act 1 of 2 so more will follow :)If you like this genre, you definately should consider getting it at some point			"

												Just a few months shy of two years I've eagerly anticipated this game, and I'm happy to say the wait was definitely worth it. While I've only experienced part one, I am very pleased with the outcome of Double Fine's toil.This game takes the adventure game banner and swings it proudly, certainly living up to the legacy of Lucas Arts and Sierra games that came before it. Minutes into the game I found myself smirking and snickering at the dialogue (which is no small feat considering how humourless I've become lately), and the art design is straight up gorgeous.If you enjoy adventure games of old, Double Fine's brand of humour, or just want a light-hearted adventure, look no further than Broken Age. I'm waiting for part two with bated breath!			"

												With Telltale leading the effort in evolving the point & click adventure genre, it can’t be easy for other aspiring developers to catch up. In Double Fine’s Broken Age the first act is a bit of a strange case. The sound design is solid, with the voice acting delivered by several big movie actors. The soundtrack is also fantastic. The art style is clearly thought out, feels unique and works well with the story. The gameplay and puzzles feel streamlined. And yet, it just doesn’t feel like fun. It’s half the time downright boring. Both the story and the gameplay refused to interest me throughout much of this first act.The two seemingly unrelated stories of Shay and Vella both start off very slow and frankly feel a little dull. The current life that Shay wants to break out of is boring and meaningless to him. This is projected well on to the player, who will feel the exact same. But the player’s feeling doesn’t let go once Shay starts on his big adventure. In fact, it still feels unmotivated and dull all the way towards the last ten minutes of the campaign. Only then does it pick up some speed, right before it abruptly ends with a tedious cliffhanger. Vella’s story is better and at least feels more focused.Broken Age’s first act isn’t a bad piece of work. There’s just too little of it. It’s a slow game, but a short one at the same time. Most of the puzzles feel devoid of any real cerebral challenge, and consistently remains on a level that a child can master. But more seasoned veterans of the adventure genre - which likely includes most of the people who backed the Kickstarter campaign - will be disappointed by what Double Fine are offering. The game isn’t bad by any means; it looks beautiful and the last few seconds of Vella’s story really makes me interested in what will happen next. But so far I can’t recommend Broken Age to any seasoned adventurers, with this two hour unoriginal and uninspired first act. Telltale has grown this genre so much. Why are you treading backwards, Double Fine?			"

												Honestly this has been an amazing game to play, the graphics are fun, the storyline is interesting and has its comedic moments. I'd recommend this game for those that would like a more interesting plotline to follow and wouldn't mind the fact that you point and click to move around. It was a fun experience for me and i'm sure you'll love it too.			"

												I loved it!  I've enjoyed several other classic point-and-clicks: Monkey Island I and II, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Day of the Tentacle, and Full Throttle, and I think this one makes a fresh and interesting contribution to that library.  The art and music direction is fantastic, the voice acting is great, and the humor is done well.  Minor things bothered me in the final puzzle sequence (mostly the music), but overall I liked the game a great deal.  The puzzles in Act I are fairly easy, so most of my enjoyment came from watching the story unfold and interacting with the characters.  In Act II the difficulty increases a bit, which I appreciated.  Online walkthroughs are easy to find, but of course I recommend playing without them as much as possible if you actually want to enjoy hitting those ""Aha!"" moments when you solve particularly challenging puzzles.The ""Double Fine Adventure"" documentary series online is also fun to watch if you're interested in the blood, sweat, tears, and laughter that goes into video game production.9/10			"

 Quick Verdict:Fun to play point and click adventure game and a tribute to the golden age of adventure genre. Get it on 66%~75% sale.Quick Pros:+ 2 Concurrent story lines.+ Good starting story with more than few nice twists.+ Really good art style / direction.+ Some very good voice acting.+ On the better end of point and click puzzles spectrum. Quick Cons:- Mediocre third part of the game.- Bad voice acting for one the main characters.- Some stupid (too easy or doesn't make logical sense) Puzzles.			"

												Broken Age has the same charm that I've come to expect from Schafer's games, like Psychonauts, Costume Quest and Stacking.  The characters are interesting though admittedly one-dimensional (just like most point and click adventure games) and the conversations are mostly quite entertaining.  I think the voice acting is superb as well, especially with the two main characters and the Computer (""Mom"").  The animation and visuals prove that a game does not need super high def SSAO bloom TressFX etc etc to set the atmosphere of a game in the right direction.  The overall aesthetic (visuals, music, ambience) elicit zero complaints from me. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the gameplay.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I found the item hunting a bit tiring at times.  I wish there was a way to speed up conversations, as I generally read much faster than people speak (pressing space will skip the entire conversation, not just the current dialogue with subtitles) and though there are some areas where your character can run, most of the time you walk at a very slow clip.  I'm glad that there isn't much hand holding, but when certain areas open up, it can be a bit annoying to walk back and forth between screens looking for an item I missed. Still, it's not like I did not enjoy the gameplay at all.  I think the clever dialogue (and even off hand remarks as I look at items or walk past characters) cracked me up, and that makes a ton of difference in adventure games.  I had an idea of where the story was heading at first, but now I'm not so sure.  All I know is that Act 2 cannot come soon enough.			"

												Let's get the quibbles out of the way first: It's not immediately apparent why Vella needs to do what she does when she gets to Shellmound, and the occasional lack of variety in ""I can't use these things together"" messages is jarring when considering the great variety on other occasions.That said, Broken Age is a fine throwback to the era of the adventure game.  If you grew up on Monkey Island, you'll find much to love here.  If, however, this is your first foray into the genre, I can think of no better introduction.  Control is simple without invoking a dozen or more arcane verbs, puzzles are mostly intuitive, and hand-holding is minimal unless you go out of your way to prolong certain stages of the game.Plus, it has the best Quaker Oats Guy I've ever seen, viewable in my screenshot gallery.

												Only act 1 has been released so far, with 2 to follow sometime very soon. I came in with moderate expectations, and came away with an insanely good Double Fine experience. The game is really funny with the quirky humour you've come to expect from Tim, with a lovely art style that remains consistantly cozy and amazing to look at throughout, no matter the route. Both protags are great for their own merits, and add a lot throughout the two wildly different experiences. Only thing I can say is the length might not be up to par for some people, although at the time of this review take in to account that only one of the acts has been released, so the second part could be wildly longer in length. I took my time throughout, talking to everyone and clicking on different combos to hear what everyone had to say, and I finished Act 1 in 4 hours, which seems to be the general consensus on how long it'll take a typical person to finish it, so keep that in mind.

												Being the most enjoyable game I've ever played since The Walking Dead, Broken Age Act 1 brings to gamers a story unlike no other. Swapping between the lives of Shay and Vella is a really interesting concept, and the puzzles are challenging enough to get your brain working for a few minutes, or in my case, hours! What really made the game shine though was it's colorful cast of characters, music, and artstyle. Tim Schafer did an outstanding job with the first act of this game, with the ending being the biggest mind-blower since Bioshock Infinite. For fan's of puzzle gmaes and games with great storys, this ones for you.10/10			"

												At this point, I might as well proclaim my undying love to Tim Schafer. It seems every title I've touched with him behind the director's chair reminds me why I love video games.Apparently 16 years since his last point-and-click adventure game, Grim Fandango, and the man still knows how to work it. I mean it's not like he wasn't doing anything, with Psychonauts and Brutal Legends druid-plowing themselves into my favorite's list, but point-and-clicks are very different from your normal genre. Practically visual novels; if the story or context doesn't hook you, there's nothing to go back for it aside from meager puzzles.Luckly Broken Age hooks you from the start with both, and beautiful artwork to boot. Shay and Vella's story is nothing new, something we've seen or read plently times before, but Tim Schafer's spin leaves it refreshing. For example, Shay's situation is entirely understandable, where he puts a mental barrier between him and the ""Computer"" who is taking care of him. Although never brought up by Shay or the game itself, it's likely only programmed to take care of him - it isn't true love and concern. Yet all it takes is some lovely voice-work provided by the ever awesome Jennifer Hale and a small story toward Shay, and I can't help but feel sad for ""Computer"". Damn you, Shay, just call her ""Mom"" for once.Contrary to what I'm saying above, the game is light-hearted. Vella's story about sacrificing maidens is not as grim as you'd imagine it to be. No blood or gore, just a small glimpse of a body as it's devoured by a giant species of monster called a Mog. Yet that's part of its charm. Combined with its watercolor artwork and peaceful soundtrack, it's as if I'm reading a children's storybook. Then you eventually come across someone whose name is shortened to Ch't.... heh-heh.All and all, I am very looking forward to Act 2. Having started Shay's story first, I thought I had an idea of where his story ended when I was nearing the end of Vella's. The end of Act 1 practically told me ""Nope,"" punched me in the face, and jumped off a cliff. I'd pay again in order for it to come sooner, but like everyone else, I'll have to wait for the free update... whenever that is.C'mon, Tim. Don't do this to me, man. I needs it. I needs it now~			"

												A simple point and click with a lot of heart. The characters are charming, the voice acting is superb, and while the puzzles may seem simple, I enjoyed them and found them rather clever without being too non-sequiter, like some other point-and-click adventures. A tad short, but this is only part one. Part two will add to the charm and make this game really great. Double Fine is very good at making games that feel like homages to their genre, and Broken Age is no exception. It's an excellent point and click adventure.			"

												I'll rate the full game (both Act 1 and 2) for what it is given the $15 price point I backed it for. This disregards things such as release time and anything about the developers.I enjoyed it very much. The artstyle is very cute, the dialog is funny, and the puzzles are just the right difficulty. The length of the game is roughly around 15 hours depending on how thorough you play the game (interacting with every object with every object, trying to extract every bit of dialog). The story keeps you engaged, with you wanting to play more to find out the mysteries surrounding the game's events. For the price of $15, it's definitely worth a playthrough when you want to relax and play some point-and-click adventure games.			"

												Broken Age was originally hailed as a great comeback to Double Fine's origins, the adventure point and clicks of LucasArts.While Broken Age certainly has good audio and visual design, the gameplay is incredibly lacking. No puzzle is really difficult, you don't really have to do anything too advanced, and I don't think you even have more than 6 items in your inventory at a time.The locations also match this lacking gameplay. Very few locations that therefore limits the game to less characters and less depth. The locations also bother me, because although it fits the style, the art is very plain and the backgrounds are way less detailed than that of other modern point and clicks, such as the remake of Monkey Island or The Whispered World.I know I shouldn't be whining when the game has a 2nd part in the works, but judging by how most of the $3.3+ million budget was put into this first part and how Tim Schaefer wanted to get some Early Access money to fund the second part, I can only predict that the second part will be just as disappointing.Double Fine is capable of much better things than this. Maybe they should stick to publishers and make sure that someone that isn't a complete fanboy believes that they have a good idea.			"

Any way it ended up with this sort of children’s-game that is enormously annoying to play. The voice-over lines and the childish approach makes me frustrated.  There is some good art and mildly interesting aspects of the game design, but it does not justify the tedious and time consuming trail-and-error “gameplay” you have to go through. The game and the its universe might fun and interesting for children, though some puzzles are a bit difficult.			"

Posted: May 4, 2015
												Having now played both Act 1 and Act 2, I feel the need to completely edit and amend my earlier review:This is an interesting concept for a game. You start out with the option to choose between two characters, and you can jump back and forth between their separate stories at will. The hand-painted character designs, locations, and background art are completely unique and absolutely beautiful.  I would recommend playing through for the visuals alone. I also really dig the musical score and the voice acting. In general, the production values are incredibly high.For the most part, the puzzles in Act 1 are easy.  If I was stumped it was either because I was over-analyzing the situation, or it was because I failed to pick up an item earlier in the game and needed to backtrack.In Act 2, many of the puzzles are still intuitive, but there are some that are more complicated or frustrating than they need to be, and there are others that require information and clues found in the other character's storyline. You will *need* to switch back and forth between playing as Shay and playing as Vella at regular intervals, and you will need to pay careful attention to every item description, detail shot, and offhand dialogue comment.  Throughout the game there is a fair bit of comedy, more so in Shay's story than Vella's.  Make sure to talk to everyone, examine everything, and to use each object with every other object/person in order to get all the flavour dialogue.  The spoon and knife are particularly amusing.I had initially disliked the plot of Act 1 because it felt very misogynistic, and even now I am still slightly bothered by Vella's story. I think what the writers were going for was to show current women's struggles (limited options, needing to prove their inherent worth to the world, needing to sometimes be overly-aggressive to make their voices heard, having a cultural obligation to put the needs of others above their own, etc.) within the context of a familiar sci-fi/fantasy plot device (virgin sacrifice). Unfortunately, the way the writing was handled made it seem like just another case of lazy violence against women, and made her and everyone else around her look petty and cruel. I think they could have explored the same issues in a less offensive manner and been more successful; however, after playing through the entire Meriloft section in Act 2, I have restored faith that the intentions of Act 1 were indeed positive, even if the execution was flawed.Shay's story, on the other hand, is wryly humorous, immediately relatable, and culturally relevant. We understand over-protective helicopter parents, we commiserate with his teenage desire to be grown up and take risks, and we are sympathetic to his need to take on responsibility and do something important and heroic with his life. The issue is that juxtaposed against one another, the stories of Act 1, at least on the surface, come across as ""white boy who feels entitled to more control"" vs. ""female PoC who just wants the right to live,"" rather than ""kids who want autonomy,"" whether that's what the writers intended or not, and it at once both highlights and re-enforces cultural inequalities. Act 2 does a better overall job with the writing; the main characters are more well-rounded and developed, the side characters are deeper, there is a greater sense of balance and equality, the plot hook is more compelling, and within the first five minutes they threw some major twists in I wasn't anticipating. At the same time, they also introduced plot holes you can drive a bus through, and they don't answer any of the meaningful questions they raise. I expected with the amount of time and resources at their disposal they could have created a coherent well-thought-out conclusion, but it felt rushed, unsatisfying, and nonsensical.Act 2 also gets mixed marks in other categories:I liked that Vella and Shay get to learn about each other's backgrounds, but for the most part you spend your time backtracking through the same exact screens you saw in Act 1. (Navigating around each location can be a bit of a slog, but double-clicking will expedite your characters' movements.)Also, while I like the idea of achievements, it took some of the joy out of playing when I saw they were for things like ""do this really long and onerous sequence in one shot"" or ""pick the right answer on the first try instead of exploring the other dialogue options"" or ""speed run this not-very-fun game in an hour."" Those kinds of achievements don't lend themselves to an adventure game.I'm not sure what to rate the complete game, honestly. As a point-and-click puzzle-adventure, it's adequate, with a couple of frustrating puzzles overshadowing the otherwise decent gameplay. As an art piece, it's production values, acting, and music are beautiful. As a story, many of the individual concepts and characters are great, but the overarching plot is full of holes and uses a passe trope for its macguffin, and it also dodges answering any of the meaty questions it raises. As a piece of social commentary, it sends mixed signals. As a comedy, it has several moments of brilliance and a few cringe-worthy duds. As a game that crowd-sourced more than 8x the needed funds and then took 3 years to complete, I was hoping for better. I guess that now leaves it somewhere in the 5.5-6/10 range. I would not pay the full $25 for it.			"

There is some good art and mildly interesting aspects of the game design, but it does not justify the tedious and time consuming trail-and-error “gameplay” you have to go through. The game and the its universe might fun and interesting for children, though some puzzles are a bit difficult.			"

												This game is set in 2 parts. The first one is so easy that is almost insulting, and since that was a big complain from backers and reviewers, the have the second part being extremely dificult for no reason, with tons of puzzles that come out of nowehere and requiere both characters to solve despite them being in total diferent scenarios.I disliked the game and finishing it turn into a chore, but after that it gets worst for achievement hunters, with tons of achievements about solving puzzles on the first try despite being try and error, related to pure luck or just dumb and confusing for the sake of it.You can watch my game library and you´ll see I´m an adventure game enthusiast, from the narrative shows of TellTale, till the pixel art of Wadjet Eye and passing through the classic Lucas Arts games and, yes, the good Double Fine properties that Schafer got back a few years ago. And I enjoy every single one of those games, this one however was painful and the only thing possitive I have to say is that I liked the art and the voice acting, but if you don´t like or you´re indiferent to the art style, and if voice acting isn´t somethign that makes games worth buying for you, then I wouldn´t recommend this game even to an adventure gamer, hell, I wouldn´t even recommended to my enemies.

												Having now played both Act 1 and Act 2, I feel the need to completely edit and amend my earlier review:This is an interesting concept for a game. You start out with the option to choose between two characters, and you can jump back and forth between their separate stories at will. The hand-painted character designs, locations, and background art are completely unique and absolutely beautiful.  I would recommend playing through for the visuals alone. I also really dig the musical score and the voice acting. In general, the production values are incredibly high.For the most part, the puzzles in Act 1 are easy.  If I was stumped it was either because I was over-analyzing the situation, or it was because I failed to pick up an item earlier in the game and needed to backtrack.In Act 2, many of the puzzles are still intuitive, but there are some that are more complicated or frustrating than they need to be, and there are others that require information and clues found in the other character's storyline. You will *need* to switch back and forth between playing as Shay and playing as Vella at regular intervals, and you will need to pay careful attention to every item description, detail shot, and offhand dialogue comment.  Throughout the game there is a fair bit of comedy, more so in Shay's story than Vella's.  Make sure to talk to everyone, examine everything, and to use each object with every other object/person in order to get all the flavour dialogue.  The spoon and knife are particularly amusing.I had initially disliked the plot of Act 1 because it felt very misogynistic, and even now I am still slightly bothered by Vella's story. I think what the writers were going for was to show current women's struggles (limited options, needing to prove their inherent worth to the world, needing to sometimes be overly-aggressive to make their voices heard, having a cultural obligation to put the needs of others above their own, etc.) within the context of a familiar sci-fi/fantasy plot device (virgin sacrifice). Unfortunately, the way the writing was handled made it seem like just another case of lazy violence against women, and made her and everyone else around her look petty and cruel. I think they could have explored the same issues in a less offensive manner and been more successful; however, after playing through the entire Meriloft section in Act 2, I have restored faith that the intentions of Act 1 were indeed positive, even if the execution was flawed.Shay's story, on the other hand, is wryly humorous, immediately relatable, and culturally relevant. We understand over-protective helicopter parents, we commiserate with his teenage desire to be grown up and take risks, and we are sympathetic to his need to take on responsibility and do something important and heroic with his life. The issue is that juxtaposed against one another, the stories of Act 1, at least on the surface, come across as ""white boy who feels entitled to more control"" vs. ""female PoC who just wants the right to live,"" rather than ""kids who want autonomy,"" whether that's what the writers intended or not, and it at once both highlights and re-enforces cultural inequalities. Act 2 does a better overall job with the writing; the main characters are more well-rounded and developed, the side characters are deeper, there is a greater sense of balance and equality, the plot hook is more compelling, and within the first five minutes they threw some major twists in I wasn't anticipating. At the same time, they also introduced plot holes you can drive a bus through, and they don't answer any of the meaningful questions they raise. I expected with the amount of time and resources at their disposal they could have created a coherent well-thought-out conclusion, but it felt rushed, unsatisfying, and nonsensical.Act 2 also gets mixed marks in other categories:I liked that Vella and Shay get to learn about each other's backgrounds, but for the most part you spend your time backtracking through the same exact screens you saw in Act 1. (Navigating around each location can be a bit of a slog, but double-clicking will expedite your characters' movements.)Also, while I like the idea of achievements, it took some of the joy out of playing when I saw they were for things like ""do this really long and onerous sequence in one shot"" or ""pick the right answer on the first try instead of exploring the other dialogue options"" or ""speed run this not-very-fun game in an hour."" Those kinds of achievements don't lend themselves to an adventure game.I'm not sure what to rate the complete game, honestly. As a point-and-click puzzle-adventure, it's adequate, with a couple of frustrating puzzles overshadowing the otherwise decent gameplay. As an art piece, it's production values, acting, and music are beautiful. As a story, many of the individual concepts and characters are great, but the overarching plot is full of holes and uses a passe trope for its macguffin, and it also dodges answering any of the meaty questions it raises. As a piece of social commentary, it sends mixed signals. As a comedy, it has several moments of brilliance and a few cringe-worthy duds. As a game that crowd-sourced more than 8x the needed funds and then took 3 years to complete, I was hoping for better. I guess that now leaves it somewhere in the 5.5-6/10 range. I would not pay the full $25 for it.			"

												I was in the middle of a 10 pages review when I accidentally kicked the power cord and the computer turned off. So I'll make this brief.Yes, I recommend it. Buy the game.Strong point: story. Very clever and surprising. Broken Age ditched all those verbs from the first adventure games. I think that's actually an advance, these things always felt hacky, sometimes there were redundant verbs and you never knew exactly what to do, do I USE a door or OPEN it? Eventually the verbs shrunk to less actions, like full throttle's intuitive wheel. But it was still questionable, what does HAND means I'll do? punch? pick it up? OK, I am glad we got over that but the fact is that more options than simply clicking gives more dimensions to the puzzles and Broken Age feels easy and linear in the puzzle department. Maybe there's a sweet spot between plain click and verbs that makes sense.I may be swimming against the stream here but I don't like the voice acting. It's not bad acting though, I think they don't know how to deliver Tim Shafer's very dry humor writing, everything sounds like a children's cartoon and it's not as funny as it could be.UPDATE FOR EPISODE 2:Everything I said before still holds but I want to make an extra comment on the voice acting. I HATE VELLA'S VOICE. Most of the voices are pretty bad, missing the jokes and all, but serviceable, except hers goes the extra mile and makes me hate the parts of the game I have to play as her. It's like they wrote all of Vella's lines in a book and had someone read it to children as bedtime story, recorded it, and called it voice acting. It's bad. Really, really bad.I still like the story. It got a little messy and confusing near the end though (still better than several classic adventure games). There were some clever puzzles. I laughed on occasion. Besides my dislike for the voice acting (and hatred for Vella's voice in particular) it's a good adventure game.			"

												My husband and I decided to play this game together. We took turns; he controlled Shay and I controlled Vella, and I would have to say that this worked out beautifully. I would recommend other couples try this, or perhaps parents with children (not super young children because it gets a bit scary at times).  You can switch back and forth between the two characters at any time, and when you finish one character’s story it automatically jumps to the other character. We enjoyed the game itself. The artwork and voice acting were amazing. The puzzles were pretty doable for the most part. There was only one time we were both stuck, but there were a few times one of us was stuck and the other was able to jump in with suggestions. This made our experience all the more enjoyable. We also really liked being able to discuss our theories about how the two characters were going to intersect, and the surprise ending of part one made us glad we shared our theories because we were pretty far off the mark and it was nice to share the revelation with other person present. All in all, I would recommend Broken Age as a game for anyone who likes adventure games or point and click games, or for anyone who loves a good story, but I would doubly recommend you play it with another person. It’s definitely a game that is better when shared.  "

												Broken Age is an Adventure, which is mostly thought for kids, but it makes a lot of fun for older ones too.The Game is build up simple, funny and sometimes kind of tricky.You Play the two charakters, one in a kind of an space ship, the boy shay, the other in a little village, the girl vella.Its very exciting to watch their own world and their own problems, which sometimes have some great supprises for you.Vella, whos always in dangour and mets allong her way many very stupid People. She seems to has a lot more intellect, than the other and thats often difficult to handle for her, while Shay is allone on this Big Space Ship with the KI playing his Father and his mother. He´s always searching for an real Adventure, without having any real knowledge, about what hes really doing.To come to a conclusion I think Broken Age is a very funny and Great Adveture, just for the first part, which is really nice to play and makes a good difference to the games you normally play instead. It´s really worth it			"

												I didn't back this game during the kickstarter and I didn't play it until it was fully released. I intentionally kept myself in the dark to not create expectations and not to spoil myself fun of discovering the game on my own.Wow this game looks good. The art style is gorgeous, music is great. It is obvious that a lot of work went into presentation. Animation for each conversation seems to be hand-crafted, so if you have an eye for details you will find many things to enjoy. Sadly the other parts of the game aren't that interesting. Puzzles are occasionally fun but nothing groundbreaking. In the later stages of the game, when it attempts to provide more challenging puzzles BA falls into a trap of being quite abstract. You will do some things, which really don't make sense within the context of the story. Story itself is enjoyable but disjointed and not particularly convincing. Still it was good enough to keep me interested for the duration of the game. There are some intriguing ideas but overall it is a very silly tale.I think it is good game but not a brilliant one. If you are looking for something on the level of the Longest Journey, Siberia or Grim Fandango... well, play those. Broken Age is a weaker kind of p&c - the puzzles stop you from progressing the story, rather than being a way of developing plot and characters.I don't think Broken Age will reopen doors to point&click adventures. It runs into too many problems the old games did and beside presentation it doesn't bring anything new. But if you crave for a new point&click, it is a fun adventure!			"

It will leave you speechless, like any other Double Fine game, that's it.I suggest to start with Vella's story (the girl).The price is a bit too high, especially now that Act2 still has to come out (it will be free, nonetheless), so, if you don't want to pay full price for a 4 hours long interactive story, just wait for some Steam sales, but then BUY IT!

												Broken Age is an Adventure, which is mostly thought for kids, but it makes a lot of fun for older ones too.The Game is build up simple, funny and sometimes kind of tricky.You Play the two charakters, one in a kind of an space ship, the boy shay, the other in a little village, the girl vella.Its very exciting to watch their own world and their own problems, which sometimes have some great supprises for you.Vella, whos always in dangour and mets allong her way many very stupid People. She seems to has a lot more intellect, than the other and thats often difficult to handle for her, while Shay is allone on this Big Space Ship with the KI playing his Father and his mother. He´s always searching for an real Adventure, without having any real knowledge, about what hes really doing.To come to a conclusion I think Broken Age is a very funny and Great Adveture, just for the first part, which is really nice to play and makes a good difference to the games you normally play instead. It´s really worth it			"

The story is absolutely wonderfull (great plot twist), the graphics are not graphics but beautifull watercolors and pencil drawings, the humor is Schaefer at his best... just can't wait for Act 2!!!I loved playing this game!

												I didn't back this game during the kickstarter and I didn't play it until it was fully released. I intentionally kept myself in the dark to not create expectations and not to spoil myself fun of discovering the game on my own.Wow this game looks good. The art style is gorgeous, music is great. It is obvious that a lot of work went into presentation. Animation for each conversation seems to be hand-crafted, so if you have an eye for details you will find many things to enjoy. Sadly the other parts of the game aren't that interesting. Puzzles are occasionally fun but nothing groundbreaking. In the later stages of the game, when it attempts to provide more challenging puzzles BA falls into a trap of being quite abstract. You will do some things, which really don't make sense within the context of the story. Story itself is enjoyable but disjointed and not particularly convincing. Still it was good enough to keep me interested for the duration of the game. There are some intriguing ideas but overall it is a very silly tale.I think it is good game but not a brilliant one. If you are looking for something on the level of the Longest Journey, Siberia or Grim Fandango... well, play those. Broken Age is a weaker kind of p&c - the puzzles stop you from progressing the story, rather than being a way of developing plot and characters.I don't think Broken Age will reopen doors to point&click adventures. It runs into too many problems the old games did and beside presentation it doesn't bring anything new. But if you crave for a new point&click, it is a fun adventure!			"

												I was in the middle of a 10 pages review when I accidentally kicked the power cord and the computer turned off. So I'll make this brief.Yes, I recommend it. Buy the game.Strong point: story. Very clever and surprising. Broken Age ditched all those verbs from the first adventure games. I think that's actually an advance, these things always felt hacky, sometimes there were redundant verbs and you never knew exactly what to do, do I USE a door or OPEN it? Eventually the verbs shrunk to less actions, like full throttle's intuitive wheel. But it was still questionable, what does HAND means I'll do? punch? pick it up? OK, I am glad we got over that but the fact is that more options than simply clicking gives more dimensions to the puzzles and Broken Age feels easy and linear in the puzzle department. Maybe there's a sweet spot between plain click and verbs that makes sense.I may be swimming against the stream here but I don't like the voice acting. It's not bad acting though, I think they don't know how to deliver Tim Shafer's very dry humor writing, everything sounds like a children's cartoon and it's not as funny as it could be.UPDATE FOR EPISODE 2:Everything I said before still holds but I want to make an extra comment on the voice acting. I HATE VELLA'S VOICE. Most of the voices are pretty bad, missing the jokes and all, but serviceable, except hers goes the extra mile and makes me hate the parts of the game I have to play as her. It's like they wrote all of Vella's lines in a book and had someone read it to children as bedtime story, recorded it, and called it voice acting. It's bad. Really, really bad.I still like the story. It got a little messy and confusing near the end though (still better than several classic adventure games). There were some clever puzzles. I laughed on occasion. Besides my dislike for the voice acting (and hatred for Vella's voice in particular) it's a good adventure game.			"

												I really enjoyed Act 1 for this game. The puzzles weren't too difficult, but not overly simple either. I loved the story line, and how you could play and switch between two characters at a time. It's absolutely beautiful and a very entertaining game; once I started playing I didn't finish until I had completed it.Unfortunately, Act 2 was not the same. When I first saw that Act 2 was finally coming out, I was extremely excited. I had been looking forward to seeing the conclusion after so long, sadly though it was not nearly as good as the first act was in some aspects.The art style was just as good, if not better. A very beautiful game. The story line got incrediably interesting, with some twists I didn't expect. The most important aspect, though, are the puzzles which was the biggest downfall of this act. They were overly ridiculous, things you wouldn't ever even remotely expect and were absolutely absurd in their logic. Without a walkthrough (which I never had to use in the first act) I would not have been able to complete this game. I was shocked at how much different this game was, and I could feel that the developers may have rushed it, or completely concentrated in other areas that weren't the mechanics of the game itself.All in all, I really enjoyed the first half of this game, not so much the second half. I'm giving this a thumbs up solely based on the story line, art style, and Act 1 as far as the game mechanics go. Please read other reviews and get more input before deciding to spend $25 on this game. Act 1 was definitely worth the money, Act 2 was not.			"

												I'm going to save an overall recommendation for when Part Two releases in 2015, but Broken Age is pretty good, so far. It's super pretty, and its characters are quite cool, but Part Two needs to make gameplay a teensy bit more interesting, and significantly flesh out the story.			"

												In a world where most games involve an hour of intense highly focused gameplay, Broken Age broke the mold.  Be prepared to be transported into a pastel world, where you are lead screen to screen in a fun and light-hearted manner.  The knock on this game is that the puzzles are a bit easy, but the world is so transcendent and beautiful it's guaranteed to carve into your memory.Really an excellent game that deserves all of it's accolades, this one is worth every penny.

I ended up paying the price for a full game for maybe 3 - 4 hours of content and a promise additional content would be released within a few months. Almost a full year ahead and nothing new appeared. This also illustrates we (gamers) should be careful when buying unfinished games like these. Next time I would definately hold off buying ""episodic"" games until all content is released.			"

												While I loved games like Grim Fandango and Monkey Island,  I have to say this game combines great story telling, heartwarming animation, user-experience and puzzle design in way that simply surpasses the former greats.I seem to have a different opinion than many, and that is likely due to the fact that I played Act 1&2 together.  Waiting several months and then playing in mostly the same settings I suppose could be disappointing, but if played together actually makes the game feel seamless and natural, and in fact the story is as well thought-out as it is whimsical. I think the same is true with puzzle difficulty: the puzzles progressively get harder over the course of Act 1&2, which makes sense.  Yes, there are times when I got stuck, but that just made figuring them out satisfying. I think one or two puzzles required a pencil and paper (or memorization) in Act 2, which crossed the line for some people.  I would say: 1. the puzzles make sense (enough for an adventure game), and 2. the game is liberal with clues, and 3. no puzzles ""require"" help online.  Kudos to the developers and all involved.  I think there are many stories left to be told in this universe, and I hope we get to see them someday.			"

												OK - Just finished the game and here are my thoughts:What I loved:+ Writing, voice acting and some jokes are clever.+ Variety of weirdly thought out characters such as a talking spoon.+ Plot is clevery written+ Graphics are charming and in 2D.What I didn't like:- There are not much of areas to explore. It felt compact.- While the plot is clevery written, it still does not capture what made classic adventure game stories interesting. There isn't much to get interested in the two main characters (Shay and Vella). We are simply solving their life problems.- Very simplistic point-and-click game. Clicking on an object will automatically trigger whatever the progammer wanted it to be. Sometimes the character would comment on it, sometimes will try to ""activate it"" and sometimes will take it. I'd prefer it if it reused the verb technique, like in Curse of Monkey Island (Look at, Use/Pickup, Talk/Eat).- The puzzles at the end of the game were frustrating and confusing.Verdict: It is a return to classic adventure games alright but I don't see it surpassing my favourite classics (Full Throttle, Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, Sam and Max). However, it is still a recommended game for all those who still want Adventure Games. It is better than whatever Telltale is doing with Game of Thrones, that I can tell ya.			"

												Holy crap, what happened to this game? While Act 1 was a charming, excitingly drawn game with fantastic voice acting and a promise of an interesting story (albeit pretty light on puzzles), Act 2 retains almost none of this. The VA is still superb, and the art looks the same (it is 80% the same, actually) - but the story turns into something incredibly silly, and the puzzle design is easily the worst I've seen in a long, long time. I could stomach Act 1 taking almost 2 years, but I see absolutely no reason why Act 2 took 14 further months.I backed this game, and I'm fine with that as the journey itself was interesting, but the end product... oh no.

I love Tim's work, and this is probably the only thing I can think of that spoils his record. Skip it, and either if you haven't already go for the classics such as Monkey Island 2, DOTT, Grim Fandango. If you already have then try Deponia if you haven't already, I personally enjoyed it a lot more than this.			"

												If you would call act 1 a rather beautiful childish point and click adventure then act 2 you could easily call a total diaster. The story is vastly incomplete in my opinion and the puzzle are way too far stretch. There are so many puzzles that I can't imagine anyone would be able to figure out without looking at guides. Too bad, I really liked act 1.			"

												Just pass on this. Seriously, it isn't worth the time.If you were excited like I was that Tim Schafer would be making a game the same calibur as Grim Fandango, this is not it. Instead, go buy Deponia: The Complete Journey and enjoy the game that Broken Age should have been.Here's the long version:Tim Schafer wrote and directed Grim Fandango, which I believe is the best point and click adventure game of all time. I say that with confidence as I've played a huge amount of adventure games (ags anyone?). Schafer, as it turns out, is a horrible project lead. Broken Age was kickstarted for over 3 million dollars which gave players Act 1. Act 1 took me about  2 hours to complete, and was fine. Just fine, it was not a game that should have taken 3 million dollars to complete and other studios have done more with much, much less. After the game released, Double Fine announced they had enough money to complete the project and deliver the abysmal Act 2.But not everybody really cares about the politics of the game, so here's some extra stuff for the passionate adventure gamer:The ""good"":Might as well start here as there is so little.Act 1 was okay. The puzzles were fair and made sense, and it did create this idea of some dark story beneath the kid friendly veil. Had Double Fine continued immediately from this point and used their 3 mil to make the entire game, I think it would have been fantastic.The bad:While the puzzles in act 1 were fair and made sense, they were very easy. It just didn't take a lot to get through it, leading to the very short 2 hour runtime. Act 1 soaked up all 3 million dollars and was only 2 hours long. As previously mentioned, Act 1's story was pretty good and gave the sense that there was something much darker in the story than we got from the frilly and colorful aesthetics. For example, at the end Vella's arc: The sacrifices are eaten by Mog Chothra and we are pretty much led to believe that they're dead. This is proved wrong in act 2, where we find that they're a-ok inside a prison cell in Mog Chothra, which is also a spaceship for some reason.The worst part about the game is act 2. Following the story from act 1, act 2 feels like it was written long after act 1 ended and they never really knew where they were going with the story. In fact, I found this on wikipedia: ""In October 2014, producer Greg Rice announced that Schafer had finished writing Act 2 and the game's finale."". But the game released on January 28 of the same year. So after 3 million dollars, and a moderately successful release, Tim Schafer didn't even know how the game would end. And that should tell you all you need to know about how funky act 2 feels. I won't even bring up the awful wire puzzle later in the game. Others have, and everybody hates it.So there you have it, it took 3 million dollars to make a mediocre, 2 hour adventure game with a cliffhanger, and the sales from that (probably not 3 million btw) paid for an awful act 2.Just... just go play Deponia.

												Broken Age is a love letter to the classic adventure game by a classic developer, and it shows. If that's your bag, you'll enjoy this beautiful and quirky game. If you don't like adventure style games, your not gonna like it.When it's strong, it's incredible. The dialogue and characters are memorable, the setting is unique, the duel story lines that criss-cross through two colliding worlds are legitimately interesting. When the worlds do collide, the different view points are interesting. 99% of the puzzles will make you think without being unsolvable. Here's a tip: flipping back and forth between the pair is essential to solve some of the later puzzles, and some hints apply to multiple puzzles.When it's weak, it's still palatable. There are sections and background I would have loved to see more of, and a few parts that feel rushed. There are a few points where it suffers from 'clickitus', where you end up trying to use everything you have everywhere and with everyone to progress forward. While most of these appears obvious in hindsight, there are two cases where I was stupefied by the puzzle logic.From my experience, I'd say it has around a 8 to 12 hour play time if you don't seek out any hints online, about 4 to 6 if your the type who just can't resist looking up hints when you get stuck. The inventory and controls are good, and the art is amazing.TL;DR version: 8/10.			"

												I will be probably editing this (ongoing) review once I finish this game, but as I am playing this game I have to talk about it because it is SO AWESOME!I can't tell you about whether the ending will be good or not, but so far it's such a treat! I can't recommend it enough.If you like Deponia or the likes, then this is a game for you. Though it's a bit more serious than Deponia it has some very hardcore humor subtly integrated into an otherwise innocent looking game.And when I say innocent looking, this game also has some vast darkness to it. I am so mind-blown by the sheer thinking that must have gone into creating it - or it is otherwise a perfect coincidence that this game is such an unparalleled mixture of LIGHT and/vs DARK.			"

												Broken Age is a terrific adventure game full of beautiful art, hilarious writing, and great music. The big name actors did great but they seemed to have the least lines out of the entire cast. Also, the first act is painfully easy and quite short clocking in at about three hours. Act 2 can't arrive fast enough, but maybe wait for the full package when it comes out this summer because three hours worth of game that has zero replayability at $25 is still too steep.			"

												I recommend getting when on sale, it has a good story but a pretty bad ending, more so a boring ending, they have this big thing that leads up to the ending but the actual ending is like ""wait what, thats all you are going to show me"" actually the credits are more of an ending because it shows the aftermath of the game through pictures, i should also mention that in the non space land there is really only 3-4 main areas with smaller areas with usually one guy to talk to so it's mainly backtracking (not in really an annoying way) between different areas so dont expect a huge adventure between a bunch of different lands, still fun but just with a disapointing  ending, worth maybe 10 dollars			"

												Boring game. It's neat on sale but as someone who was a kickstarter backer it was a waste of time and expectation. It could have been a lot more but overall it stikes you as a children's adventure game rather than the 'Double-fine adventure!' I was promised. As someone who likes logical consistency there's a lot of the old-style lucas arts, and third party adventure game puzzle farts where there's an incredible logical leap to solve a puzzle even though it doesn't make much sense and it gives off the impression of being simultaneously lazy and genius at the same time. Not recommended. I would give it a 7.5/10 for art style because while it's not well animated the design is intriguing, and 5/10 for the story because there's no consistency, flow, or real story to speak of besides what is presented topically but there are definitely some interesting concepts which are brushed on the surface but never dug into sadly. Hope you enjoy it more than I did.			"

												I've been following Tim Schafer since the first time I played Psychonauts, and I am always interested in his stuff.  So I picked this game up as soon as I heard it existed.When I played the first chapter of Broken Age, it seemed like it was setting up a lot of thematic elements and mysteries for the second part.  We've got two young people on the cusp of adulthood, questioning the way things have always been, being lied to their whole lives...  There are many different forces and people influencing the way they see the world, and they're finally breaking away and beginning to question those things.In an attempt to avoid spoiling much...  The second act kind of drops the ball on all those ideas.  It takes the thematic elements and makes them literal, and introduces concepts out of nowhere to explain preexisting plots and wrap up the story.  The puzzles also seemed less cohesive in this act.Like, I'd recommend it -- but it wasn't a religious video gaming experience or anything.SPOILERS FOLLOWMy biggest beef with this game is that there are all these unfortunate, sexist subtextual narratives that stem from a minigame in the first act: Shay has some kind of outrageous intuitive ""mateworthy"" radar that makes him, I don't know, uniquely capable of selecting the most appropriate women for procreating???  And then Malik or Malichi or whatever his name is in the second act is straight up implying that all the women sacrificed in the feast aren't MERELY BEING CAPTURED/DEVOURED, no, they are being used to provide genetic material to the super human race -- and then either exhausting their bodies to the point of death, or literally just being killed in the process of extracting the aforementioned genetic material.I cannot believe the epilogue implied everyone was supposed to have made peace after the end of the game.  Like, how else was anyone meant to interpret that?			"

												I went into the game with very low expectations, thanks to all the negative reviews and I was pleasantly surprised.The first half of the game is amazing. The story, characters, puzzles, music and the art style are all really well made. I think it`s worth playing the game for that alone.Then comes the second half which is poorly paced, has many sudden difficulty spikes, nonsense item combinations and a pretty dissapointing ending.I think the positives outweight the negatives for me, but if a bad ending ruins the game for you, then stay away from this game.

This game is awesome, it's Tim Schafer and crew doing what they do best, making old school adventure games. Awesome graphics, clever puzzles, awesome settings and characters... I'm really glad I jumped on this when the Kickstarter showed up. AWESOME ending to Act 1. I can't wait for Act 2 now. It was pretty easy and clocked in under 4 hours, neither of which I mind, but I know other people have had complaints on those areas. If Act 2 is a little longer that's still an 8 or 9 hour adventure.Bring me more games like this! I'm going to go replay the Monkey Island games now.			"

I feel this was definitely worth the money I kickstarted to get it, even just as much as I've played so far.  The story has kept me a little in the dark though so I look forward to some things being explained to me.Honestly this game is very much for fans of Point-and-click adventures.  I would argue that this game is targeted towards a younger audience but with enough older jokes to keep me chuckling.			"

												A beautiful point-and-click adventure game with imaginative locales, witty dialogue, and an engaging coming-of-age story of two youths whose paths collide in an astonishing cliffhanger for Act I of this game.The game is a visual marvel, and is further brought to life with top-notch voice acting. The puzzles are relatively easy, but will still require some more tinkering than say The Walking Dead. If you find yourself stumped with one character's path, you have the freedom of switching to the other, but it is recommended to finish Shay's story first before Vella's. While the game it has it's humourous moments, there is dark undercurrent, coupled with a gender critique that gives it a depth beyond merely being cute.All told, expect to complete Act I in roughly three hours, but with the richness of its atmosphere and detail, you may want to revisit the game to appreciate the interactions of its wonderful universe.

												This game is fun and charming! The musical soundtrack is fantastic (Melbourne Symphony Orchestra!), the art style is appealing.The interesting story element of this game is - you play as two different people from two totally different universes, and you wonder how on earth they can fit together and make one cohesive story.  It's a fun device.  It gives some Day-of-the-Tentacle-like freedom to switch around and try another character when you get stuck.The controls are quite simple, and to me this is a good thing.  There are no verbs to select from, you can either left click on a thing/person to interact with it, and you can drag things from your inventory onto things/people, and that's it - no trying ""use thing, nope, push thing, nope, look at thing, nope, talk to thing, nope, pull thing...ah-ha!"".  The interactable things on the screen have a large clickable area, and the cursor changes to a big ball-thing, so there is no pixel hunting - just run your mouse around once quickly, you find everything interactable very easily.The puzzles gradually get more difficult, and Act 2 has some particularly good brain teasers.  Now that both acts are released, the game length feels just right.This game is also suitable for children.Oh, and don't pay attention to all the downvotes on these reviews, I think they're mostly from some sad internet hate group who got upset about a joke Tim Schafer made, so this is how they get their revenge.  Pretty sad way to spend time eh?			"

												D@$N YOU TIM SCHAFERI need the next part of this game. I need it like breathing. This is everything I could ask for in a game - it has a female lead, it's jaw-droppingly beautiful, it has puzzle gameplay I damn near grew up on, it has a $%#&*$@ AWESOME SOUNDTRACK, and it has the kind of characterization and writing that I have not seen in any AAA title in at least a year.This game is a shining pearl of beauty rising from a sea of barnacle-encrusted pretenders. I've spent weeks looking for something good to play and being constantly disappointed by the legions of clones and sequels and godawful crap stinking up Steam, and then this just drops into my lap like it's Christmas all over again. Not everyone is into the whole adventure game schtick, but if you are, FOR THE LOVE OF ZEUS just buy this and play it through in one sitting. I don't care who thinks $25 is too much for it; those people are clearly pants-on-head crazy.Now I'm going to go buy some Steam credit and gift it to everyone who will listen to me babbling like a lunatic.

												It's a beauty to watch, the characters are all amazing, the dialogue is sparkling, and I finished the game feeling better about myself than I did before I played it, because this game has a huge heart, and is lovingly funny. If there's anything more delightful to my hardened SF warrior's heart than a sentence like ""Initiating Warp and Woof Drive"" I haven't come across it yet. Normally I speed read through dialogue and I was initially annoyed not to be able to do it here, but the voice acting is so good I never minded hearing anything through at least once, and used the 'skip scene' option when necessary. The puzzles are made easier by careful descriptions and error messages, and you can fail multiple times. I'm very happy to have had a chance to play this.			"

												Just got through act one as yesterday. I am a backer for the game and absolutely loved all the old lucas arts point and click adventure games. With that being said, I have not had enough time on my hands to watch many of the episodes they have posted on the documentry. However, I watched enough to have an idea of what the game was going to be like. As I played through my first thoughts were really how unique this game was as compared to some of the older games (i.e the monkey islands, day of the tentacle, etc...) in terms of the art work, the interactions between characters and items and everything seemed very thought out. But there is deffinetly a relatable feel to this game cooresponding with the older ones. I can tell by playing act one that alot of heart went in to this game and that for me was enough for five stars.However, there is much more than heart visible in this game so far. The moderetly challenging(with harder ones to come in following acts according to doublefine) puzzles give the game the classical point and click feel. However I found when trying to use items with multiple people, there would be unique and different dialoge for pretty much every person! This for me was a huge shift in the right direction! It adds that subtlety to the gameplay that I feel will be vital for the survival of future point and click adventure games. And if that was not enough for you, the plot(so far) is absolutely genious, in my opinion one of Tim Schafer's best! The twists and turns really bring you along for the ride, and you never feel bored or left out. So with the bar being set with the release of act one, I hope that the rest of the game can live up to the expectations. I hope to see more challenging puzzles, and can't wait to see how the story will develop. I hope and expect to see the rest of the game will leave me jaw dropped just as act one did! And to the all staff of doublefine on board with this project - Great job guys! This one really blew me away!!! I can't wait to see what adventures await our two protagonist in the story! This one, so far, is truly a stroke of genius! Keep up the fantastic work!!!!			"

												Broken Age is the game that launched a thousand Kickstarters... well, not really as Kickstarter existed 3 years prior to but I digress.  The original Double Fine Adventure arguably brought Kickstarter into the mainstream light.  After suffering a series of delays and controversial pre-production images that questioned the infamous ""3.3 million dollar"" funding, how does the final product hold up?Very well.  Broken Age is a game of unrequited vision: a product designed by visionaries for a very specific audience.  The title of the game represents  adolescents, the titular ""Broken Age"" being the lives of the two protagonists who are caught in the pains of growing up.  Vella was groomed to be sacrificed to a monster and Shay lives his life aboard a ship run by a coddling AI.  Through a series of events the two characters break free from routine and challenge their place in life.  The result is a game that looks like a Little Golden Book and contains writing that's both light hearted and darkly comedic.People expecting a puzzle heavy logic adventure like the classic LucasArts days will be disappointed.  There's little challenge here and nothing is really taxing on the mind.  But like Telltale's recent titles, Broken Age's strength lies in its presentation.  It is all style, little substance, but the style is more than entertaining to make up for its shortcomings.  This is only part 1 of the game and runs 3 to 3 1/2 hours but the cliffhanger ending was enough to grab me for the second part instantly.			"

I mean, if you wonder weather it is worth buying or not and you like point&click games the answer is yes. For a decent price you will get a full game containing a weird world with lovely visuals, nice music, witty dialogs, amusing characters, a bunch of puzzles of varying difficulty and a talking tree who is sick of its parents asking it when it will have fruits. And if you find a puzzle too difficult you can always look into the steam community where you can find solutions to everything.			"

												I've been following Tim Schafer since the first time I played Psychonauts, and I am always interested in his stuff.  So I picked this game up as soon as I heard it existed.When I played the first chapter of Broken Age, it seemed like it was setting up a lot of thematic elements and mysteries for the second part.  We've got two young people on the cusp of adulthood, questioning the way things have always been, being lied to their whole lives...  There are many different forces and people influencing the way they see the world, and they're finally breaking away and beginning to question those things.In an attempt to avoid spoiling much...  The second act kind of drops the ball on all those ideas.  It takes the thematic elements and makes them literal, and introduces concepts out of nowhere to explain preexisting plots and wrap up the story.  The puzzles also seemed less cohesive in this act.Like, I'd recommend it -- but it wasn't a religious video gaming experience or anything.SPOILERS FOLLOWMy biggest beef with this game is that there are all these unfortunate, sexist subtextual narratives that stem from a minigame in the first act: Shay has some kind of outrageous intuitive ""mateworthy"" radar that makes him, I don't know, uniquely capable of selecting the most appropriate women for procreating???  And then Malik or Malichi or whatever his name is in the second act is straight up implying that all the women sacrificed in the feast aren't MERELY BEING CAPTURED/DEVOURED, no, they are being used to provide genetic material to the super human race -- and then either exhausting their bodies to the point of death, or literally just being killed in the process of extracting the aforementioned genetic material.I cannot believe the epilogue implied everyone was supposed to have made peace after the end of the game.  Like, how else was anyone meant to interpret that?			"

For only five hours of gameplay I would have expected this to be $10 or less. I feel cheated.			"

												I've had mixed feelings for this game when the first part came out. I didn't like the ""coming of age"" story concept (not my issues anymore), I didn't like the setting (childish fantasy-world), the dialogue wasn't all that witty/funny, and the puzzles were simplistic. HOWEVER, as the hours trickled by, I slowly came to like that game. It was the little details that reminded me of Tim Schafer's previous games.Then came the awesome end of Act I, and then Act II is pure awesomeness. The puzzles were multi-layered and fun, the characters were developed some more, and the game felt like it should have been like this from the start. So ultimately, I had a great time.I would also like to praise the custom interface for all the different puzzles - this was done really well, much better than in many of the old adventure games, where this was always the biggest problem (fighting the monster in Grim Fandango or racing in Full Throttle).

												I wanted to like Broken Age, I really did. The first half of the game, released all the way back in January 2014, is absolutely incredible. Sure, the puzzles were a tad easy at times, but I'd rather have that than the ridiculously obtuse ""adventure game logic"" based puzzles that the genre had been plagued with. For me at least, point and click adventure games have always been about telling a story. And the story of Broken Age Act I was absolutely brimming with promise. It took on universal coming of age themes in a clever, lighthearted way, with a quirky cast of characters and a healthy dose of humor to round out the mix.Unfortunately, it was too good to last. Act II, released in April 2015, fell short in almost every area Act I had previously succeeded in. The art and music remained as good as ever, but the story became a cliche ridden mess that abandoned many of the first act's thematic elements in favor of a much simpler resolution. The puzzle quality took a massive hit as well. Adventure game logic is back in full force here, locking the (increasingly disappointing) story progression behind a gauntlet of infuriating mind-twisters. I'm not terribly good at adventure games, so I often find myself having to consult walkthroughs even for well designed ones. However, I can tell when my inability to solve a puzzle is due to my own shortcomings (as was the case with much of Gemini Rue, for example), and when the puzzle itself is just plain stupid (as was the case with Broken Age Act II).I've seen a lot of stories, across many mediums, that fall short of their original promise in the later acts. However, Broken Age takes that to an absolutely mind-boggling level. It went from one of the best games I'd ever played to one of the worst just past the halfway point. If you're curious about the premise, picking it up on sale might be worth it just for the amazing first act. However, under no circumstances should you pay full price for what is ultimately a huge letdown.			"

												Ignore the amount of hours played; just the completionist attitude, and I'm pretty sure I left it on overnight. The sad fact is Broken Age really was BROKEN. Most of the puzzles didn't feel like puzzles, and this game does that awful thing where it FORCES you to only use ONE solution, rather than SEVERAL. Point and Click games don't have to be linear, nor do they have to be obvious. This game is both, and tedious to boot. The world-building is minimal and character depth is shallow. I didn't care about any of them really. Spend your money on something else.			"

												So Part 1 of this was a fun but slight little adventure game that promised much now the scenario was established for Part 2.Sadly Part 2 is an illogical, unfocused, unclear game with puzzles that depend on the omniscience of the player as they simply could not be solved via the in-fiction abilities of the protaganists and their impossible co-ordination of actions.This is entirely and completely correct: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/04/29/broken-age-plot/ "

												Broken Age mixes a wonderful story of two perfect strangers chosen to fulfill a great destiny with beautiful hand-painted aesthetics to create one of the best graphic adventures of all time.Divided in two acts (one which came out February 2014, the other April 2015) you control both characters in different environments, having the ability to switch between them at any given time. Sometimes, the actions from one affect the other, which makes some of the puzzles hard and compelling.The story itself is amazing, one the best I've ever seen. Combining sci-fi with fantasy, finally creating one of the best atmospheres you could imagine for this kind of game.Totally recommended.___________________________________Original reviewPosted: 20 Feb, 2014 @ 7:38pm""Broken Age's only flaw is being episodic. Well, not even a flaw. I mean, I just want to play the rest of it NOW!Hand painted graphics, wonderful performance, perfect gameplay, compelling story, and top-notch voice acting. What else do you want in a videogame?A prime example of how Double Fine excels at videogame making, and how a really good graphic adventure is done. I can't wait for the rest of it to get released!If you like having cliffhangers and enjoy the wait, you should get it now, if not then wait for the rest of the episodes and then get it. It's a superb graphic adventure, and a magnificent piece of art in every sense, in graphics, story, screenwriting, voice acting and gameplay mechanics.""			"

												Broken Age is a modern adventure game with throwbacks to the past and - at least for me - an ideal fusion of both worlds. Background: I'm not a backer, so the game didn't have to live up to a specific promise for me. I used to play adventure games back in the 90ies. I waited until Act 2 was out, before I started playing Act 1&2.There's so much to love. The art style is amazing, charming, well thought out and manages to create a whole real world, partly made out of yarn. Yay! The character design and animations are great. The puzzles in Act 1 are easy enough to welcome newcomers to the genre and quickly ramp up in Act 2 to provide a real challenge and with that a real feeling of accomplishment upon solving them. There are always hints to be found. The writing is brightly witty. The voice acting is top of the line. The ""plot twist"" at the end of Act 1 genuinely surprised me and had me uttering ""what the f..."" maybe 10+ times out loud in a row. Well done.I really liked the transition into Act 2: the character reveals, the expansion of the world and the fact that you had to solve puzzles with things introduced in Act 1. I felt even more at home in Act 2: switching between the characters felt like switching between the characters in Zak McKracken, constructing the tree joke reminded me of the Monkey Island swordmaster insults. I didn't miss the verb interface at all.The only complaint I have is, that you can't load straight from a running game, you have to save+exit to the main menu first. That's it.I'd strongly recommend Broken Age to everyone interested in puzzles, art or humor. It's a monument for what can be achieved with love, talent and dedication.			"

												I wanted to like Broken Age, I really did. The first half of the game, released all the way back in January 2014, is absolutely incredible. Sure, the puzzles were a tad easy at times, but I'd rather have that than the ridiculously obtuse ""adventure game logic"" based puzzles that the genre had been plagued with. For me at least, point and click adventure games have always been about telling a story. And the story of Broken Age Act I was absolutely brimming with promise. It took on universal coming of age themes in a clever, lighthearted way, with a quirky cast of characters and a healthy dose of humor to round out the mix.Unfortunately, it was too good to last. Act II, released in April 2015, fell short in almost every area Act I had previously succeeded in. The art and music remained as good as ever, but the story became a cliche ridden mess that abandoned many of the first act's thematic elements in favor of a much simpler resolution. The puzzle quality took a massive hit as well. Adventure game logic is back in full force here, locking the (increasingly disappointing) story progression behind a gauntlet of infuriating mind-twisters. I'm not terribly good at adventure games, so I often find myself having to consult walkthroughs even for well designed ones. However, I can tell when my inability to solve a puzzle is due to my own shortcomings (as was the case with much of Gemini Rue, for example), and when the puzzle itself is just plain stupid (as was the case with Broken Age Act II).I've seen a lot of stories, across many mediums, that fall short of their original promise in the later acts. However, Broken Age takes that to an absolutely mind-boggling level. It went from one of the best games I'd ever played to one of the worst just past the halfway point. If you're curious about the premise, picking it up on sale might be worth it just for the amazing first act. However, under no circumstances should you pay full price for what is ultimately a huge letdown.			"

												I bought this game because it looked interesting and had a lot of postivie hype around it. Honestly, the game is terrible.  The art style is beautiful, but the ""gameplay"" is terrible and the story is meh. It didn't even hold my attention enough to finish the game, which apparently is really short. And as others have noted, this could be more accurately called an interactive movie than a video game. Broken Age is definitely not worth $25. And I don't think it's worth your time even if it were free.			"

												Ignore the amount of hours played; just the completionist attitude, and I'm pretty sure I left it on overnight. The sad fact is Broken Age really was BROKEN. Most of the puzzles didn't feel like puzzles, and this game does that awful thing where it FORCES you to only use ONE solution, rather than SEVERAL. Point and Click games don't have to be linear, nor do they have to be obvious. This game is both, and tedious to boot. The world-building is minimal and character depth is shallow. I didn't care about any of them really. Spend your money on something else.			"

												Y'know, Act 1 is extremely enjoyable with a lot of great world building and character development. It sets itself apart as a story with how much of it you do not expect and the kinds of interactions. Vella's character is a necessary one for modern story telling in gaming, often going almost over the top with how independently driven she is. In her torn pink dress and over sized cloud shoes, she's perfectly iconic. And a girl with a back ground that on a few occasions implies that her (because of family and community) only skill is baking, that is so incredible to have still be the most warrior like character in the whole game.And don't get me wrong, Act 2 was fun and adventurous in the same way, (Shay finally connecting with actual people for the first time in his life and getting to know his family and doing some good, that was great) but I couldn't get through this damn thing without a walk through. SEVERAL walk throughs. Several text anD VIDEO WALK THROUGHS. It was difficult in places that did not need to be difficult. The difficulty in telling a talking tree a joke was set to high. I finished Act 1 in about four hours and Act 2 took twice that.WHY DID THE WIRE PUZZLES HAVE TO BE RANDOMIZED. IT TOOK FIVE GOOGLE SEARCHES TO FIND THAT OUT. IT WAS A PUZZLE ON ITS OWN, GOOD LORD.

												People complained that the first act was too easy. Now they complain that the second act is too hard, There is no pleasing some people. Complaints that the puzzle in the second act can not be solved without random trial and error are largely false. Being observant (like you are supposed to be in these types of games) is enough to deduce the puzzles. However, you will need to switch between Shay and Vella. If you are stuck on one puzzle, change character and move on. Clues for Shay can be found in Vella's story and clues for Vella can be found in Shay's story.All in all this is a fun, funny, challenging game which is visually stunning and has a great story.			"

												The first act of Broken Age is very amazing. A AAA level quality of animation, funny jokes, amazing voice acting, and the most important aspect, the Story, was full of explorations, mysteries, and imagination. You'll keep wondering what happen, why it happen, and what will happen.The second act however, is not as good as the first act. IMO, it's just lazy. You'll just re-exploring the places that you have explored in Act I, and for an adventure game, re-exploring is not fun. Though it still have the same quality of animation, jokes, and voice acting. The story is also a bit lacking, the great thing about act I, is that it makes player keep asking question throughout the game. Unfortunately, in Act II, the important mysteries already solved in the beginning of the game, and the remaining mysteries are remain unsolved until the end.But still, with all the disappointing elements in Act II, Broken Age is still an amazing game. The animation, jokes, and storytelling are something that should not be missed. Just think of it as a great game and it's not-so-good sequel compiled as one.			"

												Worth buying at full price? Nooo way.Worth buying at sale price? Cautiously.

You won't be totally gobsmacked or anything, but they're nice to look at.Sounds are fun too, the poppy soundtrack and voice acting is spot on.Story is interesting so far, we will have to see when Act 2 comes out.Unfortunately, as pretty as this game is, I can't recommend it just yet, as it's basically half a game for way too steep a price.tldr; Game Quality 8/10Value for Money 1/10 (Regular Price)			"

												I really wanted to recommend this game. The writing is great, the general idea is inventive, and it just feels genuine. That said, I cannot recommend this game due to the puzzles. Now, I may be a dolt, but usually after I trudge my way through a puzzle that should not be as difficult as I made it, I understand this and say ""Wow I can't believe I didn't see that."" This game doesn't give you that feeling on more than just a few occasions. Complexity and difficulty are good things, but incoherence is not and I would guess that even the smartest puzzle people spent hours with trial and error at certain points or used a guide. It's sad to see this in a game that might otherwise shine, and what would have been a memorable story with likeable characters becomes obscurred by drawn-out frustration and hindering gameplay.			"

												Short Answer:  This game isn't so much ""bad"" as it is disappointing.  Starts amazingly strong in Act 1, but clearly something went wrong during Act 2's development.  Only buy this game if it's on sale for a maximum of $10.  I'd wait for $7 or $8.Long Answer:  Act 1 was great, amazing even.  The art is wonderful, the story is compelling, the voice acting is great, and the puzzles are interesting.  The game allows you to switch between the apparently-unrelated stories of protagonists Vella and Shay and both have their own mysteries to explore, and puzzles to solve.  The puzzles in Act 1 are great too!  The majority of the puzzles aren't too difficult to solve without help, or too easy to be interesting.  There are a few that aren't as great, but most are pretty good.  The story leaves you feeling like you've completed something, while also leaving you with a cliff-hanger that will bring you back for Act 2Act 2 fails in most of these respects miserably.  The art and voice acting are still up to par, but the rest was disappointing.  The puzzles are mostly impossible-to-guess non sequiturs, which can't even be solved by clicking on everything with everything else like you did in the old adventure game days.  In fact, quite a lot of the puzzles can only be solved by telepathy.  By which I mean Shay and Vella must have a telepathic link because information only available in Vella's story is needed to progress through Shay's, and vice versa.  The rest of the puzzles can only be solved by internet walkthroughs because the logic is so insane.  The story makes about as much sense as the puzzles, and is never really finished by the end of the game.  Act 2 is so out of sync with Act 1 that I can only guess it was either made by totally different people, or something horrible happened during its development.I'd still buy this game just because Act 1 is so strong.  But I'd recommend only getting it at a really deep discount.			"

												Broken Age is without a doubt one of the best point'n'clicks of the last few years. As I mostly liked it, let's focus on what's wrong with it.I'm not a fan of the character design. Those faces, noses especially.There are some sloppily cropped parts of the foreground - artifacts are visible against the backgrounds.Some animations are lacking.There's a lot of backtracking and after the first act you've pretty much seen all areas the game lets you explore. For the rest of the game you'll be walking around them again and again, just with the characters swapped.There are some inconsistencies in the story.The game feels rushed, especially the ending.If they could've just taken the quality from the best parts of the game and keep it throughout the whole thing, Broken Age would not only be one of the best point'n'clicks of the last few years, as mentioned before, but also one of the best adventure games ever created.Overall, objectively 8/10.

												I just finished playing act 1 and 2 and had a lot of fun. The hand-drawn graphics look great, the music underlines the mood and the well-written, volumnious and funny dialogue is backed by fitting voice acting. The story is original and took some surprising turns. The user interface is minimal but functional and works without explicitly selecting verbs to interact with the game objects. The riddles weren't too hard, though later some of them became a little frustrating and took me quite some time to solve. I managed to finish the game withouth looking at hints and too much frustration though. :-)All in all I'm very happy with the game and think that, gameplay-wise, it is quite on par with some of the old titles from Lucasfilm Games (which had some minor quirks, too). I enjoyed it a lot and think this game might be a future classic.			"

												Act 1 made me like adventure games, i have limited experience with the genre and this was a nice sweet entrance.Act 2 made me remember everything i hate about this genre! Incredibly frustrating puzzles!! Even with a guide it was such a pain finishing this game!Play act 1 if you want but if you don't want to taint the good experience of act 1 stay away from act 2!			"

												(Disclosure: I was an early backer, and patiently waited through the delays and whatnot because these things take time and that's fine by me, so this review - I hope - isn't based on the Kickstarter campaign or the game delivery, just the content and gameplay). I wish I could recommend this game but I really can't at this point. Act 1 was fairly well executed, if simple and relatively short, and it set up a lot of potentially interesting events in Act 2. The overall idea of two playable characters in parallel but interconnected story lines is interesting as well, as is the world they occupy. It's not a ""classic"" point and click. It's a more modern take on the genre - high quality art, more snazz, quality audio and voice acting - and clearly shows where the money raised has been spent.Sadly, there are some minor gameplay issues and major plot and puzzle issues that make playing through the game difficult once you get into the 2nd Act.   Gameplay:  - You can't skip through lines of dialogue like in most adventure games today; you can only skip the entire ""cut scene,"" which is a pain when the puzzles are designed with some repetition necessary (e.g. trial and error)- Primordia for example, had a map system to help you quickly navigate the various areas of the game that you'd already been to; Broken Age lacked this Plot and Puzzle: - There are some major plot gaps that remain unexplained / unresolved. Here are a few:*  Why didn't Shay's parent look anything like the ""bad"" Lorunians? *  How come it took Shay and his folks 14 years to get to Sugar Bunting, but in Act 2 it took everyone (even Alex's much older ship) like 10 minutes to get back to Loruna?? *  If Vella's grandmother was responsible for Steel Bunting turning into Sugar Bunting, was she also responsible for Shellmound and Meriloft turning soft? How?! *  I doubt there will be a sequel, so what happens now that everyone is stranded just outside Loruna? The ""bad guys"" aren't even necessarily dead, so what happens next? Nothing is resolved satisfactorily, it's not even a cliffhanger! - Even if you've not played point-and-click games before, you'll find Act 1 puzzles reasonably straightforward. Act 2 puzzles on the other hand suddenly become mindboggling and tedious - not challenging or clever or layered or any other word that indicates an increase in difficulty or complexity, as you'd hope for and even expect in an adventure game. There - The puzzles in Act 2 advance the plot tangentially, relying on some tedious and repetitive puzzling based on characters -  Hexipals  - that are largely unimportant to the main plotline. The  wiring  puzzles aren't even applied cleverly, relying on Vella and Shay to  magically learn what the solution is through the observations of the player.  That's ridiculous, and I've played the Monkey Island games. The result is that the player gets frustrated, sucked out of an already problematic story, and left to engage in trial and error puzzles that are situationally unrealistic. So? Doublefine have done a reasonably good job here, but have created a form of storybook point and click adventure game with a thin and curtailed moral/philosophical veneer, a plot with holes that become increasingly difficult to ignore, an ending that screams budget/time constraints and a sense that this game could have been a lot to a few rather than a little to many.  Don't buy this game.  Go and spend your money on some of the classic Lucasarts games, or better yet, on modern developers like Wadjet Eye or Daedelic, who are carrying the torch of adventure gaming in a way that I imagine (and hope) Schafer would be proud of. While not as charming, their games are polished, narrative-driven, clever and importantly, labours of love. If Broken Age was half as fun as Stacked, I'd gladly recommend it, but it isn't even. Shame really. Sorry Doublefine.			"

												This game was a piece of art and was very beautiful to play. The gameplay itself was simple point-and-click but numerous puzzles were rather tedious and challenging. I enjoyed the story and even though many have pointed out Act II was a let down in comparison to Act I, I do still believe it was engaging till the end. Sure Act II did fall in terms of quality of story and perhaps, the puzzles were more meticulous and repetitive than Act I, but i still remained immersed in the world of the characters.Characters had quirkiness and unique personalities, adding humour and warmth to the feel of the game (especially the adorable robots, such as Gary and the Hexipals/gals!). Only drawback was the repetitiveness and tediousness of a few puzzles and the ending wasn’t completely satisfying hence the captivating story was underdeveloped. Although overall, I would recommend this game, especially if you’re a fan of beautifully designed graphics, light-hearted but thought-provoking gameplay and an interesting story. Full price may be a bit steep but if on sale, it is worth the buy.Rating~Gameplay: 7/10Story: 7/10Graphics: 9/10Characters: 9/10 "

												Just watch a walkthrough online.First half is a great and is ruined by the second half. Tedious puzzles that have absurd solutions. I beat Braid and the Swapper without looking up for any guides but I had to use videos all the way through the second half only to give up near the end because it became way too rediculous. The story left unanswered questions and couldn't make up for the awful puzzle design. The second half was obiously rushed. I'd reccoment to go through the first act and then stop there; leave the game and pretend that the second act hasn't happened yet.			"

The puzzles just don't have any logical solution and get you out the flow of the story (which isn't really uplifting either). Nevertheless, the game looks great and has some great humour from start to finish, but it's not comparable with the standard Tim Schafer used to reach in the past.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Broken Age is an adventure game developed by the wonderful people behind Stacking, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, and Grim Fandango: Remastered. Double Fine Producitons once again hits the nail again with their cleverly designed and well thought out gameBroken Age is a point-and-click adventure game where you play two young people from different cultures and places experience their own adventures until secrets are revealed that bring them closer together. Broken Age follows traditional point-and-click adventure games where basically you have to click everywhere until you happen to find something that continues the storyThe story is very well written, although the ending does end abruptly and must of dissapointed a lot of people, I cannot blame them, the ending felt too rushed to satisfy me as an ending. The voice acting is really good, some well known actors and actresses lend thier voices to the game, such as Elijah Wood (from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy) and many othersThe game's graphics are really cute and well designed as well as the music is really well done which reminds me of Disney classics. Broken Age has good things but has bad things, the game overall is very good however the bad things are the puzzles, the puzzles are not that bad but the last few puzzles are so confusing it took me roughly 45 minutes-1 hour to solve some of the puzzles...Overall, Broken Age is a wonderful point-and-click adventure game which you will enjoy the fantastic graphics, story and music, even though the game does have some of its flaws RECOMMENDED :)  "

												I was leery of buying Broken Age.I was one of the people who didn't know Kickstarter existed when the Double Fine Adventure got kicked off, and cursed myself for my inability to donate at a later date.  But then I heard about Tim Schafer's ""Oops, I accidentally made the game too big out of excitement"" and the resulting decision to release the game in two parts.I was leery of buying such a Broken Age, broken into pieces.  But I bought it anyway because I believed in the man behind the Age.And I was right to do so.I will only touch upon the beauty of the designs and the watercolor style artwork.  How it transforms the world into a living, breathing, stylistic entity that adds to the gravity and majesty of the game.  You can see that just from the advertising previews.I will only offhandedly mention the beautiful music, and how it aids in captivating the strange and enchanting art, holding your attention and increasing your desire to see what's over on the next screen.I will speak about the voice cast.  About how Curtis (Wil Wheaton) just made my day, and Shay's (Elijah Wood) desperately struggling morality trying to escape it's infancy made me really, really care.  About how the entire cast is Grade-A and there is not a sour note amongst them I could even try to harp upon.I will talk about the length of Part 1.  It is short... but it is just right.  There was no filler in it, and it felt like Shay's story was shorter than Vella's, but neither side of the adventure had any spam in it.  No filler to make you sigh in boredom of somethign that should not be there.  Every bit of the game was something to be important, either in setting the tone or setting of the characters or the world.  Nothing too much, and it delivers you to...The Twist.There is a reason that Tim Schafer chose to end Part 1 right where he did, because there is no better spot to end Part 1.  The Twist changed my entire perspective on EVERYTHING.  And I will have to play the game again in reverse order to make sure I understand it this time for it's true self.  Just like Fight Club, you have to see it at least twice to really get it.And the time from now until the release of Part 2...  Let that Twist stew in your gut.  let it capture your imagination and leave you asking, How and Why.  All in preparation for Part 2.Part 1 was just the closing of the First Act in terms of the laws of writing.  The Second and Third Act are yet to come.			"

												This game was quite fun for the first hour or two, great plot, great mythos going on. Then the ""must consult the internet"" puzzles started to happen. I managed to get through to the second chapter without having to look up any answers, but then RIGHT as the game started to get really interesting the difficulty curve spiked. Then I realized I had messed up a puzzle so bad that there was no going back.I haven't picked up the game since, and I can't recommend a game that has a permanent fail state halfway through. Maybe watch a silent let's play and enjoy the story that way.			"

												Broken Age is absolutley FANTASTIC.  Its so good in fact that I would rank it as my second favorite thing Tim Schafer has ever done behind Psychonauts, THAT is no small feat.  It has all the hallmarks of Schafer's greatest works: amazing cast of characters, perfect exceptional voice acting, challenging and hilarious puzzles/gameplay, excellent Peter McConnell soundtrack, incredibly written script, its all here and its awesome.  The real star of the show, though, is its story; the story here may be simple but its one of the best and most original plots I've EVER heard in a video game, built around 2 seperate plot threads that seem completely unrelated until a few plot twists mid-way through.  This two-story structure also plays into the gameplay, where you switch between the two main characters in order to complete the grander whole of the game.  There are also a few streamlined features that help speed up some traditions of the point-and-click genre that have long needed an overhaul.That said, as is the case with ALL point-and-click adventures, it has a few niggling problems.  For the record any PAC game that has time-based puzzles never fails to frustrate me; there are times where you will be on the correct train of thought for solving a problem, but still fail because you didnt click in the right timing.  This doesnt sound like a big deal, but when you do fail this can cause you to try seeking other ways of completing the puzzle and waste a ton of time in the process.  There are other logic issues with some of the puzzles, but overall I think the difficulty was perfect for this genre, and overall I only needed to get help under 10 times in a lengthy adventure.All in all if you are a fan of Double Fine, Schafer, or a point-and-click fan in general you absolutely MUST play Broken Age.

I am a big fan of Double Fine and all of their excellent work, and Broken Age shines as one of the best releases from a company who still continues to put their hearts and souls into their games.With exceptional art, a touching and well written story (with quite a few unexpected twists!), and clever puzzles that provide a decent challenge while never tricking you with illogical solutions, I highly recommend Broken Age to any adventure fan.

												I have had this game in my library for quite a while, but for various reasons I set Broken Age aside for another time. With the release of the Double Fine Adventure on Steam it was time to properly play the game.The art, animation, music and voice acting are all really great. This certainly meets my expectations of what a modern adventure game should look and sound like. The user interface is nice and minimal, as one would expect from a modern game. I quite liked the writing too. Some of the characters are very funny, and there is plenty to laugh at. The main plot points had unfortunately already been spoilt to me by careless reviewers. Fortunately the story itself is actully quite a lot better than some reviews would have you believe. I don't have any problems with the ending myself. Everything is tied up neatly in the end credits.The puzzles are perhaps the weak point of Broken Age and were certaily a source of frustration for me. I was stuck at a few points in the game and had to look at walkthoughs to progress. Looking back I think I could have solved most of them myself if I had picked up on all the hints or not overlooked an item here or there. The python comes to mind. I was also not a fan of some of the puzzles later in the game that required memorizing things or writing them down. I prefer the game to do any note keeping for me. Also, I would have liked to see more interaction between Shay and Vella. The final set of puzzles would have made more sense if the two protagonists had been in communication with eachother or if there was  an exchange of items or influence on eachothers environments.But was Broken Age worse than the classic adventure games that inspired it? Are its leaps of logic so much more outlandish than Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle? I personally think not. I played the old Lucasarts games back when they came out, and it's easy to overlook their problems though the rose tinted glasses of nostaligia. For me, Broken Age rekindled some of those fond gaming memories and I had fun playing this game through to the end.So in summary:+ Art, animation, music, voice acting, writing, humor, plot- Some of the puzzles, not enough interaction between the main charactersRecommendation: Very much worth the price, even more so when at a discountBeing able to watch the making of the game in between gaming sessions was quite enlightening. I strongly recommend you watch the documentary too if you buy this game.			"

I was one of the first Kickstarter Backers for this game and it was totally worth it. The only downside ist the length of the game. It took me less than 6 hours to get through act one. Assuming that the second act will be roughly as long as the first this will account for some 10-12 hour game time. Which, but this is sad for the whole industry, is rather standard for any game. But hey, we never know until act two is released.			"

												This is an incredible game. With it's art and music it is one of my favorite games, especially the yarn bits. The characters are amazing, from the Space-Weaver to the Dead Eye guards it has the best characters in any game that I have played so far. I just love the style of it how everything is interconnected, not only the places like Meriloft and the forest but I mean how both the stories of Vella and Shay intertwine. How you learn some insight on the parrallel story and I can't wait for the next act. Hopefully it will come out sooner than later this year.			"

												Ok first the technical stuff: AMD Phenom 4 Cores 2.7 GHz, 6GB of DDR2 ram, radeon hd 7970 3GB.GNU/Linux fedora rawhide with the radeon open source driver (Yeay!)In 2560x1600 the game cannot run smoothly (all game are calibrated for 1920x1080 nowadays...). There is something which seems weird with the resolution/fullscreen  on gnu/Linux. Anyway, I played it ""not fullscreen"", and it was fine.I would have felt the game a bit too empty for the full price (I got it cheaper thanks to sales). I think they used the kickstarter money to ramp up the first iteration of their game engine for the next games. Basically, we can expect a much more dense and rich act2 and follow up games. Nevertheless, I think it's hard to make a rich point-and-click game with real voices, coz tons of phrases to record, and creating interesting and rich puzzles with that many original graphics, well... tons of more work due to the combinations.On the overall I liked the journeys offered by this game from all perspectives, namely graphics, sound and music and most of the puzzles. Personally, this ""dual"" journey is quite new and refreshing for me.Again from a technical/legal point of view, they should use an open source game engine (protected with a GNU Lesser GPL license) and build their game on it (maybe they used the scumvm engine!).

												This game is currently just act 1 of a game of two acts, if you buy, you are supposed to get the second act for free once it comes out. For one act, the game is actually overprized, though, so I am counting on getting act 2.The graphics are beautiful, the puzzles are not terribily challenging or have surprising solutions, but didn't leave me unsatisified. The game has an atmosphere that makes it feel unique while playing (as expected from the trailer), but for me what really made it was the story. It started out slow, but the ending was just wow - I don't want to give away more than that. It was totally not what I expected. Can't wait for act 2.			"

												After finishing Act 1, I feel like as a beautifully polished game, from it's art style, to the fantastic voice acting and storytelling that Broken Age is a great addition to adventure games. Shay's story could have been more fleshed out though, and the amount of locations on offer in this first act seems a bit lacklustre - as Double Fine are rolling out the next update inclusive of what's purchased here. I'm okay with waiting for the conclusion to this story.Controversy aside, with the cost of this game's development and Schafer's money management of what had been kickstarted. I actually recommend this as a game; as a gamer with a huge soft spot for adventure games.			"

												Broken Age makes me excited for adventure games again.Intuitive puzzles, clever and funny dialogue, and all brought to life with incredible graphics which make the game look more like a living cartoon than a game, Broken Age is easily one of the best modern adventure games out there.You play the game alternating between two lead characters, each with his and her own unique situation from which they're anxious to escape. I won't spoil anything here - I'll just say that both characters have an interesting story, and you won't be bored with either or them. Control is simple adventure game stuff, so if you've ever played a point-and-click game (or even if you haven't) you won't have any difficulty here.My only complaint so far is that when you get a game series off to such a good start, the wait between episodes is going to be tough. What's here now though is worth your time and money, and I highly recommend it.			"

Buying the whole package now at once would likely be worthy of your time.  The hexipal wiring was a real pain, but that's pretty much par for the course for endgame puzzle shenanigans, just be prepared ahead of time with a notepad or something.  I'm starting to think that I just don't like this whole genera of games, but this one at least had a really interesting setting and characters.7/10			"

												Broken Age is an amazing point and click experience, reminescent of Steven Spielburg's The Dig in a light-hearted setting. The art stlye and some of its antics remind me of Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker,The story touches on various enlightened understandings about life, and its quite meta; of itself and reality in general. There's quite a few gags and clever lines, and one in particular (a Terminator reference of all things) made me tear up and laugh at the same time.It doesn't really go very far with the story, it doesn't aim to be the most riveting and jaw dropping storytelling experience ever. Still, its a perfect example of when the games medium does story telling well. Broken Age never goes overboard, but there's a lot to ponder about the philosophical meaning of different elements throughout. Its kind of light or deep as you want it to go, I think.Its a little hard to review a game that's just a storyline with some secondary interactive elements without spoiling anything. I'll just say, the sound and voice acting are flawless throughout. The story is captivating as anything you'll find  in modern media. It has a good length. Its difficult to figure out what to do at a few parts, but its not ever bad enough to actually warrant using a game guide. The character swapping mechanic sees some token use to aid advancement, but I think over-use of that feature might make gameplay too novel.If you like games like Monkey Island, The Dig, or just a good, mild storyline, I'd definitely recommend Broken Age.

												Broken Age is absolutley FANTASTIC.  Its so good in fact that I would rank it as my second favorite thing Tim Schafer has ever done behind Psychonauts, THAT is no small feat.  It has all the hallmarks of Schafer's greatest works: amazing cast of characters, perfect exceptional voice acting, challenging and hilarious puzzles/gameplay, excellent Peter McConnell soundtrack, incredibly written script, its all here and its awesome.  The real star of the show, though, is its story; the story here may be simple but its one of the best and most original plots I've EVER heard in a video game, built around 2 seperate plot threads that seem completely unrelated until a few plot twists mid-way through.  This two-story structure also plays into the gameplay, where you switch between the two main characters in order to complete the grander whole of the game.  There are also a few streamlined features that help speed up some traditions of the point-and-click genre that have long needed an overhaul.That said, as is the case with ALL point-and-click adventures, it has a few niggling problems.  For the record any PAC game that has time-based puzzles never fails to frustrate me; there are times where you will be on the correct train of thought for solving a problem, but still fail because you didnt click in the right timing.  This doesnt sound like a big deal, but when you do fail this can cause you to try seeking other ways of completing the puzzle and waste a ton of time in the process.  There are other logic issues with some of the puzzles, but overall I think the difficulty was perfect for this genre, and overall I only needed to get help under 10 times in a lengthy adventure.All in all if you are a fan of Double Fine, Schafer, or a point-and-click fan in general you absolutely MUST play Broken Age.

I managed to get through to the second chapter without having to look up any answers, but then RIGHT as the game started to get really interesting the difficulty curve spiked. Then I realized I had messed up a puzzle so bad that there was no going back.I haven't picked up the game since, and I can't recommend a game that has a permanent fail state halfway through. Maybe watch a silent let's play and enjoy the story that way.			"

												I have had this game in my library for quite a while, but for various reasons I set Broken Age aside for another time. With the release of the Double Fine Adventure on Steam it was time to properly play the game.The art, animation, music and voice acting are all really great. This certainly meets my expectations of what a modern adventure game should look and sound like. The user interface is nice and minimal, as one would expect from a modern game. I quite liked the writing too. Some of the characters are very funny, and there is plenty to laugh at. The main plot points had unfortunately already been spoilt to me by careless reviewers. Fortunately the story itself is actully quite a lot better than some reviews would have you believe. I don't have any problems with the ending myself. Everything is tied up neatly in the end credits.The puzzles are perhaps the weak point of Broken Age and were certaily a source of frustration for me. I was stuck at a few points in the game and had to look at walkthoughs to progress. Looking back I think I could have solved most of them myself if I had picked up on all the hints or not overlooked an item here or there. The python comes to mind. I was also not a fan of some of the puzzles later in the game that required memorizing things or writing them down. I prefer the game to do any note keeping for me. Also, I would have liked to see more interaction between Shay and Vella. The final set of puzzles would have made more sense if the two protagonists had been in communication with eachother or if there was  an exchange of items or influence on eachothers environments.But was Broken Age worse than the classic adventure games that inspired it? Are its leaps of logic so much more outlandish than Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle? I personally think not. I played the old Lucasarts games back when they came out, and it's easy to overlook their problems though the rose tinted glasses of nostaligia. For me, Broken Age rekindled some of those fond gaming memories and I had fun playing this game through to the end.So in summary:+ Art, animation, music, voice acting, writing, humor, plot- Some of the puzzles, not enough interaction between the main charactersRecommendation: Very much worth the price, even more so when at a discountBeing able to watch the making of the game in between gaming sessions was quite enlightening. I strongly recommend you watch the documentary too if you buy this game.			"

												Broken Age provided an approximation of the Lucas Arts games from yesteryear, but only that.The high points broght me back to a time of simpler graphics and collecting items to combine together in silly ways. The dialog is spot on while remaining light, overall. I enjoyed the art style while it remained unusual throughout. The functionality both with mouse and controller work out well. All the voicing is done well, though I feel that Jack Black was an underused voice in the game.The two main parts of a point and click are the puzzles and the story.The puzzles are a mixed bag. Some of them were quite straight forward and logical in the ""adventure game logic"" that you would expect. Others might involve a clever use of the environment that isn't quite as obvious. But then, there are those that are generally just try until you get it right. I'm very much not a fan of puzzles that the only real way to solve them is to try to solve them enough times to find the information to essentially use a solution that is written in the game. I don't feel like I actually thought through that; I feel I just threw things at a wall until I could use a written solution. And the worst (though there is only one) is a puzzle solved by waiting. That is the worst.The story is again a mixed bag. The end of act 1 was definitely a high point with a twist I at least didn't see coming. Unfotunately, there is enough other things that don't exactly get well explained to leave you with a good sense of closure. The ending I find frustratingly vague (said as someone who actually likes endings to not always be perfectly wrapped up - this ending more felt like you just solved the puzzle with the grandest music so the game is over).In the end, though, I am glad to have played it and would love for there to be more point and click games of this level being made though possibly with a better structure to the game budget so it can end as high as it started.

Really great game! Wholeheartedly recommended.9,5/10+ fun point-and-click adventure, challenging but fair puzzles+ beautiful artwork/design+ minimalist facial expressions with maximum effect (in comparison: Dreamfall Chapters, a current story rich 3D game that I also love is disappointing me in its somewhat limited mimic range. Broke Age however delighted me with how tiny changes in the 2D characters make a huge difference. Maybe I'm projecting though...)+you can switch between the two characters (almost) whenever you like+ lovely, funny, quirky characters+ great voice acting (I started it in German which I enjoyed too, and switched over once I learned that Wil Wheaton does one of the voices)(only only the high-pitched voices of the knitted friends could get annoying after a while)+ two worlds, each beautiful and interesting and quirky in their own way+ great plot twist; story gets even more intriguing afterwards+ THE NAV SCARF! THE HEXAPALS!! :D (some of many adorable side characters)+ THE TALKING CUTLERY with hilarious personalities and comments when used with other items- (a MINOR problem) you can't always run (only when your starting point is in the very distance), so... lots of walking. Yeah I'm pretty sure that was my only drawback in the game. ^^ It was very nearly perfect! :)			"

												I have had this game in my library for quite a while, but for various reasons I set Broken Age aside for another time. With the release of the Double Fine Adventure on Steam it was time to properly play the game.The art, animation, music and voice acting are all really great. This certainly meets my expectations of what a modern adventure game should look and sound like. The user interface is nice and minimal, as one would expect from a modern game. I quite liked the writing too. Some of the characters are very funny, and there is plenty to laugh at. The main plot points had unfortunately already been spoilt to me by careless reviewers. Fortunately the story itself is actully quite a lot better than some reviews would have you believe. I don't have any problems with the ending myself. Everything is tied up neatly in the end credits.The puzzles are perhaps the weak point of Broken Age and were certaily a source of frustration for me. I was stuck at a few points in the game and had to look at walkthoughs to progress. Looking back I think I could have solved most of them myself if I had picked up on all the hints or not overlooked an item here or there. The python comes to mind. I was also not a fan of some of the puzzles later in the game that required memorizing things or writing them down. I prefer the game to do any note keeping for me. Also, I would have liked to see more interaction between Shay and Vella. The final set of puzzles would have made more sense if the two protagonists had been in communication with eachother or if there was  an exchange of items or influence on eachothers environments.But was Broken Age worse than the classic adventure games that inspired it? Are its leaps of logic so much more outlandish than Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle? I personally think not. I played the old Lucasarts games back when they came out, and it's easy to overlook their problems though the rose tinted glasses of nostaligia. For me, Broken Age rekindled some of those fond gaming memories and I had fun playing this game through to the end.So in summary:+ Art, animation, music, voice acting, writing, humor, plot- Some of the puzzles, not enough interaction between the main charactersRecommendation: Very much worth the price, even more so when at a discountBeing able to watch the making of the game in between gaming sessions was quite enlightening. I strongly recommend you watch the documentary too if you buy this game.			"

												Broken Age provided an approximation of the Lucas Arts games from yesteryear, but only that.The high points broght me back to a time of simpler graphics and collecting items to combine together in silly ways. The dialog is spot on while remaining light, overall. I enjoyed the art style while it remained unusual throughout. The functionality both with mouse and controller work out well. All the voicing is done well, though I feel that Jack Black was an underused voice in the game.The two main parts of a point and click are the puzzles and the story.The puzzles are a mixed bag. Some of them were quite straight forward and logical in the ""adventure game logic"" that you would expect. Others might involve a clever use of the environment that isn't quite as obvious. But then, there are those that are generally just try until you get it right. I'm very much not a fan of puzzles that the only real way to solve them is to try to solve them enough times to find the information to essentially use a solution that is written in the game. I don't feel like I actually thought through that; I feel I just threw things at a wall until I could use a written solution. And the worst (though there is only one) is a puzzle solved by waiting. That is the worst.The story is again a mixed bag. The end of act 1 was definitely a high point with a twist I at least didn't see coming. Unfotunately, there is enough other things that don't exactly get well explained to leave you with a good sense of closure. The ending I find frustratingly vague (said as someone who actually likes endings to not always be perfectly wrapped up - this ending more felt like you just solved the puzzle with the grandest music so the game is over).In the end, though, I am glad to have played it and would love for there to be more point and click games of this level being made though possibly with a better structure to the game budget so it can end as high as it started.

Really great game! Wholeheartedly recommended.9,5/10+ fun point-and-click adventure, challenging but fair puzzles+ beautiful artwork/design+ minimalist facial expressions with maximum effect (in comparison: Dreamfall Chapters, a current story rich 3D game that I also love is disappointing me in its somewhat limited mimic range. Broke Age however delighted me with how tiny changes in the 2D characters make a huge difference. Maybe I'm projecting though...)+you can switch between the two characters (almost) whenever you like+ lovely, funny, quirky characters+ great voice acting (I started it in German which I enjoyed too, and switched over once I learned that Wil Wheaton does one of the voices)(only only the high-pitched voices of the knitted friends could get annoying after a while)+ two worlds, each beautiful and interesting and quirky in their own way+ great plot twist; story gets even more intriguing afterwards+ THE NAV SCARF! THE HEXAPALS!! :D (some of many adorable side characters)+ THE TALKING CUTLERY with hilarious personalities and comments when used with other items- (a MINOR problem) you can't always run (only when your starting point is in the very distance), so... lots of walking. Yeah I'm pretty sure that was my only drawback in the game. ^^ It was very nearly perfect! :)			"

												This game isn't flawless. I'll get the cons out of the way first:-The game suffers from one of my pet peeves in point and click games, the character ""magically"" knows which items it can or can't interact with and which items will save a purpouse later on. if you can click on something and pick it up, your character's not gonna dare part with it until it eventually needs to use it for something.-There is a part in the second half of the game where the two characters need to perform actions based on the other characters' knowledge, even though there is no interaction between them. You can write this off as them acting on instinct or guessing, but... It probably could've been written better.Pros:-Y'know, I could honestly care less about this game's gameplay faults because at it's core, it's a story. You're here for the plot, for the characters, and for the worldbuilding. And it excels at those. It's a truly good story, which is occasionaly paused when you hit a puzzle that you have a hard time solving.-There are also stuff I liked about the gameplay, but as I said, this game should be played mostly for the story it tells and the world it takes place in.

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/broken-age-act-1-game-review/This is a review of ACT 1 of Broken Age, act 2 is currently unreleased.Broken Age - Act 1, an excellent point-and-click adventure. This is coming from someone who usually avoids the genre. I don't know how, but Double Fine somehow kept me entertained whilst playing their latest adventure. I despise point-and-click games, but this, this was a treat.Broken Age's existence is entirely due to the success of Double Fine's ""Double Fine Adventure"" Kickstarter, which in my opinion, is the reason why Kickstarter is so popular today. The game's credits list all of the backers, all of them. It took quite some time for all of those credits to roll.The game employs a colorful, stylized world, all in 2D. The art is fantastic, retaining that signature Double Fine feel to it. The music was also great, combining well with the game's overall style.The game's story however, is what I enjoyed most. The story is what probably kept me playing. Normally, I wouldn't even play a point-and-click game, and if I did, then I'd quit it within say.. 30 minutes? With Broken Age however, I never felt bored and the puzzles didn't keep me stumped as long as I would have expected from a game in the genre. Actually, I would have preferred the puzzles to be a bit harder. Most of them were rather straight-forward and easily solved. I may have gotten stumped once or twice, but I felt like they could have been a lot more challenging while retaining my attention.The story is broken into two parts: Shay's and Vella's adventures. Two entirely different characters that the player can switch to and from at any given moment. I found myself going through with Shay's quest first, rather than Vella's. I enjoyed Shay's story more than Vella's, but I played through the whole game wanting to know if the stories connected somehow, possibly one of the reasons why I found this game so enjoyable. The constant desire to see how the stories connect, or if they do at all.Voice acting in the game is incredible, well, aside from one character. It felt like Vella's voice was... off. It just sounded out of place. That may just be me, but it constantly bugged me throughout her journey. All of the other voice acting is simply amazing, no complaints there.All good things said, Broken Age does not bring anything new to the table. This may be disappointing for some, but I certainly overlooked this fault purely out of interest for the game's story. Although I may dislike point-and-click games, I've played quite a few of them in my time, and Broken Age doesn't seem to differ from them, aside from the art style. Broken Age was actually much easier than a few of the point-and-click game's I've played, because, as I said, the puzzles are rather straight-forward.There are many reasons for me to recommend Broken Age. I urge you to try it out for yourself. I certainly can't wait for the next act in the series.			"

												Aesthetically brilliant, with a charming story told through witty and defined characters. Its puzzles and point-and-click adventure mechanics may seem a tad simplistic to veterans of the genre, but it will help ease newcomers into the game, and prepare them for some  (hopefully) more refined and challenging gameplay in the impending second part, which will be released as a free update later this year. All in all, well worth your money.			"

												Broken Age makes me excited for adventure games again.Intuitive puzzles, clever and funny dialogue, and all brought to life with incredible graphics which make the game look more like a living cartoon than a game, Broken Age is easily one of the best modern adventure games out there.You play the game alternating between two lead characters, each with his and her own unique situation from which they're anxious to escape. I won't spoil anything here - I'll just say that both characters have an interesting story, and you won't be bored with either or them. Control is simple adventure game stuff, so if you've ever played a point-and-click game (or even if you haven't) you won't have any difficulty here.My only complaint so far is that when you get a game series off to such a good start, the wait between episodes is going to be tough. What's here now though is worth your time and money, and I highly recommend it.			"

Right now im a casual gamer, mostly because lack of time and the fact that most games are boring to me.Ive backed Broken Age through Kickstarter in hope of bringing recollection of those magical moments of my childhood.The game starts a little bit slow because You don't know the characters and enviroment of the story, but in less than half hour the game sucks You in. I can guarantee that story is first class and as the I Act ends half way You will be eagerly waiting for the final which will be available in couple of months. Real cliffhanger!Highly recommended!

It is DF-ish in every sense possible. Silly, mature, vibrantly positive. If you enjoyed adventure classics for its story and characters, you most probably will like Act I. If a good adventure game means inventory puzzles to you, you might want to reconsider.Personally, I can't wait for Act II.			"

												ACT I:Broken Age is a Double Fine adventure game which promised at conception to be like the Lucasarts adventure games of olde. You might remember its conception. Big ol' deal. Raised multiple millions in dollars because everybody has been harboring a secret erection for Tim Schafer's dazzling beard. Any negative reviews you might read are the result of his removing said beard. What was I talking about.So I guess the question here is, did it deliver on that promise? The answer is yeah basically.Broken Age is... a liiiittle more focused on story and world than puzzles than in those adventures of yore. Things are not quite as ridiculously complicated, but there's certainly a respectable amount of puzzle solving to be done, and it is good puzzle solving at that. I've heard the grumbles in the crowd. There is discourse over the difficulty of the puzzles to be solved. In regards to that, I can personally say that, while I never needed to consult any outside help at any time, I feel like the puzzles weren't anywhere in the realm of TOO easy. They felt... well maybe slightly easier than just right, but they're fun enough to let that slide.In screenshots, the art never took my fancy. But actually watching it in motion, and seeing the subtleties in animation and how the art style comes to life, it looks magical and pleasing to the eye. The soundtrack fits it nicely, and the voice actors display their talent proudly.Which leaves us the story to worry about. And, you know, obviously THAT'S going to be stellar. Remember that whole thing about the story being more of a focus? I just said it. Right up there. You alternate between playing Shay and Vella, and helping them through their plights. It's been said that you should play Shay's story first, and I agree. It gives things a good flow. Although you can switch back and forth between the characters mid-story (or, at least, I'm assuming you can, judging by the Day of the Tentacle-style portrait in the corner of the characters' inventories), you probably won't. The stories are fairly short - running you somewhere in the vicinity of 1-3 hours each - and are unlikely to drive you from one's arms into the other's before it forces you there.So far this is quite a nice story, and I'm anxious to see where it goes from here. It's going to be a long year, but I think more quality storytelling like this will be well worth the wait.Act II:[s]Wait for it...[/s]It seems this is a very Broken Age. Act II is now out, but I am experiencing an insurmountable crash at a certain point and cannot proceed. Looks like you'll be waiting for it for a good, long time to come at this rate.			"

												It is difficult to review a game that is only half-finished, but since there is currently no set date for Act II to be released, I suppose there's no harm in at least trying. Lets start with the cons, in order to get them out of the way, shall we? Possibly the most obvious, is the lack of an ending. While I understand the financial issues this title ended up facing, and I can appreciate how the developers decided to solve it, I'm still left feeling a little let down after realizing I would have to wait an undetermined amount of time before seeing a conclusion to this story. Indeed the story is wonderful, very well told and beautifully written, it simply lacks an ending. Act I is long enough to provide an enjoyable gaming experience, though at times the puzzles can be a bit simplistic. The action is primarily point and click, and puzzles revolve around finding objects to use with others in order to progress the characters. The characters themselves are wonderfully constructed an developed, as is their environment. The humor is witty at times, and a bit dry at others, but the writing holds up in general.I've heard many comparisons of this game to Monkey Island, however I wouldn't go so far as to agree with them (at least not until this one is finished). That being said, this title is still wonderfully constructed, and I do recommend it to those who are fans of puzzle games with linear stories and emotional rides. Especially if said fans are just slightly more interested in the story side than the puzzle side. The artwork is as equally impressive as the character development, and makes the game fun to simply look at. The soundtrack is fully orchestral and fits the game very well, helping to augment all the appropriate cutscenes. Character dialogue is provided by an array of very talented voice actors, each offering their stylistic abilities to their characters. This, in turn, creates a wonderful cast of characters for the player to interact with. All in all, this is a great game...so far. I really hope to hear about the release of the second act soon, but that is unfortunately not something I can recommend paying $25 for. Still, I suggest picking up this title as a daily deal or something. Certainly wouldn't promote the idea of paying more than $10. At least at this stage of development. Perhaps once the second half of the game is released, and it is given a proper ending, it will warrant the higher price tag. As is, however, it falls a bit short of that mark. Four Stars.			"

												Broken Age is a point and click adventure game from the mind of Tim Schafer that was brought into existance through contributions from the gaming community.The writting features a witt and whimsy that is rare in modern gaming and showcases the artistic stylings of Nathan ""Bagle"" Stapley.The game play is intuitive yet the puzzles may take you a few tries to complete however that's the whole point of a point and click game like this. Not only because it will deepen your love for the game and bolster your feeling of success when you do solve the puzzles, but also because it's the only way you'll get to hear all the great dialogue acted out by some major voice acting talent.Before I end, I'd like to send my genuine thanks to Tim and the the team at DoubleFine for taking my backer (and slacker backer) contributions and making something this incredible. I'll be sending you some good vibes while you work on Act 2. I can hardly wait!			"

												Broken Age is the LucasArts style adventure game from the 90s that you've been waiting for since the 90s. Tim Schafer's masterful dialog, character development and plot structure techniques are back in full force, no longer shoved into other genres.Act I is a pleasant experience where you are constantly seeing new areas, meeting new characters and solving relatively easy puzzles (for adventure game veterans anyways). Act 2 makes great use of those characters, even if it re-uses many of the same areas. The puzzles in the second half are much closer to the difficulty found in those 90s games, your mileage may very. Personally I had a handful of those adventure game moments where I started trying to use every item on everything until I finally figured out the solution. Expect to break out some pencil and paper for a couple of the more devious but satisfying puzzles.The art style looks like concept art in motion and has some truly stunning moments. This is a decent sized adventure that is worth seeing through to the end. We don't get a lot of adventure games with this level of production values anymore.			"

												Broken Age has set out to revive our love for point-and-click adventure games - titles such as Grim Fandango, Monkey Island, and the like.  Have Double Fine delivered on this front?  Personally, the answer is a resounding 'YES'.The art style, although rather simplistic upon first inspection, really adds to the overall feel of the game.  The voice acting is top-notch, and the story (as far as I have experienced in Act 1) is riveting as you move from place to place, even room to room.One minor flaw is that the puzzles aren't as challenging as I would have liked.  Saying that, they are aiming to bring this genre to a wider audience and for that I can not really fault them.I for one can't wait for Act 2.  I highly recommend this title, even at full price.			"

Well, tell you what. I paid for it something like 8 dollars and I would say it is actually worth a lot more than that. It truly is short (took me 4+ hours), but hey, an average movie is only 1.5 hours long while its production cost is way higher. And as far as I'm concerned, short and good is much better than long and boring. And the game is indeed very good. I literally loved every bit of it. Artwork, design, voice-acting, dialogues, the plot itself and most importantly - all those tiny details that make you fall in love. What's more, the plot actually makes the game re-playable, even though it's 100% linear.And one more thing. The story in Broken Age is just, I don't know, heartwarming. And that's something I really miss sometimes.So I'm definitely looking forward to Act 2.			"

												""I love the story, its fantastic and I can't wait for part two. I loved the art style. Although weird and funky, it showed the world perfectly.""I've played through the first part on both sides, I will note I played through shay and then vella. Holy crap was I blown away. I don't want to give spoilers to someone who hasn't played or seen the game fully though so i need to keep this short.I love the story, its fantastic and I can't wait for part two. I loved the art style. Although weird and funky, it showed the world perfectly. I loved the characters and the way they are connected to other characters like family is well done. The voice acting is amazing, I see where all the kickstarter money went.I do have some negatives i will say just to warn people though. The game is very simple. Its an old school point and click, meaning no choices in the story, the puzzles are very simple and very bad adventure game logic in some parts. I didn't need to look it up but i heard some people did because the answer to the puzzle was weird and didn't make sense. The biggest problem that this game has is that the games biggest feature is the story. This means people will probably look up lets plays and walkthroughs. This is because the game has no gameplay mechanics important enough to catch peoples eyes and want to play themselves to feel the mechanics.However Double fine have impressed me with this game, and if your thinking of buying it. Definitely consider it because this game is amazing in its story. However if you can't afford it or buy it off steam, you could allways look up a lets play, You won't miss much. Just consider buying it to aid the developers and get them to make more games as weird and as story driven as this one.9/10			"

												The art is beautiful and the voice acting amazing... but it doesn't change the fact that there is no depth to this game.  It's enjoyable and if you like point and click adventures go for it but nothing you do has an impact on the story at all.  It's just keep clicking until you find the 'right' answer to progress.  I will recommend it for anyone who likes linear adventures though.  On the basis of writing, voice acting, and musical score.  It's a winner.			"

												Update: Now that I have finally beaten the game i can give my final thoughts on it.And damn this game is cute as hell. It's actually very nice to play a game that is so earnest and designed with no amount of cynicism. It's been while since I played act 1 that I'm glad the second half pays off so well. In fact, I was worried a little bit going into act 2 that I would be confused because it has been so long since playing act 1 but I was surprised how much of the game world and characters, even small personality quirks of minor characters I remembered. I guess that just goes to show how memorable and inventive the world actually is. Another good surprise is that I enjoyed the difficulty of the puzzles in the second half. I thought the first half was perhaps a little too easy despite still being enjoyable. The puzzles in the second half require more lateral thinking to solve but not so much that they become annoyingly obfuscated. There was probably just one instance (actually the instance where I needed outside help I admit) that I thought was somewhat vague. Though, I am also not always very observant.If I had one complaint it would be that I would have liked to have seen more areas of this world. You kind of get thrown into only a handful of locations. But, the trade off for that is that these areas are really deeply characterized. The objects and people that inhabit these locations are all memorable. Heck even something as innocuous as the dinning utensils are brimming with personality. Also this narrower focus makes a more tightly woven story where there are many twists and turns. Areas you though you previously thoroughly explored in the first act will be completely changed and take on different meaning in the second half. Overall, its a very fun and funny adventure time and through my time playing it I usually had just the dumbest grin on my face.VVV--Thoughts from when I played the first half--VVVI had an incredible time playing this. It's not the hardest adventure game I played, at least the first episode, but it weaves an interesting narrative with funny, memorable characters. Most importantly, Tim Schafer and the people Double Fine show off how incredible they can be at world building, it's the kind of place you can't get enough of. I can't wait for the second episode.

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/broken-age-act-1-game-review/This is a review of ACT 1 of Broken Age, act 2 is currently unreleased.Broken Age - Act 1, an excellent point-and-click adventure. This is coming from someone who usually avoids the genre. I don't know how, but Double Fine somehow kept me entertained whilst playing their latest adventure. I despise point-and-click games, but this, this was a treat.Broken Age's existence is entirely due to the success of Double Fine's ""Double Fine Adventure"" Kickstarter, which in my opinion, is the reason why Kickstarter is so popular today. The game's credits list all of the backers, all of them. It took quite some time for all of those credits to roll.The game employs a colorful, stylized world, all in 2D. The art is fantastic, retaining that signature Double Fine feel to it. The music was also great, combining well with the game's overall style.The game's story however, is what I enjoyed most. The story is what probably kept me playing. Normally, I wouldn't even play a point-and-click game, and if I did, then I'd quit it within say.. 30 minutes? With Broken Age however, I never felt bored and the puzzles didn't keep me stumped as long as I would have expected from a game in the genre. Actually, I would have preferred the puzzles to be a bit harder. Most of them were rather straight-forward and easily solved. I may have gotten stumped once or twice, but I felt like they could have been a lot more challenging while retaining my attention.The story is broken into two parts: Shay's and Vella's adventures. Two entirely different characters that the player can switch to and from at any given moment. I found myself going through with Shay's quest first, rather than Vella's. I enjoyed Shay's story more than Vella's, but I played through the whole game wanting to know if the stories connected somehow, possibly one of the reasons why I found this game so enjoyable. The constant desire to see how the stories connect, or if they do at all.Voice acting in the game is incredible, well, aside from one character. It felt like Vella's voice was... off. It just sounded out of place. That may just be me, but it constantly bugged me throughout her journey. All of the other voice acting is simply amazing, no complaints there.All good things said, Broken Age does not bring anything new to the table. This may be disappointing for some, but I certainly overlooked this fault purely out of interest for the game's story. Although I may dislike point-and-click games, I've played quite a few of them in my time, and Broken Age doesn't seem to differ from them, aside from the art style. Broken Age was actually much easier than a few of the point-and-click game's I've played, because, as I said, the puzzles are rather straight-forward.There are many reasons for me to recommend Broken Age. I urge you to try it out for yourself. I certainly can't wait for the next act in the series.			"

I laughed through most of the adventure and really loved the characters in it.the puzzles range from easy to moderatley hard! tough one or two of them I literally did by complete luck. Though it wasn't too long, I am well aware of act 2 is coming soon. I Tried to come up with some negative comments about this game, Yet I can't seem to find a problem through my time playing, I was entertained 100% of my time spent on this masterpiece. 10/10 Would Totally play part 2!!!

												It's art, voice acting, music and story telling are all very nice. I love all of it. It just feels like it should. And the puzzels are very easy. It's not frustrating in the least. The only thing that is very annoying is that it is way to short. You need something like 3 hours to complete act 1. With Act 2 is said to have similar length. That makes me sad. I would love to see more people & conversation and generally more backstory in the game. I would love to dive deeper into this fantastic world / universe setting. Maybe some sidequests too.I hope they add a hardmode after the game is finished like in Indiana Jones 4 fate of atlantis.			"

												To put it bluntly, Broken Age is fantastic.The game is a classic point-and-click adventure, in the vein of the Lucasfilm Classics. For those of you who have been living under a rock for two years, Broken Age (previously known as Double Fine Adventure) was a huge kickstarter success, finishing up with over 3 million in crowd-sourced funds. Being one of the original big Kickstarter projects, there was some worry, but Double Fine pulled through in the most stylish way possible.The game is split into two parts, which is.... split into another two parts.This is a review of Act 1. Act 2 will be released some time this year, and here's hoping it's as good as this act. In each act there are two tales to play, both incredibly different, but linked in many, many ways. In one, you play as Vella, a girl forced into tradition. In the other you play as Shay, a boy forced to stay in a spaceship his whole life. Both stories are incredibly fun to play. On your first playthrough you may not notice the similarities between the stories, but if you think about them and put the events together in your mind, you realise how linked these tales are. I can't describe the amazing feeling I had when I discovered these connections. I can't really describe them without completely spoiling the game though.The gameplay is what you would expect from any adventure game. It's fun, puzzling and satisfying. The only downfall is the sheer simplicity of the puzzles. I only really got stuck on one puzzle and even then it's because I just didn't notice one item amongst the background. However, this is actually a pro for younger gamers, as they will enjoy it without getting frustrated.The art. Oh man, the art. It's gorgeous. I can say no more, just look at the screenshots.The music is fantastic as in most Double Fine games. Some great peaceful, ambient tunes to relax you as the gears in your head grind.The story is obviously great, with some excellent writing. The biggest caveat in adventure games for me is feeling bored as lines and lines of text go on and on. In this game though, I was always interested, clicking on every dialogue option available. The AAA voice acting helps a lot too. Before you ask, yes, Jennifer Hale is in it.Overall, Broken Age is a must-buy. Generally I don't preorder or buy games at launch, I just wait for a sale. But this time I did and it was worth every dollar. The length may be an issue, but for me just Act 1 was worth the purchase, but with another act on the way, there's really no reason not to buy this ASAP. What more can I say? Brilliant art, music, puzzle design, writing, voice acting.... It all helps to make this a great, great game. Do yourself a favour and pick this up. You won't regret it.			"

												Well worth the playthrough.   As a fan of older adventure games from Shaffer like Grim Fandango and Psychonauts, this is a wonderful addition to the genre.  At first it appears as just ""cute"" and without depth.   Gradually, you find out that there is a more sinister, interesting story underneath.  The voice acting, script , and music are top notch.

I enjoyed the plot as well, and can't wait to see the next part. Hopefully enough people buy this game so Broken Age will get the grand ending it deserves.			"

												Broken Age is without a doubt one of the best point'n'clicks of the last few years. As I mostly liked it, let's focus on what's wrong with it.I'm not a fan of the character design. Those faces, noses especially.There are some sloppily cropped parts of the foreground - artifacts are visible against the backgrounds.Some animations are lacking.There's a lot of backtracking and after the first act you've pretty much seen all areas the game lets you explore. For the rest of the game you'll be walking around them again and again, just with the characters swapped.There are some inconsistencies in the story.The game feels rushed, especially the ending.If they could've just taken the quality from the best parts of the game and keep it throughout the whole thing, Broken Age would not only be one of the best point'n'clicks of the last few years, as mentioned before, but also one of the best adventure games ever created.Overall, objectively 8/10.

												At the beginning i would like You to know that i grew up in the 90's and played almost every classic adventure game back then. Right now im a casual gamer, mostly because lack of time and the fact that most games are boring to me.Ive backed Broken Age through Kickstarter in hope of bringing recollection of those magical moments of my childhood.The game starts a little bit slow because You don't know the characters and enviroment of the story, but in less than half hour the game sucks You in. I can guarantee that story is first class and as the I Act ends half way You will be eagerly waiting for the final which will be available in couple of months. Real cliffhanger!Highly recommended!

												TLDR: A wonderful adventure game, with perfect writing, graphics and voice acting. A little easy and possibly short, depending on the still to be released second act.Broken Age is a great adventure game and don't let the angry people tell you otherwise.Let's get the ""bad"" out of the way. Yes, Broken Age is quite easy, especially if you're an adventure game veteran. If you are an adult who played a ton of adventure games you probably won't get stuck for hours on a puzzle. Also, presuming the second act will be as long as the first, the complete Broken Age will not be too long.Apart from that, though, it's a great adventure game. The angry veterans will lament the fact that it's not ""classic"" as Monkey Island. Well, I am an adventure game veteran too, and if you think what made games like Monkey Island great were a ton of action verbs and the fact that you got stuck for hours on a puzzle, well, you are missing the point. What made those games great were the setting, the humor, the fantastic characters, the fact that the game brought you in an awesome fantasy world. Broken Age does that wonderfully.The graphics, the writing, the characters and their voice actors are all perfect. Broken Age actually gave me a ""classic adventure"" game feeling, whatever that means, and I can't wait to play the second act.			"

It is DF-ish in every sense possible. Silly, mature, vibrantly positive. If you enjoyed adventure classics for its story and characters, you most probably will like Act I. If a good adventure game means inventory puzzles to you, you might want to reconsider.Personally, I can't wait for Act II.			"

												ACT I:Broken Age is a Double Fine adventure game which promised at conception to be like the Lucasarts adventure games of olde. You might remember its conception. Big ol' deal. Raised multiple millions in dollars because everybody has been harboring a secret erection for Tim Schafer's dazzling beard. Any negative reviews you might read are the result of his removing said beard. What was I talking about.So I guess the question here is, did it deliver on that promise? The answer is yeah basically.Broken Age is... a liiiittle more focused on story and world than puzzles than in those adventures of yore. Things are not quite as ridiculously complicated, but there's certainly a respectable amount of puzzle solving to be done, and it is good puzzle solving at that. I've heard the grumbles in the crowd. There is discourse over the difficulty of the puzzles to be solved. In regards to that, I can personally say that, while I never needed to consult any outside help at any time, I feel like the puzzles weren't anywhere in the realm of TOO easy. They felt... well maybe slightly easier than just right, but they're fun enough to let that slide.In screenshots, the art never took my fancy. But actually watching it in motion, and seeing the subtleties in animation and how the art style comes to life, it looks magical and pleasing to the eye. The soundtrack fits it nicely, and the voice actors display their talent proudly.Which leaves us the story to worry about. And, you know, obviously THAT'S going to be stellar. Remember that whole thing about the story being more of a focus? I just said it. Right up there. You alternate between playing Shay and Vella, and helping them through their plights. It's been said that you should play Shay's story first, and I agree. It gives things a good flow. Although you can switch back and forth between the characters mid-story (or, at least, I'm assuming you can, judging by the Day of the Tentacle-style portrait in the corner of the characters' inventories), you probably won't. The stories are fairly short - running you somewhere in the vicinity of 1-3 hours each - and are unlikely to drive you from one's arms into the other's before it forces you there.So far this is quite a nice story, and I'm anxious to see where it goes from here. It's going to be a long year, but I think more quality storytelling like this will be well worth the wait.Act II:[s]Wait for it...[/s]It seems this is a very Broken Age. Act II is now out, but I am experiencing an insurmountable crash at a certain point and cannot proceed. Looks like you'll be waiting for it for a good, long time to come at this rate.			"

												It is difficult to review a game that is only half-finished, but since there is currently no set date for Act II to be released, I suppose there's no harm in at least trying. Lets start with the cons, in order to get them out of the way, shall we? Possibly the most obvious, is the lack of an ending. While I understand the financial issues this title ended up facing, and I can appreciate how the developers decided to solve it, I'm still left feeling a little let down after realizing I would have to wait an undetermined amount of time before seeing a conclusion to this story. Indeed the story is wonderful, very well told and beautifully written, it simply lacks an ending. Act I is long enough to provide an enjoyable gaming experience, though at times the puzzles can be a bit simplistic. The action is primarily point and click, and puzzles revolve around finding objects to use with others in order to progress the characters. The characters themselves are wonderfully constructed an developed, as is their environment. The humor is witty at times, and a bit dry at others, but the writing holds up in general.I've heard many comparisons of this game to Monkey Island, however I wouldn't go so far as to agree with them (at least not until this one is finished). That being said, this title is still wonderfully constructed, and I do recommend it to those who are fans of puzzle games with linear stories and emotional rides. Especially if said fans are just slightly more interested in the story side than the puzzle side. The artwork is as equally impressive as the character development, and makes the game fun to simply look at. The soundtrack is fully orchestral and fits the game very well, helping to augment all the appropriate cutscenes. Character dialogue is provided by an array of very talented voice actors, each offering their stylistic abilities to their characters. This, in turn, creates a wonderful cast of characters for the player to interact with. All in all, this is a great game...so far. I really hope to hear about the release of the second act soon, but that is unfortunately not something I can recommend paying $25 for. Still, I suggest picking up this title as a daily deal or something. Certainly wouldn't promote the idea of paying more than $10. At least at this stage of development. Perhaps once the second half of the game is released, and it is given a proper ending, it will warrant the higher price tag. As is, however, it falls a bit short of that mark. Four Stars.			"

												If you have never played a Double Fine/Tim Schafer-game before, this one is a great place to start. It's an audiovisual feast with chuckleworthy jokes, characters and dialogue and while the puzzles are never too challenging, the pace of the game hits  a sweet spot between being thrilling and unwinding many adventure games strive for.

It took med about 5,5 hours to play it.Maybe total of 11 hours of gameplay for the whole game when Act 2 comes out.But buy it and have a very good experience!			"

												Broken Age is the LucasArts style adventure game from the 90s that you've been waiting for since the 90s. Tim Schafer's masterful dialog, character development and plot structure techniques are back in full force, no longer shoved into other genres.Act I is a pleasant experience where you are constantly seeing new areas, meeting new characters and solving relatively easy puzzles (for adventure game veterans anyways). Act 2 makes great use of those characters, even if it re-uses many of the same areas. The puzzles in the second half are much closer to the difficulty found in those 90s games, your mileage may very. Personally I had a handful of those adventure game moments where I started trying to use every item on everything until I finally figured out the solution. Expect to break out some pencil and paper for a couple of the more devious but satisfying puzzles.The art style looks like concept art in motion and has some truly stunning moments. This is a decent sized adventure that is worth seeing through to the end. We don't get a lot of adventure games with this level of production values anymore.			"

												Broken Age has set out to revive our love for point-and-click adventure games - titles such as Grim Fandango, Monkey Island, and the like.  Have Double Fine delivered on this front?  Personally, the answer is a resounding 'YES'.The art style, although rather simplistic upon first inspection, really adds to the overall feel of the game.  The voice acting is top-notch, and the story (as far as I have experienced in Act 1) is riveting as you move from place to place, even room to room.One minor flaw is that the puzzles aren't as challenging as I would have liked.  Saying that, they are aiming to bring this genre to a wider audience and for that I can not really fault them.I for one can't wait for Act 2.  I highly recommend this title, even at full price.			"

												I have just finished my first playthrough of Broken Age. And I loved it! Yes, I am aware of many people's complaints of how the game is too short and not worth 3 mln. bucks. Well, tell you what. I paid for it something like 8 dollars and I would say it is actually worth a lot more than that. It truly is short (took me 4+ hours), but hey, an average movie is only 1.5 hours long while its production cost is way higher. And as far as I'm concerned, short and good is much better than long and boring. And the game is indeed very good. I literally loved every bit of it. Artwork, design, voice-acting, dialogues, the plot itself and most importantly - all those tiny details that make you fall in love. What's more, the plot actually makes the game re-playable, even though it's 100% linear.And one more thing. The story in Broken Age is just, I don't know, heartwarming. And that's something I really miss sometimes.So I'm definitely looking forward to Act 2.			"

Although weird and funky, it showed the world perfectly.""I've played through the first part on both sides, I will note I played through shay and then vella. Holy crap was I blown away. I don't want to give spoilers to someone who hasn't played or seen the game fully though so i need to keep this short.I love the story, its fantastic and I can't wait for part two. I loved the art style. Although weird and funky, it showed the world perfectly. I loved the characters and the way they are connected to other characters like family is well done. The voice acting is amazing, I see where all the kickstarter money went.I do have some negatives i will say just to warn people though. The game is very simple. Its an old school point and click, meaning no choices in the story, the puzzles are very simple and very bad adventure game logic in some parts. I didn't need to look it up but i heard some people did because the answer to the puzzle was weird and didn't make sense. The biggest problem that this game has is that the games biggest feature is the story. This means people will probably look up lets plays and walkthroughs. This is because the game has no gameplay mechanics important enough to catch peoples eyes and want to play themselves to feel the mechanics.However Double fine have impressed me with this game, and if your thinking of buying it. Definitely consider it because this game is amazing in its story. However if you can't afford it or buy it off steam, you could allways look up a lets play, You won't miss much. Just consider buying it to aid the developers and get them to make more games as weird and as story driven as this one.9/10			"

												The art is beautiful and the voice acting amazing... but it doesn't change the fact that there is no depth to this game.  It's enjoyable and if you like point and click adventures go for it but nothing you do has an impact on the story at all.  It's just keep clicking until you find the 'right' answer to progress.

												I really wanted to recommend this game. The writing is great, the general idea is inventive, and it just feels genuine. That said, I cannot recommend this game due to the puzzles. Now, I may be a dolt, but usually after I trudge my way through a puzzle that should not be as difficult as I made it, I understand this and say ""Wow I can't believe I didn't see that."" This game doesn't give you that feeling on more than just a few occasions. Complexity and difficulty are good things, but incoherence is not and I would guess that even the smartest puzzle people spent hours with trial and error at certain points or used a guide. It's sad to see this in a game that might otherwise shine, and what would have been a memorable story with likeable characters becomes obscurred by drawn-out frustration and hindering gameplay.			"

												The first act of Broken Age is very amazing. A AAA level quality of animation, funny jokes, amazing voice acting, and the most important aspect, the Story, was full of explorations, mysteries, and imagination. You'll keep wondering what happen, why it happen, and what will happen.The second act however, is not as good as the first act. IMO, it's just lazy. You'll just re-exploring the places that you have explored in Act I, and for an adventure game, re-exploring is not fun. Though it still have the same quality of animation, jokes, and voice acting. The story is also a bit lacking, the great thing about act I, is that it makes player keep asking question throughout the game. Unfortunately, in Act II, the important mysteries already solved in the beginning of the game, and the remaining mysteries are remain unsolved until the end.But still, with all the disappointing elements in Act II, Broken Age is still an amazing game. The animation, jokes, and storytelling are something that should not be missed. Just think of it as a great game and it's not-so-good sequel compiled as one.			"

Surely there are some good parts in it, right? Might as well try.Holy ♥♥♥♥, they really weren't kidding. Swiss cheese plot, convoluted puzzles, and so much backtracking I just sincerely lost interest almost within 5 minutes.When the game also prevented me from saving (Still completely unsure why) and deleted my progress, I had no desire to finish. Honestly, if anyone still really wants to buy this, just play ACT 1 and imagine your own story for the second half. Seriously, you're doing yourself a favor.			"

												Short Answer:  This game isn't so much ""bad"" as it is disappointing.  Starts amazingly strong in Act 1, but clearly something went wrong during Act 2's development.  Only buy this game if it's on sale for a maximum of $10.  I'd wait for $7 or $8.Long Answer:  Act 1 was great, amazing even.  The art is wonderful, the story is compelling, the voice acting is great, and the puzzles are interesting.  The game allows you to switch between the apparently-unrelated stories of protagonists Vella and Shay and both have their own mysteries to explore, and puzzles to solve.  The puzzles in Act 1 are great too!  The majority of the puzzles aren't too difficult to solve without help, or too easy to be interesting.  There are a few that aren't as great, but most are pretty good.  The story leaves you feeling like you've completed something, while also leaving you with a cliff-hanger that will bring you back for Act 2Act 2 fails in most of these respects miserably.  The art and voice acting are still up to par, but the rest was disappointing.  The puzzles are mostly impossible-to-guess non sequiturs, which can't even be solved by clicking on everything with everything else like you did in the old adventure game days.  In fact, quite a lot of the puzzles can only be solved by telepathy.  By which I mean Shay and Vella must have a telepathic link because information only available in Vella's story is needed to progress through Shay's, and vice versa.  The rest of the puzzles can only be solved by internet walkthroughs because the logic is so insane.  The story makes about as much sense as the puzzles, and is never really finished by the end of the game.  Act 2 is so out of sync with Act 1 that I can only guess it was either made by totally different people, or something horrible happened during its development.I'd still buy this game just because Act 1 is so strong.  But I'd recommend only getting it at a really deep discount.			"

												A great adventure game from Tim Schafer and his team, which I would recommend to every fan of the genre. For non genre fans; if you can enjoy a well made family movie with a deeper underlying story you'll certainly like the game.The characters and the world are fantastic and quirky as you would expect it from a writer who worked on the legendary Monkey Island series. Though for a true masterpiece the game is too short and has too few locations. The puzzles are well designed, need some creativity to be solved and fit well into the presented world. The musical score by Peter McConnell is held in a modern romantic style and fits the game well, it lacks, though, a memorable main theme or motive kept throughout the score. This is admittedly difficult in such a short game with few location changes and though solid the music doesn't achieve more the being background music. The art style of the game is creative and functional at the same time and fits the story, characters and world well.The main story, if looked at bluntly, is quite brutal. It is, however, told in a very family movie like, innocent way. It works in the game, but, in my opinion, only because the end is not completely conclusive. I would love to see the same story in a more sinister and real world like game with a closed ending. I like the degree to which the parallel story of both main characters was intertwined in the puzzles, not too much, not too little.Overall I really enjoyed the game, including the non evitable moments when you're stuck and don't know what to do and their resolutions, as they're part of the game.

												I have no regrets backing this game. It's a charming adventure game with an interesting story, engaging characters, and clever dialogue. Everything I wanted out of a Tim Schaefer game. It took longer than promised, but if you watch their documentary, you'd learn why.Honestly, my one complaint are the puzzles in the second half of the game. People complained that the first half's puzzles are easy. And to be fair, they are for the most part. The second half, however, has some incredibly frustrating, unintuitive puzzles that make you want to pull your hair out. Without giving anything away, these are the pipe, knot, and wire puzzles. Most especially the wire puzzle, which comprises most of the final puzzles in the game. These especially require pen and paper beside you to write down diagrams and guides. It's the only way to complete them without having to go back and forth too much.Still, despite those frustrations, I greatly enjoyed the game. It's a satisfying game that any adventure game fan will enjoy.  It's no Grim Fandango or Monkey Island, but it's still a perfectly good adventure game. I honestly don't think it's worth the full asking price, but it's certainly worth it if you can nab it on a 50% (or lower) sale.			"

												Broken Age, or Broken Promises?I liked this game, but it's VERY short. The atmosphere and story are phenomenonal, but it'll only have you playing a few hours (3-4 hours tops). Also, it feels more like an extended trailer or demo than full game, which is disappointing since apparently this game received a few million dollars in Kickstarter funding and used it for other purposes instead of financing the rest of the game.For comparison, most adventure games have their first episode ~$5 or free, and charge $5/episode for the rest of them. Based on the list price of this game, it should include 5 episodes, but it only includes the first, and it's uncertain when, if ever the rest of the story will be completed.It's fun to spend several hours playing through, but the story cuts out just as it starts to go somewhere, and there's no sense of resolution. I really wanted to like this game more than I did because the art is great, but it's only the first episode of the story and it's priced more than most full-length adventure games. I'd still say it's worth it if you can get it on a good enough sale, but it's more demo than full-game. A lot of other indie devs have done a lot more with a lot less funding.			"

												Broken Age is without a doubt one of the best point'n'clicks of the last few years. As I mostly liked it, let's focus on what's wrong with it.I'm not a fan of the character design. Those faces, noses especially.There are some sloppily cropped parts of the foreground - artifacts are visible against the backgrounds.Some animations are lacking.There's a lot of backtracking and after the first act you've pretty much seen all areas the game lets you explore. For the rest of the game you'll be walking around them again and again, just with the characters swapped.There are some inconsistencies in the story.The game feels rushed, especially the ending.If they could've just taken the quality from the best parts of the game and keep it throughout the whole thing, Broken Age would not only be one of the best point'n'clicks of the last few years, as mentioned before, but also one of the best adventure games ever created.Overall, objectively 8/10.

												I just finished playing act 1 and 2 and had a lot of fun. The hand-drawn graphics look great, the music underlines the mood and the well-written, volumnious and funny dialogue is backed by fitting voice acting. The story is original and took some surprising turns. The user interface is minimal but functional and works without explicitly selecting verbs to interact with the game objects. The riddles weren't too hard, though later some of them became a little frustrating and took me quite some time to solve. I managed to finish the game withouth looking at hints and too much frustration though. :-)All in all I'm very happy with the game and think that, gameplay-wise, it is quite on par with some of the old titles from Lucasfilm Games (which had some minor quirks, too). I enjoyed it a lot and think this game might be a future classic.			"

												Buy this game!  Why?  Read on my new acquaintance…and no spoilers below.Broken Age tells a story that is full of humor that explores the challenges of growing through adolescence and being stuck in certain roles.  It explores scenarios that players of various backgrounds can relate to, sympathize with and learn from.  And did I mention it was funny?  Oh yeah, I did.  Well, I thought that it was so important that I should mention it twice. Not only did the dialogue have me chuckling but plenty of scenarios are outright funny. It was easy to kick back, put my feet up and get immersed into the game.  The hand-drawn art is gorgeous and charming.  And when you move the character around in one of the more static backgrounds it feels like you are walking through a painting.  There are plenty of character comments, animations and other little details that make the world feel real and alive.  The music and sound effects are great, fit well and help to make the game feel unique. The puzzles are well-balanced.  Many times dialogue is provided that helped direct me towards the next step leading to less frustration and more moments of self satisfaction.  This leads to lots of moments where I thought ""yay, I'm smart"".  And who doesn't want to feel smart? In summary, get off your butt and buy this game…well…you’ll probably still be sitting while buying/playing this game so…don’t get up and buy this game!			"

												Worth every penny I pledged; this is a beautiful, hilarious, and emotionally poignant game full of all of the little Tim Schafer touches we've all grown to love. The only complaints I have are that it is indeed only half of a game and that that half is rather short and easy, but I have no doubts that Doublefine will step up their game for the next half.			"

												Play this game if you like old point-and-click adventure games. It's simpler than Full Throttle, The Dig and the Monkey Island franchise, but the story is nice and it has beautiful ""painted"" graphics. Can't wait for the 2nd act...hope they'll made more acts after this one.There's two stories in Act 1, one of them seems a little lame/childish, the other is really good. The hook between them makes this game shine!As i've said, this game is simpler than other SCUMMVM games since there's not a lot of options of moves you can do (like the menu in Monkey Island with options like open, close, talk to, etc, or the menu in Full throttle where you can punch, kick, use Ben's mouth into items, etc). In this game, you have an inventory and you can combine items or use them with scenery objects, you talk to people and you can explore the world. As in old lucas arts games, you have to talk to NPCs to unlock new choices of answers or to proceed in the stories/game.			"

												I had a blast playing this. I honestly did; the story, graphics, and just overall quality are awesome.However, still waiting for that Act II.Along with that, this isn't particularly a challenging 'Point and Click', or satisfying in that aspect. I found more satisfaction in seeing the story and dialogue than I did actually playing the game. If you dig narrative, you're gonna love this. If you fancy  game mechanics, puzzles, and just figuring things out . . . meh. It's very simple, so you'll be dissapointed in that aspect. Because it's a game, you get to access more witty dialogue than you would in a show/comic because since it's a game, you can explore and that kinda thing, but other than that i'm not sure I can see the point in it actually being a game.tl;dr: Broken Age is more of a story-driven game with meh point-and-click mechanics (basically, weak as a 'game'). Great quality, but unfinished. If you haven't bought it yet, wait until a sale or until Act II finally comes out.I'll probably change this a bit when Act II comes out.			"

												I usually dont play point and click games, because i find them either boring or just to hard (From puzzle/riddles side of view)but this one found a great balance between great story and not so hard and not so easy puzzles thanks to that i was able to acctualy finish the game and enjoy the story. So if you are a casual in point and click games then go ahead and buy it, its really worth it!The story has a lot of likeable characters and really nice voice acting, but i felt like they lack a little bit of expression in their statements. Hand drawn graphics (or whatever they are, im not an expert in art) are really beautiful and fit the story perfectly.Gameplay wise its just another point and click really nothing new there, point on something and click it.

												This game is quite stunning considering the point and click adventure style not being approached often in this day and age.I finally had to sit down and finish this game because I was so enthralled with it, but this is not without its drawbacks.One of the biggest issues with this game is the late game puzzles, specifically the hexipal (hexigal) puzzles, are completely randomized per game. This means that your game will differ from any walkthrough that you look at. This fornunately helps sharpen your mental skills through patternization and memory. I would recommend this game to any fan of double-fine and point and click adventure games.			"

												It is an empty husk of a once good genre. Generic characters with generic audio in a story with pretty big plot holes. Puzzles are more of a nuisance than something that is fun and challenging. Lots of backtracking throughout the whole of the game, which gets tiring. Motivation for the characters is not well built, and mostly you are supposed to take the world and their people with their madness as they are: unexplained. Just like the main antagonist's motivation, you are supposed to take it ""just the way things are here"". Why are the parents separating themselves in solitude from the kid instead of being together? How did the parents not know about the evil plan? Could go on for a while.Girlfriend actually finished the second part and was mad at how such an unfinished, unpolished game could be made. I didn't bother. Overall, not even the first half of this game was not worth the time I've spent on it. This is no Lucasarts or Grim Fandango here, folks.			"

												The final product of this game was a long time coming but now both parts are released. It's a charming point and click adventure told from the perspectives of two characters Shay and Vella. You play both characters seperately but can switch between the two at will. The game is standard point and click stuff with plenty of puzzles which are mainly good and intuitive yet challenging enough. The first act of the game is it's strongest setting up the story and characters brilliantly but the second act is a bit disappointing with more focus on puzzles and less on the story and characters. The Good:- beautiful animation -great characters and story (for the first act anyway)- enjoyable intuitive puzzles-brilliant voice acting with a strong castThe Bad:-weaker second act that lets the game down  Overall this is a great charming game but it falls short of being brilliant due to the second act which unfortunately lets the game down. Still worth playing though especially now both acts have been released.			"

												I am a novice of the 2d graphic adventure genre. This is basically my first real foray into this world. I have played other adventure titles, like the Telltale games, and Ron Gilbert's recent release THE CAVE, yet this is my first real taste of Tim Schafer's distinct style. So with that being said please understand my expectations may differ from those who have played the vaunted Lucas titles, and have an affinity for that type of gameplay. For me though, this game was just a delight. Starting with the basics, the visuals in this game are unlike anything I have seen in a game. The use of these warm, wholesome colors, and these weird and off-kilter shapes and designs creates a distinct and wholly unique visual vocabulary, that just grabs you from second one, and never lets you go. And the way Tim Schafer's dialogue compliments that visual design is just spot-on. Really irreverent and dry humor gives way to some hilarious and unforeseen non-sequiturs that just lend itself so nicely to the feeling of familiarity and at the same time, mystery of this world. The music and voice-acting are also huge strengths. Everyone is really on-point with their line readings, and all the actors seem perfectly cast, and organic to the universe. The music drifts, almost like the wind, in the background of the game. Providing an eerie, almost ethereal quality to the game. But it can turn on a dime, and become the bombastic and self-important score of a summer blockbuster, which helps to highlight some of the more intense and larger-than-life moments. Now, all of this stuff combined would be enough for me to recommend it to anyone, but it is the gameplay that really puts this one into the stratosphere for me. The puzzle design, while sometimes subject to archaic tropes of the genre, is generally fantastic. The character inventory never gets so out-of-hand that I was banging my head on the wall for a solution, but not so easy that I was able to just breeze through it. The real process of solving was more reliant on your knowledge of each screen in a given area, and all the interactables in each screen. Limiting inventory allows you to focus more on the environment and less on the interactions of items you have in your possession. The puzzles difficulty was definitely ramped up in the second act, and sometimes there were ways to solve a puzzle that I felt weren't telegraphed in a way that made them readily apparent. But I was able to overlook those, as most of the puzzles were pretty self-evident, and required a little more than a modicum of thought to solve. Overall, I found this game to be one of my more cherished gaming experiences in recent memory. There were so few obvious flaws, and so few sour notes that I would be remiss if I did not recommend it to anyone who has even a tertiary interest in graphic adventure games. A nice, succinct, and gloriously original experience from the people at Double Fine. Great work!			"

												Broken Age has several big problems, most to do with fundamental design decisions, and some with surprising sloppiness in writing. But despite that there’s a lot of charm to the presentation, and a great level of polish to the game.I didn’t play this game until Act 2 was out, so I played both back to back. The first act is very simple. There’s not much to it, which makes it focused and clear. But it feels a bit flat because of it. I kept expecting to be able to talk more in depth with characters about what was going on. But after a while I decided to just roll with it. Act 2 on the other hand is complicated to the point of being convoluted. The game tosses so many new concepts at you that most end up feeling underdeveloped. There isn’t nearly enough dialog given the amount of stuff going on. Several times you’re given information that changes everything you thought about the world, and then you immediately go off to solve puzzles instead of talking about it with someone. So much of the dialog revolves around practical matters to advance the plot to the next stage, without having any character to it. This made the character arcs so vague that I’m not convinced there even were any. I’ve watched the documentary series made during the production of the game, and they were well aware of character arcs being important. But in the final game I’m just not seeing it. When the credits rolled I thought back at where the story started, and at the end it just hadn’t gone anywhere.I’ve seen varied reactions on the puzzles in Act 2. I thought they were horrible, to the point where  I began to question the entire premise of “hard” puzzles in adventure games. I don’t think they have a place in Broken Age. They didn’t fit thematically, and they didn’t even make logical sense. Like there are several puzzles about wiring robots where the direction of the cable produces different results. I had to shout down parts of my brain in order for this to make sense. At that point in the story there’s a sense of urgency. But those 30 minutes spent wiring robots deflated all the tension from the scene. Too many of the puzzles are like that in Act 2. There are a few exceptions to this, like one involving a camera helmet. That puzzle did everything right, because in the process of solving the puzzle you learn about how the world works just through looking and experimenting on your own. Gameplay and story exposition in perfect harmony. But toward the end the puzzles became like a sadistic joke. Several of them are randomized, so you can’t even bypass them using walkthroughs. Clearly a lot of effort went into designing these things, and I just have to question why anyone would subject human beings to this? In Act 1 I got the impression story got precedent over the “game” parts of the game. In Act 2 it pushes the game aspects harder, and it almost makes both story and game fall apart.But even with all that said, I still recommend Broken Age. I had a reasonably nice time with it, even in Act 2. The art is great, the voice acting is as good as it gets, the music is excellent. It's full of fun creative characters and ideas. There's almost nothing else like this. I don't mean point-and-click adventures, as there's plenty of those. I mean stylistically. And despite the disappointing last half, the sheer originality of the style made this feel worthwhile. I wish it'd been better executed, but I'm happy it exists, even in this form.			"

												A beautiful and unique style with gorgeous visuals and awesomely done animations combined with Tim Schafer's iconic humour and storytelling results in an incredible experience of modern adventuring. My only possible complaints would be a lack of a LOOK interaction (something I think is essential in an adventure game), and puzzles getting a little convoluted in the 2nd half, but despite that, I cannot help but highly recommend this game!

												Originally I think I just followed the crowd with the whole 'rah rah Tim Schafer grr' mindset, until I stopped giving a crap about that certain controversy and just played this game. And wow, oh my god, I'm glad I did. This is definitely my kind of point-and-click, and has got me properly into the genre.Act 1The first part of the game was pretty much all atmosphere for me. The puzzles were light, the dialogue long, and the environments were introduced spectacularly. It really got you into the world of Broken Age without trying to frustrate you for the sake of puzzles being puzzles early on (something that made me keep Monkey Island at arm's length for a long time). It suuuper made me want to play act 2, it made the wait crazy for me.The highlight of act 1 for me had to be the cake dresses (as seen in the example screenshots on the store page). They were absolutely lovely, and fantastical. I have to applaud whoever came up with that idea. I certainly enjoyed Vella's side of the act a lot more than Shay's due to this.Act 2I've seen others complaining about the puzzles in act 2, but to me the puzzles were what made the wait for the second act worth it. If the puzzles had been too easy, then I probably would have just whizzed through and the wait wouldn't have felt all that worth it. However because the puzzles were a notch harder I ended up really having to work for the ending (only pulling up a guide twice, to get hints about how I could figure out the Hexi-gal). I'm glad the puzzles were as hard as they ended up being.The twist, now going by what happened in act 1 I really didn't see that coming. It felt awesome discovering that it wasn't predictable.I'm really happy that this game exists, and I'll certainly be going back to play it every so often. I want to know the story like the back of my hand, I want to buy Broken Age merch, I NEED some kind of poster to put on my wall.You all gotta play Broken Age.			"

												A great throwback to the golden age of adventure games; Broken Age is proof positive that the old genre still has some life in it. The art style is absolutely gorgeous; it's like a pop-up book come to life. The story is tightly written, and is one of the best examples of storytelling in gaming. The game is quite funny, but that's to be expected from the minds behind Psychonauts and Brutal Legend. As for difficulty, the game isn't too hard by adventure game standards. Generally speaking, most puzzle solutions are logical, and only a few managed to stump me. The dual protagonist setup is well thought-out; if you get bored with a protagonist, or fed up with his/her current puzzle, you can easily switch back to the other protagonist for a change of pace. My only complaint is that the game is a bit on the short side, and being an adventure game, the replay value is limited. Of course, that could change with the release of Part 2 later this year (which will be available as a free update), but the game is definitely worth buying in its current state. "

												I must admit I lost interest kind of quickly, so I didn't play for a long period each time. For me it was because to little happened. It didn't make me curious = I didn't feel the need to play ""just a little bit more"". However I'd recomend the game, because it's a beautiful, funny and it's a nice ""filler"".			"

												Positives:- beautiful art and well written story- great music and sounds plus voice acting- great characters- overall very satisfying and funny- two separate stories in one game- unexpected endingNegatives: - not really what you would expect from the overrated reviews!- too short for the price even with discount- little interactivity, too many animated sequences- puzzles and action sequences are a child's play- low resolution graphics when the game zooms in during dialogs			"

												The voice acting, soundtrack, initial storyline, overall themes, and artwork were appealing and intrguing.  I enjoyed playing as two vastly different, yet strong character leads.  The parallel, and at times, converging storylines were well written and kept me looking forward to the puzzles  and character interactions with NPCs.  Most of the voices that you hear will be familiar and it was fun going through the IMDB cast of voice actors, when I knew I'd heard that voice before.  Although most of the puzzles were logical or just took a little thought and tinkering, I did find myself perusing a walkthrough on occasion.  About halfway through the game you'll find the there are points were the storyline drags because you're going back and forth between the same scenes.  These two drawbacks are common enough with point-and-click adventure games that it didn't deter me from pushing through those sections.  I enjoyed most of my time with this game but would recommend getting it wihle it's on sale.			"

												This game was great for the whole hour and change it took me to beat Act 1. It then abruptly ended, at which point I discovered I had not actually purchased a whole game, I'd only purchased half of one. This is a real shame; I wanted to support a great game design team, play a good game, and I even threw in the extra for the soundtrack because I thought ""This team has a vision, and I want to get behind a work of art."" I wasted $18 on half a game and I haven't got a clue where I can claim my soundtrack. I think Tim Schafer should be ashamed to fool people into buying something that isn't complete and then charge them an in-app purchase to play the rest of the game. It's underhanded, sleezy, and I'm not going to be buying from Double Fine or any other company with Tim Schafer's name on it again.TLDR: Great hour of a game, wouldn't pay 18 bucks for an hour of gameplay though. Super mad that they are charging for the rest of the game, should have charged the price for the whole thing upfront.			"

												Short version: Not a bad game, but the rave critic reviews aren't really justified and I'd wait for a sale. $15 or less.I typically enjoy games for the story and have always enjoyed adventure games. I felt constantly slightly let down by this game and I just assumed it would grow in depth and complexity... especially as that seemed to be part of the overall theme of the storyline (growing up, learning to deal with gray areas - no spoilers here, so I won't say more). However it never really did.I adored The Longest Journey and Syberia... this felt very basic and simplistic in comparison. I don't hate it, but I don't feel it was worth $25. I'll probably play Act 2 to see if it gets better, and because it's included. I am curious how the story plays out. But my expectations were probably too high based on those reviews.			"

												I backed the Kickstarter and I really want to like this kind of point&click adventure. But in this case I can't be bothered. I gave it an hour or two before I gave up. It's neat to switch between two different characters and stories, the graphics are painted/comic book style and partially quite nice. But the gameplay and story is just too weird and ultimately boring for my taste. It makes me wonder how many drugs they were abusing when designing this game... sorry.Your mileage may vary, if you're into this kind of game.			"

Not very good. Maybe it's just me, but the inventory kept coming up in the bottom and it was annoying. A map would have been helpful a little bit in the ship.

												This game is an incredibly charming reimagining of lucasarts style adventure games. Not only is the execution pitch perfect, but the story is an interesting allegory to the way people are restricted in their agency. Some complaints have been made about the length and straightforwardness of the puzzles. In my opinion though, if you take your time thinking about the allegories and jokes being made and try out all the 'wrong' item combinations that each have their own dialogue, there is a lot to savour. I am looking forward to play the second half.			"

Posted: February 5, 2014
												Unlike any other adventure I’ve ever played, Tim Schafer’s Double Fine Adventure: Broken Age: Act 1, by the Staff of Double Fine and Illustrated by a Bagel is a beauty. Everything fleshes well thematically and almost everything feeds into the story.There are many ways where TSDFA:BA:A1btSoDFaIbaB does not push adventure gaming forward. In many ways, it’s pretty standard. There’s an inventory. One-click, one verb. Not really all that impressive, and I’ve been spoiled by other indie adventures when it comes to innovations. There aren’t any novel little touches to the mechanics, as, for example, I’ve grown to expect in each new Wadjet Eye game. Resonance memorably used scenery and memories in the inventory, and another (which escapes my memory) used dialogue in the inventory. This dialogue-inventory thing was, frankly, was sort of a refinement of the sword dueling in the first Monkey Island game, a sequence more directly stolen in The Shivah. Still, Wadjet Eye added an interesting twist to the soup of mechanics—- sounds delicious!—- and there are no twists in TSDFA:BA:A1btSoDFaIbaB.This game is also very pretty, and very well produced, even if the gameplay is really on the easy side. Then again, that’s no innovation for Double Fine this side of the Meat Circus. Saying Double Fine has beautifully, impeccably polished flavor hindered by simplistic gameplay is sort of like saying that Bethesda makes large sandbox RPGs, that Rockstar has a potty mouth, or that Obsidian is Latin for “rushed by publisher.”No, where TSDFA:BA:A1btSoDFaIbaB is one of the great adventures is in how carefully it examines, in every aspect of the design, the difficulties of growing up, of coming of age. That’s why its art stands out. Though Bagel’s paintings are storybook perfection, it isn’t the kind of art you’d see in a children’s storybook. It has shadows lurking, and the right kind of sophistication, hinting at the increased burdens of adulthood. Its soundtrack, worth a purchase by itself, is in turns intimate and epic. Its puzzles usually mean something to the story, because, as another reviewer pointed out, they often involve helping someone else, an important element of any coming of age story. These puzzles rarely if ever distract from the overall experience, and always—- and I mean always—- logical. There’s one situation which comes close to contrivance, but it, almost too conveniently, gets explained away.All of these elements feed into what is so far one of the most complex coming of age stories in recent memory. Like a Pixar film, it challenges easy storytelling conventions to create a thematically rich and well-fleshed-out story, with ambiguities, with subtleties, with surprises. This richness is really only appreciated on multiple playthroughs, making this game one of the rare adventures worth replaying. This is the sort of element which is independent of having only the first half of the story released—- each of the characters tries to make their way, rebelling against what’s thought best for them, only to find a deeper reality than they ever expected. This haunting subtlety lends itself as even a theme to the story.SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSFor example, whether parents have the best interests of their children in mind is actually a question in this story. That is astonishing only in a sense, because there is a sense where coming of age stories routinely question parental authority. However, in TSDFA:BA:A1btSoDFaIbaB, it actually feels like a question, seriously considered, if not analyzed, by Tim Schafer and his legion of designers. As of the first half of the story, the answer to that question has not already been answered, and there is reason to suspect that a Momputer really does her boy’s best interests at heart, and her concern over him his leaving his cradle seems genuine and not at all cynical, not at all calculating. There’s also reason to believe she was, at one point, in precisely the same situation as the girl character, sacrificed for a greater good. The boy, working without the supervision of his Momputer, believes he is doing good by some innocent victims—- yet he’s stealing girls from their families. The girl believes she’s killing a ravenous beast, only to realize that the tentacled monster is piloted, somehow, by a boy her age.This moment, carefully built up to by a number of hints, in its way represents not just the literal sense—- the boring sense—- of a plot twist. Even this climax—- a cliffhanger for Part 1 of 2—- has direct relation to the theme, to coming of age. What boy did not treat girls as things to be saved, and what girls did not treat boys as monsters to be avoided? What boy did not ache for danger or challenge, against being coddled? What girl was not angry at being forced into doing something at odds with who she was? Even the title serves the theme: Looking at it sideways, “Broken Age” summons the awkwardness of adolescence, the age of breaking childhood and emerging into adulthood. Man, that’s a good title—- you’d think they’d go with “Broken Age” instead of TSDFA:BA:A1btSoDFaIbaB. Hindsight, I suppose.These few examples, and I’m sure they’re only the barest, most obvious examples, underscore the beautiful cohesion of all elements of this game in service to a story. It does not just tell the story of a boy named Shay, a girl named Vella. It tells the story of what it means to grow up, what it’s like to finally notice the opposite sex, to rebel against parental authority, and what leaving the safety of that authority means. Not a thing seems out of place, and not a moment draws the player out of the experience. As a result, it’s more than just the most beautiful adventure game ever created—- it’s also the most true.Tim Schafer still has a chance to fall into the Dread Pit of Cliches in the second half, I suppose, but after this first half, and after all the hints towards the far-reaching disaster these characters cause, I have no cause to believe he will fail this game, or fail the story.Forgive its brevity, forgive its ease, and forget its simplicity. Broken Age has a lot to say, and it says it enthrallingly, and—- this is its innovation—- it says it with every part, in every moment.			"

												Act 1 of Broken Age had an interesting story for both characters that kept me playing for more.  I enjoyed how beautiful the game looked with the paint style they chose to use on everything.  I had a lot of fun interacting with everything to hear what dialouges the characters had to offer.  Double Fine wanted to make a comeback with the point-and-click genre and I'd have to say this was definitely a great start.  I can't wait for act 2 to come out.			"

												This is a piece of art. Instead of thinking of this similar to other games, it seems closer what many games start off as: a vehicle for communicating a very in-depth story (similar to what good books and movies do). The animation, story, and soundtrack are all very much the focus, and each of these areas are artistic, high quality, and enjoyable. The only personal downside is that the point-and-click aspect is not as engaging as other types of gameplay styles for me, but this is more a drawback of the genre than this game particularly... the execution of the point-and-click functionality in this game seems as good as can be expected.

This point-and-click adventure tells an amazing story of two people and their stories which do not seem to have a connection, until subtle hints are dropped here and there.Smooth controls ( minus drag and drop sadly ), gorgous visuals and superb dialog. This is what gaming is about, amazing adventures with great immersion and breathtaking moments that leave you in awe for a few seconds, just sitting there and staring at your screen trying to comprehend what just happened.Do yourself a favor, even if  you are not very into point-and-click games, this game deserves to be in your library.

												Point and click games never interested me in the past, but, I was pleasantly surprised by Broken Age's hilarious plot and characters. The game has an awesome art style that feels cartoony yet has a gritty undertone to it that makes it stand out from most video games. There were many times where the near bat s**t insane characters entertained me to no end. (Not to spoil to much but when you meet the talking tree I dare you not to laugh!). It's more of a cartoon movie rather than a game so dont go into it expecting revolutionary gameplay, cause it's far from it. The issue with Broken Age is I felt the game was much to short for the price tag. On the up side, the developers are in works creating part 2, meaning there will be more content in the future for Broken Age to continue it's story. For what it is, Broken Age does it's job well for giving you a great 4 hr adventure through its bizzare and wacky world, even if it isn't everyone's cup of tea.			"

												I think this game deserves credit for making some ballsy decisions in terms of puzzle design.For my experience it meant that there were a lot of interesting puzzles, but at times it also seemed very unintuitive to a point, where I wasn't able to tell, if I was going in the right direction or not.I got through this game in 10 hours, which seems to be the average for the main story of the game according to https://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=26791At times I felt I must've been moving very slowly through the game for the exact reasons mentioned above. I would spend a lot of time walking back and forth at certain points, because I was missing some or clue or at times disagreed completely with the intended solution(The huggy snake for example).That's about it for the negatives, which most of the time was a positive.Another particularly great thing about the game was the story - especially the first half. It fooled me on several occasions. I'm only sad that the end of the story wasn't elaborated a bit further. Might've been due to a lack of exploration on my part, but I think that just signifies the story was interesting enough to want to know more.I also really liked how well the game played with a controller. I didn't realise this until halfway into the game, but the game has implemented a really nice selection mechanism in the right analog stick. The left analog stick works like a regular cursor, while the right analog stick drags the cursor to interactable elements on the screen.  Other controls in terms of selecting and using items etc.Finally, I really enjoyed the art style too. I'm quite surprised at how well they managed to make important elements stand out in this style, where colours sort of blend together a lot. Voice acting was top notch too, but even more I liked the script, which was executed excellent by the voice actors. There was a lot of humor in the game of all sorts that made the game a lot more enjoyable; especially while trying different item combinations that were commented upon by the characters in the game.To summarize: It's a quality production with fun puzzles and an interesting story that is supported by good writing, good voice acting and beautiful art.

												Act 1:The first hour of the game is pretty terrible, as there are no puzzles and hardly any user interaction, you are basically clicking your way through a cartoon and not a good one, as there is a ton of repetition. It does get better later on as the game opens up and you are allowed to run around on your own, but it still never quite captures what made the classical LucasArts adventure great.In terms of interface it feels disappointing and like a step backward for the genre. You don't have a dialogue-skip button and can only skip full cutscenes, that makes it far to easy to skip over important content. And the lack of a dedicated view-action means you aren't allowed to inspect the environment properly. There isn't a hotspot-highlight button either. All of that have been standard parts of most modern point&click games.Graphically the game is ok, but just barely so. The sprites all look really flat and cheaply animated (i.e. what you expect from Flash animation) and the backgrounds show some ugly pixelation when the camera zooms in. On the plus side the game does a lot of camera motion to keep things interesting and it has quite a few custom animation.All that said, I did start having fun with the game before the end. As once the game opens up and you get a little more familiar with the characters and the overall situation it starts to feel more like a proper point&click game. If they can improve a little on that this might turn on into a really good adventure game. But compared to all the stuff Daedalic has put out this just doesn't really look all that impressive and as a callback to the classic days it kind of fails, as it feels to watered down and artsy for it's own good. It's still good enough to recommend it, just don't expect a worthy successor to the LucasArts adventures.Act 2:Continues exactly where the first one left off. There are no updates to the interface, graphics or anything. Puzzles are this time a little harder then before, but not in a good way. There is a lot of walking forward and backward through scenes and it can be easy to miss a critical clue. The game is also filled with time based puzzles and puzzles that require correct setup or else they reset, this leads to a lot of repetition and frustration due to the lack of proper dialogue skip. Good inventory based puzzles don't really exist and the game doesn't really do much with the character switching either. You can play each character almost completely separate from the other and outside the very last sequence they never interact.As far as setting is concerned, act 2 reuses most locations from act 1 with some small changes. There is very little new happening here and the story reveal feels pretty ""meh"", as it doesn't really open up any new areas or anything. The whole mythology of that world feels pretty underdeveloped and not really explained enough. The ending feels like there would be an Act 3 to follow that plugs those holes, but there isn't one.Overall this isn't a horrible adventure by any means and it has it's moments, but it's pretty mediocre and certainly not up to classical LucasArts quality and with all the simplification going on in the interface it feels like they weren't even trying to get there.On the positive side: The game runs flawlessly on Linux with Open Source ATI drivers.

												A worthy modern successor to old school point & click adventure games. I loved the classic Lucasarts and Sierra games in the early 90s and Broken Age really scratched that itch for the first time in a long while. The visual style was unique and beautiful, the puzzles were very satisfying and I found the difficulty level to be just about right as well. Maybe it wasn't quite as good as Monkey Island 2, but it was a truly enjoyable way to spend 15 hours.			"

												Broken Age is a point-click game that requires a lot of attention to detail.  I understand that as the game progresses, so does the difficulty.  However, I find that the difficult puzzles (e.g. the knot puzzle, robot wiring) came with no clear instructions, and furthermore, just dragged the story out.  Puzzles are meant for the players to feel integrated into the storyline, but the ones in act two were tedious and frustrating.  It drew me away from the initial timeline, and focused my attention onto wiring a robot to play a harp. Aside from that, Broken Age did a very good job creating quirky and fun characters.  This element brought a lot of colour to the story, and although there were some holes in the plot itself, I still enjoyed it nevertheless.  The music was fitting, but it wasn't something I'd stop playing for (too frustrated from the act two puzzles). And if you plan to play this game, make sure you have a pen and paper... And also a guide. Trust me, you're going to need it.			"

But you will get act 2 when it comes out as well.Honestly, one of the best point and click adventure games I've played.			"

												I love this game, when I was first looking at it I saw a lot of reviews complaining about act 2 and the story within. I picked this up during the summer sale and decided to give it a go a couple of days ago. I was completely hooked. It has a really interesting story and delightful visuals, it is super well crafted.The negative reviews about the story in act two (such as ""anything you make up will be better"") are completely inaccurate for me. The story followed a pattern that I started to understand when I was swapping between characters and I thought the game followed a logical path.The reviews about walkthroughs in the second half are quite true. The puzzles aren't completely unrelated and I think sometimes I was actually so focused on something that I had gleaned from a brief look at the walkthrough that I missed an obvious solution to the problem I was having. The game does a good job at hinting at what the characters need if you get it wrong, but it can be entirely frustrating when you just can't see the answer, particularly like in the second half where sometimes you need something from the person you are not playing as to help the one you are playing as (but now that you know that you'll know to look for it so you might be better off already). Overall I got a little frustrated at times but I loved the clever quirks put into all of the characters and the silly outcomes of the puzzles (silly as in fun not as not matching to the rest of the story). I loved this game I would recommend it happily.			"

												Review for Act 1While playing video games growing up I've come to realize that the best games always seem to have something very specific in common; something that allows you get wrapped up in and immersed in a different world to escape reality for a short time and get lost in the beauty of it; and that would be that they all have a great story. A story first above all else; above crazy graphics, above gameplay, and even above music, etc.  A story that lets you become a part of it.There are so many games these days that seem to forget that you should always start with that good story first, with fully realized worlds and the characters that inhabit them. And the games that do realize what should come first, usually turn out to be amazing works of art; games that draw you in and never let go, and have a lasting impression.And Broken Age is an excellent example of this. The story is at the heart of the experience and you can feel it.And even though this game might seem very simplistic in nature (given its gameplay style), it truly is just as satisfying to play as it would be to play a huge, multi-million dollar, RPG production made by a first-party studio by hundreds of people. But I think that's what makes this game so special: that it can be as great as it is even though it was made by just a handful of dedicated people who truly care about what they’re creating and why they’re creating it.Double Fine has shown that you can have an exciting adventure that whisks you away to worlds full of challenges, laughter, and even emotionally-engaging moments, in the form of a point-and-click adventure that’s very accessible and easy to pick up and play. And the impact you feel at the end of Act 1 is an immensive one, that really gets you thinking. It was surprising to find out how much I cared about what happened to the two main characters and how they impacted the worlds around them.I would definitely recommend this game to people who enjoy a great story, even if the gameplay style isn’t normally what they might be in to. You just might be surprised with how much you’ll enjoy it.I absolutely cannot wait until Act II! I cannot wait to go back into Shay's and Vella's worlds to finally get some answers to some burning questions! And I have a feeling it's going to be a very satisfying conclusion regardless of how it ends.:)Congrats again to Double Fine for some amazing work so far!			"

												I really like this game. I got it because I have played most of Double Fine's games and because of that, they gave me 2 coupons for the game so I bought it for my friend and I.In the end I'm actually really glad I did because it really was a fun game. Yeah it took forever for the second act to be released but in the end i actually felt it was worth it because the second act was just as enjoyable as the first.I really like the characters and humor and art was pretty good as well. While some of the puzzles were easy to figure out, I actually liked that the ones in the second act proved more of challenge, even though they were actually quite frustrating as well.Really if you are a fan of adventure games and feel like you would enjoy this game, then get it probably on sale or whatever price works for you. I understand that not everyone enjoyed it, but I did at least, and maybe people who didn't have to wait so long for act 2 will enjoy it more who knows. XD			"

												Broken Age is a very charming point and click adventure, it has a very nice art style and very good voice acting.

It feels like an adventure into unknown lands with 2 angsty teenagers seeking adventure and excitement. Act 1 is the better half but overall the game is still fun to play and has a lot of laughs. It tries to harken back to the old school point and click adventure and almost delievers.			"

												หลังเล่นจบ Act 1 รับรู้เลยว่า เล่นแบบผ่านๆไม่ได้ ต้องอ่าน และดูเนื้อเรื่อง ไม่เช่นนั้นพัซเซิลจะยากมาก เพราะไม่มี log คอยบอกว่าต้องทำอะไรก่อนหลัง ความสนุกของเกมส์ อยู่กึ่งๆระหว่างความไม่สนุก คนที่บอกว่าสนุก คงเพลิดเพลินไปกับความอาร์ตของเกมส์ และพัซเซิลที่ท้าทายระดับนึงเลย แต่ถ้าไม่ค่อยอดทน อาจจะเบื่อไปซะก่อนจะเล่นจบ เพราะระบบเกมส์มีค่อนข้างน้อย จึงทำให้ช่วงหลังน่าเบื่อ7/10 (เฉพาะคะแนน Act 1)			"

												An original world and story for a comical yet endearing point-and-click adventure. While I wish they'd done more with the interaction between both worlds (you can play most of the game without it) it was none the less nice to have two storylines that are connected and form a whole. Some of the later puzzles were a little vague (this seems to be what is prompting some down-voting), and a hint system would have been nice here, but overall this wasn't too hard a game if you can stand some trial-and-error.

												I wish Steam had a more nuanced option than ""Yes"" or ""No"" because I would use it for this game.Let me begin with some things that affected my view of the game that might not affect yours. I was a Kickstarter backer, and backed Double Fine Adventure (Broken Age) for an amount quite a bit higher than the suggested retail price. I did so because my three all-time favorite adventure games (Monkey Islands 2, Monkey Islands 1, Day of the Tentacle) were all by Tim Schafer.  Unfortunately, the result -- this game I am reviewing -- does not match their quality. And no, it is not just nostaligia, because Broken Age compares poorly against The Book of Unwritten Tales (1 & 2 both highly recomended) which is ""modern."" So part of the reason for my disappointment in Broken Age is that it did not meet the high expectations I had going in to it. Now to the game itself, starting with the art. Zooming into the screenshots will show that the game has a distinct, almost impressionistic, art style to it -- see for example the visible brush stokes in some of the backgrounds. Obviously art is subjective, but I did not find the art to taste. Honestly, I would have prefered whatever effort  that went into the art style put instead into creating more locations, more puzzles, more plot, more ....   anything other than snooty art. Your milage may vary.Part 1 was widely criticized for having overly easy puzzles. Part 2 has puzzles that are much more challenging. Average as a whole, I think the puzzles are good. Plenty of clues are built into character remarks, particularly when they are getting close ---- but for players lulled by the lack of puzzles in the first half, the sudden appearance of a difficult one might catch them by surprise to the extent they do not realize looking for clues is something they should be doing. The story was by far the best part of Act 1. But overall it too becomes a mixed bag. I will make an analogy.... consider a story told around a campfire. An interesting one, full of intrigue and plot twists. And then the scout master annouces that it is time for bed, so the story-teller has to conclude the tale in a big rush of resolution. It's not quite like the coming to a crashing halt, not can I really say it left plot threats untied. I don't know how to explain it, so I will try another analogy: Imagine a telling of the famous  Cinderalla story that is full of all the details we remember up until the time she enters the castle to dance with the prince. At which point hte narrator says ""But she lost track of time and had to flee the castle but it was OK because she left a shoe behind so the Prince could find her again and marry her"". Bletch. I will say, though, that the afterword viginettes shown during the ending credits were a nice touch.  So, how to give a yes/no rating to a good but flawed game? If you have read this far, I would recommend you play some adventure games from Daedalic Software, or King Art Games. If your answer is ""I already did, should I play Broken Age as well?"" I suppose my answer is Yes.			"

												Broken Age is a charming addition to Schafer's amazing adventure game collection, and has all of the visual charm and intelligence we've come to expect from Doublefine. The puzzles are clever and satisfying without being exasperating, and the story is engaging and well written. The voice acting is particularly good.			"

I also thought the connection between the two characters was interesting, although I have to agree with some reviews I read that they could have done a whole lot more with it.			"

The game is funny, clever, and has great puzzles and dialogue, everything a classic or modern adventure game should be.			"

												Broken Age is a very charming point and click adventure, it has a very nice art style and very good voice acting. The puzzles are for the most part simple yet enjoyable, however in Act 2 the difficulty really ramps up. It feels like an adventure into unknown lands with 2 angsty teenagers seeking adventure and excitement. Act 1 is the better half but overall the game is still fun to play and has a lot of laughs. It tries to harken back to the old school point and click adventure and almost delievers.			"

												I jumped on Broken Age near release. I'm a huge fan of Double Fine and a large portion of the cast in this game. I was also interested in playing another game with the 'painted' style graphics as well as trying other types of point-and-click adventures. This game was released in 2 acts. Act one was amazing; such an intriguing tale matched with great dialogue and fun problem solving. It took me a good chunk of time to make it to the end without cheating! Now about Act 2..I've seen a lot of hate for Act 2 so don't let that scare you away from the game, but.. There was a solid delay in the release of Act 2 and because of that I found the well crafted story that was half-told and full of mystery from Act one, well, a little hard to remember. I didn't totally forget what happened but almost all character sentimate was lost and I was very much detatched from all of the characters that I know I loved at the end of Act 1. This doesn't effect the person purchasing this game after release of both acts though. Where I feel act 2 gets most of it's hate is the way the story changes and even the puzzles. You get the answers to the questions raised in Act 2 but if you're like me at all you're not totally happy with what you get. Without giving anything away it's a bit dissapointing and super underwhelming. It seemed like an utter lack of creativity compared to Act 1. Also, the puzzels do very much increase in difficulty during progression of the game but in Act 2 the answers to the puzzles make the story completely unbelievable. This is fiction but the puzzles around the end can only be solved by a player who is taking advantage of having the perspectives of both protagonists which leaves you wondering how the characters could have ever figured any of this out. By the end they're practically working together without any communication at all just because you, the player, are controlling them.Anyway, that's how I feel about Broken Age. I still give it a thumbs up even though the second half did not meet the expectations set by the first the game as a whole was very good and half-way stellar. I definitely recommend it, especially now that both Acts have been released.			"

												This game is brilliant in the way it gives you a fantasy / sci-fi world which you must discover by looking and talking to your surroundings. The puzzles in the game are extremely interesting, especially because a lot of them have to do with you thinking outside the boundaries of reality in order to solve sequences. This is also a multi-aged game. If you have kids, then they can play it and enjoy the game, while also being satisfying to adults. Very fun game, and worth a buy given its price.			"

												The voice acting, soundtrack, initial storyline, overall themes, and artwork were appealing and intrguing.  I enjoyed playing as two vastly different, yet strong character leads.  The parallel, and at times, converging storylines were well written and kept me looking forward to the puzzles  and character interactions with NPCs.  Most of the voices that you hear will be familiar and it was fun going through the IMDB cast of voice actors, when I knew I'd heard that voice before.  Although most of the puzzles were logical or just took a little thought and tinkering, I did find myself perusing a walkthrough on occasion.  About halfway through the game you'll find the there are points were the storyline drags because you're going back and forth between the same scenes.  These two drawbacks are common enough with point-and-click adventure games that it didn't deter me from pushing through those sections.  I enjoyed most of my time with this game but would recommend getting it wihle it's on sale.			"

												This game was great for the whole hour and change it took me to beat Act 1. It then abruptly ended, at which point I discovered I had not actually purchased a whole game, I'd only purchased half of one. This is a real shame; I wanted to support a great game design team, play a good game, and I even threw in the extra for the soundtrack because I thought ""This team has a vision, and I want to get behind a work of art."" I wasted $18 on half a game and I haven't got a clue where I can claim my soundtrack. I think Tim Schafer should be ashamed to fool people into buying something that isn't complete and then charge them an in-app purchase to play the rest of the game. It's underhanded, sleezy, and I'm not going to be buying from Double Fine or any other company with Tim Schafer's name on it again.TLDR: Great hour of a game, wouldn't pay 18 bucks for an hour of gameplay though. Super mad that they are charging for the rest of the game, should have charged the price for the whole thing upfront.			"

												Short version: Not a bad game, but the rave critic reviews aren't really justified and I'd wait for a sale. $15 or less.I typically enjoy games for the story and have always enjoyed adventure games. I felt constantly slightly let down by this game and I just assumed it would grow in depth and complexity... especially as that seemed to be part of the overall theme of the storyline (growing up, learning to deal with gray areas - no spoilers here, so I won't say more). However it never really did.I adored The Longest Journey and Syberia... this felt very basic and simplistic in comparison. I don't hate it, but I don't feel it was worth $25. I'll probably play Act 2 to see if it gets better, and because it's included. I am curious how the story plays out. But my expectations were probably too high based on those reviews.			"

												I backed the Kickstarter and I really want to like this kind of point&click adventure. But in this case I can't be bothered. I gave it an hour or two before I gave up. It's neat to switch between two different characters and stories, the graphics are painted/comic book style and partially quite nice. But the gameplay and story is just too weird and ultimately boring for my taste. It makes me wonder how many drugs they were abusing when designing this game... sorry.Your mileage may vary, if you're into this kind of game.			"

												Hmm, I have mixed feelings about this one. Granted, I happen to be a huge fan of point-and-click adventure games, especially the LucasArts classics. I also wasn't one of the kickstarter funders for the game so i'm taking the game on it's merits alone as a point-and-click adventure game. That said, the game is beautiful to look at, wonderfully voice, and with a very appealing art style. it's almost like an interactive chidrens book.Though the ending is very abrupt and left me fairly disappointed. I can how those who did fund the kickstarter would be even more so considering how much was being asked for and how much was received and still ended up with half a game out of the game, especially if Act II is going to be a separate purchase and not a complementary add-on. I was also disappointed in how the part on the spaceship ended just when it started to get interesting, not to mention how towards the end of the game you meet a man in cryo stasis and you get that ah-ha moment and you feel the plot is tying up only to get a completely out of nowhere plot twist that breaks those tied ends and raises further questions.Still, I enjoyed playing the game and bought it at a significant discount while it was on sale, and for what I paid for it, I'd recommend it. if you can get it for a good price, it won't last long, but it was fun to look at and play while it lasted.

The play however isn't really my thing. I've never truly been a point 'n' clicker, (Now if the game were set up more platform-ey...) BUT, after the first thirty minuets or so I decided this game was worth my discomfort. I am not disappointed, and am eagerly awaiting Act 2. Worth the money, however it is also worth the wait for a good sale seeing as Act 2 isn't even here yet. Jussayin.			"

												With a voice cast full of familiar celebrities, and a lovely painted style, Broken Age is a sweet little adventure game. Part 1 isn't very long, as games go, but the cliffhanger is likely to keep your mind churning with questions until the conclusion arrives. The worldbuilding is so well done that it seems almost criminal that we see so little of it. Hopefully the developer uses this as a positive learning experience and goes on to make more games like Broken Age, where we can immerse ourselves for longer.			"

While I didn't NOT like it, I didn't love it either. I'm still left with many unanswered questions. Also, I appreciated the fact that they wanted to make more challenging puzzles, but GOOD LORD were there some frustrating puzzles in Act 2. My goodness. I was ready to bash my monitor in at some points, because a handful of these puzzles required nothing more than trial and error, which for someone who has zero patience like me, is insufferable.Otherwise though, I suppose the game wrapped up nicely. Act 1 is still far more superior in my eyes, but I really liked going into Act 2 and seeing all those characters again, how much they developed.			"

I was going to write extremely positive review about it.However the second act feels like rushed and it is mostly frustrating. Puzzles do not make sense like they did in the first part. During the first act point&click-veteran could figure out how to proceed with the game. During the second act there were moments when you have to point&click everything or even to find out solution from the internet to proceed. Puzzles where you had to wire electronics were extremely frustrating and felt like out of the place.As you can not recommend the game barely on the first act and the second act is plainly bad, I do not recommend this game, that is a pity.

												Broken Age is a point-click game that requires a lot of attention to detail.  I understand that as the game progresses, so does the difficulty.  However, I find that the difficult puzzles (e.g. the knot puzzle, robot wiring) came with no clear instructions, and furthermore, just dragged the story out.  Puzzles are meant for the players to feel integrated into the storyline, but the ones in act two were tedious and frustrating.  It drew me away from the initial timeline, and focused my attention onto wiring a robot to play a harp. Aside from that, Broken Age did a very good job creating quirky and fun characters.  This element brought a lot of colour to the story, and although there were some holes in the plot itself, I still enjoyed it nevertheless.  The music was fitting, but it wasn't something I'd stop playing for (too frustrated from the act two puzzles). And if you plan to play this game, make sure you have a pen and paper... And also a guide. Trust me, you're going to need it.			"

												Act 1:The first hour of the game is pretty terrible, as there are no puzzles and hardly any user interaction, you are basically clicking your way through a cartoon and not a good one, as there is a ton of repetition. It does get better later on as the game opens up and you are allowed to run around on your own, but it still never quite captures what made the classical LucasArts adventure great.In terms of interface it feels disappointing and like a step backward for the genre. You don't have a dialogue-skip button and can only skip full cutscenes, that makes it far to easy to skip over important content. And the lack of a dedicated view-action means you aren't allowed to inspect the environment properly. There isn't a hotspot-highlight button either. All of that have been standard parts of most modern point&click games.Graphically the game is ok, but just barely so. The sprites all look really flat and cheaply animated (i.e. what you expect from Flash animation) and the backgrounds show some ugly pixelation when the camera zooms in. On the plus side the game does a lot of camera motion to keep things interesting and it has quite a few custom animation.All that said, I did start having fun with the game before the end. As once the game opens up and you get a little more familiar with the characters and the overall situation it starts to feel more like a proper point&click game. If they can improve a little on that this might turn on into a really good adventure game. But compared to all the stuff Daedalic has put out this just doesn't really look all that impressive and as a callback to the classic days it kind of fails, as it feels to watered down and artsy for it's own good. It's still good enough to recommend it, just don't expect a worthy successor to the LucasArts adventures.Act 2:Continues exactly where the first one left off. There are no updates to the interface, graphics or anything. Puzzles are this time a little harder then before, but not in a good way. There is a lot of walking forward and backward through scenes and it can be easy to miss a critical clue. The game is also filled with time based puzzles and puzzles that require correct setup or else they reset, this leads to a lot of repetition and frustration due to the lack of proper dialogue skip. Good inventory based puzzles don't really exist and the game doesn't really do much with the character switching either. You can play each character almost completely separate from the other and outside the very last sequence they never interact.As far as setting is concerned, act 2 reuses most locations from act 1 with some small changes. There is very little new happening here and the story reveal feels pretty ""meh"", as it doesn't really open up any new areas or anything. The whole mythology of that world feels pretty underdeveloped and not really explained enough. The ending feels like there would be an Act 3 to follow that plugs those holes, but there isn't one.Overall this isn't a horrible adventure by any means and it has it's moments, but it's pretty mediocre and certainly not up to classical LucasArts quality and with all the simplification going on in the interface it feels like they weren't even trying to get there.On the positive side: The game runs flawlessly on Linux with Open Source ATI drivers.

												Review for Act 1While playing video games growing up I've come to realize that the best games always seem to have something very specific in common; something that allows you get wrapped up in and immersed in a different world to escape reality for a short time and get lost in the beauty of it; and that would be that they all have a great story. A story first above all else; above crazy graphics, above gameplay, and even above music, etc.  A story that lets you become a part of it.There are so many games these days that seem to forget that you should always start with that good story first, with fully realized worlds and the characters that inhabit them. And the games that do realize what should come first, usually turn out to be amazing works of art; games that draw you in and never let go, and have a lasting impression.And Broken Age is an excellent example of this. The story is at the heart of the experience and you can feel it.And even though this game might seem very simplistic in nature (given its gameplay style), it truly is just as satisfying to play as it would be to play a huge, multi-million dollar, RPG production made by a first-party studio by hundreds of people. But I think that's what makes this game so special: that it can be as great as it is even though it was made by just a handful of dedicated people who truly care about what they’re creating and why they’re creating it.Double Fine has shown that you can have an exciting adventure that whisks you away to worlds full of challenges, laughter, and even emotionally-engaging moments, in the form of a point-and-click adventure that’s very accessible and easy to pick up and play. And the impact you feel at the end of Act 1 is an immensive one, that really gets you thinking. It was surprising to find out how much I cared about what happened to the two main characters and how they impacted the worlds around them.I would definitely recommend this game to people who enjoy a great story, even if the gameplay style isn’t normally what they might be in to. You just might be surprised with how much you’ll enjoy it.I absolutely cannot wait until Act II! I cannot wait to go back into Shay's and Vella's worlds to finally get some answers to some burning questions! And I have a feeling it's going to be a very satisfying conclusion regardless of how it ends.:)Congrats again to Double Fine for some amazing work so far!			"

												One word, disappointing. Act 1 is amazing, my favorite adventure game ever, Act 2 is... awful, story and voice acting are still great, but these are some of the worst puzzles I've ever seen in a game. To make sure the puzzles are as unfun as possible, they are randomized, so the annoying to obtain solutions aren't even obtainable online, wasting many hours, when I just wanted to see the story to the end. The actual ending, there isn't one, the game just ends, and then it's over, credits roll. Sad, can't recommend buying this since Act 2 is so bad.			"

												I got this game from monthly bundle and now i regret paying for it. While graphics are pretty and music is great, Broken Age isn't offering anything, that could be described as ""gaming experiance"". You can't lose, you can't choose, you can't do anything on your own. Did i just describe the whole Point and Click genre? If so, maybe point'n'clicks aren't meant for me. Conclusion: Might be a great game for hardcore Point and Click lovers. Not exactly for anyone else (like me).			"

												While the game play is a tad on this short side, overall experience is fantastic. The game is immersive and the characters have a realistic and level-headed approach to the surreal sutational mechanics of this p'n'c release. It seems there's some community angst over the developer's time between episodes, but frankly for < $10 on Steam sale, I felt that Act 1 alone was worth price of admission and my time.			"

												Hmm, I have mixed feelings about this one. Granted, I happen to be a huge fan of point-and-click adventure games, especially the LucasArts classics. I also wasn't one of the kickstarter funders for the game so i'm taking the game on it's merits alone as a point-and-click adventure game. That said, the game is beautiful to look at, wonderfully voice, and with a very appealing art style. it's almost like an interactive chidrens book.Though the ending is very abrupt and left me fairly disappointed. I can how those who did fund the kickstarter would be even more so considering how much was being asked for and how much was received and still ended up with half a game out of the game, especially if Act II is going to be a separate purchase and not a complementary add-on. I was also disappointed in how the part on the spaceship ended just when it started to get interesting, not to mention how towards the end of the game you meet a man in cryo stasis and you get that ah-ha moment and you feel the plot is tying up only to get a completely out of nowhere plot twist that breaks those tied ends and raises further questions.Still, I enjoyed playing the game and bought it at a significant discount while it was on sale, and for what I paid for it, I'd recommend it. if you can get it for a good price, it won't last long, but it was fun to look at and play while it lasted.

												I really liked the story, characters, funny dialogue, and some of the not always subtle ways it questioned a typical video game story (Why does the boy have to be the hero??!). The art was really cool.I found the puzzles really challenging and frustrating at times. Had to get help a few times and seems the answer was pretty obscure. Even knowing the solution you have to get the order of operations perfect for some puzzles which is frustrating but that's the nature of puzzle games like this I guess. Makes solving the puzzle pretty rewarding.Some things were kind of awkard and found that the voice dialogue sometimes overlapped. Characters would have their phrases cut off early when speaking. "

												Broken Age is  a point and click adventure game by Double Fine, and more importantly, the last work of Tim Schafer, creator of such classics as Day of the Tentacle or Grim Fandango. It was funded via Kickstarter, a lot of people wanted to see a new adventure game that matched the clasics in quality, story and gameplay wise. Did it succeed? Not quite. But I would still recommend it to any fan of the genre. A lot of people were dissapointed by the game, mostly because it wasn't complete when it came out. The first part is excellent. The art style, every location, the pacing, the characters and dialogs are golden, and I couldn't stop playing until I hit the ending point. If anything, it might be a bit too easy, but it was really enjoyable, and left with quite a cliffhanger.The second half... it's not that good. It recycles every location and practically every character in the previous half, it introduces a few puzzles that become tedious to figure out, specially contrasting with the easy ones from the first half, and it becomes QUITE CLEAR that they put a lot more of thought in the enigmas presented during the first half than in the resolutions in the second: There's quite a few plot holes, glaring ones. It was quite the dissapointment, specially taking into account that the second half took 2 YEARS to come out. Still, do I recommend the game? Yes. Even with the flawed second half, it's still an incredibly charming tale, full of funny and endearing characters, and I quite enjoyed the ride, even when at the end it left me with a bit of dissapointment over what could've been if the second part matched the first one. Still, having played it once the entire game was already out, the clash didn't hurt me as much as if I had to wait for it, so that's a plus.In conclusion, if you like point and click adventure games, you gotta try it out, just be aware that it doesn't end as good as it starts. If you're on the fence about it, wait until it goes on sale.			"

												Broken Age, lets see, what can I say about Broken Age.......  Well it didn't suck.  It wasn't great either.  It was slightly above average if you ask me, so maybe a 6 or a 7 out of 10.  I enjoyed the story, and I wasn't turned off by the ending like so many of the nay sayers.  What I really didn't like about this game is the wire puzzle.  I was able to do it, and I only have average intelligence, but still the way the game approached solving this puzzle made it tedious and down right frustrating at times.  It should have been implemented better.  I do recommend this game, but the wire puzzle might make your eyes bleed, you have been warned.			"

												Very cute with memorable characters and a well-composed plot.  The adventure gameplay is quite nice, although you won't find any puzzles that are too ingenious in here.  There is a nice variety though, and only one puzzle I felt was unfair (getting the snake, it was the only ""puzzle"" I had to look up, and I didn't feel bad about it after I had done so.)  I suppose the game reminds me a bit of Loom, but it is a much more satisfying and complete experience than that game, which felt to me a bit like a demo for a game that could have been.  I would imagine everyone would enjoy this.  I hope there is a sequel which will let us explore in the land beyond the plague dam, and learn a bit more about that culture.			"

												EDIT: I can no longer justify leaving this as a positive review. The game has gone un-finished for far too long. This isn't a multiplayer game adding new features, this is a narrative driven point n' click adventure, meaning there is nothing remotely complete in this product you are purchasing. On top of that the half that is playable is incredibly easy (which an Adventure game shouldn't be) & short. Broken Age is clearly not worth the money.I will leave my original review below intact. Just treat it as a review for half a game...Original review at the time of beating the ""First Act"":Broken Age aka Double Fine Adventure is finally here in all it's pointy and clicky glory! Is it that return to the good old days of PC gaming that everyone hoped for? Or does it fall short of its high expectations?.............psst, this is a Double Fine game, it will probably be amazing.            With Broken Age, Double Fine pretty much put Kickstarter on the map for indie developers, making it the go to platform to help make their dreams come true. The original idea for the project was small. Tim Schafer hadn't released a point and click adventure since 1998, and this was the genre that started his career. No big publishers wanted to fund these kind of games anymore, so he turned to us, his fans, to see if we wanted it or not. Our response was clear as the initial goal was to raise $400,000 and the Kickstarter ended at a total of $3,336,371...and that is just the total from the initial funding. Despite the incredible success Double Fine saw from public funding, there were some concerns that made news during development, the main one being that the project had become too big and they required more funding to complete it. Tim Schafer later announced that Broken Age would be split up into two acts and would take the funds from people who purchase the game and use that to develop Act II. This is why I am writing this review. This is a unique situation where how well this game does financially after release will have a huge impact on the second half of the game. This review is my way of trying to help out Double Fine to get a bigger audience so that this fantastic game gets the finale it deserves. Even if one person reads this and because of me decides to purchase the game, I will be happy. So now that you know how super important this is to me, I'll try actually talking about the game itself. :)            In Broken Age you play as the two teenagers Shay and Vella, as they are separately trying to make a major change in their lives. Shay lives in a spaceship with his loving AI parents where his every need is taken care of, though they still treat him like a child, due to their limited programming. Whereas Vella is about to be sacrificed to a giant monster as is tradition in her home town....one of these lives sounds worse than the other. Much like Day Of The Tentacle, you can swap back and fourth between the two protagonists at any moment and experience the two incredibly contrasting stories in any form you like. The gameplay is very similar to the classic point and clicks you remember, even bringing back the traditional crosshair rather than a hand or simple mouse cursor which are both more common nowadays. The big difference for gameplay is that you click and drag items in your inventory onto other objects rather than clicking to activate the item, then clicking on the object you wish to interact with. This may seems like a very small change but it instantly felt much better than the traditional method, greatly improving the overall flow of the game which I could feel was very important for Double Fine.            The main parts of any traditional point and click game are the story and puzzles. The puzzles in Broken Age may be the weakest part for some players, as this was expected to be a return to the olden days, the puzzles in Broken Age are overall pretty easy. I was never stuck for six hours straight, pulling my hair out over what I needed to do next. To be honest though, that's a good thing. Puzzles are still an important part of Broken Age, and it still feels like an adventure game, but I feel like Double Fine wanted everyone to be able to experience the wonderful story, characters, and environments they worked so hard to create, rather than have half their players be stuck because they don't know what to do with a bottle of root beer. The puzzles aren't bad, they are still very smart in how they are used, and they compliment, rather than hinder the flow of the story, which is truly what makes this game an absolute gem.            The stories of Vella and Shay are both incredible, and filled with mystery. The reason I finished this game so quickly is because I needed to see what happened to them, and I needed answers as to why these kids are both in these crazy situations. Double Fine has always been masters at creating fantastic yet unique stories, characters, and environments and this game is no different. With the help of backers, they were able to create and bring together these extremely contrasting environments and characters and somehow make them feel like they all belong together. I never questioned that in the same game I was talking to a hipster lumberjack in the forest, I also had a futuristic talking spoon in space. As you can tell from the last sentence, Double Fine brings another of their staples to Broken Age which is comedy. Though it doesn't have as strong of a presence as some of their previous games, most likely due to the somewhat serious tone, I was still laughing quite a bit, and it definitely helped that they had incredible voice talent to take advantage of including Wil Wheaton, Elijah Wood, Jack Black, and more.            Originally when I saw the art style for Broken Age, I have to be honest, I really did not care for it. It seemed too strange, and it didn't say ""old school point and click"" to me. However that all changed when I started playing the game. The art really does compliment the style of the story and the feel of the game. Seeing it come alive and be animated really proved me wrong and what was once ugly to me is now an absolute visual beauty.            Overall Broken Age so far is an absolutely amazing game, filled with wonder, charm, and childlike fun, something that has been mostly lost on modern video games. It's a must play for anyone that was obsessed with the point and clicks from long ago and an excellent starting point for those who are interested in the genre. The story, characters, environments, art, and dialog all mix together and makes for truly a Double Fine Adventure. Please support Double Fine with this masterpiece so that we get the incredible finale it deserves.			"

												Act 1:The first hour of the game is pretty terrible, as there are no puzzles and hardly any user interaction, you are basically clicking your way through a cartoon and not a good one, as there is a ton of repetition. It does get better later on as the game opens up and you are allowed to run around on your own, but it still never quite captures what made the classical LucasArts adventure great.In terms of interface it feels disappointing and like a step backward for the genre. You don't have a dialogue-skip button and can only skip full cutscenes, that makes it far to easy to skip over important content. And the lack of a dedicated view-action means you aren't allowed to inspect the environment properly. There isn't a hotspot-highlight button either. All of that have been standard parts of most modern point&click games.Graphically the game is ok, but just barely so. The sprites all look really flat and cheaply animated (i.e. what you expect from Flash animation) and the backgrounds show some ugly pixelation when the camera zooms in. On the plus side the game does a lot of camera motion to keep things interesting and it has quite a few custom animation.All that said, I did start having fun with the game before the end. As once the game opens up and you get a little more familiar with the characters and the overall situation it starts to feel more like a proper point&click game. If they can improve a little on that this might turn on into a really good adventure game. But compared to all the stuff Daedalic has put out this just doesn't really look all that impressive and as a callback to the classic days it kind of fails, as it feels to watered down and artsy for it's own good. It's still good enough to recommend it, just don't expect a worthy successor to the LucasArts adventures.Act 2:Continues exactly where the first one left off. There are no updates to the interface, graphics or anything. Puzzles are this time a little harder then before, but not in a good way. There is a lot of walking forward and backward through scenes and it can be easy to miss a critical clue. The game is also filled with time based puzzles and puzzles that require correct setup or else they reset, this leads to a lot of repetition and frustration due to the lack of proper dialogue skip. Good inventory based puzzles don't really exist and the game doesn't really do much with the character switching either. You can play each character almost completely separate from the other and outside the very last sequence they never interact.As far as setting is concerned, act 2 reuses most locations from act 1 with some small changes. There is very little new happening here and the story reveal feels pretty ""meh"", as it doesn't really open up any new areas or anything. The whole mythology of that world feels pretty underdeveloped and not really explained enough. The ending feels like there would be an Act 3 to follow that plugs those holes, but there isn't one.Overall this isn't a horrible adventure by any means and it has it's moments, but it's pretty mediocre and certainly not up to classical LucasArts quality and with all the simplification going on in the interface it feels like they weren't even trying to get there.On the positive side: The game runs flawlessly on Linux with Open Source ATI drivers.

												Review for Act 1While playing video games growing up I've come to realize that the best games always seem to have something very specific in common; something that allows you get wrapped up in and immersed in a different world to escape reality for a short time and get lost in the beauty of it; and that would be that they all have a great story. A story first above all else; above crazy graphics, above gameplay, and even above music, etc.  A story that lets you become a part of it.There are so many games these days that seem to forget that you should always start with that good story first, with fully realized worlds and the characters that inhabit them. And the games that do realize what should come first, usually turn out to be amazing works of art; games that draw you in and never let go, and have a lasting impression.And Broken Age is an excellent example of this. The story is at the heart of the experience and you can feel it.And even though this game might seem very simplistic in nature (given its gameplay style), it truly is just as satisfying to play as it would be to play a huge, multi-million dollar, RPG production made by a first-party studio by hundreds of people. But I think that's what makes this game so special: that it can be as great as it is even though it was made by just a handful of dedicated people who truly care about what they’re creating and why they’re creating it.Double Fine has shown that you can have an exciting adventure that whisks you away to worlds full of challenges, laughter, and even emotionally-engaging moments, in the form of a point-and-click adventure that’s very accessible and easy to pick up and play. And the impact you feel at the end of Act 1 is an immensive one, that really gets you thinking. It was surprising to find out how much I cared about what happened to the two main characters and how they impacted the worlds around them.I would definitely recommend this game to people who enjoy a great story, even if the gameplay style isn’t normally what they might be in to. You just might be surprised with how much you’ll enjoy it.I absolutely cannot wait until Act II! I cannot wait to go back into Shay's and Vella's worlds to finally get some answers to some burning questions! And I have a feeling it's going to be a very satisfying conclusion regardless of how it ends.:)Congrats again to Double Fine for some amazing work so far!			"

Product received for free
												First off i only technicaly got this for free, I got it in a humble bundle and set Double Fines cut to $0.00.  I played this game to completion and quite frankly i was disappionted all round;The graphics are paper cut-out style and are probably  the best part of the game.The interface is overly simplistic and in most places you have to play interactive object hunt, coupled with alot of late game puzzles require 4th wall breaking knowledge it overal feels very childishly implemented.The plot is well crap, the villians are 1 diamensional and shallow. The evil plan is stupid, stealing girls for genetic material, fine that kinda makes sense but why only girls? The selection process is ridiculous random teenage boys better a collecting 'sensing' gentic material of girls though the hull of a 'spaceship' than scientists with actual tests?The only moment I feel anything other than mild disappionment with is the scene where a pair of (apparent) lesbians fly naked of into the sunset on the back of a giant pink bird.

												NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit http://microfloppy.net/2015/06/13/broken-age-2/Today, Kickstarter has been used by a number of different developers to crowdfund their games. I would like to say that Broken Age was the game that started this trend (which, by the way, I am very happy to see). Tim Schafer, the co-developer of Day of the Tentacle and developer of Grim Fandango, asked for $400k to make a small game as well as a documentary about the development process. He got waaaaay more and started to make a full-length point-and-click adventure game.This was in February 2012. As scope increased, so did the development time and the game took a long time to get done. Double Fine also ran out of money and decided to split Broken Age in two acts in order to make some money whilst developing the last part of the game. I was one of the backers and I worried immensely about the future of the game. In the end I was happy to see a full game released. But how was the results?First of all, the graphics are beautiful. I love the hand-painted feeling in the game and the imaginative scenes that we get to explore. Everything is just gorgeous. The music goes hand-in-hand with the graphics and the result is a very smooth and calming ambience.The theme of the game is growing up and taking control of your life. Our main protagonists are Vella and Shay:Vella is a young woman who has been selected to be sacrificed to the beast that regularly visit her village, threatening to kill everyone if it doesn’t get young maidens.Shay is a young man who stuck on a spaceship where the ship’s mother does everything to keep him safe and out of harm’s way.Neither of them have any control of their lives and they desperately want to break out of their situation.Broken Age is divided into two acts which were released months apart, and the difference in gameplay is very distinct between the two acts. In both acts, you will solve puzzles in order to advance the story. After the first act Double Fine Productions were criticised for not making the puzzles difficult enough. They were easy, story-based and required very few steps to solve.In the second act, Double Fine had listened to their fan base and upped the difficulty of the puzzles. The second part of the game has more classic adventure game puzzles with some far-fetched solutions. I had to bring out pen and paper and take notes to solve some of them, and I must say I enjoy this difficulty level much more than the first part.Unfortunately, you can’t please everyone. With act 2 released, now the critique was that the game was too difficult and that the puzzles were not fun anymore.Either way, if you love beautiful graphics and a nice story I would definitely recommend Broken Age. Just be warned that there may be some difficult puzzles waiting ahead. If you instead want difficult puzzles you will need to play for an hour or so before you will have your challenge.I am very happy that I backed this game when it was released on Kickstarter because I truly believe it has made a difference in the gaming industry. However, if I were to recommend just one point-and-click game to you, I would have to recommend Deponia instead.The documentary is very worth seeing so if you have the time and are curious about how to make a computer game: check it out on YouTube!6/10 grabbin’ garys "

												This is promoted as an old-school point & click, but the game is so utterly lacking in challenge it hardly merits that claim. Many modern adventure games lower the difficulty and focus on story instead - recent examples being The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us - but the story in Broken Age isn't good enough to let them get away with it. What few good comedy moments there are do not make up for the shortness and shallowness of the experience. Where did all the Kickstarter money go?			"

												After the first half, I thought the game was merely okay. The story seemed kind of interesting, but I felt the puzzles were not terribly challenging.  The second half, however, not only does everything in the story come together in a very interesting way, but many of the puzzles were much more challenging. The kind where you have to pay attention and look for clues, and they actually make you think.  Once you've beaten the game and knew the full story, I recommend replaying the first half. You'll likely notice a lot of connections that were not obvious the first time around.Overall, I was very impressed.			"

												I really enjoyed my playthrough of Broken Age. A lot of games nowadays have trouble holding my attention for extended periods of time unless I've already previously invested a lot of time in them. However, when I picked up Broken Age, I fell in love with it right away. It's visual art style as well as its voice talent brought me in, and I stayed for the comical yet engaging storytelling. The characters are also likeable, not two-dimensional but rather have depth to them which adds to the immersion that the game tries to present, especially the game's two protagonists, Shay and Vella. The puzzles did not feel like a chore: they felt challenging yet fair, and when completed, made me feel good about solving them, rather then feeling as though I had lifted a burden off of my shoulders like other games. The puzzles started off simple and later on grew in scale, encompassing (at some points) both of the game's protagnists to solve puzzles, which was an interesting game mechanic in itself. Would definetely recommend, especially to those who have yet to try point and click adventure games.			"

												I really like this game. I got it because I have played most of Double Fine's games and because of that, they gave me 2 coupons for the game so I bought it for my friend and I.In the end I'm actually really glad I did because it really was a fun game. Yeah it took forever for the second act to be released but in the end i actually felt it was worth it because the second act was just as enjoyable as the first.I really like the characters and humor and art was pretty good as well. While some of the puzzles were easy to figure out, I actually liked that the ones in the second act proved more of challenge, even though they were actually quite frustrating as well.Really if you are a fan of adventure games and feel like you would enjoy this game, then get it probably on sale or whatever price works for you. I understand that not everyone enjoyed it, but I did at least, and maybe people who didn't have to wait so long for act 2 will enjoy it more who knows. XD			"

												Hmm, I have mixed feelings about this one. Granted, I happen to be a huge fan of point-and-click adventure games, especially the LucasArts classics. I also wasn't one of the kickstarter funders for the game so i'm taking the game on it's merits alone as a point-and-click adventure game. That said, the game is beautiful to look at, wonderfully voice, and with a very appealing art style. it's almost like an interactive chidrens book.Though the ending is very abrupt and left me fairly disappointed. I can how those who did fund the kickstarter would be even more so considering how much was being asked for and how much was received and still ended up with half a game out of the game, especially if Act II is going to be a separate purchase and not a complementary add-on. I was also disappointed in how the part on the spaceship ended just when it started to get interesting, not to mention how towards the end of the game you meet a man in cryo stasis and you get that ah-ha moment and you feel the plot is tying up only to get a completely out of nowhere plot twist that breaks those tied ends and raises further questions.Still, I enjoyed playing the game and bought it at a significant discount while it was on sale, and for what I paid for it, I'd recommend it. if you can get it for a good price, it won't last long, but it was fun to look at and play while it lasted.

7/10 - Well directedBroken Age improves on a few things the adventure game genre has been missing, such as the option to skip animation while moving across areas, and having dialogue available for much more combinations of events.  It's quite funny in places and has a good cast.  It does tend to drag on after the mid-game reveal though, and I found myself wanting it to end rather than wanting more story.			"

It seems there's some community angst over the developer's time between episodes, but frankly for < $10 on Steam sale, I felt that Act 1 alone was worth price of admission and my time.			"

												With a voice cast full of familiar celebrities, and a lovely painted style, Broken Age is a sweet little adventure game. Part 1 isn't very long, as games go, but the cliffhanger is likely to keep your mind churning with questions until the conclusion arrives. The worldbuilding is so well done that it seems almost criminal that we see so little of it. Hopefully the developer uses this as a positive learning experience and goes on to make more games like Broken Age, where we can immerse ourselves for longer.			"

												This game is balls awful, half a game that will never be finished. The half you get is so easy it takes all of the fun out of it. No solid information on if/when it will be finished. All but total silence from the developers. Never supporting double fine or time schafer again after this huge pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥he took on my chest.			"

												This is promoted as an old-school point & click, but the game is so utterly lacking in challenge it hardly merits that claim. Many modern adventure games lower the difficulty and focus on story instead - recent examples being The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us - but the story in Broken Age isn't good enough to let them get away with it. What few good comedy moments there are do not make up for the shortness and shallowness of the experience. Where did all the Kickstarter money go?			"

												There are so many things to say about this game. So let me break it down.1. Gameplay - Obviously, it's point and click. You can't exactly right click on everything. It's all done via point and clicking (or dragging your mouse) to move the charcter along the screen. All puzzles and item combination is done by simply dragging an object over a set piece/another object. There's not much to say besides that. It's point and click. If you don't know what that is then go away.2. Graphics - This... THIS is how you do graphics. Forget being ultra real, brown, and close to real life as possible. Broken Age chooses a different style and its style is beautifully hand painted characters and environments. Yes. Painted. Imagine you're looking at A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. Now imagine it as a video game. That's this game. The world is absolutely beautiful to look at, and it never really feels like you're controlling characters in a map. It seriously feels like you're playing with a movable painting. It's so badass!3. Presentation - Broken Age's art style, humor, and challenging puzzles are all exceptional. The first act starts out strong, and  ends on a high note. The characters are all lively in their personalities with some good humor to back up the few. The voice acting is superb, although there were rare occassions where it felt like the actors might have delivered their lines a little short. For the most part they do their job exceptionally well and bring the characters to life. Hell, a knife and spoon have more on screen chemistry than most leading roles in AAA games. That's saying something. The puzzles can make you scratch your head a few times which is exactly what we need from these sorts of games. It's clear that a lot of heart went into making this project a reality. I can't imagine what this game would have been without it's 3 million dollar kickstarter backing. Or in the hands of some moron publisher who ruins everything.Overall - Broken age is a solid point and click adventure title with a new spin on how point and click adventure title games control. Albeit many will find it to be something similar to controls used for a tablet, but I would argue it's more for cutting out the use of right click. One button controls inspecting, combining, and using an object in your inventory. I beat the first act in about 5 hours. While that may be a tad short, I'm hoping the second half is just a teeny bit longer and harder. I still had a fun adventure exploring Shay's and Vella's worlds. I'm definitely glad I backed this project during the Kickstarter phase. If I had to give this game a score, it'd be along the lines of a 8.5/10. Do pick this one up. It's very special.			"

												First, I am a backer. Which means: for every positive review I am considered a fanboy, for every negative review I just did not understand what I was backing.That sad: a funny old-style adventure was promised. They got 10 times the money they asked for. They needed an enormous amount of time to deliver the game, were other companies that got way less money delivered real gems. Well, that would all be ok if the result was a gem too. It is not, sadly.While the graphic style appeals to me and the voice acting is superb, the story starts very interesting in act 1 just to succumb to complete meaninglessness. Every ""Oh, what's that?""-moment in the first act was deeply disappointing explained in act 2.The puzzles did not get harder, just much more painful to solve which much trial and error and revisiting the same locations over and over.The game ended for me after ~10 hours of playtime with a real bad written ending. This game only achieved one thing for me: never buy a game again where Tim Schaefer is involved. He betrayed the trust of his backer and his legitimacy as a story writer. He finished writing the story after more than 3 years according to his own words. 3 years for that short story with so few good ideas? Wow.I can recommend the game if you want to enjoy the graphic style and voice acting. I also recommend to stop at the second time the characters start over on a split screen. Your expectations of a good story unfolding will be disappointed and you will see already often visited screens over and over again to solve some really boring puzzles. It's just sad....			"

												Finally, fiiiiiiinally I finished the game Broken Ages. It's a cute, silly, point-and-click game where a couple of brats are in undesirable situations and so are trying to change it. Player gets to play 2 different sides, capable of switching sides whenever desired to. One side involves a boy named Shay living a futuristic and OVERLY-PROTECTIVE environment. The other side involves a girl named Vella living a primitive?/modern? setting where she is a giant monster's sacrifice, but Vella is trying to kill the monster instead and free all the villages from it's terror. I started playing the game last year and it only had Act 1. Act 2 came out last April. But, I heard there were changes to Act 1, so I really can't say too much due to memory and the fact I refuse to play the game at the beginning again. The game is semi-decent to play once, but that is pretty much it. Art style was a nice painting style. It has it's funny moments, a lot of puns. Very bad puns. I like puns, but I know most people would just turn off the game due to how bad the puns were. Puzzles......I vaguely remember going through Act 1 without cheating, however in Act 2 I ABUSED the walkthrough! I try my best to figure out solutions. Playing the Ace Attorney and Professor Layton series taught me not so be so reliant since the best part IS solving a puzzle. But this flippen game has me stumped on the very first puzzle in Act 2 on Vella's part. Trial and error is the best method when it comes to these kinds of games. Part 2 was evil. It has specific directions in solving a lot of it's puzzles. I now hate cereal. For now. Until I forget that stupid puzzle.  OverallGameplay: Simple, puzzles are sometimes VERY annoyingArt: clay/painting-like decent Story: silly and decent, bit repetitive on dialogue. Wouldn't hurt to play it once, but not the second time.			"

												What started out as such a great adventure with an engaging story and strong plot lines, completely dismissed this formula in the 2nd half.  Puzzles became pretty bad, and much of the previous locations were reused.  It's hard to recommend this game, it unfortunately feels like they rushed it or ran out of money which may account for the long delay between Act 1 & 2.  I tend to love DoubleFine, but this was a let down.			"

												Playing the first act felt like playing the Monkey Island 20 years ago. Same magic was going on! Game was absolutely fantastic! I was going to write extremely positive review about it.However the second act feels like rushed and it is mostly frustrating. Puzzles do not make sense like they did in the first part. During the first act point&click-veteran could figure out how to proceed with the game. During the second act there were moments when you have to point&click everything or even to find out solution from the internet to proceed. Puzzles where you had to wire electronics were extremely frustrating and felt like out of the place.As you can not recommend the game barely on the first act and the second act is plainly bad, I do not recommend this game, that is a pity.

												The voice acting, soundtrack, initial storyline, overall themes, and artwork were appealing and intrguing.  I enjoyed playing as two vastly different, yet strong character leads.  The parallel, and at times, converging storylines were well written and kept me looking forward to the puzzles  and character interactions with NPCs.  Most of the voices that you hear will be familiar and it was fun going through the IMDB cast of voice actors, when I knew I'd heard that voice before.  Although most of the puzzles were logical or just took a little thought and tinkering, I did find myself perusing a walkthrough on occasion.  About halfway through the game you'll find the there are points were the storyline drags because you're going back and forth between the same scenes.  These two drawbacks are common enough with point-and-click adventure games that it didn't deter me from pushing through those sections.  I enjoyed most of my time with this game but would recommend getting it wihle it's on sale.			"

												NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit http://microfloppy.net/2015/06/13/broken-age-2/Today, Kickstarter has been used by a number of different developers to crowdfund their games. I would like to say that Broken Age was the game that started this trend (which, by the way, I am very happy to see). Tim Schafer, the co-developer of Day of the Tentacle and developer of Grim Fandango, asked for $400k to make a small game as well as a documentary about the development process. He got waaaaay more and started to make a full-length point-and-click adventure game.This was in February 2012. As scope increased, so did the development time and the game took a long time to get done. Double Fine also ran out of money and decided to split Broken Age in two acts in order to make some money whilst developing the last part of the game. I was one of the backers and I worried immensely about the future of the game. In the end I was happy to see a full game released. But how was the results?First of all, the graphics are beautiful. I love the hand-painted feeling in the game and the imaginative scenes that we get to explore. Everything is just gorgeous. The music goes hand-in-hand with the graphics and the result is a very smooth and calming ambience.The theme of the game is growing up and taking control of your life. Our main protagonists are Vella and Shay:Vella is a young woman who has been selected to be sacrificed to the beast that regularly visit her village, threatening to kill everyone if it doesn’t get young maidens.Shay is a young man who stuck on a spaceship where the ship’s mother does everything to keep him safe and out of harm’s way.Neither of them have any control of their lives and they desperately want to break out of their situation.Broken Age is divided into two acts which were released months apart, and the difference in gameplay is very distinct between the two acts. In both acts, you will solve puzzles in order to advance the story. After the first act Double Fine Productions were criticised for not making the puzzles difficult enough. They were easy, story-based and required very few steps to solve.In the second act, Double Fine had listened to their fan base and upped the difficulty of the puzzles. The second part of the game has more classic adventure game puzzles with some far-fetched solutions. I had to bring out pen and paper and take notes to solve some of them, and I must say I enjoy this difficulty level much more than the first part.Unfortunately, you can’t please everyone. With act 2 released, now the critique was that the game was too difficult and that the puzzles were not fun anymore.Either way, if you love beautiful graphics and a nice story I would definitely recommend Broken Age. Just be warned that there may be some difficult puzzles waiting ahead. If you instead want difficult puzzles you will need to play for an hour or so before you will have your challenge.I am very happy that I backed this game when it was released on Kickstarter because I truly believe it has made a difference in the gaming industry. However, if I were to recommend just one point-and-click game to you, I would have to recommend Deponia instead.The documentary is very worth seeing so if you have the time and are curious about how to make a computer game: check it out on YouTube!6/10 grabbin’ garys "

												It's a visually stunning game, with great writing and voice acting. The puzzles are not as complex as in some games, and depending on how you like to play your games is either a pro or a con. I never really felt challenged, but I wasn't bored either. It is, admittedly short (taking me only 3 hours the first time to beat it), but hopefully part two will be out soon to remedy that. Overall I do recommend it, and remain optimistic about the next chapter.			"

Act 1 is amazing, my favorite adventure game ever, Act 2 is... awful, story and voice acting are still great, but these are some of the worst puzzles I've ever seen in a game. To make sure the puzzles are as unfun as possible, they are randomized, so the annoying to obtain solutions aren't even obtainable online, wasting many hours, when I just wanted to see the story to the end. The actual ending, there isn't one, the game just ends, and then it's over, credits roll. Sad, can't recommend buying this since Act 2 is so bad.			"

They have really refined the genre in terms of gameplay. It also looks stunning. The art style is beautiful, every area of the game is interesting to look at and explore. The voice acting is also brilliant, including some big names.There are some things I wasn't asa impressed with. The story is better in act 1 but I found the puzzles too easy. In act 2 the story gets a bit weird and seems a bit forced, but the puzzles are a lot better and some had me stumped for a while, which was nice.It's definitely worth the price and it's definitely worth a play. I had been in a gaming rut, with nothing new really exciting me. Playing Broken Age got me excited about games again, you can tell a lot of passion went into making it and it's really just a nice game to play.			"

Puzzles are not ""terrible"" as someone wrote around, there are clues everywhere, just listen to what the characters are talking about and explore the rooms, that's the nature of point & click games, isn't it? If you're not lazy but curious about understanding the mechanism behind new stuff by yourself you won't need any guide to play this game, all puzzle were fair I think, or at least they were for me.

This second act is made up almost entirely of recycled environments and characters from the first act, but it works for the most part.  There's some more humor, and a lot more plot development, and a final sequence that would have taken forever without hints, but overall it made up an enjoyable story with a good ending.  Nothing on the Grim Fandango level, but not a bad throwback adventure experience.			"

The game world is pretty small so don't get your hopes up too much.My PC specs are way lower (dual core, 4GB ram, NVIDIA GT630 2GB) than what was reccommended and the game worked mostly fine, only problem I had was a horizontal line in the middle of my screen which I hardly noticed (I am using linux).I got it for $10, totally worth it.

												Broken Age is a fun but uneven, oddly paced, hit-or-miss affair. I will still recommend it on the merit is that it tries very hard to do the adventure game genre justice with the unique telling of a story with two separate characters. It also plays with a dream-like aesthetic that is often soft and cuddly that makes up for any faults I found with it. The puzzles also try to recapture the spirit of LucasArts days puzzle solving with some good logical puzzles included, it is a fairly fun experience overall. Storywise, this one probably wouldn't win any awards, it's lackluster in back story and a lot of the characters' dialogue comes across pretty chill. All the characters are very charming, and I think my favourites are still the hexipals, they're just so cute! Honestly funny moments are too few and far between. Tim Schafer's dialogue and story writing skills unfortunately weren't on full display here, and I grew to miss the wit that usually was to be found in his work.Some players will find the puzzles too easy in the first act and too challenging in the second act. I personally found myself stuck a few times in the second act, but some friendly hints along the way got me back on track. The logical puzzles are good and they required me to have the pen and paper handy, something I really enjoy doing when solving puzzles. What I truly appreciated about Broken Age was that Tim tried telling the story in a format that was something different, where the player is the unseen link between two physically separated characters. Some puzzles are solved with both characters seeing clues that aid the opposite character, all without them speaking or saying anything. I wish this idea could have been taken further.For those who enjoy a good adventure game will certainly enjoy this title and still be pleased by the art, puzzle design and the Schafer style storytelling. Also, with a soft and cuddly aesthetic, it's hard to be displeased with the final product.			"

												I bought the game after both acts were published. So I have not experienced the ""big disappointment"" of act 2 after a year of waiting. Some of the critisism is valid, but overall it is a good adventure game. A rating of 73/100 seems accurate.			"

												After watching the documentary, I get that a lot of blood, sweat and tears went into making this game.  Unfortunately, part 2 does not deliver on what part 1 set up.  I totally empathize with what they went through, but I have to be honest here.  I was extremely let down by this  game.I feel like we got the outline of an interesting story.  The two main character's worlds are explained fairly well.  Unfortunately the antagonist's isnt, and instead is simply summarized through dialog...and even then it's still not explained very well.  Imagine if a character is on a journey to a destination, and when they finally get there, the only thing you get to see is an exterior shot and nothing else.  That pretty much sums it up.  There were some major, ""Hey!  What about the so and so's trapped in the you know where?"" type of plotholes that were never resolved.   There's also an extremely frame-breaking puzzle mechanic introduced in part 2.  Characters A and B are completely separated with no way to communicate.  Yet Character A has puzzles with solutions that only Character B has information about.  So when Character B looks at an inventory item, you have to use information about that item so Character A can solve the puzzle.  I was literally stumped for a couple of hours because I didn't think Tim would actually break that kind of rule.  It made absolutely zero sense in the story so why should it be possible?  When I finally gave in and used walkthrough to find an answer, I literally put the game away for a few months.  I was suddenly disinterested because it's cheating the story just to make the puzzle harder.  Anyways, after I finished watching the documentary, I decided to start over and finish Broken Age.  I was even more excited now that I got a glimpse at how it was made!   Maybe I was wrong.  Maybe that was just one puzzle that was bad.  Well, it turns out several puzzles break the narrative.  The end of this game has two characters coordinating an attack who aren't in communication at all!  Seriously!  It felt like I was playing an old Sierra puzzle game called Gobliiins.  Get these characters in the right places and push the buttons and pull the levers to continue.  Couldn't Tim just put some sort of communication device in the story that allowed them to communicate in some fashion?  I think it would have led to better story telling as our characters actually got to know each other.I'm even more disappointed after seeing so many likeable people put a lot of time and energy into this and to come up with something that feels 77% complete.  The art and the music are superb.  The voice acting is top notch.  Unfortunately the part two's puzzle felt like busy work (seriously, once I demonstrate I get the gist of it, I shouldn't have to go through all the steps over and over again) and felt like they focussed more energy on making puzzles harder and less time developing the story.  So I cannot recommend this game at full price.  I'd definitely wait for it to go on sale.  I never thought I'd say that about a Tim Schafer game...			"

												Actually got mad at myself for putting this one on the back burner for a while. Finally got around to playing it only to be crushed by the reason I probably waited to play it in the first place. You know that whole lack of act two thing...yea...ow...Anyhow as far as the game goes it is beautiful, the art, music, flow, vibes (if you will), all of it. Grand! The play however isn't really my thing. I've never truly been a point 'n' clicker, (Now if the game were set up more platform-ey...) BUT, after the first thirty minuets or so I decided this game was worth my discomfort. I am not disappointed, and am eagerly awaiting Act 2. Worth the money, however it is also worth the wait for a good sale seeing as Act 2 isn't even here yet. Jussayin.			"

												Just finished playing ""Broken Age""  (Act 1) and I'm just... wow!Feels like playing those epic and classic adventure games back in the days (Monkey Island 2 and 3, Maniac Mansion 2) but with jaw-dropping hand-painted high-resolution graphics and a marvellous music-score.It brings back the best of point-and-click adventure games to our ""modern"" age, while retaining their essence (I'm very glad, for instance, that they didn't go the 3D route).The story is good and intriguing, the setting is excellent, the puzzles are just right (neither too obvious nor too hard).This game will become a classic, and I think it's a must-play game.Definitely a recommend! Looking forward to ""Act 2"".			"

												Really enjoyed it. Nice style, much different look than games I usually play. Pretty funny sometimes but only a few moments where I actually laughed out loud. Some really subtle stuff totally in my direction.It's a puzzle game, but some of the puzzles make no sense at all or you miss something so I had to check out the walkthrough (partially because I was afraid the game was broken like when I was stuck in Oakvale playing Fable 2). The game world is pretty small so don't get your hopes up too much.My PC specs are way lower (dual core, 4GB ram, NVIDIA GT630 2GB) than what was reccommended and the game worked mostly fine, only problem I had was a horizontal line in the middle of my screen which I hardly noticed (I am using linux).I got it for $10, totally worth it.

I would say definitly worth buying if you can get it on sale! With only the first half of the game out, I don't think its work the full $25.			"

												The puzzles aren't completely insane like most of it's genre, as I didn't need to use a walkthrough, but still enough to keep you scratching your head for ten minutes or longer at times.  The story seems fairly predictable but with a twist that'll make your reaction be similar to one of the characters by the end of the first act.  Plus with act two coming out for free makes it worth to get.  The major drawback is the price tag being twenty-five dollars and myself managing to finish the first act quickly, only taking a little over three hours, even without walkthroughs for the game and taking my time following all dialogue trees I could follow.  I'd recomend this game either on sale or with a coupon at most to get the time per dollar value but over all an amazing game to play!			"

If you have played any of the classic LucasArts games (i.e. Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle, Monkey Island) then you owe it to yourself to play this game.  The gameplay has been very dumbed down (as in, clicking on something and it acts as 'pick up', 'look at', 'eat', etc.) but the story and gorgeous art style is well worth it.  I disagree with the asking price (I was a Kickstarter backer so I have it at a discount) but on a sale this should be a must buy.  9/10			"

Pros+ witty humor.+ well developed plot and twist(s.)+ a vast, lovable (and not so lovable) cast of characters.+ gorgeous hand painted visuals.+ every single detail of the game tying into the ending.+ Grabbin' Gary.Cons (very few)- very rough looking backgrounds when cutscenes and close-up dialogue are taking place.- some repetitive lines when inspecting something more than once or twice.- I picked this up for about 1/4 of the normal price during a weekend sale, if you're interested in the game, I'd put it on your wishlist and wait for it to go on sale. I love the game but I think the regular price is a little high.first review I've ever done :')			"

												The game is very good in most aspects , artwork is awesome really it's gorgeous from start to finish, voice acting is also great (they have quite an insane cast btw) , difficulty is inbetween mostly fine but once or twice you have to do something totaly conter-intuitive to progress. But boy, the story ... It's sad ... First and foremost the awkwardness , so much awkwardness to vaguely justify situations ... And then the end of the game, well it pretty much comes after the introduction of the plot, just like that: plot is introduced, fade out, roll credits. It kinda spoils the experience.			"

												Old point and click nostalgia and Double Fine's classic brand of humor.  If you have played any of the classic LucasArts games (i.e. Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle, Monkey Island) then you owe it to yourself to play this game.  The gameplay has been very dumbed down (as in, clicking on something and it acts as 'pick up', 'look at', 'eat', etc.) but the story and gorgeous art style is well worth it.  I disagree with the asking price (I was a Kickstarter backer so I have it at a discount) but on a sale this should be a must buy.  9/10			"

												Broken Age is beautiful, charming, clever, brave, and funny. It brings great twists to classic concepts like ""stuck in space"" and ""human sacrifice to ancient gods"" thanks to witty writing and unique, delightful visuals. Each character is instantly lovable thanks to great voice acting and perfect design/animation. The first half of the game is, in many ways, much superior to the second in terms of pacing and seamlessly teaching the player how to solve interesting puzzles, while the second half sometimes drags due to illogical and difficult solutions, but overall the story and art (not to mention the exciting reveals) make this a terrific game worth owning and playing more than once.

												Broken Age is the story of two kids trying to change their lives. Vella is about to be sacrificed to save her town while Shay is wandering through space doing the same missions every day. The story starts off pretty simple and you can start with either character. In fact one of the interesting things about the game is that you can switch between the storylines at any time. This is your average point and click adventure. You walk around looking for items to complete a puzzle to get to the next location. Some of the puzzles are easy to figure out, while others will have you thinking for a while. Then there are the puzzles that you accidentally find the missing part to complete that one puzzle you have been on for about an hour.The graphics are nice, nothing next gen which adds to the game subtle charm. Each location has its own unique design and color scheme. The music is well done. Nothing overbearing or too generic. The voice acting is also well done with interesting conversations. Like many games, there are always a few characters with some extremely cheesy dialog. If you are a Double Fine games lover, this is definitely a good game to pick up. The whole time playing it, it felt like I was playing the old point and click game “The Dig”. This game is nowhere as long or as hard but was just as enjoyable.			"

												This game can be broken into two parts:Before the Hexipal Wiring puzzle, and After.The game before the Hexipal Wiring puzzle is beautiful. Polished, crisp, lovely. Interesting puzzles and wonderful dialogue, beautiful art style, just a pleasure to sit and relax and enjoy with.Once you get to the Hexipal Wiring puzzle, quietly close the game, uninstall, and watch a lets play for the rest. Do not put yourself through that nightmare of an unsolveable puzzle that, if walkthroughs are any indication, you must repeat several times more. It is not a puzzle you can do with a guide. It is not a puzzle you can do with intelligence. It is pure tediousness, plain and simple, and sucks the joy out of the game.I do not recommend this game because that is how game-stoppingly difficult this puzzle is.			"

												Broken Age is  a point and click adventure game by Double Fine, and more importantly, the last work of Tim Schafer, creator of such classics as Day of the Tentacle or Grim Fandango. It was funded via Kickstarter, a lot of people wanted to see a new adventure game that matched the clasics in quality, story and gameplay wise. Did it succeed? Not quite. But I would still recommend it to any fan of the genre. A lot of people were dissapointed by the game, mostly because it wasn't complete when it came out. The first part is excellent. The art style, every location, the pacing, the characters and dialogs are golden, and I couldn't stop playing until I hit the ending point. If anything, it might be a bit too easy, but it was really enjoyable, and left with quite a cliffhanger.The second half... it's not that good. It recycles every location and practically every character in the previous half, it introduces a few puzzles that become tedious to figure out, specially contrasting with the easy ones from the first half, and it becomes QUITE CLEAR that they put a lot more of thought in the enigmas presented during the first half than in the resolutions in the second: There's quite a few plot holes, glaring ones. It was quite the dissapointment, specially taking into account that the second half took 2 YEARS to come out. Still, do I recommend the game? Yes. Even with the flawed second half, it's still an incredibly charming tale, full of funny and endearing characters, and I quite enjoyed the ride, even when at the end it left me with a bit of dissapointment over what could've been if the second part matched the first one. Still, having played it once the entire game was already out, the clash didn't hurt me as much as if I had to wait for it, so that's a plus.In conclusion, if you like point and click adventure games, you gotta try it out, just be aware that it doesn't end as good as it starts. If you're on the fence about it, wait until it goes on sale.			"

I enjoyed the story, and I wasn't turned off by the ending like so many of the nay sayers.  What I really didn't like about this game is the wire puzzle.  I was able to do it, and I only have average intelligence, but still the way the game approached solving this puzzle made it tedious and down right frustrating at times.  It should have been implemented better.  I do recommend this game, but the wire puzzle might make your eyes bleed, you have been warned.			"

												Broken Age is the game that essentially started the kickstarter craze.  They wanted $400,000 to make their game idea a reality.  What they got was over $3,300,000.  With their new budget they started making a 'larger' and 'better' game.  Double Fine then went way beyond budget and had to break the game into two parts.  The backers, such as myself get both parts (once completed) while anyone who buys act 1 is simply funding act 2.  As of this review they have made enough money to make the second act.  This review is about part 1.Broken Age is about 2 hours long.  It is an old school point and click adventure game where you play as two characters in very different worlds.  The humor in the game is what you would expect from Tim S. and Double Fine.  The game is very creative and beautiful.  The game runs smoothly and I didn't experience any bugs.  The puzzles in the game are laughably easy though.  Aestheticly and humorously entertaining the gameplay itself is just to simple.I would recommend this game for it's imaginitive design and it's humor.  I have to not recommend this game though, knowing the whole story of development, because it is just to short and to easy to feel anything more than a simple flash game someone could hammer out in a few weeks and toss up on newgrounds for free.  I feel that I did get what was promised, a game and a movie of how it is being developed.  When you weigh the time of development and the money spent on it, compared with what the final product became, I have to say that you should buy this game as cheaply as possible.  I hope Double Fine learns to manage their money better from here on out.  If you are looking for a unique set piece and story that is short and has simple gameplay mechanics that you don't have to put much mental thought into then this game is just perfect for you...for the next two hours.Update:Act 2 is finally finished and just as simple and short as act 1. The game even has an achievement for beating it in under one hour. Gee, thanks Tim.			"

												Very cute with memorable characters and a well-composed plot.  The adventure gameplay is quite nice, although you won't find any puzzles that are too ingenious in here.  There is a nice variety though, and only one puzzle I felt was unfair (getting the snake, it was the only ""puzzle"" I had to look up, and I didn't feel bad about it after I had done so.)  I suppose the game reminds me a bit of Loom, but it is a much more satisfying and complete experience than that game, which felt to me a bit like a demo for a game that could have been.  I would imagine everyone would enjoy this.  I hope there is a sequel which will let us explore in the land beyond the plague dam, and learn a bit more about that culture.			"

												By reading the reviews I expected the game to start really sucking during the second half, but that didn't happen at all. I thought the second half was just as lovely as the first and both together create two halves of a great story.While it is true that there seems to be a missing third arc, the game does fine without it. You understand the underlying plot just fine without having to actual see the bad guys get taken down. It completes the personal stories of the two main characters and that feels fine.Personally I loved the spaceship and was intrigued constantly by everything about it. The design and concept behind the whole thing is just amazing and the game was fun just to get to explore that thing.All in all I loved this game, and I think everyone is being way too hard on it. People complain about the difficulty of puzzles in the second half, but if you're a Adventure game regular you won't have too much trouble. (Granted there is a robot wiring puzzle which is confusing as all hell and even when you understand it you basically HAVE to write things down on a physical piece of paper to complete it which is reeeaaal old school.) I can understand why people who hate it for that.			"

The production quality is immense; top of the line (and famous) voice actors, professionally recorded soundtrack, beautiful artwork and a perfect user interface. But really, that's all it has going for it. The game feels so incredibly empty, it's depressing.

												The game is beautiful, but also ugly...The first thing you will notice about this game, whether you're playing it or looking at screenshots and footage, is the undeniable beauty this game exudes. This beauty is found in everything, from the distinct art style that is both shocking and comforting, to the humourously written script that kept me chuckling and shocked by it's delightful twists and turns. The gameplay is engaging and rewarding through the adbundant player interactions and the logical puzzles... of the first Act. The second Act though I'm not so sure.I couldn't help but feel cheated by the second Act's puzzles. The first Act provides the player with just enough information to suggest the plan of attack for solving it, but not so much that you feel that your hand is being held through it. I didn't mind progressing, at I perceived to be a slow pace, during the first Act because I didn't feel I was being cheated by the puzzle's logic. I felt that if I was ""stuck"" for long enough the game gave a subtle enough nudge in the right direction for me to get their on my ""own"". On the other hand, the second Act felt punishing in some ways because the same level of information feedback was not provided to the player. Instead it felt like I was either left flopping around frustrated because I wanted to keep enjoying the bountiful world before me, to the point where I was simply employing a process of elimination for ""solving"" the puzzle, leaving me feeling cheap and unaccomplished.In summary, this is a wonderful game. I will reccommend it to all as I feel it certainly has a lot to offer, a wide range of different players. The artists within you will love the colourful, but psychotic world before you. The logician within you will enjoy MOST of the puzzles and adventurous players will enjoy an unfamiliar experience that I'm confident, the majority of modern gamers haven't experienced before; the point-and-click adventure game. If you do heed my suggestions, beware of some puzzles that will leave you broken.			"

I mean, sure I would have loved to tackle the same kind of social issues and stuff in a story, but the second half was more: aaaaand so this is how the situation is going to be resolved.

												I really wish Steam reviews had a 'mixed' button....Ok. Broken Age is... mostly solid, as a fun quirky throwback to old style adventure games. Nice art, ok Voice Acting, some fairly decent puzzles. It's short in theory, but your first playthrough should take a fair bit of time as you explore the world and try to work out the logic behind some of the puzzles. If you're into classic point and click adventure games, I do have to recommend this.However, Act 2 was ultimately somewhat disappointing to me, for a few reasons. The story's resolution, whilst there, is cut somewhat short and a few key plot points are left either unresolved, or barely touched upon. Alongside that however, is a completely illogical final sequence, where the player's end goal is not clearly explained to them, the puzzle requirements are irritating and time consuming rather than rewarding intellect, and where the plot closes out without a resolution on the underlying conflict.It has its virtues. I recommend investigating it if you're curious. But ultimately, the game did not justify the hype, or the Kickstarter. It will be remembered for kicking off the indie kickstarter boom more than as a game in its own right. Which I feel is a shame given the talent that act one displayed. Double Fine needed a stronger brief with this game, and I feel that ultimately they wavered and improvised the end.			"

												Yet another Double Fine masterpiece: a fantastic story and setting with equally excellent voice acting and visuals and great dialogue. The gameplay is the classic point and click adventure style where you have to talk to people, find and combine items in a particular order to advance the plot by resolving various situations the game presents you with. There is a twist here where there are two characters whose stories are linked and run in parallel, both coming from very different backgrounds and you can switch between the two, also enabling you to find hints to solve one's puzzles in the other's world (although how they exchange information is never clearly explained there are some hints in some of the implied actions). The characters are great although Vella (the girl in the story) is overwhelmingly stronger out of the two. You travel from scenic location to scenic location while solving a deep mystery in a world that is a mix of fantasy and a degree of modernism without being directly contemporary. There's a minority of people complaining about some obtuse puzzles and backtracking but I did not find anything here that is any worse than other great classics of the genre (I've played almost all of them) and although a hint system would have been nice, the puzzles are generally feasible. Seriously though, do not let the minority of complainers (less than a third of the 2000+ reviews on Steam) whose reviews somehow got voted as most helpful thanks to people never seeing and voting for the positive reviews in the other tabs distract you from this great adventure game, it is something to be experienced.

That's really all I have to say without giving away spoiling details. I was able to play all of Act 1 in about 4 hours. It is very well-thought-out and plays very fluidly. I was excited about everything (graphics, art, music, voice acting, etc), but what really got me was hearing Pendleton Ward's voice in the game!! I couldn't believe it. Princess Bubblegum's voice actor also plays a part in the game. Anyway, it is a great game so far and I literally cannot wait for Act 2. The cliffhanger was almost unbearable :D			"

												Just finished Act 1 in about 4 hours. Easier than previous adventure games I've played, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I do wish it was more challenging... a lot of the stuff was way too obvious IMO. That said, that's probably intentional for Act 1, and also I have a lot of experience with adventure games so many people will probably find it more difficult than I did.Too short too I would say... could have used more puzzles, but I guess we'll have to wait for Act 2 for those. The story and graphics are both amazing, as is the voice acting in general. I kinda wished some of the dialog trees were longer, but they were well done regardless.Still, it was entertaining overall and I can't wait for Act 2!			"

												I'll start with the only flaw I could find in my first playthrough: Broken Age Act I is pretty easy. Any old-school adventure game player won't ever find himself stuck, all the puzzles are very intuitive. That said, this game is AWESOME. Graphics are simply gorgeous, animations are splendid and the voice over... oh, the voice over! Jack Black, Elijah Wood, Wil Wheaton, and Jennifer Hale! So freaking immersive!Dialogues are fun and most of the situations you'll find yourself into will make you remember when you were little and spent your nights trying to beat Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle. The story is very very nice, even if I anticipated the final plot twist. I hope Act II will be a little harder to solve (well, much harder, actually) but bottom line, I loved this first half of the game.			"

												I always thought that I started gaming while playing the platforming genre like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog being one of my favorite series of all time. As I thought about it for a minute, I remember I used to play a certain type of game even earlier than that. It involved using the mouse to click on parts of the environment to move your character, interact with it and solve puzzles. I never knew the name of the genre until a few years later when it peaked my curiosity enough to Google it. The genre was appropriately called 'Point and Click adventure games'.So why it was so hard for me to pinpoint the genre? Well, gaming between now and then exploded in a ton of different genres, which further splintered into a variety of subgenres. Between all this chaotic explosion of genres, one got caught in the crossfire and badly wounded to the point it almost got killed, yes you know what genre I am talking about.After more than a decade after that incident, the folks at Double Fine used their powers of necromancy to  Kickstart the Heart  of the genre back to life. They had to tap into the power of hundreds and thousands of souls to make it happen. Ok, I am very dramatic here but it kinda works doesn't it! The crowd funded Kickstarter campaign was a huge success, not only they greatly exceeded the funds to make their original vision of the game possible, but they kept on breaking all kinds of Kickstarter records in the process. The additional capital went further into making the game we all deserved but never asked for...or something like that.So how is the game? Double Fine crafted a beautiful imaginative world with colorful characters while some carrying surprisingly muted intentions. It tells a story about a boy and a girl from two entirely different environments, yet facing the exact same problem: being captive in one's fate, as they both try to defy the fate placed upon themselves. The world looks hand-drawn and reminds me of the story books I used to gross over as a child with the smallest of details carrying the biggest impressions. What is brilliant is how Double Fine lays down such a mature tale through the light hearted visuals and very simplistic and pleasing audio cues.As someone who played a lot of adventure games when he was a kid, but sadly gone out of touch with it - because of lack of such games out in the market. I got stuck in a couple of  puzzles, some of them took more than hour for me to figure it out!  I took about 6 hours or so to finish the first act. Your milage may vary depending on how good you are at solving the puzzles.If I had a gripe with this game, it is how much you are limited in solving the puzzles: I wish the game was a bit more open to clever to players out there. At times I felt I had the tools to handle a situation in an alternate way, but the game never really responded to such ideas. I know the game is playing it to it's well documented traditions, but I wish the game explored a bit further out the boundaries of this genre like this without taking away it's heart.For the asking price of 25$, it might put off a lot of people off considering the short ride they are getting. The ride may be short, but it is a much more memorable. They could have easily went the road most other games take by stretching the length with filler content, but they didn't. Not a single time in the game I felt it was wasted, it is even more true for games of this class as any sort of filler content will distract it further from it's puzzle solving elements. So what are you waiting for? Hop in the Double Fine express for a beautiful journey that you won't be forgetting anytime soon!			"

												This is a bad game. The story is about a boy who lives in a spaceship and pretend plays to be a hero while in a different location a girl is about to be sacrificed to a monster that appears every fourteen years. These two events seem to be unrelated but I predicted the twist within five minutes of the game. The protagonists are boring and have very little personality. The supporting cast isn't very memorable either and feels wasted especially when you consider the people they hired to do voicework. Jack Black sounds unrecognizable, Elijah Wood sounds drugged and I don't even know what the point was of Wil Wheaton. The world is underdeveloped and feels empty with very little unique characters or even unique voices to talk to. This makes the puzzles tedious to solve.Also where did the 3.3 million dollarydoos go.			"

												Many people complain about Act 2 and how Tim Schafer failed to deliver. While the second part of the game could certainly be better, Broken Age is still one of the best adventure games ever made. If you believe that Monkey Island, Full Throttle or Grim Fandango were more cool, then you need to think of this: memories of the game are usually better than the game itself.			"

												I've waited for something like Full Throttle and got something like Broken Age. Is it a bad thing? Well, not really.I can understand why some backers (those who paid more than $15 mostly) may be disappointed in the game. It's fairly simple (good for you guys who hate illogical twisted puzzles!) and also very short (Act I is about 4 hours, and that's two storylines!).It's also beautiful, fully animated and voice acted and has a nice twist story-wise.The Kickstarter promise went something like “You will see us a make a point-and click adventure from scratch, or at the very least, will have the fun to see us ♥♥♥♥ it up”. I would say Double Fine did the former and not the latter. Hope the second act would be a bit longer though.			"

												This is a delightful point-and-click adventure. Its strengths are story, superb art and animation, top-notch voice acting, and lush original music. The puzzles are more of a mixed bag: some really great ones, but also a few that don't make much sense and may prove frustrating with a lot of going back and forth.But, if you like point-and-click adventures, you are sure to enjoy this one. I recommend it. The tone is family-friendly (with a few sly jokes) and endearing. It may remind you in this respect of Machinarium and Botanicula, though voice acting and plenty of dialog really beef up the production.So, what's up with all these bizarrely negative reviews? This game had a lot of hype, and was poorly managed along the way (it was originally released in two ""acts"" and took a total of three years to make), which led to some inflated expectations about and misdirected anger towards the final product. Some people seemed to expect this to be the greatest point-and-click adventure of all time, and when it didn't turn out that way, slammed the game.Jut ignore all that noise: it's not the best point-and-click adventure of all time, but definitely worth your time and money. The game absolutely deserves a ""thumbs up,"" even if it has frustrating moments.I also suspect that some of the negative reviews come from people who just don't appreciate the genre: point-and-click adventuring has always been based on 1) thinking logically, and when that fails 2) trying to use every object on every other object, and finally 3) going: d'oh, why didn't I think of that! If you don't enjoy this kind of gameplay, this is not the game that will convert you. It adheres to all the conventions of the genre, just with exceptionally high production values.Finally, I'd like to thank the developers for supporting Linux!			"

												A really great point-and-click adventure game! Especially if you like Tim Schafer's flavor of characters and silly humor. In terms of puzzles and difficulty, the first half of the game is a little bit easy and (depending on your experience with adventure game puzzles) perhaps even a little boring in a few places, but the writing and characters are still excellent.The second half of the game takes the puzzle difficulty up a notch! Some have complained that Double Fine overcorrected in the second half and made the puzzles too difficult, but I could not disagree more. The puzzles can be very difficult, and if you're not consulting a guide/walkthrough, you will definitely get stumped on a couple of occasions. Maybe if you're coddled by modern games and aren't used to the experience of not knowing what to do next, then you will find this frustrating or annoying, but back in the golden days of adventure games this was to be expected and was even desired! The great thing about Broken Age, though, is that even though you sometimes get stumped in terms of how to accomplish an objective, you always pretty much know what your next objectives are, and it's just a matter of fiddling with the environment and keenly observing your surroundings until you ultimately have an AH HA moment. It's sometimes slow to come, but it will come.The genius of the puzzles in the second half is that they essentially come in two types: 1) Pure logic puzzles where, if you have heard the pertinent information in dialogue or seen it displayed somewhere, then simple logic and deduction gets you the answer you need; or 2) Intuitive puzzles that require you to think more laterally or metaphorically, and yet make enough sense that you can figure it out without consulting a guide. All you need to solve the most difficult puzzles in this game is a bit of lateral thinking, some patience, and excellent observation skils. (You won't be making any fake mustaches out of cat hair taped to a fence, if ye olde adventure gamers catch my drift.)When the first half was released early, it seemed short and easy. As a full game, though, there is an upward-sloping curve to the difficulty that starts them at easy and raises them to very challenging.Above all though, in this game, as in all Double Fine games, there is a unique and inimitible purity to the good-natured and good-humored characters and jokes and universe that just makes you happy. I'll take that over face stabbing any day.			"

												This game is beautiful. I was lucky enough to be a backer of this game, allowing me to follow its creation to the point and as it continues in the future. I have been an avid fan of point-and-click/adventure games for a long time now and am a huge fan of Tim Schafer's games and writing. First of all, it is interesting to point out that you play as two characters in separate, parallel stories, a boy named Shay on a spaceship and a girl named Vella in a village. It is very unique and provides an interesting twist to the genre that I personally haven't seen before. At any time you can switch between the characters using the inventory menu at the bottom of the screen and pick up right where you left off with that character. I'm interested to see if there is a link between the two and when it will appear. It is a very interesting mechanic and I can't wait to see what DoubleFine continues to do with it.I have to say that everything in this game just... works. The art is done in a very interesting and eye-catching style, and it is a major draw of the game. In any point-and-click, the art is extremely important since you will do a lot of exploring. It is also important to make sure that it is clear what is in the foreground vs. what is in the background as well as make the distinction of what is just part of the backdrop and what you can interact with. The game does a terrific job of all of this. I have enjoyed exploring Shay's ship and Vella's home immensely. I think my favorite moment, in terms of the art, were the different birds you see flying during one of Vella's segments. The art style and direction is incredible.Complementing the art and story is the music. The music rises at parts and is more subdued at others, matching the mood. Some points will feel slightly darker while others will feel slightly more silly or intense. For every situation, there is a perfectly appropriate piece. They've also successfully avoided one of the pitfalls that can occur with a point-and-click: the music loop. If you spend too long on many games of this genre, the music loops can can become very annoying very quickly. However, if the music looped, I didn't notice it, which is a great thing to see in a game such as this. I have to say that little piece when you first start the game and see Shay and Vella back-to-back in different worlds has to be my favorite piece thus far. I am extremely glad I got the soundtrack with my backing.The voice acting thus far has been pretty spot on and terrific. I am thoroughly enjoying listening to these actors speak and find them to be believable, which can be tough to pull off. I often find myself listening to them in situations and thinking, yeah, I would be apprehensive also or that I would be just as confused as them given the situation they are in. The voice actors do a great job.The puzzles are as you would expect. Challenging enough that you don't breeze through them, but intuitive enough that you can figure them out if you put in a little effort and time exploring and putting the pieces together in your mind. They don't reach the point of frustration, at least not for me, which is just where it needs to be. Again, the art helps a lot in this department as well by showing you what you can pick up or interact with and making it clear what various different objects are.Finally, the crux of the genre, the writing of the story and dialogue. When Tim Schafer writes a story, you know it's going to be good. It's going to be one of the few games that can make you laugh out loud with how funny it is. This game is no exception. Throughout most of my time playing, I was smiling and, on more than a few occasions, I belted out laughing. Mr. Schafer has not lost it. He is still up with the best of them in terms of writing and I enjoyed going through every possible dialogue choice just to see what silly, or even insightful, things would be said next.Overall, I am quite pleased with what I have seen and am quite glad that I chose to back this game when I did. I have a good amount of trust in DoubleFine and believe they know what they are doing. I can't wait to see where this game goes in the future. Good luck to them in producing the rest! "

												Don't expect Broken Age to be similar to Lucasarts great games, with weird characters and hilarious jokes everywhere.Don't expect Broken Age to be a very deep point and click with difficult puzzles.Do expect Broken Age to be as soft as its wonderful, pastel-colored world. The humor is there, but it's chuckles and light touches, instead of being a in-your-face laughing out loud thing. The game has a deeper goal than simply making you laugh, so it toned down the humorDo expect Broken Age to tell you a story instead of stumping you on puzzles. Puzzles are easy, but  that serve to make the story and the exploration more enjoyable.If you go without theses assumptions, you will discover a charming game, in a wonderful world, that is begging for you to explore it more. It's a story more than a game, and I love it for that. Unfortunately, this is only Act 1, and it ends on a cliffhanger that is hinting at a very surprising Act 2...Can't wait to know the end of that story :)			"

												Normally I hate Adventure games. Really, I despise them. I'm not into FPS either, I'm your good ol' gamer who enjoys the classics, Dwarf Fortress and all that. However, this game really peaked my interest. I personally love the idea of online begging via Kickstarter, and followed this game to the finish line. Although I never actually gave money, I reccomended this game to everyone I knew, to the point that they called me the ""Broken Record."" However, I never bought it. There was always some DLC that I needed or some other thing that got placed right above this. I finally bought the game about a month ago and played it in one or two sittings.Playing this game is a life experience. It's the equivalent of getting a good grade on a test, while riding a motorcycle backwards, while going off a jump into a mound of bouncy balls. I can't stress how visually appealling this game is... It's the equivalent of... I think you get the point.I really have to hand it to Tim Schafer and his team, they really knocked it out of the park with this. I also admire that they took the risk of a media backlash to create best (and only) adventure game I will play. When I finished the game I started counting the days until Act II came out, but now that it's delayed to Q1 2015, I can only imagine what the game will play like.			"

												I like it.  it's a little pricey when it gives you only a little to work with and the twist was only a twist to me because a friend said I wouldn't get it right so I was sure I was wrong, but I'm interested to see where it goes from here.  The only thing I'm worried about is if it will actually get here.  Because it is creative, a little repetitive but those parts seemed to be more to get you into the feel of things than to pad the short time it has, and the slow discovery through the ship is the most fun.  The puzzles are blindingly obvious, but I'm not really in it for the puzzle as much as the story and while obvious it was still clever and I still don't know why the ship is doing it and why it has to happen.  So can I have the second part, please?  For those of you on the fence, I might suggest waiting for the end product as I have no idea when this second part will actually come out and without it I would hesitate to recommend it as it is short and leaves a huge cliffhanger.

Broken Age is an adventure game in the classic point-and-click style. The hand-drawn graphics are wonderful and the story was entertaining. The characters were interesting and the dialogue were amusing.

Act 2 update posted April 28, 2015I replayed Act 1 and went on to beat Act 2. Everything I already said about Act 1 stays true in Act 2. Act 2 is about another 8 hours if you take the time to talk to everyone and try to do every combo of item with person/thing you can. The puzzles are a little more difficult which is good, but at the end of the game figuring out exactly what to do can be a little annoying what with the multiple possibilities of the ""wire puzzle"".The answers to what is going on are basically answered, but not to the depth I (and I'm sure many others) would have preferred, especially given the implications of what it meant. If you're worried about a cliffhanger, there isn't one; it just feels like there could (and hopefully will) be more to the story when you beat it. Sequel perhaps? There easily could be one.Overall I did enjoy this Act 2 and I feel it was very well done. One of the more memorable point n' click adventure games in a long time.Posted Jan 29, 2014As of this writing only Act 1 is available but boy did I have a good time! Act 1 is only about 4 hours if you take your time, but what is there is so superb you're not likely to mind. The story is so well put together with truly excellent dialog voiced by professionals. If you didn't already know, this is a point and click adventure game with 2 main characters that have their own unique and separate, but ultimately converging, story. One story is of Shay, a lonely boy who is on a spaceship with only his AI ""mother"" and ""father"" for company, while all he gets to do is play boring child-like games. The other story is Vella who is in a pre-industrial civilization and must prepare for the Maiden's Feast. I can't say more without spoilers.You may notice a lot of people complaining about the puzzles. What they are actually saying is that the puzzles in this game are all logical and usually have a clear goal given to you. Because of this the puzzles aren't convoluted and illogical like in so many adventure games prior. My only complaint is that the puzzles here aren't complicated at all, but this is only the first act and I expect they will get more challenging in Act 2.I can't say much about the characters you will meet or places you will go without spoilers, so I'll just say that the people you meet and interact with are all imaginative and well done, no complaints. Although this game doesn't have an examine feature (or taste, touch, etc.) I do like all the different reactions from people as you use items on them. Some are fairly funny with a few adult-oriented jokes thrown in.I saved the best for last: the ending. Oh man was this cliffhanger of an ending amazing! I seriously can't say more without possibly ruining it and that would be a travesty. For me at least the ending had me continuing to think about and examine the game hours after I had beaten it and even as I was trying to go to sleep. In the context of the game it is so thought provoking, bringing with it many more questions than it answers. I can say I haven't been looking forward to the conclusion in a game with this much anticipation and desire in a long time.So is this game worth 25 bucks? Right now it only has Act 1 that is 4 incredible hours, with Act 2 to come in the future for all current and future owners. If you want the most bang for your buck right now then you should probably wait for a sale or Act 2 to arrive. If you know you want this game but are thinking you'd rather wait until it's all done, don't! Part of the impact and effectiveness of the Act 1 ending is the fact you can't immediately proceed in the story to see the conclusion. Instead you are forced to think and mull it over, analyzing what it means and could mean. Conclusion: buy this game now or soon if you can and know you want it, otherwise be sure to get it later.

												Once upon a time, there was a man named Tim Schafer who made some of the best video games to ever exist. They were fun to play, hilarious, and quickly became timeless classics. Nowadays Tim Scahafer is scamming people with early access, siding with social justice warriors and con artists posing as feminist video game critics(and guess who is a recommended curator for this game!), making fun of minorities using sock puppets, and most of all, mismanaging Kickstarter funds IE this game.This game was suppose to require 400k bucks to fund, but after a Kickstarter campaign that raised 3.3m, backers were given HALF of a game. They spent 3.3m on half a game, and had to use the profits to finish the game. All of this attributed to big name voice actors, big hand drawn backgrounds, and lavish parties thrown by the developers.When you actually play the game, it just plain sucks. In act 1, the puzzles are♥♥♥♥♥♥easy which is made so by the shortness of the game, where as soon as you get an item ingame, you'll be using it real soon. The story for act 1 was actually really good, but act 2 is what ruined the whole story.There's just so much wrong with act 2. The game just feels rushed here. There's only a small number of new characters introduce and they really don't do a lot. The story is an absolute mess, like the plot twist about Shay's parents is just plain unbelievable which ruins the whole story of act 1. The villain's motive is easily skippable dialog, which is a huge story no-no, and not even that but the whole villain thing was never really fleshed out. It was like they had just plans for the villain but cut them at the end. Not to mention that the whole ordeal with one of the elderly female characters in act 2 is completely glossed over and ignored after it's revealed.Also the puzzles are act 2 are a mess. Schafer said before production of act 1 that he wanted to stay away from puzzles that had no basis in reality, yet act 2 is full of them. The biggest culprit of this is the snake puzzle and all the wiring. In act 1 you could play through each character's story fully without having to switch between them. If you go into act 2 with this mindset, you'll run into a brick wall sooner or later, and the game doesn't even warn you of this. Doesn't make since that to solve a puzzle you have to find a book as 1 character and solve the puzzle as another. Let's not forget the snake where you have to let the snake strangle you for about 2-3 real life minutes while your character mentions how they're dieing in order to proceed ahead.The ending really felt rushed. It's over so quick, and ignores the fact that everyone's standing around a giant wall that was just shooting cannons at them, it fades to credits where you get pictures of what happened to the characters next, which unlike Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, doesn't feel fulfilling.Also there's so many social justice warrior undertones in the game it's just plain ridiculous. You can tell these people got their claws rooted in Schafer. There's girl power tones everywhere with 1 of the main characters being a strong beautiful black women who don't need no man. Also the villain is of a white race that the characters ingame describe as ""privileged"" ughhh.Honestly don't buy this game. Schafer lost his touch years ago, and after all the underhanded and discriminatory stuff he's done lately, you shouldn't be giving your money to him, and because of the lack of love with act 2, you're not really missing much by skipping this game.

												Broken Age... hmm. Lots of negative reviews. Some negative reviews go into a lot of detail and have good points. I'm going to focus on what was well done and what may need work. I'd suggest buying Broken Age on sale, and expect 2-4 hours game play. What's that worth to you?Well done:Story, music, artworkNeeds work:Rest of game--this is only half or Act 1, puzzles, slow panning of camera when revisiting areas			"

												Since ""Broken Age"" will come along in two Acts, ……… I as well will take the liberty ofsplitting my Opinion for the time being until ……… I had the fair chance to experience both parts.First and foremost, there is a *huge* amount ……… of charme – established by the visuals, character design, voice acting and camera ……… work. But where is the substance?Unlike in classical LucasArts adventure games ……… – where walking about alone with the occasional ""Pick up Item"" was not enough to ……… solve the puzzles and demanded further thinking & experimenting – traversing the areas ……… in the same manner in BA already solves half the puzzles. This results in a ……… short & easy game. It does have charmebut lacks the humor quality typical of Tim.Playing as either of two characters and ……… switching to them at will spices the game up a bit, but as short as this is there isn't ……… much sense for this feature altogether,imo.

												The good: Fantastic art direction, amazing voice talent, engaging story, simple gameplay.The bad: Frustrating 'use object with everything you can think of' gameplay, overly obtuse puzzles, breaks off before delivering on story.It may be that I'm getting old and no longer have the patience for puzzle games, but I can't help but feel that Broken Age's strengths are the fantastic story, art and characterization, and that the puzzle mechanics actually get in the way and detract from that experience (I had to resort to a walkthrough a couple of times, which broke the immersion somewhat) and there are a few sections of the game that feel a bit rushed or, rather, too hastily progressed through.The cliffhanger ending will hopefully be resolved in part 2, but as it stands it can feel a little unsatisfying as there's no real resolution provided for the situations the characters have created.Those points aside, it's still an interesting experience and one I'm glad I had.

												Starts out fun, but the limitations of character class (mage in this case) make higher dps castles almost impossible to complete. Cannot access inventory in castle on attack, so if you fill up and a beter piece of gear drops you are S.O.L. In mob situations point and click movement becomes ridiculous since you cannot click on any real estate to move. Has potential to be fun if it were team play...but it isn't.			"

It reminded me of older games such as Myst and Riven. The dialogue was absolutely hilarious. I truly loved every minute of this game. EDIT: I loved the first half of this game. The second half was kind of a let down and I could totally see it coming. I would get this game on sale if you want to get it. It's a great puzzle game, but mostly for kids. Especially with how the second half turned out. This game had so much potential and momentum going for it. I was sad that they took the direction they did in the second half.			"

												brokenage is a good game & thruoughout this essay i will prove it to youparagraph 1:broken age has very many characters. sometimes u play a videogame that only has two or three characters (example: super mario brothers) all it has its mario and green mario. BORING. brkenage has many characters such as the cool girl and the computer lady and the wolfhead guy.  that makes it a good game.paragraph 2:the graphics are nice to look upon.  sometimes u play a videogame that has crap graphix (such as: mario 1. everything's all blocky and it looks like it was made with an old windows xp computer.  brokenage has nice nice pictures and that makes it agood game.paragraph3: my mom said it lookd good. i showd her a screenshot of it and she said it looked like something she would play, but she dosnt have much time because she is very busy today okay (don't ask me!!)i tried to show her supermario but she had 2 go to work again.in conclusion, i think you will hav efound that because the graphix and the characters and because moms like it that broken age is one  of the best.thank you for reading my essaysincerelyjoseph gordon levitt			"

												First off I felt cheated when they broke the game up into act's after taking so much money to make the game, and taking forever to do it. I played Act 1 however and it was pretty damn good I was mad when it was over because I was so anxious to see the conclusion, and here we are Act II of Broken Age. It has been a year or more since I played Act 1 so I wasnt even excited for Act !!, on top of that it is under par at best.  Act II just makes no sense and the puzzles arent even fun. You have to play some of each character to figure out clues to puzzles for the other mind you they have no communication with each other so how does that even work. The main point of this review is do not waste your money on this game its to late for some of us who got suckered into this awefull game so dont you fall for the trickery. There are far better adventure games out there play Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis an oldie and far better than this game.			"

Posted: November 17, 2016
												As much as I really wanted to like this game ... well ... it doesn't keep up with the promises it took in any way.Let me tell you why:The whole storyline evolves around two main protagonists and thus for is splitted in half by the game design itself. Too bad they didn't use this opportunity to implement some nice coop style riddles and things. There is not one single point in the game where one player does something and the the other has to work at least with the outcomings of these actions.But it does get even worse: I won't spoil you, but in fact there is one (or two) moment just before the end of the game (a point where there have been so many obvious opportunities to do coops or at least interesting crossovers in the story - sadly noone of them do happen - and so you as the player are quite disappointed because the game was hyped by tellling to do so), where you can see information in the story part of one of the player, that must be used by the other player. And now listen closely: The two never exchange this information. The only one that knows this is the viewer / player. How illogical can game design become?Apart from that this leads to a ""riddle"" where you have to repair droids by making connections in their electronic brains. Here you connect two pins with cables multiple times for both droids. But noone tells you that it makes a difference what end of the cable is connected first ... :O ...  A behaviour one most likely would excpect like for e.g. on his or her everday Computer / HIFI / Telephone system in real life ... OR NOT ?!? ... :/I even mentioned this behavior one or two times while doing the adventure game typical ""use everything with everything actions"" using items in the inventory, where the action only takes place when the objects are selected in the proper chronological order ... GOSH ... Do you have any idea how far I have to go back to remind myself when (back in time) I was happy because this behaviour of adventure game systems seemed to hopefully never happen again in commercial games? Let's be fair and say it where the 90s ...So far for some of the technical limitations of the game's design and engine.But the TOP MOST ANNOYING thing about this game and THE MAIN REASON why i just can't like it is the overall theme of the game: it is made for depressive, psychotic, self-murdering, apathic, social-incompetent players with no friends during their whole lifes whatsoever ... reminds me of people like my neibhbours here, that where happily giving comments during the strangest psycho sequences this game has to feature, thus being possible because the walls here are too thin - and that's is the only bad thing I encountered while playing this game, that's not the game's fault ...To come to a finish: You may have fun with this game if you enjoyed games like ""Edna"", ""Deponia"" or ""The whispered World"". Strange depressive games made for psychotic people.You will not have fun with this game if you had the luck to enjoy real adventure games that don't want you to start hurting yourself like ""Monkey Island"", ""Flight of the Amazon Queen"" or ""Beneath a Steel Sky"" ... my oh my ... you can get the latter two ones for free to play on Scumm legally. And you should do it now (The last one being a perfect example on how to handle sarcarsm or bad themes in a game) and forget about this very game here.			"

												I changed my mind. After mulling it over I can't really recommend this game. I loved Psychonauts and all things DoubleFine, but to make me wait a yeat for this ending... it was asking a lot and failed to deliver. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it and I can even manage to gloss over a lot of odd and unexplained story to that end. The puzzles, however, are suprisingly annoying and aren't really interesting or mentally challenging (like Myst or Talos) but are more about guessing and hunting hown every object until you've found it or cheated or killed yourself. One 'puzzle' is just randomly knowing to wait in one spot an arbitrary amount of time! Plus they make it so that characters solve puzzle they couldn't possibly solve without somehow knowing what the other character was doing even when that isn't possible... I dunno. Like I said, it was fun: just don't pay full price (or even anything ove $10) or expect anything too too deep. I did enjoy the art and the music and the voice acting... just not the story or the puzzles or the actual content. Besides that I played through the game one and a half times with no intention of ever playing again and it just isn't worth buying so little entertainment.			"

												After completing Act 1.This game is good. Nothing groundbreaking, nothing incredibly innovative (except for the fact that it started out a kickstarter gaming boom, but that's another story).This game is a very solid experience for adventure-type-game lovers all over. You follow two separate storylines of a yound girl and a boy set in completely different environments trying to find solutions for the problems that arise. The gameplay part of it seems incredibly basic, you won't be wondering around much trying to figure out what to do. Most of the time spent in the game is listening to well written dialogue and experiencing neatly animated cut-scenes.Characters, story and dialogue is a strong part of the game. You will most definitely enjoy witty humour of wordplay and voice-acting. The animation style is quite unique and was very much to my liking, easy on eyes, weird enough, pretty enough.Though I think the game is a bit on a short side (even considering it is supposed to come out in 2 parts). 4-5 hours for 1half - that's ~10 for the whole game. Also I don't like it being episodic and having to wait to leard what happens next. The game is completely playable as it is though and does have an ending.Overall I am very glad that I've kickstarted this and I am waiting for act2 soon! =)			"

												When I backed Doublefine's first Kickstarter I believed they'd make a good game, maybe a great one. But what they delivered is absolutely stellar. Starting from the heartwarming story of two people on their path to freedom, the gorgeous storybook art style, the catchy music to the voice acting, this game didn't let me go from the beginning. I am on my second playthrough and I still discover new things.The downside is that only the first act is available at the moment which will give you roughly 4 - 5 hours of gameplay. But I'd rather play a short and lovingly designed game than 90 hours of shooting random mobs in the face or punching orcs in the balls in some dungeon that looks like all the other fifty ones you have already visited.If you like story-driven point'n'click adventures look no further.

												Breathtakingly gorgeous, and with a hilarious flair that Tim Schafer is known all too well for, Broken Age is a love letter to the classic point-and-click genre that is so rarely ever acted upon in this age of gaming. Growing up playing games like this such as ToonStruck and Grim Fandango, I find a heartwarming and euphoric sense of wonder washing over me with every click of the mouse. The dialogue and story is reminiscent of the days where well-written plots and stellar (not to mention gut-bustingly hilarious) character interaction was a keystone in gaming, which seems to find less and less of a foothole in many modern blockbuster games. Double Fine has always excelled at creating games that have a personality, and Broken Age is no exception. With a terrific ensemble cast of voice actors, a beautifully executed art style, and a charm that only the folks at Double Fine and the creative genius of Tim Schafer could produce, you're looking at one of the best games of the year. Don't pass this one up folks.			"

												This game is absolutely beautiful. Just look at those hand painted graphics. The orchestral score will melt your ears with how good it is. The puzzles are excellent and streamlined in such a way that you don't need to rub every single item together to find the solution. If you get into the right mindset, you'll be able to follow the game's own twisted logic easily. But as with all adventure games, story is king. It may start off slow but trust me, the story is incredible and will twist and turn in ways you could never expect. The humour is spot-on (as with all Double Fine games) and often had me grinning like a lunatic.There's only one minor caveat and that is that the game only offers 4-5 hours of gameplay. Of course it's only the first act of 2 so I imagine you'll get another 5 hours when Act 2 releases later in the year. It's up to you if you think playing 2 halves of a game months apart is feasible. Personally, I think I'm going to have to invade the Double Fine offices and hide amongst Tim Schafer's Rubiks Cubes because I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT AND I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG.4.5/5 - Highly recommended to long time adventure fans and newcomers alike.

												This is an absolutely delightful adventure game. The graphics, the dialogues, the soundtrack ... evrey possible detail of the game has been carefully crafted and put together. The problem is that so much dedication means a not very long duration: 3-4 hours at most, for the first act. It doesn't really matter, because ""Broken Age"" is one of the most enjoyable adventure games I've ever played, and you won't regret buying it.			"

												I enjoyed the game while it lasted(under 4 hours for the first act) but I was expecting it to be difficult like the adventure games of the past but it was rather easy(you will most likely not need to consult a walkthrough).As a backer for the same price I recieved the documentary which easily made the purchase price worth it.  Without the documentary(aka purchasing it through Steam) I'm not sure if it's worth full price.			"

												This is Tim Schafer at his best. Focusing on imaginative worlds and characters. Both managing to right off the bat hook my curiosity, and through at least Act 1 maintaining that interest. Though Tim doesn't work alone of course. Double Fine is this rare company that can produce these games that makes me genuinly laugh. Partly thanks to the solid delivering of the dialogue by a quite renowned cast. I personally appreciate this atmosphere being literally painted in Broken Age. A style along with the music and surprising sound production making it all very cozy and welcoming, but occasionally tainted with a hint of darkness. Along that line of contrasts, the sun has its spots. A Double Fine game is not complete without its issues, though thankfully seldom of a game breaking level. Broken Age has quite a bunch of frame drops, and sometimes the layer sorting of the beautifully rendered art goes awry. Worst part of this all? The wait for Act 2.			"

												If you are looking for a beautiful experience, read no further - this is something you HAVE to play.  If you are driven by challenging puzzles and game mechanics, read on.Broken Age is a escape into nostalgiaI in more ways than one.  I took my time with this, which is how I feel it should be experienced.  I am sure I would have been disappointed if I raced through.  However, taken in spaces of 30 minutes to 1 hour at a time (which is often all I have), it provided an escape into another world and another time.  The beauty of the story and the world is transformative, it was a joy to experience this first half.I have rarely experienced a game that has had such an authentic impact on me.  Usually the experiences are much more superficial (though enjoyable).On a purely objective level, there is room for criticism with the ""game"" mechanics so far.  As an inquisitive/exploring player I stumbled upon most of the solutions with little effort.  I am keeping an open mind, however, as there is still more to come. For me, the experience more than outweighed the lack of challenge.  I believe this will be the case for most people, and I encourage anyone even leaning towards purchasing Broken Age to give it a try.			"

												Act 1 of Broken Age has lived up to everything that I could have hoped for. Voice acting, music, story, everything about this game I simply loved. For someone who has been craving and jonsing for a great point and click adventure game this game properly filled all my needs and desires. My only complaint is that it is only half a game right now. I need the other half. I want to flail around on the ground like a horrible child because life is just too horrible without it. Sure it'll be out ""later this year,"" but I have no idea when that is. I also purchased the soundtrack, and have listened to it a couple times. I would recommend if you like Peter McConnell's other game scores.			"

												Put simply, the game has a great art style, interesting narrative (albeit, somewhat derivative of recent works) and doesn't often play the humour just for silliness sake. That is to say, the humour is present, but not in your face or overly slapstick. The issue appears with the puzzles. Unfortunately, whilst the point and click puzzler is a cult favourite, the actual style of puzzle is very important. My experience of Broken Age is to unfortunately use puzzles that aren't so much requiring of intelligence, but knowing a specific set of steps, one mistep of which puts you back to square one. Those are the most laborious, because it doesn't require the player to ""reason it out"", it requires them to know a precise sequence, or learn it by trial and error. Not great fun, and has frustrated me a few times in a playthrough.Still, overall positive impression, but I'd only recommend it to fans of the genre.			"

												After completing Act 1.This game is good. Nothing groundbreaking, nothing incredibly innovative (except for the fact that it started out a kickstarter gaming boom, but that's another story).This game is a very solid experience for adventure-type-game lovers all over. You follow two separate storylines of a yound girl and a boy set in completely different environments trying to find solutions for the problems that arise. The gameplay part of it seems incredibly basic, you won't be wondering around much trying to figure out what to do. Most of the time spent in the game is listening to well written dialogue and experiencing neatly animated cut-scenes.Characters, story and dialogue is a strong part of the game. You will most definitely enjoy witty humour of wordplay and voice-acting. The animation style is quite unique and was very much to my liking, easy on eyes, weird enough, pretty enough.Though I think the game is a bit on a short side (even considering it is supposed to come out in 2 parts). 4-5 hours for 1half - that's ~10 for the whole game. Also I don't like it being episodic and having to wait to leard what happens next. The game is completely playable as it is though and does have an ending.Overall I am very glad that I've kickstarted this and I am waiting for act2 soon! =)			"

												What a horrible adventure game. I've been playing adventure games since the early 80's and this is surely one of the worst.The first act is okay. The puzzles are almost non existent, which judging by the quality of the puzzles in the second act is probably a good thing.It's obvious that Tim Schafer couldn't design a good puzzle if he was paid a million dollars per puzzle. The puzzles in the Cave were horrible and Act 2 of Broken Age is more of the same. Time to retire Tim, you're a  washed up game designer. In fact your latest games are so terrible I suspect that you have claimed credit for past classics that you weren't entitled to.			"
