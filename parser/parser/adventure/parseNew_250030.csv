												TL;DR - Wait for a bundle. It's cute but short and tedious with no story and no replay value.Lilly looking through is a point and click atmospheric puzzle game. I hesitate to even call it an Adventure game because there's no dialog and really no story at all. It's basically a short series screens designed to create an atmosphere of whimsy with puzzles to stretch the time out. The one story element there is, chasing the little boy, is really nothing more than a macguffin to get you to the next screen.At no time are we ever told who these kids are, where they come from, what world they are in, what the rules of it are, why they are there, where if anywhere they were planning or going and what if anything they were planning on doing before the boy was swept away.That it appears to be presented in a package of magical whimsical mystery is just covering for the fact that in actuality there is no story at all. It's just an experience game made to set a mood and impression. That the bulk of the short play time is made up of puzzles that once figured out are almost immediately solvable the second time around and beyond just means it's experience game that you'll really only want to play once. Speaking of the puzzles, every time you have Lilly click to go somewhere or do something you to wait. Having to sit through the slow animations every single time and not being able to skip or cancel them no matter how many times you were redoing the same motions made me want to stab my eyes out. It was just so tedious.The fact that this game is still very short in spite of all this tediousness and the fact that they reached their Kickstarter stretch goal to make the game longer is really saying something.If you come to the end and think 'That's it?' a short length of a game is more likely to feel noticeable and problematic than another game of the same length with a satisfying conclusion that feels like a complete, whole experience. To the Moon is a good example of the latter. It is short but that never feels problematic because there's a definite, clear conclusion that makes sense in the context of the game and the journey. This game in comparison definitely gives a 'Huh? That's it? What does that even mean?' feel at the end which just makes the short length all the more noticeable and unforgivable. If you are going to make a game first and foremost about soaking up the atomsphere framed by gameplay that that gives no replayability to speak of then at least make it long enough so that we feel we get enough time in that world to soak up the atmosphere.Seeing as it's both short and without a story, all your are left with is a short time with a feeling of whimsy that's mostly padded out by puzzles made tedious due to all the slow unskippable animations between motions.Lastly, I want to talk about pricing and packages. I bought the 'Deluxe Edition' through their Humble store. The regular version for $10 pre-order at the humble store did not come with a Steam key. The 'Deluxe Edition' for $15 did. It also came with a PDF artbook, which turned out to be very short and mostly just pictures of one particular locale in the game. It's also the same PDF they are giving at GOG for $9, the price of the regular version minus 10% off new release sale. They literally charged $5 extra to for a Steam key if you bought the game from the Humble Store which is not only shady, I've honestly never seen another developer do this.The music was excellent, relaxing, magical sounding and ambient and the best thing about the game in my opinion. It would have been nice if this had come with the 'Deluxe Edition' for $15. It didn't. The soundtrack will put you out another $10. I'll pass as I've already spent more than I should have for what I ended up getting. It's a real shame because I wanted to love this game.			"

												A lovely adventure for the whole family that would benefit from more finely tuned gameplay and twice the current length. Kids will love it, though - and their parents might as well :D			"

												Short and relatively charming adventure in the vein of Samorost and Botanicula. No inventory management, no verbs, no dialogue, just clicking hotspots on the screen in the right order. Nice animation and graphics, soothing music and the puzzles occasionally provide a challenge. Sadly the challenge is more about trying to figure out what you should be doing than actually solving the problem itself - the age-old Myst™ curse. You find yourself spending lots of time flipping colored switches with no concept of what you're supposed to accomplish.The story doesn't really make much sense or seem to be going anywhere. When it finally does the game just abruptly ends, and the said anticlimax just seems to underline the already short length of the game. If you've already played all Amanita Design games and still want more, then and only then consider Lilly Looking Through. Lilly doesn't quite fall in the same league, but is pleasant enough to waste a couple of hours with.			"

												It's almost a recommend, because the art is nice, the animations are cute, and the setting is quite pleasant.I can't recommend it because the execution is terrible:- mechanics suddenly change (can you click mid animation or not?) - solving problems is mostly ""I feel tricked"" rather than ""I feel smart""- then the color puzzle come. The ""solutions"" might as well be arbitrary, I recommend you use a guide for all the color puzzles- it's so rarely clear what to do. This isn't like ""I want the solution"" - I like hard puzzles. But the aim is just totally unknown - for one puzzle the magic solution is yellow, for another it's red. No indication why.- the story is bland and ends so abruptly I felt like I'd fallen off a cloud.- animation delay. This is a killer. Every single action has a second padding front and back when you can't do anything. At first this seems laid back... in the later puzzles where you need to make 50 or so animations in a row, it drives insane rather than creating a relaxing feel.			"

												Putting aside the somewhat lackluster ending and the missing conclusion, let alone any sort of proper story or explanations, the puzzles themselves are often lacking in logic and the player may find the rules changing on them without any warning or visual clues. A hint; game mechanics don't usually change without any sort of a note - as in, the player suddenly being allowed to click during cutscenes/animations. Similarly, the puzzles themselves are somewhat tedious and repetitive. The animation sequences take a long time and are forced on the player, meaning that sometimes (yes, I mean the pipe extension) the player will spend 10 minutes repeating a tedious task over and over, with animation and loading inbetween each inch of progress.No, I would not recommend this to anyone; it seems half finished and not nearly as good as most other puzzle games.

												TL;DR LLL is a good point and click game with tons of adventure game errors.Yes, I know I said it wasn't recommended. I'm probably gonna get shot in the head for this, but, Lilly Looking Through just feels like wasted potential. When I was going into this game, I had high expectations because people were saying it's good, and that it's like Machinarium and so on. After finishing the game (yes, it was that short), I don't feel like it's really that great.Lilly Looking Through is a story about a girl named Lilly, who has to rescue her brother Row, from a... magcial cloth who has appeard to taken Row away. Yeah. Anyway, let's start with pros. The pros are that the game is charming and whatever, and has a nice setting. You can switch between two worlds to solve puzzles in and the art style is really cool. The animation in this game is wonderful, and it just looks overall great. The game isn't too hard, and you'll have fun playing it. Maybe.Now it's time for the long list of cons. Some are personal, some are obvious. 1. The game is waaay too short. After finishing a puzzle, I was thinking what would happen next to these two protagonists. Then the game ends. Seriously. On a cliffhanger. One second I'm partially enjoying myself and the next second the credits are rolling. 2. YOU CANNOT skip animations. So whenever you're doing a puzzle, you have to watch every slow animation Lilly makes. It looks nice, but not when you're sitting there for minutes watching Lilly shamble on. These long animations actually help lengthen the already short game time. It makes the game super tedious and I can't enjoy it if it's like that.3. Variety. There were a lot of the same puzzles. Ones with color mixing. I no like colors. I never thought a really short game could get repetitive.4. Random. There's an appearance from Lilly's Grandpa at the end that had nothing to do with anything and it baffled the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. Also, there's like 5 lines of voice acting that randomly appear and I don't get it.Overall, I wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy it. There were a lot of cool things, but when you stop and look at it, you'll realize that there's problems abound. With that said, I wouldn't mind a sequel with some improvements or a new game from these guys. There's still a lot of potential here.			"

												Hmm... this one's a hard one to review.PROS:—Beautiful, beautiful, BEAUTIFUL scenes/backgrounds. Absolutely magical art.—A pair of magical goggles that transport you between past/present versions of the current scene (kinda like DOTT)—At least one of the time-exploitation puzzles (the one involving trees) is very neat and clever—Rather than inventory puzzles, LLT relies more on Myst-style machine-manipulation puzzles, which is a flavor I greatly enjoy and wish I could find in more games.CONS:—Every thing you click on plays a kinda slow/lengthy animation. Many puzzles require you to perform the same action over and over again, and it gets incredibly old watching these long, slow animations play out over and over again.—The game’s coolest feature is the past/present time swapping goggles, but it is woefully, woefully underused.—The game’s very first serious puzzle (i.e. the bubble pond) is one of the most frustrating puzzles in the game and may turn some people off right at the front door.—Several puzzles in the game are based on color-swapping, but the puzzles don’t make sense. They end up being trial and error puzzles instead of puzzles where you work toward something that makes practical sense.—The very last puzzle of the game is an illogical mess. You will most likely only solve it by guessing or by looking up a walkthrough.—The game has no ending. Literally. It just abruptly ends with no apology or explanation. You solve the last puzzle, and then there is a short cutscene, and then Lilly finds herself in a new situation, and it appears as if this is a new room and a new puzzle is about to start, and then…. credits????? The ending is so painfully abrupt that it’s almost indistinguishable from a game crash. The barely-there story gets no resolution, no explanation, nothing.--Very, very, very short. (About 2 hours, maybe a little less.)This game is really beautiful, but it’s got some serious flaws that hold it back from being great. Here’s what it would need for true greatnesss:+Some playtesting of the puzzles. A couple of them are painfully illogical/obtuse (especially that last one, holy hell).+In fact, get rid of all of the silly color-based puzzles. Those puzzles are the worst offenders. The past/present time-swapping is the most interesting thing about this game and there is not nearly enough of it.+Actually finish making the game. I'm going to recommend this game to people who love point-and-click adventures, child-like wonder, and Myst-style machine-manipulation puzzles. However, I recommend it with a huge caveat, because I am not exaggerating in the least about the cons mentioned above. If you go into this game with your expectations appropriately adjusted, you may enjoy yourself for the evening.			"

												Delightful point and click game, that is just very gentle and relaxing. Not to say that it's easy because it really isn't! I must confess that some of the puzzles had me totally foxed and if it wasn't for youtube, I would be hopelessly stuck! If you like point and click then you will definitely like this one. Give it a try, it’s a bargain right now.			"

												TLDR;   Very short and leaves a definite sense that the game (the story) is unfinished.  So you will be left feeling unsatisfied.   Otherwise it's a really nice little adventure game. I truly do hate to give this game a Not Recommend.It's a cutely animated game, with some pleseant music, interesting locations, and a unique concept.  There are a few challenging puzzles (a couple of them are anyway).   Though it's fairly simple for a point and click adventure.  There are only a few options presented at any time as to what you can interract with and do, so depending on how you look at that it's either good or bad.    Bad perhaps in that it makes solving the puzzles easier, if you like greater challenge,  but good in that you aren't presented with options to do things which are no longer useful, so you'll have less frustration.That said,  this game is VERY short.  I completed it in about 3.5 hours, and that is without looking up any guides or using any hints to solve the puzzles.   My shown time includes at least an hour and a half of idle AFK time during various play sessions. It's not only very short, but I'm almost certain that it is actually unfinished.  When you solve the final puzzle, you find yourself not in any resolved state, having figured out what has been going on this whole time (or at least making it back home safe and sound),  but in a very precarious situation clearly nowhere near home. Then the credits simply roll.   And this after in the previous scene having met/seen someone who might help explain things.   I had to watch through the entire credits (which aren't that long thankfully),  thinking I would see some explanation, a final cut scene, or at least a ""To be continued..."", but nope, that was it. So in the end, though an enjoyable journey for the most part,  you are left feeling very unsatisfied and unfulfilled at the end.   Should they ever finish this game, with hopefully at least a couple more scenes (ideally more) to properly wrap up the story, it would be a Recommend for sure. If you are willing to deal with these caveats and can get this game for a steal, then it's worth it if you know what to expect going in.			"

												(Please see the UPDATE below review.)By now, everyone knows: ""Lilly Looking Through"" is charming, beautifully animated, and very fluid. The music has an ethereal quality that doesn't distract. In a nice touch, as you put on or remove the time-changing goggles the music changes too, depending on which ""time"" you're in.As is typical for the genre, there are times when the game becomes not quite a pixel hunt, but ""let's mouseover the entire screen to see what I've missed (or what's changed)."" Unfortunately, there are also times when you click on things without a clear understanding of what your actual goal is. When you do make a successful attempt, Lilly's actions may actually surprise you, as she does something you may not have been trying to get her to do in the first place. In other words, there is one solution to each screen, and only one. Most of the puzzles make sense (if only in hindsight), but it does mean that if you're not on the developer's wavelength, too bad. The game does not save after you complete a puzzle, but only after you complete a screen. If you leave partway through a screen, you'll have to repeat your puzzle solutions up to that point on that particular screen (which should take less than a minute, as you've already done it once).There is only one game at a time, which means that if other people in your house want to play as well, they'll either have to play your game or wait until you've finished. Frankly, as this is being marketed as a family game, I don't understand the lack of multiple player slots at all.All that said, I did find myself enchanted by the game for the first hour. An hour later, however, I found myself finished, frustrated, and a bit stunned at the overall lack of purpose. My total time played was 2:33, but that includes a 15 minute period where I literally kept trying different combinations of switches on one screen simply because I had missed seeing an important lever and had no idea what else to do. If I had noticed it earlier, I would have had around 2:18 for my total playtime. It's also important to note that much of the game's running time is simply you sitting back as a several-second animation plays out every time you click on something. You cannot cancel an animation, even if it's the twentieth time you've seen it (and with some of the trial-and-error puzzles, you will be sitting back and waiting a lot).The irony here is that the first Kickstarter stretch goal allowed them to actually make the game longer, so I'm at a bit of a loss. Every Indie game is a labor of love (I would hope), but this one feels so much more so, and so special (even to the point of being developed and voiced by a family) that it really does pain me that I can't recommend it at full price. Yes, it's obvious a lot of work went into it. Yes, I hate myself a little. However, how do we learn, grow, and improve, if not from our mistakes? How will we ever know about those mistakes if people constantly bury the truth in favor of praise for our hard work? I'd rather have a constructive criticism than an insincere ""attaboy"" any day. With that in mind, take a deep breath, 'cause here we go.Not only is ""Lilly..."" short, but the puzzles tend to feel repetitive, particularly with four consecutive color-matching puzzles on the last four screens (the final screen also combines that same color gimmick with mechanics from an earlier puzzle). I stopped having fun after the second color puzzle, but when I realized that final screen was yet another one (the fourth in a row), I actually began to resent the game. This color-matching idea is milked so often, it leaves me wondering if these were the stretch goal additions.And then...the ""ending."" Which is to say, there isn't one. While avoiding spoilers, I'll say that it literally is a cliffhanger; that is, it would be if we cared about the characters. How can we though, without any reason to? Lilly and the little boy are cute, but there's nothing else to them. I understand minimalist storytelling but, for me, it doesn't work. I've chased a red piece of cloth (and the boy) across ten screens, only to have it be replaced at the end by something so completely random, open-ended, and esoteric that I'm left thinking there was absolutely no point in my playing, no reward for my work, no reason for the red piece of cloth to have existed at all. It's such a thoughtless MacGuffin that it feels like a bit of a slap in the face.I sincerely hate writing this but, as a gaming experience, ""Lilly Looking Through"" gets two stars out of five. The game's length, repetitiveness, and ending completely undermined the joy I felt the first hour of play. That said, the love, creativity (for the most part) and passion is there for great things in the future, and I really do hope ""Lilly..."" finds a solid enough market that Geeta Games can keep growing and producing games.UPDATE: This review was originally written the day of the game's release (I had previously joined the Kickstarter). Today, almost a year later, I found Lilly in an old bundle as an add-on game that I had never noticed.  I popped it onto Steam, gave it another go, and am saddened to report that NONE of the initial problems have been fixed. Cut scenes still take forever (with no way of bypassing them), and the game's optimization level is ridiculously poor at times (particularly the underwater sequence), even at lower resolutions.  Lilly currently sits at a $10 price point (down from $15), and I think that's still too much for a two-hour game with no replay value (this time I completed it in less than an hour), no real story,  only one save spot, repetitive puzzles, and no ending.  If you can get it in a bundle, then do so to admire its ample charm. More than $5 and I'd pass.			"

Gameplay'Lilly Looking Through' is a point & click adventure game. In most of those games, you collect items and use them on stuff in the game world or on other items in your inventory. 'Lilly Looking Through' plays more like a puzzle game, though. There is no inventory. You just use items in the game world like levers, cranks, wheels, pressure plates, and so on. On a few occasions, you can pick up an item but only to use it immediately on another item in the world.There is no dialogue with NPCs. And there is little story. So you're basically just solving puzzle after puzzle to advance in the game.The thing that makes this game special, is that most scenes have two versions. You see, shortly after the start, Lilly finds a pair of goggles. When she wears these, she's in the same place but in another time. This opens up great opportunities for some original game mechanics. For example (just a mild spoiler because this one is fairly obvious): you stand before a chasm you can't cross, on the other side there's an acorn that you can water => do that, then switch to the future and all of a sudden there's a huge tree allowing you to climb its branches to get across the chasm. DifficultyThe first half of 'Lilly Looking Through' is quite easy. By that I mean you won't need a walkthrough, not that you won't need a brain, because you will need to analyse and think, combined with the good old principle of trial and error.The second half, the colour puzzles, are quite difficult. The biggest reason for that is that you don't know what the goal is. A few words to indicate what the desired result of the puzzle is, would have been welcome. As it is now, you just fiddle around and hope the solution will come to you. I looked up a walkthrough, not to read how to solve the colour puzzles but to read what the desired outcome was. Maybe it will help you, so here are the goals for the colour puzzles. Don't worry, finding the way to achieve these goals is still plenty challenging!   underwater cave: the desired result is yellow, all yellow (oh yeah, and each bell has two (!) usable sections, I failed to notice that, too) second underwater cave: yup, make the whole cave yellow again final colour puzzle: you need red insects, red like the canvas you'll be repairing Graphics and musicThe characters in the game are drawn in a basic, cute cartoonish style. The settings and the backgrounds are simply beautiful. The music is very nice: subtle but atmospheric.A few cautions It's a short game. There, now you know ;-) No seriously, a lot of reviewers bash the game for being short, so they didn't get the word before they bought it. Personally, I think point & click games shouldn't be long because then they tend to drag on. Also, isn't it a compliment if people think your work (a game, a musical piece, a play, ...) should have been longer? That means they enjoyed it, I think, as they want more! I mentioned before that the second half of the game mainly consists of colour puzzles, so people who are colour blind may need to give this game a miss. Every time you click on anything that Lilly can interact with, she'll do so in the form of a short animation. This means that this game is not for the impatient. Personally, I think all the small animations add to the game because they show a lot of heart and an eye for detail on the developers' part, but a lot of the negative reviews bash the game for those constant animations and I can surely understand that, so a warning seems appropriate. VerdictBecause 'Lilly Looking Through' is a short game, let's get this out of the way: it's not worth full price. But when it's on sale, often priced at less than €1/£1/$1, I think it's more than worth playing if you can appreciate a beautiful puzzle game.  I do think you should know about the cautions mentioned above, though, and take a peek at the wanted outcome for the colour puzzles, so you know the goal of those puzzles.			"

												Absolutely adorable flash animation adventure game about Lily chasing, trying to rescue, her brother Row.  The background are beautiful and the animations are very detailed and fluid.  Some of the puzzles can be very difficult at times, especially the color puzzles near the end.  The rest of the puzzles though will tickle your brain, but will not be too difficult to make you cheat or give up.  Overall it is a short game and the ending seems abrupt, as if set for a sequel.  I've not heard of a sequel yet for this game, so this may be a disappointment for some.  Cute fun game to play with the kids or by yourself, especially if it's on sale where the price is right.			"

												It's cute but the ending and gameplay fall very short of my expectations, if it's cheap it's an ok time waster but don't pay full price. The puzzles are hard per se just not well explained, I spemt a lot of time just randomly clicking during the color changing ones with no clue what I was doing. There is practacally no plot and game is unfinished in my opinion, maybe there wil be a patch so we can get some closure. It really is sad because I feel the idea of mini time travel is great but wasn't really used much a little under half  the game(which isn't long) you don't have use of the goggles. It had so much potential.			"

Lilly Looking Through manages to captivate without being dragged down by some of the more cumbersome aspects of the genre. The beautiful artwork and animations will draw you in while the clever puzzles are a challenge without ever becoming too obscure.

												TLDR: I would recommend you play this game when it goes on sale. It is not worth paying $10. This game is short AF. I would reccomend this game because it is an interesting point-and-click adventure. It has nice graphics and I love the googles versus no goggles mechanics. If you are interested in simple, short, point-and-click adventure, this is the game for you.HOWEVER, the number one downside of this game is that the story seems UNFINISHED. I won't spoil it for you, but there are a lot of plot holes that will leave you feeling unsatisifed.			"

												""Took longer to get the cards  than to finish the game. ""That basically puts the game in perspective. It was a fun game with nice interaction but it was incredibly short for $10. I finished it in 2 hours and I don't consider myself particularly gifted at puzzles. Two hours for $10 is rediculous no matter how much fun with NO replay value. The storyline is non-existant and does not even 'end' when you finish it, making me believe there was a second chapter or something (which I believe there is not). There are no side quests, no mini puzzles, no achievements. These are basics for a game for its value. I recommend getting it in a bundle or when its < $5.			"

												Despite the nice environments and the almost-interesting time-jump toggle mechanic, this game falls short of a satisfying experience.Drawing on its place as a typical point-and-click adventurem, Lilly Looking Through fails to provide a rich interactive experience, an understanding of the world, interesting puzzles and even an ending. The only difficulty in the puzzles is through obscurity (not realising options were available or that a certain colour is desirable) and tedium. Watching Lilly climb up, hang on a lever, pull down, then run back to her starting position before you're able to do the same thing again (and you'll have to do it 3 or 4 times) takes about half of the time you'll spend in the game. The game ends abruptly and without warning, feeling like the end of a chapter. This presents about 2 hours of nearly interesting, somewhat frustrating gameplay without humour, intrigue or intellectual satisfaction.			"

												Sort of the love-child of Machinarium and Violett.  Another one of those cases where I wish there were a middle/neutral ""thumb"" in the review choices...but I like to round up if I ""liked"" the game.Pros:+ Cute+ Interesting time-warp mechanic+ Mostly fun puzzles+ Trading cards+ ""Reveal the hotspots"" hint system built-in but optional+ You can play it with your kids (though the young ones won't be able to solve the puzzles)+ I didn't encounter any bugs (well, one minor one that didn't impact anything)Cons:- Long animations that get tedious during trial/error phases- The color-related puzzles near the end were obtuse to me.  Maybe it would be natural/obvious to an artist?- Short (my 3.8 hours included some idle time and graphical slow-downs)Anyway, this won't go down as one of the greats, but it was a mostly-fun way to spend a few hours doing the pointy-clicky thing.

												Good: Beautiful and well-animated Voice acting, while sparse, is well-done The goggles are a cool gameplay mechanic Puzzles make sense, with only a couple of exceptionsBad: The aforementioned couple of puzzles that I had to look up the solutions to The appearance of Lilly's (presumably dead) grandfather goes completely unexplained No ending—no “ultimate mystery” gets unlocked, and we do not return Lilly and her brother back home; they land on a balloon and then the credits rollUltimately, the lack of an ending is the killer. This feels like only the first 50–90% of a very well-made game. I can't recommend it until there's either a proper ending or a sequel that actually “unlock[s] the ultimate mystery”, answers all of the questions surrounding Lilly's grandpa, and gets the kids back home.I hope that's coming soon, because this game was really good right up until it disappointed me with its lack of an ending.

												Lilly Looking Through is a charming 3-4 hour game with a rather abrupt ending that makes it look (not feel) like some sort of unfinished product.Other than that it's a traditional point-and-click adventure with some mind bending puzzles. The environments are beautifully made and the few characters in it are cute and nicely animated. Some of the animations are frustratingly long, though, so sometimes you have to wait before an animation is completed before you can click on something again. No, it's not all that bad, but noteworthy nevertheless.Unfortunately, Lilly Looking Through didn't meet my expectations but, then again, I'm not really into (point-and-click) adventures. In the end I will still recommend it to people because it certainly is not a bad game and like any other game has its ups and downs.[Rating: 72/100]			"

												Encapsulates all the best things about being young: a time of wonder and innocence, where mystery beckons around every corner, a time of magic and imagination so many of us remember when we think back on our own childhood. Its a wonderful game also the music is beautiful.What im missing a little bit is the story. There is no story or just bits of story. You dont know who those kids are and why they are there. In the end it gives you the feeling like ""huh thats the ending?thats it?"" Its basically just coming from one place to the next to find her brother/friend.The Puzzles offer a little challenge and it has no replay factor, once you figured it out you will know it always; and also, ten locations make the game very short.The gameplay without idling is around 2 hours so i think the price is a little too high.I still recommend it because its beautiful even without a story factor. But i think for the full price its not worth it, i would wait for sales when its around 2 €. It would be nicer if the game would be at least double as long so you get a little bit more time with this ""magic feeling""			"

												Just another point-and-click adventure which has (IMHO) logic issues: e.g. more than one time you have to deal with color combinations... the logic issue i am talking about is that sometimes the color you chose is added to the resulting combo, while some other time it's subtracted from it and you cannot know how or why.I don't know if it's me or what, i just don't like to take guesses when playing this kind of games.Anyway, leaving apart the fact that this is a really short adventure, the setting is very charming, art and graphics are neat and the soundtrack fits well enough with the gameplay, being melodic and quite relaxing. The ending could have been a better one, honestly.Lilly Looking Through is currently sold by HumbleBundle and i feel like i can recommend it, in spite of everything.			"

												This is a beautifully atmospheric game.  It is best taken at a slow and relaxed pace. The art is fantastic and the gameplay mechanics suit perfectly.   I enjoyed this game from start to finish.Lilly Looking through is about the tale of a brother and a sister.  You don't know where they are from, where they are, or why the world is like what it is.   Some may consider this lazyness, but I however, find that this actually helps emphasis the characters themselves.   They're sweet and charming.  Throughout the game the single minded child like nature of the characters is evident and enhanced by the simplicity of the environments of the world.Even though the art style is simple and beautiful the puzzles this game present can be quite cunning.  Given the short length of the game the difficulty curve is quite steep. However, the basic premise of most of the puzzles makes solving them challenging, but never threatening.  It doesn't aim to increase the difficulty by providing lots of places to click, or by confusing you.  My one warning with this game is that you cannot rush it.  You must not rush it.  To fully enjoy it you must be willing to enjoy the art, ask yourself what has happened and why.  This game rewards freedom of imagination.  If you want a game which fully explains itself this is not the game for you.  However, if you are willing to let a game absorb you, if you are willing to let your imagination be free then this game becomes an experience full of joy and emotion.			"

												Great puzzle game, short and sweet. Not sure why it says my gameplay time is so short, but I played through the whole game. Took me about 3 or 4 days of intermittant play on my lunch break - maybe 2 to 3 hours total?Get this game if: you like point and click adventures.You are looking for a relaxing, slow-paced game.You enjoy unique art styles and presentation in gaming.You can play/enjoy a game with little hand-holding.Do not get this game if: you are looking for action/exciting gameplay.you don't have patience to sit through Lilly's longer/slower animations.You don't enjoy puzzles, or puzzles that are moderately difficult.Spoilers below, maybe?Over all I really enjoyed the game. I liked the relaxed pace, the enchanting environments/art, and the puzzles were challenging but not maddeningly so (I used a guide on a few I couldn't figure out). The game provides little direction. You're trying to find your little brother, and solving each puzzle level brings you closer to finding him. The game is short, but that's part of its charm. The world is extremely colorful and vibrant, but in the end there's little substance to the world (as you learn nothing about it). Using the goggles to shift between (I assume) timelines is a really awesome idea, and the mechanic is part of the puzzle-solving. Still, it would have been cool to learn about the disparity between environments/timelines. The only real complaint (and a small one at that) was the open ending. Felt pretty abrupt and didn't offer any explanation for a strange twist in the last level. Perhaps it's leaving room for Lilly Looking Through 2? I'd certainly pick that game up, were that to be the case.			"

												A cute, little adventure, with some pretty 2d graphics and some amazing character animations.Most similar to games like Samorost and Machinarium, in that the game consists only of environmental puzzles, and there's almost no dialogue.Unfortunately because of the focus on character animation, many of the puzzles feel unnecessarily heavy and clunky to complete, as you have to wait for Lilly to finish her animation for every single part of the puzzle's many steps.The little story there is is cute and works well to drive the progression, and ramps up right before the end, leaving us with a huge cliff-hanger and more questions.It's worth playing for the gorgeous backgrounds and the amazing character animation, if you don't mind clunkiness and a very short game with no proper ending.

Short version: 79%The setting, graphics, and the protagonist will charm you instantly, but the incredibly short play time cannot really justify the price of this fun little puzzle adventure.Long version:Lilly Looking Through is a silent game with no narration or dialogues. You play as a little girl who tries to rescue her friend (brother?) after he was swept away by the wind. It is a simple, but really nice tale told without any narration or dialogues, letting the imagery of masterfully crafted 2D backgrounds, 3D character models, and fluent animations do all the work. (The hardware requirements are a bit high though, thanks to the game being made in Flash.)Gameplay mechanics are a cross between a mild point ‘n’ click and room-by-room puzzles. At first it’s quite innovative, thanks to a pair of goggles that let you jump back and forth between present and past, but eventually the game resorts to reusing the same kind of colour puzzle over and over.It’s a bit pricey for this length, but still worth it if you like easy games with great art style and atmosphere.

												Pros:+ adorable, enchanting+ that's itCons:- graphics / animation poorly optimized (if at all). Choppy and slow animation after a while playing, even on the lowest quality setting some scenes would make the backgrounds crash and appear blank, going as far as crashing my computer once. This is unforgivable. I know what games I can and can't run on my computer, and Lilly Looking Through is definitely not among the ones that shouldn't.- very short. Often less is more, but this is not the case here. It feels like the first episode of a way longer game.- in such short time, it manages to be repetitive. The last puzzle is infuriating - unless you like moving something back and forth 200 times. It's not hard to figure out, it's not challenging in any way, it's just mind-numbingly repetitive.- it's basically a few more or less fantasy-ish backgrounds, a couple of cute kids, and... that's it. There's barely any story, not even hinted at, no substance, nothing. It's just cute.TL;DR: The technical problems combined with the repetitive and unimaginative puzzles made an incredibly short game ridiculously tedious and annoying to play. For that you will get a vague incomplete ""story"" (lack thereof) and a couple hours entertainment at most if technical issues don't stall you.Cute game concept, poor execution, nightmarish experience. Not worth it.			"

												This ALMOST made it to the recommended pile, and I really wanted it to, but unfortunately the scales tipped the other way. PROS+ Art is beautiful and fun, animations very fluid+ The goggles are fun to use+ Many puzzles are quite clever, and pretty satisfying once you figure them out+ Minimal UI makes the scenes more immersiveCONS- No ending or closure- No attempt to tell a real story- No explanations of ANYTHING- Animations between clicks are unacceptably slow- Way too many clicks required to accomplish seemingly simple tasks- Unclear puzzle goals- Unintuitive puzzle mechanics (obscure hotspots, backward-thinking)- Solutions require overly-repetitive actions- No mid-chapter saving, so crashing means restarting the entire chapter- Very short (~2 hours + more if you're forced to restart a chapter)- Certain UI buttons don't do what you think they should~ Not quite a con, but for such a dialogue-free game, the few spoken words detract from the atmosphere a bitLong version:Let me start with a warning:  Do not go into this expecting an ending, closure, or story resolution to reward your efforts.No, that's not a spoiler. I wish I read about the lackluster (understatement) ending in reviews beforehand, because I felt robbed as a player. No closure, no satisfaction. I could maybe forgive that if the last scene made any sense, but it doesn't. And to make it worse, the final ""reveal"" is only shown for maybe 2 seconds before the credits roll, so you don't even get time to look around for visual hints.STORYI'm not even sure what the story is, to be honest. Nothing is explained. Other than the overarching ""solve puzzles to find and save someone"" umbrella plot, you get no hints about who or where these characters are, why the goggles do what they do, why Lilly can breathe underwater, etc etc etc.But let's assume you don't care if a game has a story/plot.GAMEPLAYI enjoyed the ""swapping worlds"" mechanic of the goggles. There are a couple of other games that involve a ""magic lens"" of some kind, so it's not a groundbreaking idea, but this is the first game I've played that makes it the main prop/power. Using it to progress through each scene and puzzle was a fun experience, and I wish there were more excuses to toggle it.Moving around...oh dear. The animations are fluid and cute, but the timing is sooooo slow. It's not that big of a problem when the distances are short, but if you need to repeatedly run/swim across the entire screen, the wait time is simply too long. It gets absolutely excruciating in the last pipe scene, with jaw-grinding stop-and-go movement that has you clicking the same thing over and over and over just to achieve a single goal that could have easily been reached with 90% less clicks. (Then for all that work, you get no real ending.)The puzzles are clever, yet simple enough to figure out with no direction. A bright kid would probably have a blast with them. However in several it's not really clear what the goal is. In more than a few cases I resorted to the help button (something I try to avoid), which highlighted hotspots I never would have guessed without more information. But once you know what you need to do, it's just a matter of completing the steps.A note for the confusing color puzzles (bells/columns and berries):The idea is to start with a secondary color, then remove the primary color you don't want. The annoying part is that you need to add the color you want to remove. Ex: If it's green and you need yellow, add blue. If you need red, add yellow to orange. And so on. The logic is there (and consistent across puzzles) - it's just poorly implemented.CONCLUSIONScore: 4/10Don't get me wrong - I did enjoy the game, and was very torn about giving it a thumbs down. But the lack of explanation across the board (story, puzzle goals/solutions, ending, everything) is a huge turnoff. The great aesthetics do soften a few of the cons, but don't expect more satisfaction than a handful of ""a-ha!"" moments during individual puzzles. If you're a patient, laid back, and/or artsy person, I'd say give it a shot, but wait for a bundle or sale. Otherwise there are much more rewarding P&Cs to be found elsewhere.			"

												It's gorgeous and I really enjoyed the game-play.  However, I found it waaaay too short and a couple of the puzzles didn't really make any sense.  The ending was very disappointing and confusing.  Overall, I would recommend this game, but only if you catch it on a Steam sale.  I don't believe it's worth $10.			"

												This game sucks you in with its gorgeous visuals and cute but helpless protagonist, Lilly. The adventure is over far too quickly but you will fall in love and enjoy every minute of it.Lilly Looking through is a point and click puzzle game. This game is a successful kickstarter and greenlight story and for good reason. There is simply not enough of these types of games. It reminds me of games like Monkey Island, only there is no inventory and every level is its own individual puzzle. The puzzles are not ment to be hard, simply obstacles. Although, the color puzzles through me for a loop and I find myself asking “what am I supposed to be aiming for?” a few times. Even after beating the game once I still found myself a bit confused and just clicking around until things lined up.The game’s art and music are very well done. It is easy to tell that the focus of the game is indeed the atmosphere. The music keeps you calm even through some frustrating parts and mixed very well with the art direction.  The art is designed to look like a painting and it succeeds. I found myself captivated by the environment and beauty of this game.The story is simplistic but enough to set up the adventure. Lilly is trying to save a young boy, Row, as he is swept away by a mysterious red scarf. It is not much to go on, and exists only to move things forward. I actually found myself forgetting about Row and asking more questions about what happened to the world that Lilly is a part of.I would recommend this game looking for an experience. This game is far, far too short to satisfy anyone looking for a time waster. If you want to kill time, go play COD: Ghost multiplayer.			"

												I got in on the Kickstarter for this, just after the original demo came out.  It's come a long way since then, with so many more puzzles, artwork, music and most of all the acting.  While the art is usually the first thing people see in a game, I was immediately taken from the very first scene with how very much like kids Lilly and Row are.  Lilly plays around, imitates a frog, trips now and again because she's not paying attention. Row gets in trouble heedless of consequence, and isn't put off by setbacks. They physical acting for these two really goes a long way to putting me into their world and accepting both of them (although obviously Lilly is the focus here) as having personalities despite the minimal dialogue.As to the puzzles, they're well designed, and I for one am glad for a lack of sound puzzles as I'm bad at those.  There are colour-matching puzzles which can be a bit of a challenge, but nothing impossible.  The hint system is well done, it highlight's what's important without giving the game away, so getting help doesn't make it feel like you're cheating.  It's more like a nudge than anything.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this, although I echo other reviewers in demanding a sequel, preferably a much longer one.  I'd like to see more of the characters and more importantly more of their world. There's a hint of darkess in what appears to be a world fallen to ruin after some long-past glory days, possibly a change in climate?  It's hard to tell, but there are taltalizing hints to speculate on and that's a mark of a good adenture game.			"

												A point and click adventure that has ups and downs. The story and artistic style are charming and cute. The puzzles are not that hard to figure out but are pretty tedious to complete. A lot of guess work and going back and forth between switches. The game is also a bit to short for my likings. Normal price might not be fully worth it but its worth a go when its on sale.Note: Appearantly a GTX580 is not a good card to play this game. You can play it in special software/hardware modes but the game runs real slow at points and/or lacks high graphics.			"

[ Gameplay ] - 6/10 -- Some of the puzzles were decent but ultimately I found some to be ridiculously frustrating and enough to be gamebreaking.  The final puzzle in particular presented an impossibly illogical mechanism, even if you understood what needed to be done.  It was the kind of poorly designed, overly complicated puzzle where you would abandon certain logical approaches, thinking nothing was progressing when really you were on the right track but the game indicated otherwise.  I liked the time-based puzzles where you have to switch back and forth from the past and present in order to solve, however, I was not glad to have played this once it was over.[ Graphics ] - 8 - Cartoony and somewhat pleasant to look at.[ Story ] 4/10 -- Minimalistic with only a few spoken words, the game is mostly silent on describing what is happening and there is very little dialogue.  I didn't mind this, however, the story itself was underdeveloped and I was unsatisfied with the ending, which felt pointless.I got this as part of a bundle but the unnecessary complexity of some of the puzzle mechanics made things somewhat unenjoyable.

												While playing I was constantly reminded of my first romp through Myst.  It was just me and the world around me.  In a way, Lilly Looking Through is an extension of this philosophy of figuring out what’s going on on your own.  In a gaming environment filled with action titles that make your muscles twitch like crazy, it’s a fresh change of pace to sit back and leisurely move through each screen and just enjoying the ambiance.  And it’s a great game that can be played by children of all ages.  After reaching the end I found myself wanting more.  I highly recommend this game to anyone with children or just want something short to unwind from a long day.http://www.kickstartadventure.com/home/lilly-looking-through-review/ "

												this game was a beautiful relaxing point and click with nice scenery and art. though, it felt like a demo/part 1 of a series and has no finite ending. that was really upsetting.In this game you play Lilly, who can see two words. You have to solve puzzles, often related to colours to advance on. I really liked this game, I found that the puzzle difficulty was challenging enough, so that I did not breeze through the game in half an hour, but I also felt that the game was missing a lot of content.The music in game was great, but the voice acting, (though there was very little of it) was terrible. I enjoyed this point and click game, especially with a female protagonist, but I would not buy this game unless it were on sale, due to how much content the story lacks, and the cliffhanger ending.

												The game is quite short, especially if you have played a few adventure games. But whilst short that means it doesn't drag on and isn't full of padding. The puzzles are decent, some are very simple and others are a bit annoying as it's not always obvious what you are meant to be doing. Luckily there is a hint button that can help point you in the right direction without just handing you the answer.The music is great although it is a bit obvious where it loops. The art for the backgrounds is also very well made, whilst the characters are 3D models and look a bit out of place at times. They are well animated but I would have preferred that the characters matched the environments in terms of style.If you like simple adventure games or want something to play between longer titles this is a good title for you. If you are looking for a rival to Myst then perhaps give it a miss.			"

												A short point and click adventure that (for the most part) focuses on interacting with the world, rather than relying on inventory items to solve puzzles via sticking everything in everything, and also has dual world gameplay (think Zelda: Link to the Past).So after about two levels, you get these goggles that put you in an alternate version of the world you're already in, with a bunch of things, as well as environments being different. I.E. You do something in one plane of the world, it sometimes effects something on the other plane, and vice versa.In at least some of the scenarios, it seems like you're time traveling, which is pretty cool, like for example in this one puzzle: Where you scare a squirrel away, so it doesn't steal the acorns that drop down after shaking a tree branch, funnel a stream of water with a curved branch, grab an acorn, and place it on spots with water, which is then an instantly fully grown tree that you can climb over when you switch worlds, so more or less its some sort of time travel mechanic.So if you're into interesting point and click games with a wacky mechanic or two, try this when its on sale, otherwise its a tad too short for its normal price tag.

The artistic direction is great and the point and click gameplay is simple, yet satisfying. While it is a good game, the puzzles are tedious and complex and can take several tries to solve without using a walkthrough. Even though the puzzles can take some time to get through, the game is still devastatingly short, I would have loved to see more levels to add to the adventure of Lilly and Row.8.0/10			"

												A delightful puzzle adventure, Lilly is a good mix of logic puzzles, soothing music and wonderful animation. Lilly's journey to save her brother reveals her to be resourceful and determined. The color themed puzzles require a bit more than the standard ""combine this item and that one to move on"" problems of this genre. The game's one drawback is its length - it ends long before you're ready to leave Lilly's world. Hopefully, this means there's a sequel or DLC in the works to expand the story further.			"

												This review takes into account that i bought this game under full knowledge that it's a very short game. Also, it was on sale.Lilly Looking Through is a classic Point and Click adventure game with very classic puzzles (do things in right order, color puzzles, ...). I guess that's why i had trouble on a few on them.Very early on you acquire an item that lets you ""switch between worlds"". This mechanic is well integrated into the puzzles. The music is very serene and the animations are cute. Sadly it doesn't scale all that well to higher resolutions (i'm using a 1440p monitor).My other gripes about the game are the very long, non-abortable/interruptable animations. You often need to click on the same objects a lot in a row to solve some of the puzzles and the animations - while cute - can last quite a long time. This sadly got me frustrated quite a bit.Also, it's not clear what the game wants you to do sometimes in order to progress. You clearly have things to click on, but to what end? You almost always find that out after the fact.Otherwise it's a quite enjoyable, short little puzzler![SPOILER?]The ending is quite open and kinda hints at a sequel.[/spoiler?]			"

You have to be very logical about your move and because you can change the timezone you are in, doing something in the world will affect the other.Some people say that it is short, maybe but even at full price, it would be more a good ratio of $/hour than many other games.

												Lilly Looking Through is a relaxing, almost sincere point & click adventure game. Its gameplay is simple and very approachable for those (like me) who can get impatient with these puzzles and its art is simply remarkable. It's a game best played on a quiet evening, when you're not in the mood for anything so impactful like shooters or as commital like MMOs or RPGs. Its laid back feel makes it a good unwinding game.I like this game, but I can't say I love this game, mainly because theres times where it just feels TOO SLOW. Especially compounded by the small animated sequences that play whenever your click on something just bog down the process of solving a tricky puzzle. I hope in the Inevitable sequel elluded too at the end (which I guess further validates the contributions of those who backed that Kickstarter) that you can fast forward those animated bits.I recommend it, but perhaps only for more relaxed platers.

												First off, know that this game ends without a real resolution, and there's almost complete silence from the developers about creating a sequel.Beyond that, I originally bought Lilly Looking Through for the same reason I buy a lot of adventure games: compelling artwork and interesting characters. While Lilly delivers on that score, there's some pretty heavy issues beyond that.If you're looking for a lot of narrative, this is not what you're looking for.If you're looking for a lot of character development, same deal.If you're looking for a lot of the conveniences of modern adventure games, look elsewhere.Lilly Looking Through presents almost each screen as a puzzle box that needs to be solved in order to move on to the next screen. It's very rigid in this fashion. The thing is, that's the entire game. I'd be fine with that, accepting the game for being more limited than expected, except for that fact that it makes this process of trial and error very cumbersome.Lilly's movement involve long, languide animations. Lilly is slow, as you'd expect a child dealing with these devices to be. But when you're dealing with a ton of repetition, trial and error, and experimentation, these unskippable animations become a bit of a nightmare. There are adventure games from 20 years ago that let you skip cinematics and animations that you've already viewed, so there's not really a good argument for its absence here, unless the creators just hated the idea of you not caring.And the saves only occur at the beginning of each screen, something I discovered on accident when I quit the game. It's just another thing hurting ease of use.Lilly is one of those failed adventure games where watching a Let's Play on Youtube would be preferrable to playing it.			"

												While easily one of the more beautiful and aesthically pleasing games that I have played, Lilly Looking Through is definitely not worth $10. If you can get it in a bundle or for less than a buck or two, by all means - go ahead, purchase and play it. I, personally, did not buy it with physical money. I purchased it, from a friend who got it in a bundle, with virtual currency from another site that I play on. I almost (almost) feel cheated for how much I spent, even virtually. Lilly Looking Through has less than two hours of gameplay to it. With only ten (or so) levels, it's definitely not a game that you want to sap time. The only thing that Lilly Looking Through has going for it, I think, is the fact that it is so absolutely beautiful and (kind of) relaxing. The puzzles do get tedious (as other players have mentioned), the solutions oft-times seem extremely arbitrary with no actual reason, and the game itself seems to be compiled of mostly filler play.If I remember correctly, Lilly Looking Through was intended to be a short story. I think it should have been kept that way and not fashioned into a game. The ending is extremely abrupt, and I literally had no idea it was over until the credits started rolling and my boyfriend asked, ""Is it over?"" to which I responded that I think so.There's absolutely no conclusion; the game appears to have been built on a cliffhanger, almost as if it was the end of one ""part"" and there is another part to follow. If there is, I do look forward to seeing the rest of the story. If not... well, I suppose that's that. For those of you who can't stand a lack of ending, don't play it until we know more.			"

												This review takes into account that i bought this game under full knowledge that it's a very short game. Also, it was on sale.Lilly Looking Through is a classic Point and Click adventure game with very classic puzzles (do things in right order, color puzzles, ...). I guess that's why i had trouble on a few on them.Very early on you acquire an item that lets you ""switch between worlds"". This mechanic is well integrated into the puzzles. The music is very serene and the animations are cute. Sadly it doesn't scale all that well to higher resolutions (i'm using a 1440p monitor).My other gripes about the game are the very long, non-abortable/interruptable animations. You often need to click on the same objects a lot in a row to solve some of the puzzles and the animations - while cute - can last quite a long time. This sadly got me frustrated quite a bit.Also, it's not clear what the game wants you to do sometimes in order to progress. You clearly have things to click on, but to what end? You almost always find that out after the fact.Otherwise it's a quite enjoyable, short little puzzler![SPOILER?]The ending is quite open and kinda hints at a sequel.[/spoiler?]			"

												A short (2-3 hours) great looking adventure game.  LLT utilizes a light world/dark world effect in its puzzle-solving that works decently enough.  Most puzzles are logical but if you're anything like me, you looked for a walkthrough once mixing colors came up.  The last couple puzzles of the game rely on this and the color wheel is a foreign thing to me.  Asking me to mix colors to solve a puzzle is a death wish.Animations for the characters are well-done and have a lot of charm but one complaint I have regarding them is they can't be skipped or sped up, so if you're messing up a puzzle numerous times, you'll have to sit through the somewhat slow animations and back and forth every time.  The ending is also rather abrupt.In short, nice looking, cute adventure game that's on the short side.			"

												Lilly Looking Through is a rather pretty point and click adventure game.Sadly I can't recommend this as a purchase (well.. not for more than say $1 or $2) as it's very short (about 10-12 screens) and ends on... kind of a cliffhanger.If you already own it, I do recommend playing for the beatiful mysterious atmosphere and puzzles centered on understanding and manipulating machines. Since you need to get most of these machines set just right, or do multistep actions with them, you can't just click objects till you get lucky, which is nice.Many puzzles rely on color manipulation, and most have enough states you can't brute force them very well, so if you're colorblind you may struggle with the entire second half of the game.

												A lovely little puzzle point and click adventure. Very nice visually, i loved the sound, and the puzzles were intriguing. Sometimes fairly straightforward, sometimes quite difficult and frustrating, until i got it. Very short, only 10 zones, each with it's own puzzle to proceed. I see I have only 3 hours and some of that time the game was sitting while I was afk. So in that case, I'd recommend purchasing only on a deep discount. Worth it if it's cheap though.			"

												I don't recommend this game, but it doesn't mean that this game is bad anyway. This game has a creative problem solving system with a beautiful background. It took around one-half to two hours to beat the game, and yeah I love short game due to my less free time after a day of work. It's great, but the gameplay is too slow and need a lot of patient to watch the character doing something you already commanded. You can beat the game in half-hour with x2 speed, but unfortunately, the game doesn't allow you to do that, and also this game no value of replay with the W T F ending. In my opinion, it worth only a bundle price not a full price. I'd recommend to buy this game only from bundle or something cheaper, hope u enjoy, thanks.ไม่มีอะไรมากครับเกมนี้เล่นไม่เกิน 2 ชั่วโมงจบ เกมให้ความรู้สึกหน่วงอารมณ์ ถ้ามีปุ่มปรับสปีดซัก x2 จะเป็นเกมที่เยี่ยมยอดกระเทียมดองมาก ปริศนาไม่ยาก แต่ก็น่าเบื่อไม่ทำให้อยากกลับไปเล่นซ้ำ แนะนำให้ซื้อตอนลง bundle นะ อย่าเกิน 0.5$ กำลังดี "

												TL:DR get it on sale only if you like puzzle gamesLovely game with long but well made animations that most people might find sluggish, however i liked the level of detail in such animations. I can say that i do not regret playing it and loved most of the puzzles, specially the goggle related ones. Its quite short (about 90mins if you get the grasp of the colour puzzles) and sadly like most other puzzle games offers very low replayability. The colour puzzles use the 6 basic colours (red yellow blue purple green and orange) so if you are colourblind to any of these i would recomend skip this game since i didn't find any colourblind option. On top of these is the ending that is totaly lackluster leaving you hunging in the midle of nowhere possibly trying to create interest for some sequel... dunno really, I can say however that the ending impacted my review more than usuall and this is why I do not recomend it.

												I would suggest avoiding this game. While it does have most of the gameplay that you need from a standard point & click adventure game, it is missing a few things.I feel as if the story is somewhat lacking. It is very short, and from what I can tell you are a sister looking for her brother who somehow got carried away on a banner of some kind. Then you end up being able to travel through time, see ghosts, and then end up on some wierd cloudy island. I really have no idea what is going on.The graphics are not great. The background are very nice, but the character models seem somewhat disjointed to it. I don't really feel they match the style of the backgrounds. This coupled with some severe framerate issues which made the game feel very sluggish made it a bit hard to play. Especially when you have to move very far around a scene.The music and sound design on the other hand was very nice. As were the puzzles. I suppose with a bit of a re-think this game could be very good, but in it's current form it is not worth playing.			"

												I got this game as part of a bundle. Not knowing what I was diving into, I decided to open it and play around a little bit. For everyone that absolutely loves point-and-click adventures in the same vein as Machinarium and Botanicula, this is definitely a MUST buy. In all honesty the game, which at first glance did not look appealing to me, opting for a rather childish and colorful art style,  quickly turned into an immersive experience with relatively simple puzzles and effective story-telling through short cutscenes. The plot is rather open and loose, but it proves enough to keep your interest. Featuring a handy hint system that, rather than spoiling the puzzle, allows you to intuitively learn your way through each scene, it's length is just adequate to appreciate the hard work poured on the atmosphere and attention to detail.A pleasant surprise that I never expected, Lilly Looking Through doesn't abuse it's gimmicks and adequately caters for a wide audience, from kids to adults alike.

												There's a certain childhood wonder and curiosity that at some point we all loose, as we gain knowledge of the world and realize that our magical fantasies we once imagined possible were just that; figments of our imaginations that will never actually come into existence. Nevertheless through books, movies, games and other art forms we can still visit the enchanting worlds of our dreams, carrying ourselves away for a few hours to a place that can only be described as extraordinary. Lily Looking Through is a lovely, imaginative journey that captures that childish awe and spirit of discovery exceptionally well; placing it under an adventure game guise and a gorgeous presentation which carries you on your way sidestepping the many pitfalls games of the genre often fall into. With very little in the way of story Lily is a game that is largely about spectacle over plot, but personally I didn't think it needed anything more than what was here. The simple opening of your brother being taken away by a magic scarf sets off the adventure, and I was more than happy to continue on it without anymore development up until the very end. This is the point that I was disappointed with where the developer took the game. Instead of ending with the heartfelt reunion I think many will expect from the start, you are left with something that feels entirely misplaced among the rest of the game which makes no sense and left me feeling a bit empty inside, almost as if the developers themselves had no clue what it was intended to mean. I'm perfectly fine with having to decipher an ending for myself, but when it comes so out of left field as it does here, I have to wonder if it was intended for any reason than to confuse the player.While I disliked the conclusion, the joy I had traversing the rest of the game certainly made up for it. Lily is about as simple an expression of the point and click adventure game formula, but it works wonderfully in this instance. Instead of collecting items, talking to characters, or solving obtuse puzzles, in Lily you simply progress and explore the world. Puzzles come in the form of interacting with objects, pulling levers, and using Lily's goggles to see the world in a new light, all of which formed logical and satisfying solutions which were enjoyable to solve but didn't exasperate me by being too challenging. While I wouldn't call it easy per say, this isn't a game that should give many people trouble, which I feel is admirable in a genre that is so full of alienating game design. If you are looking to flex your cortex intellect this may not be the best way to do so, but as a mellow and relaxing experience Lily succeeds beyond doubt.Easily Lily's biggest asset is it's artwork. Each vibrant scene is full of lush colors and beautiful detail, mixing pseudo-3D character models with hand-drawn 2D backgrounds. Seeing the environments come to life is a sight to behold, and the top notch animation flows with impeccable grace and fluidity. If the interaction was removed this could easily pass as an animated movie, something I don't say likely and intend as a great compliment taking into account the great strides animation has made in the last few years. My only ""complaint"" if I have one, is that everything moves at a very slow pace. Doing anything traps you in an animation that you then must watch to completion before being able to interact with anything again. This isn't a huge deal for the most part, but when you are at times required to repeat the same task several times in a row it can become a bit frustrating that there is no way to speed up or skip through an animation. I got used to it after playing for a bit, but it wouldn't have hurt if the world moved just a little bit faster.Clocking in at about 2 hours, Lily Looking Through is a decidedly brief experience but one worth having. I loved every second of being in Lily's world, from the amazing art to the delightful puzzles, right up to the regrettably unsatisfying end. While its simple nature may put off some, it was a pleasantly mellow surprise for me and one I would wholeheartedly recommend for anyone looking for a pleasant game to relax with.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												I do recommend this game, though certainly not for everybody, and probably not at full price. The graphics are adorable (as can be seen in the screenshots), the gameplay functionality uses a simple point-and-click method, and it is completely free of monsters or anything else scary. This, of course, means that it truly is safe to play with the kids if you have any. In addition to this, it has a nice soundtrack and some interesting puzzles. However, it also has some downsides. For one, the game is full of slow-moving cut-scenes, every time you do something, which cannot be skipped. Also, there is absolutely no background or story provided within the game itself (really no dialog or screen text at all, in fact), and not much of a plot, all of which, depending who you are, might or might not bother you. The major downside to this is that there is also no real explanation given of what you are meant to accomplish in any given puzzle, and several are far from clear just from looking at them. Therefore, there is a lot of either randomly doing things until something happens that works to solve the puzzle, or else seeking an explanation online or in the forums of what your final goal in a puzzle is meant to be. It is also quite short, has little replayability in practical terms, and has an ending that is a bit abrupt. That being said however, with the exception of a couple more tedious puzzles, I truly did enjoy playing it most of the time. So, if you're into cute point-and click adventures, and have a certain amount of patience, then this might well be a good choice for you. I would advise watching for it to be on sale or part of a bundle though, as there simply aren't enough hours of gameplay here for me to be able to recommend it as a good buy at full price.			"

												Lilly Looking Through is a minimalist point-and-click adventure game about a girl named Lilly who goes to save her little brother Row from a mysterious magical scarf with the help of mysterious magical goggles. Going from one beautifully-painted environment to the next, the challenge comes from figuring out the functions of Lilly's surroundings and how to use them to proceed. The main gimmick of the game is the ability to shift between two distinct versions of an area via aforementioned goggles to either bypass obstacles or manipulate one to alter the other; the game's description states that this is supposed to represent looking into the past to change the present, though that information doesn't explicitly come up in the game itself, nor is anything else in the game really expounded upon. In short, think of a cross between an Amanita Design title (Machinarium) and Chrono Trigger.Unfortunately, while the game is pleasing to look at and the sound design is equally soothing, the game suffers from a lack of polish and repetition, which is quite surprising for a game that clocks in at just under two hours. One of the first things I noticed about the game is that the character animations are slow and appear to run at around 12 frames per second. These are apparently not skippable, so every time I took an action I would have to wait around 10 seconds before I could continue, which was incredibly tedious whenever I made a mistake. Worse yet, quite a few of the puzzles follow a similar pattern of moving something to the right position by using the same switch over and over and watching the same animation again and again; this is not problem solving, this is busywork.Additionally, the game is not as enchanting and wondrous as it probably wishes it were. In a story seldom told with words, it is usually up to expressive animation to give characterization to the cast, but for the most part Lilly reacts to her journey with dull bemusement, if even that. Lilly's world, pretty as it may be, is quite lifeless as well. There are some neat locations, but they don't feel like an actual setting as opposed to a string of set pieces. There are some animals here and there, but they don't really do anything delightful or engaging. To say the least, if you're looking for a ""charming"" game, Lilly Looking Through will not suffice.Last of all, while the game would have at least been conclusive by ending with Lilly rescuing her brother, it extends a bit past that, introduces a character as some sort of plot twist, and then finishes on a gigantic cliffhanger both confusing and unsatisfying. To reiterate, none of this is explained, and the ""ultimate mystery"" mentioned in the game's description is never actually touched upon. It leaves the impression that the developers had an entire second half of the game planned that they just did not have the resources for.It's quite a shame, as the juxtaposition between the pristine past and the derelict present implies a far more complex history to the world of Lilly Looking Through than meets the eye, and I do still want to see what happens next. Perhaps if a sequel is released this game will retroactively become better than it currently is, but for now it's nothing more than a few screens of lovely scenery.			"

												You are Lilly, the first legally blind female to serve in the elite U.S. Navy SEALs. Guide your team through harrowing door-to-door urban combat and clear booby-trapped cave complexes across three different Middle Eastern countries that have been badly fictionalized by risk-averse developers. Wield your white cane and an awesome array of realistically-modeled weaponry (including the H&K® G36, the FN SCAR®-H and the Magnum Research® Desert Eagle) for a true Tier One experience. Lilly Looking Through is a touching story of honor, loss and redemption that has been hailed as ""the best PTSD simulator since that level in Painkiller with the straitjacketed electroshock guys"" (Game Informer), ""a rollicking good time for the entire family"" (IGN) and ""a patriarchal, racist oppression of the disenfranchised minority diaspora"" (Kotaku).

												Quick, simple and still clever, not to mention quite pretty!This little adventure game utilizes some great ideas without getting too gimmicky. The games' strong point is the atmosphere that the developers have created with the music score and the art style. It lacks a bit on the interactivity side, as the game kind of leads you forward without the gamer actually having to scroll through the inventory (of which there is none) trying every kind of concieveable combo... ;)Although some might say that the game is too easy and short, I think that it's these two things combined that makes for a relaxing and enjoyable game. If the game was too hard, there wouldn't get to be a sense of accomplishment because of the shortness of the game. If the game would have been too long, it couldn't have kept the players interest in it.The game is not perfect, and a bit short compared to the price, but I would recommend it heartily when it is on sale!

												The main problems I found with the game were:1. Animations take WAY too long. You can't skip them with SPACEBAR or ESCAPE, unlike in the Deponia series.2. Price vs length. For such a short game (3 hours), I absolutely cannot justify the price of 7 GBP.3. Opacity of puzzles. A number of puzzles, particularly the colour puzzles, are very unclear in terms of what one needs to do.

												The atmosphere of Lilly is very comforting - it's a nice place to be. The puzzles work well, the soundtrack is a delight, the visuals are fascinating, overall it's an incredibly pleasant environment to be immersed in. The pace could be called slow (moving around takes time, just like reality), and it can be finished in a few hours if you are in a rush.If you enjoy the atmosphere of a game, and you want to relax at night after a draining day at work but still be involved & engage with a game & the world it presents, Lilly is a fine place to be. This sort of quality work should be encouraged.			"

												It’s a different take on point and click adventure games but fails to live up to anything substantial. Story:Is there a story? Despite finishing the game, I’m really not sure at all. All I know is that you are a girl named Lilly who is searching for her brother who got kidnapped by a red cloth…. It’s kind of vague. I feel like there is supposed to be an underlying story by the fact that the ending hints at something but it’s literally a 3 second animation/dialogue so eh. Practically speaking, non-existent. AND IT ENDS ON A CLIFF HANGER.Gameplay:It’s a twist on an adventure game. You don’t move the character by clicking on certain spots like in most adventure games but instead click on predetermined spots to move there/do something there. It’s a system that helps newcomers learn the basics and allows for a good hint menu but the problem is that there is no way to interact with the environment and learn more. I can’t learn the backstory about the other kid. I can’t talk to him, I don’t even know who I am. There is no narrative and thus, the world seems kind of dead. This is a damn shame because the world is beautifully crafted but utterly wasted. The second gimmick is that you can switch between the future and the past. This allows for some interesting puzzles where you can (for example) create paths by moving where to plant an acorn. Those puzzles are nice but there are about 3-4 puzzles that use this gimmick at all before the game takes it away. I thought this would be the central element but overall, I didn’t understand the point of it and it seemed wasted.The puzzles themselves followed some bizarre logic. The tree puzzle mentioned earlier made sense and was logical in its steps but later puzzles had you do color manipulation but you had to figure out what all of the buttons did and what the end goal was. It was adventure game logic to an amazingly bad degree and it completely killed any motivation I had to actually get into the puzzles. They were contrived as hell. Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)The game is beautiful and looks like each scene was hand crafted but it chugs. Yes it’s pretty but not that pretty. The frame rate goes between 30-50 but I don’t know why. There isn’t an options menu where I can change my resolution so I had a weird scaled version that looked slightly off. The background music is pretty but the voice acting is extremely poor and I could barely hear it. Final Thoughts:This seems like a proof of concept game. A place where people can try out making a game and seeing what works. Each area mentioned above shows promise but the execution is off. Play it if you really having nothing else to do but otherwise, it’s a pass "

												Lilly Looking Through is a point and click atmospheric puzzle and (somewhat) adventure game. I’m a bit reluctant to call it an adventure game as the game itself has little to no story.Now the artwork from screen to screen is adorable, beautiful even, the animation is great, however they can become a little bit out-drawn at times. The music on the other hand is simply stunning and ads a lot of mystery and whimsicality to the game.When it comes to the puzzles, I had a hard time figuring out what I was supposed to do every once in a while, but at the same time I liked the challenge of solving them. As you often have to think outside of the box. I particularly liked the use of Lilly’s (or Lilly’s brother’s) goggles.The characters don’t have any particular background story, which is a bit disappointing, but it is understandable, when you take into account the time you use to play through the game. Speaking of time. As the game is relatively short, I expected a closed ending at the least, but alas, that did not happen. The choice of ending confused me and made me think: “That’s the ending? That’s it?” The open ending made me think they’re planning a follow-up to this game, but in all honesty, if the next game is the same length as this one, I very much doubt I’ll buy it. The way the ending looked, it seemed that this is just ½ of a whole game. The latter is just speculation on my part though.In the end, this is just an experience game made to set a mood and impression. Don’t get me wrong. By describing this is as just an experience game, I want to express that those wanting to play this game, and expect a plot and a story on the same level as the art, animation and sound will most likely be disappointed. Most of the short playtime is made up of puzzles that, once figured out are very easily solved the second time around.  Seeing as it's both short and without a story, all you’re really left with is a short time with a feeling of whimsy that's mostly filled by puzzles made somewhat tedious due to slow animations between motions.When it comes to the price, I think that 9€ is a reasonable price for a game like this. I’ve seen games far worse than this going for a lot more, but I don’t think I’d go as far as paying extra for the “deluxe edition”.Overall, I’d say this is a good game. What I’ve enjoyed the most in this game would be the underwater puzzles/ cave puzzle. Again, I really love the art, the music and last, but not least the puzzles plus the use of the goggles in the game. It definitely is worth a play-trough, but that is about it. As much as I’d love to recommend buying this game, I still feel something is lacking before you could actually say that it is a 100% finished product. I’d say the game is entitled to get ½ cookie out of 1 whole cookie :)			"

												I was drawn into Lilly's world by the beautiful surroundings and the adorable visuals. Some of the puzzles were interesting and made sense, however, some were nonsensical and it was pure luck that I 'figured' them out. I 'finished' the game after 119 minutes only and was left very disappointed with the ending, or lack thereof. I love a game with a good storyline and this was not it. Glad I only paid $1.49 during the sale or I'd be even more disappointed.			"

												Quick, simple and still clever, not to mention quite pretty!This little adventure game utilizes some great ideas without getting too gimmicky. The games' strong point is the atmosphere that the developers have created with the music score and the art style. It lacks a bit on the interactivity side, as the game kind of leads you forward without the gamer actually having to scroll through the inventory (of which there is none) trying every kind of concieveable combo... ;)Although some might say that the game is too easy and short, I think that it's these two things combined that makes for a relaxing and enjoyable game. If the game was too hard, there wouldn't get to be a sense of accomplishment because of the shortness of the game. If the game would have been too long, it couldn't have kept the players interest in it.The game is not perfect, and a bit short compared to the price, but I would recommend it heartily when it is on sale!

												The main problems I found with the game were:1. Animations take WAY too long. You can't skip them with SPACEBAR or ESCAPE, unlike in the Deponia series.2. Price vs length. For such a short game (3 hours), I absolutely cannot justify the price of 7 GBP.3. Opacity of puzzles. A number of puzzles, particularly the colour puzzles, are very unclear in terms of what one needs to do. Especially when combined with point 1, it makes the game far longer than it should (without the excessive amounts of animation, I think this game would only be ~1.5hrs of gameplay).4. The story just ends abruptly. It feels as if the game was barely started before it was slapped onto Steam.All in all, it may look good (which is more than I can say for May's Mysteries: The Secret of Dragonville), but looking past the eye candy, it's an insufferable experience that will leave you feeling very unsatisfied (and with buyer's remorse).

												Lilly Looking Through is a point n' click game, with a beautiful artstyle, and simple enough mechanics to dodge most of the genre's common problems.   You play as Lilly, trying to save your brother, Row. The game ends in a sort of cliffhanger (after 2 hours only), so the plot was very minimal here, and it's a bit of a hard sell for the 10$ they're asking. However, I think the game is competent enough at what it does, even if it doesn't do a lot.   Without the shadow of a doubt, the game's highlight is its Presentation. Everything has been hand-drawn and animated, and the result is gorgeous, in my opinion. It's the game that warrants a relaxing playthrough, taking the time to appreciate the backgrounds instead of just solving the puzzles.   Each area is distinct from the others, and has 2 planes (one in the past, one in the present). The present is usually a ruined version of the past's splendour, but both are pretty in their own way.   If the game was more fluid (I'm not even sure it reached 30fps), it could have been of the quality of a simple tv animation. It's pretty good.   The music was also very good, although not as striking, I think would be a good way to describe it. It's very soothing, ambience music. A good aspect, though, is how there are 2 tracks: 1 for each plane. The present usually had a more ""beaten"" sound, with an acoustic guitar, while the past was more majestic and epic, with the use of strings. Of course, this is a gross simplification, but it's enough to give you an idea.   I went well with the game.   The sound effects, on the other hand, were a bit too aggressive, I feel. Not always, but sometimes.   Here are my problems regarding the artstyle and animation:   The backgrounds are a bit too blurry (although the problem seemed to disappear after a while -- maybe I got used to it), and the characters had a different style to it, feeling a bit detached. The characters were very clean colored (barely had shadows, for example), while the backgrounds were significantly more complex. It's not horrible, but it didn't feel quite right at the start of the game.    Other than that, the problem is that the animations were a bit too slow, and unskippable. While it is pretty to look at, some puzzles require experimentation, and it takes a bit too long with these stretched animations. The game is only 2 hours long, so I can't say it's a huge problem, but it would certainly be, with more complex puzzles.    Now, let's talk about mechanics.   As I said, the game is very simple. For instance, there is no inventory, or object carrying. If you every need to use an object, you simply click on it (from the ground), and then click on what you're supposed to. There's no Examine/Give/Use function or anything like that. It's very straightforward, and makes the puzzles self contained.   If you're a fan of the point n' click genre, you may not like this. If you're not, then this is probably good!   The game's main mechanic, is a pair of Goggles. By using them, you see the past plane. It's not a well explored mechanic, but it's used, and it's nicely so. For example, you plant an acorn in the past, and in the future there's a tree. There are other uses, but I think this exemplifies it well enough.   But yes, most of the game revolves around this. You change planes to surpass most of the obstacles. There is also a lot of color puzzles in the last few puzzles. The puzzles are generally fairly easy, so there's no need for the game to teach concepts to the player.   Again, it is a very simple game. You mostly play it for the imagery, I would imagine. And it's relaxing, if you're into that.There's no plot, no complex puzzles (although they're not achieved at first try, for the most part)... It seems a bit lacking, overall. It's a beautiful game, but it's very limited at what it does.   So, be aware of what you're buying. In my opinion, it's a well put experience, for what it is. Perhaps a bit too expensive, but I try to keep that out of the equation.   I would recommend it if you're interested after reading this, you shouldn't be disappointed, unless you're expecting a decently sized game. It seems more of a prototype than a full game, but for that, it's not bad.--------------   There isn't much to take from this, but I'll try to think a bit more about it.This is not actually part of the review itself, more of an outside the box analysis, trying to figure out what more there could be (or something that a game simply missed on its mark.   As I said, there's barely any mechanics to actually learn, or plot to follow. This means that it's almost looking at paintings. Well, almost...   There seems to be a huge blank spot waiting to be filled, here. The fact that it's so simple, leaves a lot of space for other content to be presented. When you can simply lay back and appreciate the atmosphere, it has the power to be a bit more than just atmosphere. Carry some ideals, maybe represent an era, something along those lines.   The point here is that games can sometimes try to build an heavy world and characters that can get overlooked when the player has to learn complex mechanics, or is simply distracted by fast paced combat. It's up to these simpler games to present that rich world, even if just in a very artistic manner, rather than preaching something.   Lilly Looking Through doesn't take any advantage of that, but I believe it has the right pacing to do. Thinking outside the gaming industry, movies like Spirited Away, Angel's Egg, Fantastic Planet, The Secret of Kells, Kino's Journey etc. carry a bit of that, in my opinion. It's not about teaching the player about something in particular, but perhaps shed light on things from a different perspective, and provide food for thought in a more artistic way.    This is me rambling, but I think it's a good exercise, if nothing else. Something useful may occur to me, one of these days, haha!			"

												Pros: Beautiful visuals, great concept.Cons: Execution, mechanicsI really want to like this game, it looks great, some of the game concept are interesting (The goggle thing which transports you between two worlds).But unfortunately it is a game about frustration, and not exploration. The first thing that will frustrate you is the animation speed. It’s so slow. I have eaten dinner, having a bite between each click while waiting for the animation to finish.The second things, is the fact that the puzzles are arbitrary. It’s a matter of pure guess work. There’s no indication of what the game wants us to do. You need to press buttons in a certain sequence, which has no meaning. The hint option is completely useless – often pointing at objects I can’t interact with yet because I haven’t solved the previous puzzle.The more pieces a puzzle has, the more frustrating it is. One has a total of 6 pieces (3, each having 2 settings), which you have to arrange in a certain way and interact with in a certain order, to get a completely random colour result. You don’t even know when you solved the puzzle – because you have to go to a different map and interact with a different puzzle to see if your colour was the right one.The game mechanic rules change on the fly with no indication that it happens. You can’t click on anything during animation. But on one occasion you can and have to, in a certain timing.While this game is short, I wouldn’t recommend for anyone to spend their 2 hours on it. There are many point and click games which are better than this.It feels like someone’s first attempt at a game, who doesn’t yet understand game concepts to make it any good.			"

												A game that looks to be for children but has too very tedious puzzles. The developers laid a lot of emphasis on animating lilly beatifully but they seem to have skimped on the framerate of the animations themselves thereby losing a lot of the intent. And the animations are very very slow and every action takes what seems like ages. Combine this with the fact that most of the puzzles require experimentation (repetitive pressing lots of buttons), the game quickly bores and becomes a chore. But it did make me smile in places but I still won't be able to recommend this boring game. It is not for adults nor is it for kids.			"

												I decided to play Lilly Looking Through to relax after finishing the intense The Wolf Among Us. Instead of relaxing me, this game really irritated me. It's one of those adventure games in which you have to click on random items without knowing what they are or what their effect will be and try different senseless combinations of random click, click, clicking to move on to the next map. There's no hint as to what you're even striving for. There's no logic to it, no visual clues, no audio clues, nothing to make you feel like you actually figured a puzzle out.It's not fun. It's not stimulating or rewarding mentally, emotionally, or visually. It looks ""cute"", and it's made by an indie developer, but that will never be enough reason to recommend a game. A game should stand on its merits, not given a ""pass"" just because it's indie. There are too many amazing games out there, don't bother with this one. "

												Although this is very pretty with nice music and an interesting mechanic, it's way too short and you can't ""finish"" the game: when you reach the end, it's not really the end... But there's no such thing as ""Lilly Looking Through 2"" and even if there was, I don't agree that they should've left the story hanging like that. They should have finished THIS story at least, and then begin a new one in a cut scene or something.Also, animations are very detailed, but they can get (cross that, WILL get) annoying when you need to watch them over and over slowly play out again and again to solve a puzzle.As for the puzzles, most of them don't really make much sense, it's more of a trial and error until you sort of understand what's going on for that puzzle. This + the lack of an ending makes me not recommend this game.			"

												This game was visually beautiful and have some interesting puzzles. I loved the settings, the characters and the main mechanic of the game. The game is divided into scenes and most of the time your interactions are limited to where you stand so you will always have an idea of what to do even though the puzzles are presented without explanation. On the other hand this game is VERY short. I was glad I waited for a sale to get it. Also if you don't like games without an ending steer clear from this one.I will not go as far as not recommend the game because I enjoyed the journey, but I would not hide the fact that it left me with a little sour feeling because of the way it ended.If you are think it of getting it, do as I did, and wait for a sale.

												Cute little game that plays a bit like an Amanita title (see Samarost2) and is kid-friendly.  Nothing to read, no violence, and most of the puzzles allow you to see the consequences of your actions all on one screen, although it's not super easy and the hardest puzzle set covers multiple screens.  It is short though, like 2.5 hours.  There are maybe 10 beautiful scenes with a puzzle or two each, mostly figuring out how machines work so you can progress.  Many of the puzzles use a unique device (the goggles she looks through) to see the scene two different ways in order to solve puzzles.  My biggest criticism is that I see no real reason to play it again.			"

The graphics are really well done with a polished, slightly haunting soundtrack.  The puzzles are interesting if only made a bit irritating by the repetition in places and not helped by the slow character animations (that are lovely to watch elsewhere).			"

On the downside, the game play can get tedious as you can't skip repeated animations which can often take quite a few seconds to play out, and if you're coloured blind, then don't even bother.

This may be a virtue if you're prone to nostalgia.But more importantly, this is a game that interacts with the player. The level design is such that the world seems to want you to play with it, and increasing challenges tease you to unlock the secrets of the goggles with impressively little propmting. Lilly Looking Through will be your best friend if you let it.Also Lilly herself is the most athletic point-and-click adventure game hero ever, and you will love her by the 10 minute mark.			"

												While beautiful and well animated, it lacks a very important game factor - fun.I tried playing this with my kids, but they got bored to tears, and I can't blame them.Lilly moves slowly, most puzzles involve repetitive tasks (which are again animated, slowly).The absence of a 'skip this animation as I have already watched it 100 times and you're just doing this for padding' is the final nail in the coffin.The game is short, 10 levels and it's over, but it felt longer and that's a bad sign, In the end, nice animations don't compensate for the lack of fun, and while there are good puzzles here and there they are few and far in between.Oh, and it ends in a sort of cliffhanger, but I was so happy to see it end I didn't care...I got this in a bundle, so I do not feel cheated, but this game is so pretty it saddens me that it is so bad.If you must play - wait for a 75% off or more deal (or wait till it is in another bundle)			"

												This game makes me wish there was a ""maybe"" option rather than simply yes or no to recommend.Although I adored the demo and really wanted the full game, I have to say that I don't feel it's worth the money - it has an extremely disappointing 'ending', if you can call it that.While the game is - as many other reviewers have said - very short, that isn't always a bad thing if the game itself is a good one.  Lilly Looking Through is absolutely charming: beautiful to look at, completely non-violent (very suitable for children, although they may need help with the puzzles), includes an interesting mechanic with the goggles which should have been used more often, and has some scenes/events which are both lovely and a bit melancholy.  A couple of the puzzles (especially the colour-based ones) were frustrating because there seemed to be no clue what was required, but the majority of them were fun and not too challenging if you put a bit of thought into them and used what was available to you.I could forgive the price and the length of the game if it had some kind of resolution at the end, but it has nothing.  There's sort of a hint, during the last 'chapter', that there'll be something more - perhaps the ""unlocking the ultimate mystery"" mentioned in the developer's description - but the ending is so abrupt and unexpected that it was a real let down.  Since people have been commenting on this even in the developer's own community discussion for at least a year and nothing seems to have changed, it looks like this 'ending' is all we'll get.I waited months for a sale and never saw this reduced, so I eventually received it as a birthday gift.  Having finished it in less than 3 hours (my playtime includes the game being left running while I did other things) and been left feeling very let down, I can't help but feel sorry that my purchaser paid full price for the game!In conclusion, then, I guess I can say I cautiously recommend this if you like the game's look and feel.  If you enjoy the demo, you'll likely enjoy the majority of the game - just be prepared for the fact that you'll be left hanging at the end with no resolution, and try to get it on sale if you can! "

												I will start by saying that this game is very pretty. The art is well drawn. The music is also well composed and pretty. Very atomospheric and calming. That is the good part of this game.Now for the bad part. Firstly, the puzzles are not very fun. Some of them, especially the color matching ones are not very intuitive. The fact that you have to watch her move each crank or lever just to test and experiment with what each crank does make it worse. Half of the puzzles consisted of me reading something else, while waiting for the animation to be over. If you misclick, then it makes it even worse.Secondly, as mentioned before, don't misclick. It is so easy to misclick in this game. It is made worse when you accidentally zoom in while clicking a lever. Since you are zoomed in, you can't even see what pulling the lever did. It was pretty disorienting.Both of these problems wouldn't even be that bad if it wasn't for the fact the game feels incomplete. It ends on a rather abrupt cliffhanger without closure, leaving me more confused than ever. Combined with how short the game is, I really think that this game was released early because the developers overreached and fell short.Overall, this game is nice, but it is NOT worth 10 bucks. Wait for a very good sale or for it to be in a bundle before buying. Too short for the game to be worth it otherwise, unless you really like point and clicks.			"

												A sweet little point and click that is cut way too short in a poor attempt to line up a sequel...or something. As it's been over two years since the first came out, and without even a hint of anything going on over at Geeta Games, you can safely assume what you see is what you'll probably get, and it's frankly debatable if it was worth it or not. A game that practically demands Steam to put a ""Maybe"" button for reviews.At max, LLT is about 3 hours long. It's a cute game for sure, and it has a wonderful little art style to blend the world together, and a nice gimmick that echoes of childhood stories and dreams. The puzzles make use of this dual perspecive and offer an organic feel that few point and clicks achieve. While none of them hit that sweet spot of puzzle solving, they do present a fair challenge near the end, although it often comes down to trial and error.The story mirrors the childlike persona, and with a wordless presentation of the story, it holds a youthful feeling of adventure as you see the old and new. There's an extremely small twist in the story, but other than that, it's very run of the mill, although its heart is in the right place.Where it gets rocky is when even if you struggle every step of the way, you have a game that is barely 4 hours long and no satisfaction to show for it. For 10 dollars, that's a debatable price. If this were pitched as an episodic series, maybe. If this were a finished product, and it had an actual ending, I'd say go for it. However, as a game that was clearly pushed out the door with no resolution and probably will never recieve any, don't waste your money. It's a great unfinished product, but for something that may never be concluded, it may be worth steering clear of until a sale or a bundle.The only thing worse than wasted potential is seeing potential half-fulfilled. God it makes me bitter.			"

												Despite enjoying my couple of hours with this game, I'm going to have to downvote it, especially at the retail price. Not only is it a very brief adventure game, but the ending of the story is no ending at all.  I bought it in a bundle for a dollar along with three other games, so I paid a quarter for it, and I'm still not sure I don't feel a bit overcharged for what would make a lovely free browser based game.  If you like point-and-click, get it with the understanding that and at the price where it will be worth about 2-3 hours of your time.			"

												Great indie point and click short adventure. The art looked nice and the gameplay idea behind it were simple and minimalistic. The story was short and left a lot to the player's imagination.The music was in touch with each scene, and there was some short voice acting.An issue I had with this was the slowness at which everything moved. This was especially fustrating when taking the wrong direction in a puzzle, or misclicking an action. A great feature that other P&Click adventures have is where you can doubleclick to force the animation to complete earlier. Overall, for an indie game, 7/10. It's nothing spectacular and you can finish this game within an hour.			"

												This recommendation comes with a caveat:The game's story isn't particularly satisfying, nor does it really have much of a presence throughout the game.With that out of the way, though, it's a fun little pointy-and-clicky adventure game with interesting environments and cute characters. Some of the puzzles can be pretty tricky (especially the ones that involve adding and subtracting color, which can also be a dealbreaker for people with color blindness), but solving them is really satisfying.Lastly, the game is rather short. If you have a look at the scene browser screen as you start progressing through the game you'll quickly get a sense of how much you have left. Personally, I finished in just under 2 hours.It doesn't really have any particular replay value, unless you simply want to do the puzzles again or revisit the vistas, but it was an enjoyable little experience.

												Fun little point & click puzzle game with level swapping. Most areas come with a past and present layout, and as such changes in the past change the future. A few things to keep in mind:around 2 hours of gameplay, so I wouldn't recommend it at full price. This game has cards, but with the steam refund system, you'll likely see the first drop at the end of the game. Most puzzles are straightforward, but a few require a bit of trial and error to first solve. This is especially true for the color puzzles near the end. The game is very linear, you're pretty much guided from one puzzle to the next.A lot of language support, along with handholding, this looks very much like a childrens game. "

												Finally finished with Lilly, and it felt like little i could have played it for hours and hours, the puzzles are really interesting i wish the colour changes made a little more sense tho, they seem a bit too hard for kids, but great to do with them, since Lilly and her little brother are very relatable. The wow factor when you first put the googles on is really suprising the double setting from them that later makes sense is the second wow moment of the game (not spoiling it guys) and opens a huge amount of possibilities for further gameplay, i hope a big company pics up this team and let´s them further develop this original idea into a even better sequel.The only things i didn´t like was the lack of consistency between puzzles and the puzzle mechanic in some spots that didn´t seem very intiutive, but this is an indie and i can certainly ignore that for a first draft of a concept that has so much potential. This game is a little gem and makes me anxious waiting for a sequel. "

Not ended, there wasn't really an ending, it just stopped.The worst part for me was how slow it was. Animations are slow, loading is slow. A few puzzles near the end require you to go through a large number of steps to complete the goal and each one takes forever. I can't recommend this.			"

												If this game had faster animations, it would last 10 minutes, which speaks for both how short it is, and how unbearably slow the animations are. The art is really pretty, although somewhat low resolution, but all in all, just not worth the $9, far from it.			"

												A calm, charming, quick little game with neat puzzles and an engaging atmosphere. A couple puzzles toward the end are a bit out there, and being able to skip (or fast forward) animations you've already seen would've been appreciated, but honestly there are worse things you could be playing. Basically, if you like puzzles, delightful environments, or games that don't overstay their welcome, this is a game worth checking out.			"

												I bought this game due to hearing about it through my grandparents. My grandparents told me that my fathers cousin was the head designer of the game alongside his wife and i had to instantly grab the game when it came up to play something that my family had created. And i for one absoluetly adored this game. The colors were great, the backgrounds were great, the main characters were easily lovable and fun to play along with, and the music was a perfect fit for the relaxing style of the game. To anyone considering to pick up this game i would recommend it for all people who are looking for a good button click search game. The fact that no talking is even used in this game is great as well allowing for people of all languages to enjoy this game as much as the next group. I am proud to say that the people who designed this game our in my family and I will always tell others to try out this game if they want to have a fun and relaxing game to play.			"

												I quite liked this. It was slow, but then again, this isn't a game that is supposed to be played fast. Anyone who argues that the game is tedious should go back to the explosive action that is hour long dota matches.The game is nice to look at, and the environments vary very nicely, especially when given the goggles that allow Lilly to switch between two points in time, making each section of the game unique. Lilly herself is a very adventurous heroine that isn't afraid to do dangerous jumps, or scale walls, as she climbs and runs through the world. Puzzles are fairly easy and make sense, but even the hint system doesn't help in a few sections. You just need to use your noggin.The later parts of the game involve light puzzles, which, with a little bit of trial and error, are easily solved. There's like 4 combinations, its not very hard.I wasn't a terrible fan of the ending, as it wasn't really a conclusion at all, but it doesn't detract that the rest of the game was fun, if not a little vague in the plot department.

Because its not long enough and at the end you see there is more to come ( dlc or episodic system ). Try to buy it with a bundle. Looking forward to see more episodes.Yaratıcı ve renkli bir macera oyunu. Size keyifli iki saat yaşatacağı kesin. Fakat tek başına 9.99 biraz fazla gibi geldi.

												*Gnome Seal of Approval*Cute little point and click adventure game. You play as Lilly and try to save your little brother as he is swept away with the wind. You navigate through the world and solve puzzles with the help of some enchanted glasses that transport you back and forth to an alternate time or reality. It is a fairly short game and I failed to see the logic in some of the puzzles. It's not hard though. Chances are you'll get through it after a couple of hours. Cute and nicely animated.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this casual point-and-click game with a caveat that I'll mention later.  This is clearly the first chapter in a series based on how the game ended.  It's short (you can win in less than 3 hours), but it's visually gorgeous and the atmospheric music is a perfect compliment. The idea of goggles to change the past in order to affect the present is rather novel, and I loved the way that I could immediately see the result of something that I had done in the past.  For the most part, solutions for each section are on a single screen - there is no invintory system at all. Those sections where you have to go between screen use at most three or four screens in that area. My only caveat is that get ready for a few puzzles that make absolutely no sense, particularly those puzzles involving color. I found one in particular to be absolutely frustrating because there's no logic to it. You basically have to keep guessing about how to change the colors of a particular section until you happen to get the right one. There was no rhyme or reason, which is infuriating when the rest of the game has puzzles that make a logical progression to solve that section. It's as though the color sections were thrown in just for the sake of throwing them in. Make sure YouTube is ready to help you with these section.That said, the color levels are slight bumps in what is overall a very smooth and enchanting journey. I definitely recommend it and I look forward to the next installment. I just hope that there are no color puzzles - unless they actually make sense.			"

												The graphics, animation and story were cute.However several puzzle elements require some trial and error just to figure how you're supposed to use them as their operation is not being clearly visible and some of the results are not always logical.That would be alright if every single action didn't take so long to be completed. The characters will often hesitate or sway while they move which is nice and realistic. I enjoyed those animations the first time they were played, but seeing the same slow one played over and over ruined the pleasure of solving many puzzles. Waiting instead of actually playing is not fun.I wish there was a way to skip animations or play a faster one after you've seen it once.The game is also quite short (10 different screens).Pros:+ Nice graphics and animations+ Nice story and atmosphereNeutral:o Sound and music, ok but not memorableo Puzzles, some were good, some made sense only after being solvedo I first played on an old laptop and the performances were terrible even with the lowest settings (to the point of breaking all animations and being unplayable). It worked fine on my my desktop though. Make sure you are quite above the hardware requirements.Cons:- Pace is way too slow to enjoy solving some of the puzzles- Price (9 €)- Quite short (2-3 hours)Overall, I would recommend it only at a discounted price and if you have enough patience.

												The positive:* LLL has lovely background art and incidental musicThe bad:* It is not a complete story, nothing is hinted at or explained or resolved.* Nothing makes any sense, either as a real place or an imaginary world of symbolism. Many of the set pieces are clearly there for the purpose of a contrived puzzle.* Puzzles rely on a lot of back-and-forth experimentation (trail and error) which, coupled with slow animations, are incredibly frustrating.* Adding to above, several of the later puzzles make no sense, unless I am missing some hidden logic behind the ringing bells.The ugly: How exactly does blue and green result in red?

The puzzles generally focus on performing a small set of actions in the correct logical order before you can progress to the next area. The variety of locations and form of each puzzle keeps it fresh, while the ""children's picture-book"" visual style, and characters are enjoyable.The ending is a cliff-hanger, but the story is enjoyable enough up to that point.

												Lilly is watching her little brother Row when the unthinkable happens, and Lilly must go on an adventure through past and present (or is it present and future) to save him.  Eventually she does.  I had two favorite parts, however.  The first, just after Lilly and Row are reunited, Row, as any rambunctious boy his age would do, runs off, and you can see the aggrieved look on big sister Lilly's face.  The second, Row is once again, running off, and Lilly tells him to wait, and you can hear that same aggravation in her voice.  As an older sister who was often called upon to watch my own little sisters, I could sense exactly what Lilly was feeling then.  A cute, if short, game.			"

												Well I just beat this game and was left completely dumbfounded. It's not that the ending is a letdown, so much as non-existent. The description touts that you'll ""unlock the ultimate mystery"", but don't expect to find out anything about this world other than where the red fabric came from. Instead, expect about two hours of adventure through gorgeous environments with puzzles that are challenging enough to make you stop and think for a while, but not so overly complex that you'll need a walkthrough.What this game offers is excellent, it's just a shame that it doesn't offer more. And I'm not strictly talking about length. Gone Home costs more and lasts only a little longer, but it offers a complete experience so I love and recommend it. Because Lilly feels more like a taste of a greater experience, I can't in good conscience recommend it.			"

The game never get's truly difficult, since all the puzzles are logical and well thought out. All in all, highly recommended for people interested in a laid back, relaxing adventure game. Only drawback for me was the length of the game. I rarely play adventure games (and don't recall ever finishing one before), but even so, I got through this game in a little over 2 hours. Taking the current price (8,99 euro) in consideration: The game is excellent, just not good value for the money (IMHO).			"

												Firstly, this was very almost a ""YES"" vote, however, I had to vote ""NO"" on this game for the following reasons...The game was short, not that I mind short games, but if it wasn;t for teh VERY annoying slow pacing of the animations every time you try and get the girl to do anything this could be finshed in half an hour. The waiting for her to do things is the main reason for the thumbs down I'm afraid... that and the VERY disapointing ending. It just stops, with no end or reason... is this so they can make a 2nd game?? If so, sorry I wont be buying it. On the plus side, very cute graphics and music was beautiful. If you want to play the game for its art style then take a look. If you are looking for a fun game, look elsewhere.			"

Aside from some of the trickier puzzles this game is age appropriate for pretty much anyone. This is the most fun I've had playing a point and click in a long time.			"

												""Lilly Looking Through"" is an adventure/puzzle game in a somewhat minimalistic approach, with a very relaxing and heart warming atmosphere. The presentation of the game is nothing short of magical. The art is beautiful, the music is dreamy and ethereal, and the characters' animations are most exquisite. The kids, Lilly and Row are so cute and animate so well that right from the start it was unbelievably endearing. The game immersed me in a feeling of childhood, with all that innocence, curiosity, cuteness and sense of awe and adventure, like I never have experienced before.Speaking of the actual gameplay, it plays like a point and click puzzle adventure where one needs to figure out how to get past the obstacles of each screen to progress to the next. I can't spoil you, so I'll just say that along the way you pick up an item that not only serves as an excellent, original and creative device for the puzzling itself, but adds to the wonder and magic of the game and its world as well. Some of the puzzles are quite hard to figure out, but the hint system, which highlights items/actions you can click makes sure you're not missing out on where you can click, so you can focus on the puzzles themselves. If you have no patience for this genre (or in general), though, or you can't stand low tempo, relaxed games, I wouldn't recommend it.Despite all that I loved about the game, which was, in a nutshell, that it provided me with a nostalgic reliving of the magical feelings of childhood, the game has some problems. Mainly, it's short, around 2-3 hours long, which is a pity and a little frustrating. Towards the end, the puzzles get a bit repetitive in ""theme"", and their mechanics get a bit more cryptic, thought one can argue that's the point of a puzzle game. But more importantly, and again, without spoiling, the end has little closure and feels more like a cliffhanger than an actual resolution it's surprisingly abrupt and open. Also, it creates the idea that there will be a ""sequel""/continuation, one feels that there should be, that the game/story isn't quite finished.It pains me to give such criticisms to this game, because, in spite of its failings, the it is so magical and endearing that I was really impressed. It was one the most memorable gaming experiences I ever had. I really hope that there will be more and longer ""Lilly"" in the future.			"

												A delightful, yet short, linear puzzle game. Lily Looking Through carries the full weight of an indie game in the art (which is beautiful) and the story (which is slightly confusing, but sweet). The game is very quick, easily completed in one sitting, and features a new take on an old mechanic. Gameplay is relazing, despite the puzzles, and I definitely reccommend it for the casual gamer interested in trying puzzlers. Still, the story is never quite resolved or fully explained, and the game begs for more levels and more challenging uses for the mechanic. Three Stars.			"

Control over the character's position isn't allowed as movement only happens when interacting with objects, at which point the character will move by herself.  There's also panning and zooming which are done by dragging the mouse and double clicking, both similar to dragging and double tapping with the finger.  The tablet-like interaction isn't a detraction though, just an observation.Overall it's an interesting game, but a couple of parts feels a bit off.  The minor one was the lighting inconsistencies.   When moving from a bright lit area to a darker place, the lighting on the ground and background would be different but the character would continue to have the same brightness on her.  This sometimes makes Lilly stand out in the environment more than I expected.  Maybe it's a stylistic choice and maybe it's a bit of nitpicking, but it was one of the first things I noticed. The more major concern was the puzzles near the end where the method to reaching the goal of each scene and the reasons for doing the puzzles becomes more obscure.  Combine it with the trial and error method to discover what the puzzles are and the nice but long character animations, the later puzzles become more of a hassle.  For example, in one scene a bird steals her goggles and perches on top of a structure.  My first thought was to get it back and there was a mechanism nearby to fiddle around with which turned out to have an effect on the structure it's sitting on along with the nearby ones.  Maybe there was a way that I can scare the bird into dropping it if I played around with it.  I spent quite a while toying with it, watching her bounce back and forth between her idling position to her action movements.  Each trial was long to watch, and since I didn't know if this was the correct path, I could only try out the different combinations to see if there were any effects.  As it turns out the solution was to do something else and I only realized that after exhausting the possible combinations, but the mechanism was still needed to get to the next room, so I'm back again adjusting parameters and watching more animations.  The next few puzzles (except for one) after that are more or less the same style, a couple even worse.  For example, there's a mechanism that's clearly to be used to solve a puzzle but the puzzle and the desired solution is unknown.  It would be as if a stranger handed you a pen and blank paper and looked at you.  You know he wants you to do something but because he hasn't said or done anything, you're not sure what it is.  So you're left writing and drawing various things and looking at his reactions before you finally realize what he wants.  Maybe if it was clearer what the puzzles are and what was wanted out of each of them prior to interacting with the mechanisms that dealt with them I wouldn't feel as puffed about it but I felt these issues detracted from the magic the game presents.I would recommend the game on the note that unless you're able to immediately determine what needs to be done to solve the puzzles, you'll most likely be fiddiling around with various combinations while watching Lilly slowly move about.

												A old school style adventure game that is pretty but slow.  It's ok to have slow game play, but normally it will be off set by a good plot.  In the couple hours I played the game there was no plot whatsoever. Things I learned about the game:-Your character's name is Lilly.-There is a boy that gets captured.-You are trying to save the boy.-The boy knows your name.-The boy likes scarves.-The world is more run down than it was in the past.That's it.  The puzzles that I encountered were ok, but nothing amazing.			"

												A calm, charming, quick little game with neat puzzles and an engaging atmosphere. A couple puzzles toward the end are a bit out there, and being able to skip (or fast forward) animations you've already seen would've been appreciated, but honestly there are worse things you could be playing. Basically, if you like puzzles, delightful environments, or games that don't overstay their welcome, this is a game worth checking out.			"

There was times where I was fiddling for quite some time either A) trying to figure out what to do or B) trying to do what I knew had to be done (sometimes it's hard to brain). Others the solution just fell into my lap.If you like a relaxed paced game, beautiful art style, lovely music, and sweet story of caring siblings, this is a game that you would very likely enjoy.

												Firstly, this was very almost a ""YES"" vote, however, I had to vote ""NO"" on this game for the following reasons...The game was short, not that I mind short games, but if it wasn;t for teh VERY annoying slow pacing of the animations every time you try and get the girl to do anything this could be finshed in half an hour. The waiting for her to do things is the main reason for the thumbs down I'm afraid... that and the VERY disapointing ending. It just stops, with no end or reason... is this so they can make a 2nd game?? If so, sorry I wont be buying it. On the plus side, very cute graphics and music was beautiful. If you want to play the game for its art style then take a look. If you are looking for a fun game, look elsewhere.			"

												Finally finished with Lilly, and it felt like little i could have played it for hours and hours, the puzzles are really interesting i wish the colour changes made a little more sense tho, they seem a bit too hard for kids, but great to do with them, since Lilly and her little brother are very relatable. The wow factor when you first put the googles on is really suprising the double setting from them that later makes sense is the second wow moment of the game (not spoiling it guys) and opens a huge amount of possibilities for further gameplay, i hope a big company pics up this team and let´s them further develop this original idea into a even better sequel.The only things i didn´t like was the lack of consistency between puzzles and the puzzle mechanic in some spots that didn´t seem very intiutive, but this is an indie and i can certainly ignore that for a first draft of a concept that has so much potential. This game is a little gem and makes me anxious waiting for a sequel. "

												""Lilly Looking Through"" is an adventure/puzzle game in a somewhat minimalistic approach, with a very relaxing and heart warming atmosphere. The presentation of the game is nothing short of magical. The art is beautiful, the music is dreamy and ethereal, and the characters' animations are most exquisite. The kids, Lilly and Row are so cute and animate so well that right from the start it was unbelievably endearing. The game immersed me in a feeling of childhood, with all that innocence, curiosity, cuteness and sense of awe and adventure, like I never have experienced before.Speaking of the actual gameplay, it plays like a point and click puzzle adventure where one needs to figure out how to get past the obstacles of each screen to progress to the next. I can't spoil you, so I'll just say that along the way you pick up an item that not only serves as an excellent, original and creative device for the puzzling itself, but adds to the wonder and magic of the game and its world as well. Some of the puzzles are quite hard to figure out, but the hint system, which highlights items/actions you can click makes sure you're not missing out on where you can click, so you can focus on the puzzles themselves. If you have no patience for this genre (or in general), though, or you can't stand low tempo, relaxed games, I wouldn't recommend it.Despite all that I loved about the game, which was, in a nutshell, that it provided me with a nostalgic reliving of the magical feelings of childhood, the game has some problems. Mainly, it's short, around 2-3 hours long, which is a pity and a little frustrating. Towards the end, the puzzles get a bit repetitive in ""theme"", and their mechanics get a bit more cryptic, thought one can argue that's the point of a puzzle game. But more importantly, and again, without spoiling, the end has little closure and feels more like a cliffhanger than an actual resolution it's surprisingly abrupt and open. Also, it creates the idea that there will be a ""sequel""/continuation, one feels that there should be, that the game/story isn't quite finished.It pains me to give such criticisms to this game, because, in spite of its failings, the it is so magical and endearing that I was really impressed. It was one the most memorable gaming experiences I ever had. I really hope that there will be more and longer ""Lilly"" in the future.			"

												What little there is of it is good. It's just very short. Beautiful game though. Puzzles really aren't intuitive as you go on, especially the color ones. I used a walkthrough for the whole thing just because I didn't understand what I was supposed to do. The ending really isn't an ending and the game seems unfinished. It's good to play if you get it included in a Humdle Bundle or it's reduced to a few bucks, otherwise not worth the money.			"

												I backed this on kickstarter, and have been very pleased with the result. The game is short, but what there is of it is both beautiful and interesting. The whole game is charming.Unlike many point-and-click puzzle games, this does away with the concept of inventory and is much better for it. No trying all combinations of items, everything you need to solve the puzzle is there on the screen. This results in a focus on timing/ordering type puzzles, but there's still a lot of variety. The time-switch mechanic works well too.I'd definitely recommend this to fans of puzzle games.			"

												A delightful, yet short, linear puzzle game. Lily Looking Through carries the full weight of an indie game in the art (which is beautiful) and the story (which is slightly confusing, but sweet). The game is very quick, easily completed in one sitting, and features a new take on an old mechanic. Gameplay is relazing, despite the puzzles, and I definitely reccommend it for the casual gamer interested in trying puzzlers. Still, the story is never quite resolved or fully explained, and the game begs for more levels and more challenging uses for the mechanic. Three Stars.			"

												This game had 2 major problems that really made it hard for me to enjoy it. The first is the requirement to see every single animation 100x before you are allowed to do a new action. There is no clip to the end of the animation if you click again. This means any puzzle you are stuck on for an extended period of time is greatly enhanced by the sluggish pace of Lilly herself.My second issue is the puzzles themselves. On puzzles I was stuck on it was largely due to the fact it was unclear what you are actually trying to solve. It is annoying to have a secondary aspect of the puzzle being figuring out why you are doing an action or what you are trying to get the machine to accomplish. The hint box isn't always helpful either. Sometimes a blimp on it means you can just move there. Other times it means you can just move there as well as click again to do another action once you are already in the same spot.The game looked really pretty and the puzzles themselves were fun once you understood the goal of them. Maybe I am just bad at puzzle games but i'd like it a lot more if the objectives were more straight forward. I did manage to beat the entire thing while sadly only needing help for one of the first puzzles. "

An endulging and enjoyable Point&Click game for every ageThe game is really easy to control as you basically need just a single mouse button to perform all the actions.The difficulty lies mostly in finding the places you have to interact with and doing so in the correct order.But even if you are not really good in analysing and guessing the game will help you, as there is a hint button highlighting the places you can interact with to further progress.While the game is rather short, as a complete play-through took me less than 2 or 3 hours without using hints, the great atmosphere and the well designed user interaction made it very enjoyable.If you are into casual point&click games, this is definitely worth your time.

												Lilly Looking Through is a sweet, short game that should take you 2-3 hours to complete.  I agree with most of the points raised in the negative reviews, however.  Furthermore, I was chagrined to find that the puzzles in the levels of the demo were more difficult than those later in the game -- as a result, after paying for the full game (which nicely unlocked the rest of the levels and kept my demo progress), I found that the remaining gameplay went by too easily and quickly.  Despite these considerations, I did wholly enjoy LLT for its casual, relaxing experience and recommend it for the following reasons and with the following cautions: Animations:  Lilly, the boy (her brother?), and the creatures are all beautifully animated, and it is a joy to watch the great care that went into their movements.  The animations are reminiscent of the hand drawn Don Bluth style.  Note that if you're generally growing impatient, having to repeat many steps of a puzzle, or in a hurry to wrap up the game, the movements and gestures can turn puzzles into a painful grind, since there is no way to skip through them.  Music and Sound:  The music is gentle and soothing -- a light, synthesized symphonic background that, with the background and action sounds, help with immersion.  Everything is a good fit for the artistic style and game's pace. Mechanics:  This is a slow game.  Lilly doesn't move quickly -- while this shows off the already-mentioned animation care, it becomes laborious in places that you have to repeat actions.  If you need her to pull a lever, you'll need to watch her walk to the lever, get into position, pull the lever, then move away from the lever, and walk back to her starting point.  This happens every time.  The only instance where I saw a mechanics shortcut was in a jumping puzzle:  on Lilly's first jump to a landing point, she kicked up some dust and sneezed.  It was cute, and the sneeze only happened on the first jump.  The game would have benefited from similar and even more ruthless trimming throughout.  Otherwise, because of the game's simplicity, the mechanics are pretty clear in most cases.  Actionable objects have only one (at most, two) options, and the cursor is obvious when searching for trigger areas.  Puzzles:  I did not struggle as much with the puzzles in LLT as I often do with other point-and-click games.  Be aware that, typical for its genre, there will be some solutions that are utterly arbitrary.  As you'll read in other reviews, color plays a big role in this game, and it can be bewildering why a particular color leads to a solution any more than another.  Despite this, the color logic itself is sound:  you'll need to be familiar with basic, additive color theory (e.g., blue + red = purple; therefore purple - blue = red).  I liked that the game is careful to introduce and train the player on these elements before moving into more complicated, multi-step color puzzles.  I found that the ""?"" button for hints was usually enough to get me through the tougher situations.  Story:  I found that the premise and plot are the biggest issues with the game as a cohesive unit.  The Store Page ""About This Game"" summary doesn't give the player much of a lead-in.  We're told, ""Help our heroine through a variety of enchanting environments brimming with magic and wonder, as she seeks to rewrite the past, change the present, and unlock the ultimate mystery.""  However, the game doesn't come close to this description -- you won't ""rewrite the past"" or ""unlock the ultimate mystery,"" and it's important to know this when going into LLT.  The only way this game works from a plot perspective is to take it at face value.  A little girl is looking for a little boy, and she must explore an environment where her magical goggles allow her to slip between and use elements of two universes/planes to ultimately find him.  Then just dive in and don't ask any questions.  A third character is inexplicably introduced in the last stage, and the game ends ABRUPTLY with no resolution.  And like other reviewers, I found this is one of the most abrupt endings I've ever seen.  From a plot perspective, there is absolutely no satisfaction at the conclusion of the game.  The developers took great care to eliminate as much written and spoken text as possible to create a unique gaming experience, but even the smallest paragraph at the beginning and between levels would have gone far to lower confusion and frustration.  In conclusion, the ease and shortness of the levels/puzzles following the demo, the lack of a cohesive story, and the abrupt ending left me feeling mildly disappointed when the credits started rolling.  Overall, however, I had a lot of fun in this game, enjoyed the animations and music, and found that it was a wholly enjoyable way to casually pass a few hours.  I'd be greatly interested in new titles from this development team.  For those reasons, I do recommend LLT -- just be sure to start with the demo to see if this game's style and mechanics click with you.			"

												This game is really fabulous, but don't pay it at full price, because it's very short. I just wish there was an end to the story, as the devs haven't made a sequel...			"

												Ehhhhh.Okay, it's a beautiful game. I mean, really, it's quite stunning. But I hated it. The first two thirds of the game were okay, the last third was excruciating. The color puzzles made no sense to me. And what is up with the ending? I hate the ending!It's really short, and with zero replayability. Took me two hours to beat and it would have taken maybe thirty minutes longer if I hadn't decided, ""Screw this"" and used a walkthrough for the color puzzles (seriously, ♥♥♥♥ those puzzles). Wish I could recommend because it's so gorgeous and using the goggles to get a different view of the land is a great concept, but there simply wasn't enough enjoyment in this game for me to suggest it to others.

												Okay game, disapointed with the ""ending"" if you can call it that. I feel cheated, honestly. I don't know if this is supposed to be episodic, but I'm left with more questions than answers.			"

												A lovely game though way too short. The idea of time shift is not new and was much exploited in other hidden object games. Two actors is also not new, e.g. in ""Brothers - A tale of two sons"" it was used far more actively. So, not a groundbreaker but overall a very entertaining game. Graphics is fine. The interface is a bit annoying until you get accustomed to it, which happens quite fast. Hope for the second part.			"

												This is an 'ok' thumbs up. Good little thing, was hoping for a bit more.This is really charming - graphics, animations, music are all really good. What's wrong here is flow.. Took me 1h45 to to it all, but I'm left with the feeling over half of that was waiting for animations to be done.. Everything could and should have been more tight to proceed at a much snappier pace. During the last few screens, I was literally watching TV after a click waiting for the characters to waaaalk over.. do their thing.. and finally pass the control back to me while I was trying to figure out what it was I was supposed to do with the colored bells..Mechanically it goes from pretty much a tutorial level where I was wondering if this was an interactive story where you just press the only possible thing to make things progress, to an ok adventure game a la Botanicula (ie no inventory) to the last few screens where there's more interlinked elements to the puzzles (where the pacing issue shows it's annoying head as mentionned before).The 'gimmick' of using the goggles to time travel to an ancient version of the screen where changes can affect the present (ie plant an acorn in the past, get a tree in the present) is neat, so I was really surprised to see the game ditch it altogheter just before getting to the end game...!I feel there are fuller, more polished games out there from more experienced teams for the same price point. The story is really thin.. Really, if not for the really great graphics and animations plus the overall charm, it might have been a serious thumbs down.			"

												Only 1 hour of gameplay.... Even with all the crazy waiting for the character animation....The graphics are nice but the game is far too short to be worth $10. (Lucky me I got it in a bundle)All around, I can't say I feel this is a good game to reccomend...			"

												I love this game, it's one of those hint games to solve a puzzle. At first, I thought it was a boring game because of the reviews but I love it. I wish it had a cancel button, to cancel what you are doing; instead of doing it over and over again.PROS:CuteTime-Machine GogglesRescuingHints + cluesCONS:Cannot cancel what you're about to doShort scenes			"

												A charming adventure with bedevilling puzzles, ""Lilly"" left me wondering if Geeta Games might some day produce a sequel.  Sadly, I am still waiting.  The worlds are colorful; the puzzles make use of both sight and sound.  A pleasant diversion.An average play through the game WITHOUT HELP is likely to be about 5-6 hours.  The amount of time I have on record is a little longer because I spent some time livestreaming with friends after completing it the first time.  If you look up the solutions online you may be disappointed with the game's length - part of the joy in game like this is trying to figure things out on your own, savoring in a bit of mental frustration as you try to work out the rules of the world.Some other reviewers have compared Lilly to MYST - which is not an unfair comparison, as it was developed by Steve Hoogendyk (whose past credits included Myst III, realMYST, and Uru) with help from others including Mark DeForest (of Cyan Worlds).

												It has a nice visual style, it's cute and colourfull, and the begining is quite decent even if it uses the tired old mechanics of swapping betwen two worlds, without really doing anything new with it. For the most part are the puzzles fairly easy, but because there really isn't much you can interact with in each scene, the puzzles themselves are quite random and makes little sense. Especially in the second half of it when there are some really contrived puzzles with colour swapping. It's also very short and ends like it's chapter 1 of a much larger story, without and real ending, and even more questions raised. I have no problem with selling games in chapters, but at least tell me so.There are a lot better puzzle games for the price. Not recomended.			"

												Beautiful images and animations.However, you spend most of your time waiting for the animations every single time you click on something. (Which you have to do a lot, because the puzzles are unclear.) The scrolling is also laggy. The very last part of the last level bugged out, so I had to look up the ending.Bad game, good animations.			"

												Yes, I recommend this game. It's a very fun, engaging point-and-click adventure. There isn't a lot of reading. There isn't a lot of talking. The puzzles were mildly challenging at the most. This would be a good game for a younger teen or someone older who wants a bit of relaxing adventure.It WAS short. I'm not usually one to begrudge a game's length but this felt short even to me. They've definitely set it up for a sequel and I will definitely be looking for it.			"

												I love the art I love the atmosphere and more important I played it with my doughter and she was so happy to play it. We will play it again. Most of puzzles were to hard for her but she enjoy it specialy when she managed to solwed it out. Animation is gorgeous. It is realxing type of game that is great to play with children. Do not think it is not for adults I just wish to point out that is billiant to play with kids! Some players said it is to short for them for me it was the right amount of playtime. We love it.			"

												I enjoyed this game, though, honestly I glad it was short. If it were longer I might have uninstalled and not gotten through the whole story. There certainly were some puzzles that were tricky and you just had to experiment. I couldn't see the logic behind the action or result on one particular one.The art style is lovely, however, I agree with a few other reviewers that having to wait for the slow animation behind each interaction can become painful--especially when the character has to walk across the screen.I ended up finishing this one solo since my partner lost interest.

												It is a beautiful and relaxing game. Worth buying! But only if its on a deal, I wouldnt spent more than £10 on it. Simply because its really short and it isnt all that difficult. I wish there was some story to it a well. Even though I did find it quite magical. I hope there will be a second one and this one doesnt actually have an ending...			"
