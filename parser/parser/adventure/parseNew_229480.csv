												The bottom line - Should you buy this game?YES - Especially if you are a fan of oldschool brawlers, and/or you're looking for a fun co-op game to play with friends.Disclaimer: Although it is not required, I highly recommend that you play this game with a controller. This review is based on the experience I had playing with an XB360 controller and a SFIV Tournament Edition Arcade Fightstick.Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara is actually two games in one. Both are excellent remakes of the old arcade games D&D: Tower of Doom (1993) and D&D: Shadow over Mystara (1996). The story of the games overlap - Shadow over Mystara begins shortly after the end of Tower of Doom's campaign - but they can be played in any order. The game has you (and up to three of your friends) play as a noble team of adventurers on a grand adventure through the land of Mystara, a classic fantasy realm populated by elves, goblins, kobolds and fearsome dragons.PROS: - One of the best options out there for anyone that enjoys oldschool brawlers/beat 'em ups. - Very faithful port, and runs well. Spectacular visuals that hold up even today.- Several different display options; scanlines, different views, etc. Including a view of the entire ""cabinet.""- Online and couch co-op for up to four players, drop in and out at any time.- Visual design is great, and soundtrack does a good job of immersing you in the game.- Stays true to the original D&D feeling; the game features spell slots as well as loot in the form of new armour and equipment for your character.- Limited character customisation and progression: Choose from classic D&D staples like Elf, Thief, Fighter, Cleric, and Magic User. Gain levels and grow stronger as you journey on.- The second game (Shadow over Mystara) features a more complex spell and equipment system. There are many types of weapons and equipment to find that change the way you play and deal with enemies (e.g. shields that enable you to block attacks that would otherwise be unblockable).- Branching storylines (Do you rush to the defence of the castle yourself, or do you seek help from the soldiers in the city? etc), and many optional areas. Lots of secrets to find.- An unexpectedly deep combat system for an oldschool brawler. Each character feels very different, and you'll have no trouble finding one that suits you. There are double jumps, dodge rolls, dashes, shield blocks, aerial maneuvers, attack combos and more to find and experiment with.- Very clear and accessible menus. No troubles getting things up and running.- Lots of challenges to clear, such as defeating enemies or using certain spells and attacks.- Tons of extras to unlock, including houserules (e.g. higher gold gain, or no respawning).CONS:- These games were originally coin-op style arcade titles, where you insert more coins to get back into the game when you die. This means the game is designed to be lethal in order to hook the player. Until you get a good grasp of the mechanics, you will die. A lot. Capcom has opted to go with a more lenient approach in the remake, giving you infinite credits (there is a House Rule that lets you play on a single credit). Although this is a good thing for those that want to have a casual experience with friends, it also means that you can blaze through the entire game without stopping as you have infinite continues. This also means that there is no real reward for doing ""well"" (although there are difficulty levels that determine the HP and possibly amount of enemies).- Game is based on arcade stick controls and is best played with a controller. It's definitely possible to use the keyboard, but you might find it tedious.- Although online co-op usually runs very smooth, you might run into some issues if you are playing with three or more players and some of you are from different time zones. I experienced occasional slowdowns when running through Tower of Doom with American friends.- Certain enemies can be frustrating if you are playing alone, since groups of foes that can disable you (e.g. setting you on fire) can end up chain-stunning you for a long time if you are unlucky.- Aerial controls can sometimes be a bit clunky due to the way depth works in this game (It can be hard to determine if you can hit an enemy, or if they are too far away from you vertically).- Although this experience may be unique to me, I had one major issue: achivements bugging out. I played through the entire Tower of Doom game without unlocking a single achievement. Eventually I managed to fix it by verifying the game's cache, but the challenges were already unlocked in-game, which means I can no longer get these achievements. UPDATE: After contacting Capcom Support the problem was handily solved. I applaud their support staff for the swift reply.The bottom line: should you buy this game?YES - Especially if you are a fan of oldschool brawlers, and/or you're looking for a fun co-op game to play with friends.

												I was a child of the arcade era. Sneak off and walk up to the mall to waste quarters on the arcade cabinets, all that jazz...And this just brought back tons of memories. All the quarters I dumped into this thing since I had no clue how D&D worked. That's the thing to remember going in.A side-scrolling brawler incorporating D&D mechanics, one would be surprised at the amount of knowledge they should have going in. If someone doesn't have a party when they're a magic user, they might wonder why they can't cast their spells against the Beholder boss. Or in Tower of Doom, they might wonder why certain monsters just won't stay down until they're burned or beaten to jelly.Even not having this knowledge however, these games are still fun. Replayability is definitely a factor, with dozens of items to collect as you go along. A radial item wheel is available to access the items or spells you collect, and even to switch equipment for classes that can do so, and while some people may claim the keyboard controls are clunky it's a minor hiccup in all honestly. Even going from WASD movement to arrow movement for this isn't the end of the world. The game isn't as pretty as one would expect from a packaged port like this. I personally haven't tinkered with options, but there are some glaring issues here and there with things that just pop out, at the least in Shadow of Mystara. The audio is just as I remember, excellent music for around the year these games came out and a reminder that before Squenix took over, Capcom was the go-to music company.Considering you're picking up two games for the price of one, the TL;DR of this is yes. Chronicles of Mystara is worth it. Graphically, you get what the age and port would expect. Audibly, the game is ear-candy. Playability-wise, exceptional. It's not perfection, but it's damn close to it for the price.			"

												As someone who has never played the old arcade games I can still recommend this one - it's challenging but fun and full of secrets that aren't shoved down your throat. I've yet to try online multiplayer so I can't comment there, but the single player and local co-op is fantastic.It makes me wonder why fantasy brawlers aren't more common, I'd definately pay for a modern brawler like this.

												THIS GAME IS SO MUCH FUN. I bought it for a few friends because we couldn't get Turtles in Time to work online through an emulator. This is like ten times better. Awesome beat em up. The keyboard controls suck a fat one but with a controller it's A++. I would absolutely recommend it at full price. It runs windowed without issue or full screen, the graphics hold up and have a nostalgic feel, combat is really fun and the game doesn't get boring.			"

												This is a port of two classic Capcom brawlers with a Dungeons and Dragons theme.  You get both the Tower of Doom and Shadow over Mystara.  Many consider these games to be the best brawlers of an era.  The game's implementation of GGPO means the online multiplayer is smooth.  It includes some bonus content (such as concept art), but the real meat of the game is still the two brawlers themselves.  They hold up fairly well after all these years and are still rather insteresting games.  However, the plethora of continues available remove some of the bite they originally had.  Brawlers easily became quarter eaters in the past and with enough coins you could always trudge them them.Still there is enough content left to warrant owning this game.  However, the asking price of $15 is somewhat steep.  This is a prime canditate to add to your wishlist and pick it up on Steam sale.  50% off or more is just the right price.  It is worth playing eventually, but not necessarily immediately.  It will also provide poor satisfaction for someone who only plays single player games.  Brawlers are at their best when played with a buddy.			"

												I must say the value of this game certainly pays for itself. I used to play this game in the arcades when I was younger and this game still holds out today as far as quality gameplay goes. The only gripe I have about this game is that the special graphics filters really slow down the framerate of this game , I have to turn them off in order to play. I am not annoyed by this fact but since I obviously have over the minimum system requirements its strange. What I find cool is the emulation options. They have different views when it comes to emulating the machines. You can choose a mode with graphics surrounding it or you can choose dual monitors like the arcade.Glad Capcom took their time on this release. I hope to see more classic arcade games in the future. I'll pay for them because they are worth every penny.			"

												Chronicles of Mystara is a classic arcade brawler from the 90s.  It contains two games, Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara.  They are remarkable in that they both stand up remarkably well for being nearly 20 years old.  Branching paths, level ups, weapon upgrades, shopping...  Basically these games, for their time, and even now, do a fantastic job of capturing much of the Dungeons and Dragons formula.That being said, these games run on the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (AD&D) rules, so if you play a character who casts spells, don't expect to be able to blast away willy-nilly.  Spells a ultra-powerful abilities that are extremely limited in their use until the party makes camp for the night, and this only happens at set story moments in the game.  You don't get to choose.All in all, it's a fantastic game.			"

												Dungeons&Dragons is something that I really enjoy (am I a Dungeon Master). Even though this game is slightly old, it still has very good playablility. The game itself is set in Mystara which is a unknown/unique D&D world, or basically what is known as a Home Campaign. Anyway, enough of the basics, lets write out the pros and cons.Pros-Graphics, the graphics are actually pretty good (for the time that is). The characters and things look cool, and have many different animations.Character Development, although there is a set number of characters you can play as, as to how you use them is totally up to you. Want to have a Dwarf tank while using only ranged weapons? You can do that (albeit unnatural). Plus your characters level up the more you use them, so playing the game through with a single character is ideal here.Music/Audio, the music is really good, but the audio is really good. From the clang of weapon on shield to the hit of a spell on an enemy, it just sounds cool.Cons-Difficulty, unless you play this game a lot, then you will likely think the difficulty to be overly hard. But you must remember that this was an arcade game, where they made it hard so you would have to dish money into them. If you get good at it, it actually isn't to hard, just keep at it.Class Balancing, although each class has its own unique things, the classes overall are not balanced. The mage by far is overpowered, with so many spells available to him and so many uses for such spells, you can basically walk through almost all the levels. But the real over powered character is the Warrior. If you get good at using him, he can basically defeat anything given enough time.Menu, using a keyboard is not recommended, it is just to inefficient to try to cycle through the menus while avoiding a Displacer Beast or Beholder.Conclusion-Overall, it is still a very fun and challenging game. If you like old style arcade games and hack and slash games, then this is a must. If you like anything Dungeons&Dragons, then you may be interested in the story, much like myself. Anyway, hope this review has helped at least a little bit.May your adventures be many and always end in reward!-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League			"

												Old-school Capcom beat 'em up? Yes pls.  This game is part of what Arcades were all about back in the day.  It has a really fun combo system, with special moves of which the inputs are just like fighting games, and with clever play you can extend your combos with items and magic.  It's pretty unforgiving in difficulty, that is if you didn't have infinite continues heauehaueaheuaeh.Also, this game has online multiplayer, and I manage to catch a game in progress sometimes.  It's even more fun with groups.			"

												Dungeons & Dragons Chronicles Of Mystara holds up well. Even today. The graphics aren't high definition, but still sharp enough and are definitely an improvement over the original graphics, thanks to our high resolution monitors.Like the original games; the gameplay is all about beating creatures up, while collecting money, gear and finding secrets. Basically a beat 'em up with light RPG elements. You can pick one of the many available classes. All of them come with their own armor and moves. A nice and great idea back then, but when you compare it to (action) RPGs of today it's, obviously, disappointing. Especially when you can customize pretty much anything these days, from the looks of your character to your own playstyle by selecting the specific skills *you* want to use. I agree it's an unfair comparison, but I couldn't help but notice it, because the game is linear and short, and the current asking price is steep for what you actually get. There are so many other games out there, for the same price, or even lower, that give you much, much more value for your money.Anyway, the developers have also added challenges to the games. Kill 10 enemies for example and you'll earn in-game currency that you can spend in the virtual store to buy artwork and magazine pages, as well as things that can help you beat the game like making your items unbreakable. It's a fun idea that I'd love to see appear in other 'modern retro' games. It does give the game some replay value.As I mentioned the game is short. This is thanks to the unlimited continues. There's no penalty for dying. So beating these games in approximately 2 hours, well, that's pretty fast. And the other available classes aren't all that different to warrant a second playthrough, but I guess you could give the drop-in/drop-out co-op a try though. Or I could see you play it again to complete some more of the challenges.To make a long story short; buy it if it's cheap (because it is a fun game), but for the current asking price (€15) it's just not worth it.[Rating: 75/100]			"

												Possibly the best, if not one of the best Arcade ports ever put on Steam.It's a no-brainer if you like Arcade games or even are just interested in the D&D aspect of it.Hell, even if you just like games you can play with a friend.It's a beautifully rendered 2D side-scroller which includes two full retro games in one:1993 - Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Doom1996 - Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over MystaraEach have different dialogue to choose and different paths to take, adding alot of replayability.Another feature added is in-game challenges and achievements.Four-player drop-in/drop-out co-op with local co-op included.Each game has multiple characters to choose and upgrade - that's right, upgrade. Nineties style.ToD includes a Cleric, a Dwarf, an Elf and a FighterSOM includes those same four characters with an additional two: a Thief and a Magic-User.Multiple graphical options are available, like the original pixels...or smoother pixels...or crispy pixels. As well as different views, like Fullscreen, Widescreen, Full Dual Arcade Cabinets, or choose between the left or the right side of the Cabinet.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR A HEALTHY DOSE OF 90'S NOSTALGIA.

												It would have been so easy for this to be a phone-in, cash-grab game. Instead, we get one of the best Capcom brawlers of the era, wedded to a surprisingly true-to-spirit recreation of old D&D games and the Mystara setting, with some honest, if not always succesful, attempts to graft some of the of the pen-and-paper game into the brawler. The emulation of the old games is well-done in this release, wrapped in a nice front-end, with some decent, if not earth-shattering bonus art. The new game modes and the various ""enhanced"" graphics options are not anything to write home about, but they don't get in the way if you don't want them.Overall, a splendid package for the price, particularly if you have friends to play it with.

												Chronicles of Mystara is a picture perfect recreation of arcade classics. Personally I prefer the first game, Tower of Doom, because while Shadow over Mystara has more classes and spell/item options, it makes things a bit too complex. Tower of Doom is an incredible streamlined experience that captures the spirit of Dungeons & Dragons in a beat'em up of all genres. Shadow is an alright expansion, but Tower is what you're really paying for.			"

												A surprisingly good Beat-Em-Up RPG-like game where you gain levels & upgrades as you fight your way through the game with added features that make it unique compared to it's arcade original.PROS-Up to 4 player Online/Offline Co-Op-Easy Multiplayer where people can jump in/out of games easily-Several different Characters to play-Fun Classic Arcade Beat-em'up Style-2 Games in OneCONS-Repetitive Game Play-Lack of D-Input Support (Joy2Key Needed)FEATURESThe game has two games to choose from.  TOWER OF DOOM & SHADOW OF MYSTARA.  Shadow of Mystara is the game's main campaign with more game play elements & characters to play as while Tower of Doom is the 2nd campaign which is basically an older version of the 1st campaign with slightly less features.  Both campaigns are very similar with the exception of graphical differences.  In SoM each character has special abilities unique to them which gives them a unique play style.  The Rogue can Double Jump & Throw Rocks with her sling, the Warrior can Block attacks with his shield & so on.  ToD doesn't have these features for each character.You can also swap your special ability for an item that you have in your inventory & is easily switched by simply pressing a button then rotating to the item you want.  It can be cumbersome to do so in the middle of a fight since you can't move/attack while doing it.  The same cycle mechanic is used in both campaigns for items.At the end of each level you fight a boss & after the boss you enter a shop menu which lets you buy health potions to heal & weapons that your character can wield. There are also branching paths in each campaign near the end of each chapter.  If you are playing a co-op match you choose by majority vote.  If the vote is 50/50 I think it's random.You also gain level ups after each mission. These feel pretty much tacked on but they do serve a purpose.  The Fighter gets a stronger sword, the Mage gets more spells, & every class gets more HP every level.  If you die you can swap characters mid play through but they start out at the lowest level so it's better to stick with the same character as you play.  The Final Boss in SoM is probably one of the most hilarious things I've seen in an arcade game.  It's not how she looks but how she fights.  She's just a super killing machine meant to eat quarters & even has a giant instant kill AOE attack that you can't dodge & takes up the entire screen.  Luckily, you have infinite continues so you don't have to worry about that nonsense. The game also has ""House Rules"" which let you customize each play through with different game play elements.  These can make the game easier or much harder depending on what you choose.  This adds much more replay value as there are a lot of different settings to choose from.  You do need to unlock most of these by completing achievements, though.  There's a convenient achievement tracker while you play the game as well. OVERALLOverall the game is fun, enjoyable, has a lot of content added compared to the originals & is very well done for an arcade port.  The online co-op is simple & easy to use.  You make a room, & can either wait for people to join or start playing & have them join mid game or join another game in progress.  The Single-Player is also enjoyable but the real fun is in the co-op.    I recommend buying it if you like Classic Arcade Games or just want a good gaming experience.			"

												A retro retrun to a great pair of beatemups!Graphics:The orginal graphics are intact, loking as they did back on an orginal machine, as well as additions for other options, such as smoothing and crisp; and options for scanlines for those obsessed with authenticity.  You also have options for better resolutions, vsynch, and even options for playing the game from an arcade cabinet, though that makes the screen much smaller and harder to play.  It's better to play in widescreen or standard with achievement bars on the sides.Sound:All the sound is just how it was back in the day, perfectly ported to this version.  And the music is just as great as it was back then, too!  No complaints!Control:It's a bit different than using the old arcade stick, but it's quick to get use to a controller for it.  I have NOT tried keyboard/mouse and for a game like this, it is probably best that you don't.  Gamepad gives you quick access to your skills and secondary weapons and makes it easy to use them.  So yes, gamepad.Gameplay:JUST how it was.  Secondary weapons, spells, able to change weapons.  There is NOTHING missing from this game (that I can tell).  The characters even have their special attacks (attacks taht require specil move button combos)!  This is a straight port of the game that was also touched up for modern computers.  Though I do have to point out that online play is a bit of a lag fest if you play someone with a less than perfect connection.If you like old-school beatemups and D&D, this game is worth a look...  As long as you DON'T have WinXP.  It won't work on anything less than WinVista.			"

												Capcom's Dungeons & Dragons arcade games are fantastic classics. The first game, Tower Of Doom, is a fairly straight forward beat'em up with the addition of having an inventory of limited spells/items you may use in combat. Shadow Over Mystara on the other hand is alot more advanced, the inventory/spell system is expanded upon, equipment upgrades you can obtain, along with more techniques+combos you can perform with your character.Graphically, both games look really good, especially Shadow Over Mystara which looks more more refined and alot more vibrant. Both games in terms of audio sound really good, the voice acting is great (hilarious), especially the Cleric and his STICKS TO SNAKES, and the sound effect using for Striking in Tower Of Doom which I swear is lifted directly from Mega Man X's Buster Charge. Honestly I like Tower Of Doom's soundtrack more, some areas have somewhat Castlevaniaish music to them that I like.Both games are alot of fun, but I think Shadow Of Mystara gets more love due to it's refined and more technical gameplay mechanics, along with having more routes and treasures to find. Overall, I'd highly recommend this game to fans of the beat'em up genre. Capcom did great things back in the 90's in arcades.One last thing worth mentioning is this game uses GGPO for netplay, so the game is very playable online, unlike other beat'em ups such as Double Dragon Neon. So you can totally get a group of 4 going and have a good time!			"

												Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara is a port from the classic arcade games of my youth to our current digital age.  The gameplay is how I remember of the games though I wasn't one to have many quarters to blow back in the day.If you have any love of old-school side scrolling brawlers with a touch of the D&D mythos, then this is a fantastic game for you.

												Do i recommend this game...its a 50/50-Yes because you get the game and its a great classic. Change the video graphics filter to Crisp and not Blur, to play the un-altered arcade game.-No because its not HD at all, its a mostly-broken blur filter to make it look HD when its not in any way, and theres tonnes of extra unneccasary user interface around the game clogging it up and slowing it down, and tonnes of pointless loadscreens have been thrown into it when the game never had loadscreens, and every PC in the world can run this game no matter the age of the hardware. Please shoot whoever decided to put slow load screens on a game that DOESNT NEED TO LOAD.Big warning: Has to be run in fullscreen, Windowed Mode is broken, its borderless and jammed at the top left of the screen...so its useless.

												Brilliant, classic, ancient, arcade beat em up game remade for PC. I absolutely love the fact that they've reworked the original game quite a bit and even added Online Coop feature. You can host or look for games, join others drop-in style or from the beginning if you like. Lag can be a bit of a problem but they've also added a ping limiter apparently so you can filter out the people outside your area and whatnot.Controls can be a bit messy until you get used to it, it takes a while to get used to even for a beat em up game. Another thing that bugged me was how they left the magic as it was, it looks fantastic when you're playing alone or in an arcade game place but not online when it pauses the game for everyone for about 3-4 seconds to watch the special effects, they'll have to sort it out asap.The game itself seemed a bit sandbox-ish, at least for a 2D sidescrolling game, there's quite a bit of exploration and looting, and you can do certain combo moves as you attack, not to mention you do all these with 3 other actual players. The inventory is stacked and divided to 2-3 parts, you can choose to use magic or throwing weapons or simply potions and various items instead. When you die, you can just respawn right away at the cost of your ""score"".It's definitely worth a look if you've got friends to play with and definitely worth the price if you ask me.			"

The pair of games in Capcom's Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara collection may very well be the best of its beat-'em-up games from the '90s arcade era, and these ports from Iron Galaxy are the most robust versions of the duo of Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara to date. The 1999 Sega Saturn ports were exclusive to Japan and were unfortunately downgraded from four-player to two-player co-op, but these new HD ports are upscaled versions of the four-player arcade originals with a few modern additions, such as visual filters, unlockable rules, and concept art. Of course, the real draw is the co-op beat-'em-up experience, which has stood the test of time surprisingly well. It's a return to form for these nearly 20-year-old games; for players who remember them, and even those who don't, Chronicles is worth the time it takes to wrangle a party of warriors and suit up for battle.Coming toward the end of Capcom's stint in side-scrolling brawlers, these games are far more advanced than was typical of the genre at the time, when their contemporaries included only temporarily equippable secondary weapons and a small selection of combo attacks and special moves. Capcom took a more role-playing-game-like approach by including elements of level progression, optional equipment, and supply shops. There are branching paths and conditional events, and even the name you give your character determines certain factors of your character's skill and equipment loadout. These nuances, especially in Shadow Over Mystara, with its advanced Street Fighter-like inputs, provide plenty of depth. There are moments when fighting common enemies becomes repetitive, but it's not difficult to find new ways to play to keep the experience fresh; it's often as easy as choosing a different character and exploring their distinct moveset.You and your co-op cohorts have four character classes to choose from in Tower of Doom: fighter, elf, cleric, and dwarf. Shadow Over Mystara contains those four and adds the thief and magic-user classes to the roster. The classes differ quite noticeably in speed, power, and abilities, and though you can charge your way through the game with any selection thanks to unlimited continues, it's a far more rewarding experience to plan and build a team of complementary characters. The availability of unlimited continues is good in the sense that it lets you see everything the game has to offer, but it ultimately cheapens the thrill of victory.Typical thief. Picking up loot while everyone else does the dirty work.Both Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara were designed for co-op play, and though playing solo can be enjoyable, it pales in comparison to the fun that can be had when joining up with a team. Without expert knowledge of the nuanced controls, such as the proper timing of a riposte with the cleric, it's not uncommon to die quite frequently when fighting monsters on your own. Each class's default abilities are detailed in the main menu, but it will take considerable practice to memorize, and consistently perform, some advanced but crucial maneuvers, a task that's more easily done when someone has got your back.Health pickups are few and far between, but again, the unlimited-continues system negates their worth. Don't bother spending money on health in shops between levels (unless you're chasing a high score); you're fully revitalized the next time you continue after death. It's the nature of a direct arcade port that doesn't include a coin limit. The unlockable Elimination mode does away with the default continue system--entirely. Once it's enabled, you die the first time your HP runs out. This is good for those trying to prove their mastery, but it doesn't really resolve the hand-holding nature of the default system in a desirable fashion.And people wonder why dragons get such a bad rap.Of course, judging classic games by modern standards is tricky. Ultimately, it comes down to expectations. Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara were revered upon release, but their classic traits can be off-putting without a nostalgic perspective to give them context. Players who have graduated from the past and are looking for a more advanced experience may view this collection as a lighthearted diversion. However, for anyone who has waited the better part of two decades to play these games, their arrival on modern platforms is nothing short of awesome. Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara is a great port of two delightful games, and unsurprisingly, they're the very best versions that you can get your hands on.The Good    Two sought after arcade games in one package.     The classic gameplay holds up better than that of their contemporaries.     RPG elements add necessary depth to the beat-'em-up formula.The Bad    Unlimited continues sully the joy of victory.     Too few enemy types.7/10    Good "

												Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara was the best beat-'em-up ever made from 1996 to 2013, when Dragon's Crown came out. That's a pretty damn impressive run, all things told. This game packages SoM with the previous game in the series (which was still pretty great) and includes a bunch of features like excellent netcode, selectable difficulty, and what amount to cheat codes with the ""house rules"".The only real problem I have with it is that there's no chat system in the game at all, so you pretty much either have to go without communicating with other players or talk over Skype or something.

												D&D:CM is an old school beat'em up in vain of Golden Axe.  You like Golden Axe?  You sure do.. then you're gonna like this as well.  There's 2 separate games in this bundle and each take about 1 hour to beat.  There's multiple branching ways to go while traversing through mountains, swamps, caves, villages and the lot.  There are a lot of locked options/pictures for you to unlock.  You have unlimited continues much like you would in the arcades.  Except this time you're not pushing quarter after quarter in a huge box.  Not worth full price at all, but is fun especially with local coop.  I'd say grab this at $3 mark and you'll be happy enough with your purchase.  Maybe only 1 maybe 2 replays until you get bored.  6/10			"

												Chances are one of the better Beat-em Up's out there, the two D&D games developed by Capcom really did a ton of creative ideas for this style of gameplay, while trying to stay 'true' towards the source. Stuff not seen in other's of it's kind is the aspect of 'leveling up', your EXP being your points, while also collecting gold to replenish weapons and health doing intermissions. Not only that, but you also get a ton of expendables you can carry and use when you wish, more less depending on your class, a multatude of spells and combat actions to assist you getting from start to finish.Tower of Doom sadly shows it's age greatly nowdays, with it's somewhat 'stiff' inputs and movement, more less a few bosses that are clearly there to grind down your credits, yet does have a lot of little touches, such as being able to destory arrows before they hit you, and even a puzzle boss or two. Shadow over Mystara thought is the real meat of this product, with fast flowing combat, tons of spells and actions to make use of and gain as you level up, lots of hidden paths and weapons, being able to collect monster parts to craft into equipment, more less the only Beat-em up where you can equip a different main weapon outside of Cyber Warriors. Rings, Cloak, helment and armor, boots man and offhand all make up your charater's equipment list, really feeling like this is an action based table top adventure.Overall, if you enjoy beat-em up's, this one's a no brainer. It will last you for quite some time, and with GGPO online support, you can always pull a friend over for online Co-Op to boot. If I had any gripes, the extras you can unlock by doing the 'achivements' are more fitting of D&D 3.5 and 4.0, then the AD&D this game was based off of, so they feel horrably out of place and not really fitting of any of the content you will activly be playing.

												Arcade style games from the good old days. Most people will recognise the far more common games like Golden Axe, this is very similar. The main difference is that in D& D you can use different equipment ( daggers, throwing hammers, urns of fire) and equip different pieces of armor. There are also alternative parts in the storylines taking you into different dungeons. Don't worry about dying, we have infinite $$$ here haha.If you want to take a trip down memory lane or you are just curious about old hack and slash games it is worth picking up on sale. "

												Chronicles of Mystara is a collection of two of the best beat-em-ups to come out fo the golden age of arcade gaming, Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara.  Selecting from a diverse group of classes with unique strengths, weaknesses, and abilities, you have an unparalelled level of control over your character and the path you take through the game.  There are a number of normal and unique items throughout the game that you can pick up that will influence the way you play the game, like frost swords that allow melee characters to keep the front line endlessly stunned, and items like the egg of the owlbear that will summon one to fight for you.  The different paths you take will result in different levels and bosses, leading to an ultimate battle that will test your skill.  This game had endless replayability for me when it was in arcades, and it still keeps me drawn in nearly twenty years later.			"

												7/10Only done single player. So maybe the co-op will be better.But my impressions of the game from what I saw.I like the levels and how you can choose your fate of where you go between some levels.The combat knocks a point off because though it is simple. Sometimes the evade slide or even your lunge attack(down, forward, attack) won't work, or the enemy hitbox will be out of range somehow despite your weapon going through their body, and you just get beat on.I had a boss stand still, I kept swinging, every swing missed. Then suddenly I hit him a few times and kept missing again.A boss (some kind of frost serpent) went down on the map, where I couldn't move to so I missed every attack but he could hit me fine. I like the combat on normal enemies. But when the boss fights happen it feels like the game breaks.I like the fact you can change characters any time after you die. So if you don't like a certain character you can change before respawning.Speaking of respawning, there is unlimited lives. So can make plenty of mistakes and not have to restart.If you put time into it, many people can seem to beat it fine on 1 life.I don't see me playing enough to get that good.I got this full price, but I recommend it at a sale price to be sure. Especially if you don't have friends to play it with and stuck at solo only.			"

It was the skyrim of the 90s, with more to discover than any other arcade game.It is a relic and a treasure, and anyone that likes beat em ups, deep games, and D&D/Fantasy games, needs to buy this. For me, $15 is a perfect price. It is CAPCOM after all and they could charge more. 1/3 Fighting Game, 1/3 D&D, 1/3 RPG.Easily my favorite game of the 90's with no exception.

												Even though time has been slightly unforgiving for Tower of Doom (much less so for its sequel), both games included in this mini collection prove to be among the best and deepest side scrolling beat'em ups ever created, up to this day.From classes to monsters, the world of D&D and its rules (with obvious ""artistic"" licenses) came perfectly to life in a way that can satisfy both arcade fanatics and avid players of the famous tabletop game.Multiple paths, a remarkable amount of variety and a multiplayer co-op mode (online and local) that is a blast to play make Chronicles of Mystara a must have even though you didn't have a chance to try the original in an arcade, given that you can appreciate the dated graphics.There are also a bunch of challenges that earn you some kind of diamond currency, which can be spent to unlock artworks, sketches (taken mostly from 2E and 3E manuals, a little disappointing if you were expecting original material) and house rules, special settings to make the game easier or harder.If you like brawlers and/or fun multiplayer games, Chronicles of Mystara is certainly worth a closer look.

												Old-school arcade beat-em-up with modern game mechanics and retro graphics. Very nicely done. This is not for people who like fluid, highly-responsive action combat, as the controls are (intentionally) period-specific to a frustrating extent. Great for small get-togethers, as it supports up to 4 players who can drop in and out freely. Definitely has something to offer beyond the nostalgia value, but likely not for $15. Pick it up if you find it discounted and you're really itching for a good party game.			"

												Even though time has been slightly unforgiving for Tower of Doom (much less so for its sequel), both games included in this mini collection prove to be among the best and deepest side scrolling beat'em ups ever created, up to this day.From classes to monsters, the world of D&D and its rules (with obvious ""artistic"" licenses) came perfectly to life in a way that can satisfy both arcade fanatics and avid players of the famous tabletop game.Multiple paths, a remarkable amount of variety and a multiplayer co-op mode (online and local) that is a blast to play make Chronicles of Mystara a must have even though you didn't have a chance to try the original in an arcade, given that you can appreciate the dated graphics.There are also a bunch of challenges that earn you some kind of diamond currency, which can be spent to unlock artworks, sketches (taken mostly from 2E and 3E manuals, a little disappointing if you were expecting original material) and house rules, special settings to make the game easier or harder.If you like brawlers and/or fun multiplayer games, Chronicles of Mystara is certainly worth a closer look.

												I picked this up to play with some friends who are big fans of D&D. It was on Sale so why not. I never fell under the D&D spell that some of my friends did, but I enjoy playing this game either way.If you like Golden Axe on Sega Genesis then you will love this game. The graphics are on par with the Sega Genesis Console's graphics. This game is your standard hack and slash RPG. The Chronicles of Mystara plays like Golden Axe with some added attacks and buffs. if you like old school Capcom games this is a must have. They have also made this game multiplayer so you can play together online with your friend. I rate this game a 3.5 out of 5			"

												Strangely, the only Capcom arcade beat-em-up on Steam, and their deepest. Inventories, spells, distinct characters, command specials, and multiple story pathes, all piled on top of the classic Final FIght style gameply. The pixelated anime style graphics date it pretty badly, but if you don't have any problems with CPSII era graphics, you'll be fine here. I persoanlly love the graphics, and love pulling out the arcade sticks.THe challenges and vault really appeal to the completionist in me.Definitely more for beat-em-up fans than for D&D fans. If you're both, then this will probably scratch a very specific itch.One of my favourite beat-em-ups of all time.			"

Sure it has some arcade cheese but with the updated credits system you'll actually be able to make it to the end. Good variety in characters, acceptable graphics, and high replay value. Its great to play with your friends but the netcode isn't prefect if you're playing online so you may want to expect some lag. Controller reccomended.			"

												This is basicly 2 games in 1 - I remember having a blast with these back in the day at the arcades.They made it a decent port into steam, implementing some achievements and most importantly - online play with steam buddies. This is pretty much the only reason I'd consider getting it.If you enjoy beat'em ups like Golden Axe and Streets of Rage, you'll love this one. Gameplay is fun and incorporated D&D elements like spells and such.One run through the first game would take you about an hour or two. So its definetly not worth its current price tag.Wait until its on sale. Eventhough its a great game to play with friends, its fairly short, and I would not recommend paying more than $5-$6 for it.Its good to see them bringing back these games with a touch of online playability.

												This brings me back to my youth where I used to spend so much money just enjoying the story of this classic arcade game.   Still a touch hard and at times you can die easily but with the fact you have infinite continues now it brings the fun and excitement without the stress or well lost of funds.  A wide range of character choices and story outcome based on the time it was made this game was and will always be one of my favorites.  The best part is, you get two games in one with it.  It's easy to join others or start your own session as well if you want to play multiplayer.  I ended up buying me a copy then going and buying not 3 but 4 of my friends one as well so we all can play together or they can have as much fun as I do with it.  All in all a must have if you like classic and old school games, or arcade dungeon crawls.			"

												Brings back memories. One of the best arcade games of the '90s. I had to get this title since it offers more than just the base games. It has great in-game 2D graphics and rare artworks, easy-to-learn and solid game mechanics, gamepad plus online/offline multiplayer support, and a decent storyline. Basically, this is beat 'em up done right. Get this if you're a fan of the D&D franchise, couch co-op games and 2D art. Two thumbs up for me and well worth the price. I recommend it.			"

												It is a classic arcade game/quarter eater. It is relentlessly difficult, almost as hard as the Metal Slug games. It is fun to play as all of the characters although there isn't much difference other than looks. It is a faithful recreation of the arcade version and worth it on sale for around $6 which is what I paid and is a fair price. Have patience because you will need it. Anyone playing through for the first time will die a lot. Or basically anyone period because it was designed that way so it would take a ton of quarters to beat so they could get a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of money from the game in the arcade. One of the hardest games I've ever played but also a true classic beat'em up that doesn't make you mash the attack button 90 thousand times a minute until your hand and arm are broke like a piece of trash unfun arm breaker of a game like Castle Crashers.7/10 good, but get on sale only			"

I prefer Shadows over mystara to Tower of Doom as the story was I felt a bit more flushed out, you had two more characters to choose from and alternate costumes, version two of the warrior was my favorite.

												This contains D&D: Tower of Doom and Shadows over Mystara, the two beat-em-up arcade games by Capcom from back when TSR made D&D.  I have never actually played Tower of Doom so this review only concerns Shadows over Mystara.As the game was  made by Capcom they tend to have a bit more to interest to them then the typical button masher types.  Characters have special moves unique to them made with fighting-game inputs, and each class has fairly unique features about them that make playing each fun.  The game is about an hour or less per full run through, and with infinite credits you do not have to worry about a lost playthrough or it being too hard.  The game is not without its faults, some of the secrets are extremely obscure and the inventory system often is more trouble than it is worth.  There is not much replayability but it would probably be a pretty great pick-up-and-play game for lan parties or hangouts.The ports are faithful and completely functional, and contain some extra content like mode variants and concept arts.  The real draw here is that the game has netplay that works VERY WELL alongside local multiplayer.  Capcom really went out of their way to satisfy fans by making the game functional, which is something I appreciate.  You will not likely find a functional cabinet of this game nowadays.  Its certainly an old game, but its pretty good for the era.  Not bad for a game to pick up on sale, at least.			"

												I think this game is freaking amazing. I forgot how awesome a beatemup can be. I don't think I've played one since Genisis. I don't have anything againts them. Just not my thing usually. However, I think this game has to be on of the more. All the different backgrounds. The music, the fact that there is a lot of things to collect. The first game is a nice classic and sort of a tutorial for the second game. Mystara is SO much faster than the first one. It is fast pace and challenge when you start to put the difficulty higher. I'm not great at this game but I still love to play it so see the different sprites and just play a classic game. I got this on a sale but to be honest, I would have been ok with full price. If you enjoy the whole retro thing then I highly recommend it. I originally seen a video from a Youtuber called ProJared and I don't tink I would have gotten this game if it wasn't for the fact that I saw his video on it. If you're curious about the game go check out his review on it.			"

												Took me a year and a half, as well as a trip to China, to play this.  Clearly, I am an idiot.  This game, while having some problems, is immensely fun.  Colorful, fast paced, and with tons of replayability, this romp through the DnD world is awesome.  The game includes both Tower of Doom and Shadow over Mystara, the first being a fairly standard beat em up, which is cool because of the DnD aesthetic, while the second has a ton of variety, content, and much tighter controls.  Throw in 4 player co-op, house rules you can implement to alter how the game is played, tons of extra content, and a number of branching paths in game, as well as challenges to complete and you have a game that will take ages to get old.  3 playthroughs and I'm still having a blast playing through it.  Definitely pick this game up.A usb controller is highly recommended.			"

												How can you screw up a port of an arcade game this bad is beyond reasoning.Even an emulator does a better job than this excuse of a ""remaster"": The game itself might be fine. However, it crashed on various occassions. Dying? Crash. Picking your character? Crash. On 4 different machines with different Windows (8 and 10) at that.			"

												I have to say, I am very sorry to NOT recommend this game. And it's just because one reason: CONTROLLER ISSUES...Yeah, you cannot just plug your favourite controller and play, eeeeeeek. No, you need to play with the 360's controller and pray for the game to load it. If you sacrifice a goat, this may help, indeed...Unfortunately, you cannot configure it properly. Nor graphics, nor difficulty. The point, this game seems to be created just to load with MAME or similar, not Steam.The only PRO is you can play with your fellas easier than trying buggy unrelated SW... but tha't all...			"

												Any fan of D&D or beat em ups should buy this game, whether it be on console or steam, this is a really fun game! It has lots of good things like satisfying gameplay and fun action. But like every other game in reality, it has flaws, like the game being too hard for being on the easiest difficulty (Which is probably why you get so many continues by the time you start dying) And the only online games I found were ultra laggy! Anyway, this is still a fun game and I really want to play online, so I hope you buy it on steam so I can play with you!			"

												Definitely an Arcade game, it has a crapton of features for a Beat-Em-Up. In total there's 100 items across 2 seperate games! Mix that with new ""House Rules"" and local/online drop-in/drop-out multiplayer for up to 4 players and you've got a game that's worth the $15 in my eyes.The combat system is pretty basic, but each of the 6 characters are indeed in-depth enough to make things interesting. Unless you're the Magic-User, combo potential is pretty good for beating down your opponents. The Magic-User can also combo, but not to the same degree of depth. Spells make up for this though, and BOY does he have a lot of them.Unsurprisingly, this game has a Level-Up system. The Score you gain from grabbing items and killing enemies are the Experience Points you gain for leveling-up, which increases your Health and makes you more powerful to some degree. I mean, it's Dungeons & Dragons, so it's kind of expected, even if it doesn't make too much sense for a Beat-Em-Up.The game is kind of unforgiving in terms of difficulty, so expect to die a lot. I got game over 30+ times during my 1st and 2nd playthrough of Shadow over Mystara. I haven't tried online play yet, but I hope to if my friends pick the game up. Maybe more players will make it easier, although I doubt it. This still won't deter me from playing it!All I can say is, if you're a fan of old-school Arcade Beat-Em-Ups, you'd be missing out on a gem if you've never played this.			"

												I'm going to preface this review with the fact that I LOVED this game in the arcade.  It was absolutely one of my favorites.This game does NOT have full controller support.  It does work with my XBox 360 controller, but not my USB controller.  Very disappointing.  (I like the fit and feel of my USB controller better.)Having said that...  the game is...  well, the game.  It's what you played in the arcade and possibly on your emulator.  The game even seems to be complete with the fraction of a second delay response to the button inputs that came with the arcade game back in the 90s.  The game is fun enough but, like all side scrolling beat-'em-ups...  you have to deal with the boss characters that are invulnerable for a time that are designed to mop the floor with you.  Standard fare.Don't pay full price for this.  And honestly, don't even pay half price for it unless you're a HUGE fan of the game and absolutely dying to get it.(I have yet to try the online feature of the game...  and I'm sure eventually I will, just for giggles...  but that wasn't the reason I got the game.)

												These games are pretty much straight ports of the arcade quarter-eaters. Nostalgia is what will make you buy them, and nostalgia will maybe let you play twice as long as you would if they were ""new"" games.Skill as an element in this game makes up about 20% of your survival chances, but there are SO MANY cheap deaths and gameplay is so poor that rage quitting is basically the only thing that will prevent you from getting through the hour or so long campaign.I only played SP, but maybe this game is less cheap or more fun in MP, but really, especially some of the boss fights have so many cheap, unblockable, undodgeable attacks that even if you know all of the attacks coming, you'll still get into endless loops of getting hit until you're dead and have to continue again.I don't understand how people are saying this is the best beat-em-up of that era, as Final Fight, while having some cheap elements, was still beatable without continuing even if you made a couple mistakes. In this one, certain enemy attacks, falling fireballs, etc happen much faster than certain character animations, so if you're in the middle of swinging a sword and an enemy pops up and throws a fireball at you, there is absolutely nothing you can do. And it happens constantly.Only buy it for nostalgia reasons or if you really think the MP will be worth it.			"

												Dungeons and Dragons,does suffer from one huge issue and that is the controls and I mean that because they expect you to do some fighting game combos like from Mortal Kombat,now that would be fine and all,but there is no way to use the shoulder bouttons for these sorts of combos. For me that just kill's it, because I am used to doing these kind of combos in Injustice.When,here the button combos are harder to pull off and in turn that leave""s you wide open at times. But, I do like the variety and the different combos you can achieve, it will just take some time to get used to, if your like me. Personally,I enjoy Castle Crashers and Double Dragon Neon more then this, but add a few friends and even this one become's enjoyable. Otherwise,when I am on my own,this one is a broad experience. Personally,I would give this game a below average just because of this issue,but add in a patch and of course I would recommend it!			"

												The Chronicles of Mystara features D&D Tower of Doom, a god effort that feels poor when faced to his sucessor, Shadow Over Mystara, wich IMO is the core game of this pack.This game (Shadow over Mystara) was so amazing back in his time. Nowadays still brings good memories filled with nostalgia and bread with nocilla, plus crapcom did a decent work with crappy HD pixels, adding a nice interface and new features in the style of actual games (items list, achievementes, online scoreboards, statistics and challenges, online gameplay and all that stuff that makes replayable a game.Two things I would not forget to mention, you CAN PLAY fullscreen, without the border frame showed in the store pics & trailer, that's something I didn't see mentioned already, the other important thing is that ONLINE MULTIPLAYER CANNOT BE PLAYED WITH LOCAL BUDDIES, you'll have to choose wether you go online or play couch coop.I will not recommend this game cause we all know it won't offer nothing really new, they only made a pixelpolish, added a poor interface and few tweaks without really revamping this game. Anyway still offers the same fun that made it one of my all time favorite games.If anyone should buy this it will be old school gamers in a nostalgic rampage (just like me)			"

												For single player, this is fun. For multiplayer, don't bother with this version.This is the classic arcade game that I loved as a kid. It's still a great game and amazing to do with friends.  There is online multiplayer, but local coop is where the fun is at for me.  Unfortunately, they did this terribly.I couldn't figure out how to get multiple playstation controllers to work until digging through a community guide and installing third party drivers so that this archaic game could support it.  I don't recommend this game, due to the complete headache of controller support, poor documentation and lack of controller configuration (you can only bind the jump, item, use, attack keys in the game UI, but not direction and 'insert coin').

												I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. This is a relic of quarter hungry arcades from point a to point b. It punishes you for playing with bullet sponge enemies, no life restore after a level, bosses immediately after bosses, if you die too many times while playing you'll become a diffrent character that you did not select (ie i played as a rouge, but after dying i was forced into playing an elf and fighter by the game), and backwards controls. The attack button is the ""pick up item"" button, and you cannot what you want to do, so when one of the thousands of goblins drops a single gold piece in front of the dark elf you're supposed to kill, you pick up the penny instead of defend yourself from the stone cold killer. The move controls are the arrow keys instead of wasd, you know, like every other pc game ever. The space bar is the pause button instead of the jump button, so when i panicked, which happened 9/10 of the time while playing this game, i would bring the game to a screeching halt instead of dodging the attack, remainding me that i could quit at any time. So i did. I play Dungeons & Dragons and video games to feel accomplished, powerful, and generally good about myself. This game makes me feel like a little bich.			"

												This is an old game and even with a reworked version, it feels ancient. The pausing of in-game action every time a player character's special power is used breaks the immersion. I understand that part might already be ingrained in the original arcade version and hence difficult for the devs to remove. If yes, I've forgotten about it and was expecting a more fluid movement. Furthermore, the story text scrolls too fast for normal people to read. The controls feel awkward especially when jumping while using a game pad. The nice colorful art work definitely brings nostalgia, but you might not like how the game appears in a Full HD screen as the stretched graphics is very pixelated. I appreciate how Iron Galaxy Studios tried to resurrect this once great game and they might have done their best to improve it. But the remaining negative aspects, consequently, made the game feel less valuable. The sale price of PhP 220 is too much for me. You might enjoy if you are willing to overlook all of these... but I am refunding.			"

												This is the first game I ever returned.  If you have some people who can come and play with you it's one thing.  If you can play online, that may make it worth it too.  However, single player like I was limited to thanks to intermitent internet drops was just not that satisfying.  Castle Crashers was just more fun to play all around.  It's a pity, I wasted a fair number of quarters on the game back in the day.  It is not awful by any means, but shows its age.			"

												Do not buy.If you watch the trailer and screenshots - it is misleading and the Steam version does not include a HD option which is only available on other platforms/consoles. Complained to Customer Care but they didn't care (same with dead rising 2)I am sick of Capcom and their crappy ports to PC and wish to inform others because there won't be any after purchase support from either Capcom or Valve.Otherwise, solid gameplay like the original.@X KirbyWhen the game came out, I watched the trailer and thought ""looks nice, I'll buy this"" yeah I didn't bother reading the page, why should I have to? So I can see a disclaimer saying that this game doesn't come in HD? Yeah there's no disclaimer.So when I asked for a refund - they said no. So I asked them to at least remove the trailer and screenshots as they were misleading - they said no. Great customer service right there.And no one cares what your preference is - this isn't about preferences. Its about how a product is marketed and sold to consumers and basically no after purchase customer care/support.Why you you try working on your reading comprehension.			"

												I guess I remembered somehting different. As a kid I used to love this at the arcade. When I saw a remastered version available I thought I couldnt pass it up. I don't really see how its remastered though other than adding a smoothing option, which I don't really think makes the game look any better at all. Controls just feel clunky and I guess its the classic thing of remembering things much better than they actually were. I guess all in all I just don't feel like this game is really remastered.			"

												Unlike ""Injustice: Gods Among Us"" (which has full controller support correctly coded), Capcom decided to only support Microsoft Xbox 360 controllers!

												I fail utterly to understand why these games are remembered so fondly. I can certainly appreciate the marriage of RPG and beat-em-up elements that Capcom's Dungeons & Dragons arcade games offered, especially given that it was innovative at the time (and still sort of is). I can also readily understand loving the games' aesthetics, because the graphics and art direction still hold up well. However, like every beat-em-up of its era, these games had nothing to do with skill and everything to do with how many quarters you were willing to part with. Clunky movement and horrendously imbalanced damage ensured that you would lose repeatedly, and the fact that this rerelease allows you infinite credits is telling of just how much of a massive scam these games were. What's more, if you're buying this version, you're paying for some ""features"" that make some pretty bad games even worse. Playing on an emulator that supports Netplay is not only cheaper, but it will also rid you of the terrible bezel that takes up damn near the entire screen, in addition to allowing you the opportunity to find far more people to play with.

												Game Score: 5/10Nostalgic semi-fun beat 'em up. The arcade style quarter hogging mechanics that include near impossible boss fights and ruthless enemies don't matter much when you have infinite lives. This leaves players to do one thing, pick a mage, cast spells, win. All other characters are useless because the bosses are either flying or move way to fast to hit with melee.Pros:- Lots of characters to select- Many different treasures to find- 2 games in one- Near retro arcade graphicsCons:- Enemies do so much damage to you while you do so little to them- Some bosses are near impossible to hit without magic- Hitting enemies on the same horizontal plane is a hassleD&D: Chronicles of Mystara just wasn't that fun.

												A Shadow of Mystara reviewAt first, this game might seem bland and out of balanced, yet if you give it some time you discover how much fun it can be, that is, if you like the genre. For a beat em up you have tons of variety in spells, items, classes and different paths you can take on, adding lots of replayability. It should be noted, that some people have some crashing experiences in the main menu, but I haven't heard anyone dropping from the game yet, so all things considered, it gets a pass in my book.Multiplayer is for up to 4 players and there is 6 classes to choose from: Fighter, dwarf, elf, cleric, thief and magic user. They have some of the basic things in common, like basic combo and slide, but there is major differences in how they actually play. For example, dwarf has a lots of tankiness but is somewhat slow, while thief is weaker but can backstab, double jump and steal items. Game rewards people for teamwork, and a right team saves of a lot of continues, since every class is tailored for something: Fighter, dwarf and thief are good for killing standard mobs, while cleric has a heal and stat boosting abilities, lastly Magic user and elf are useful for killing bosses. This doesn't mean you can't solo the game with any class without dying once if you have played it enough and know it's gimmicks.At the moment of this recommendation, there is a a few players in online, so you still have a chance to play this on multiplayer even if you can't get your friends to play this. This game is made in 1993, however, it has aged well since it was made for the arcade board. Just remember to change filters and resolution from the options first. For a nitpick, I'd say it is a bit on the easy side, because you get unlimited credits by default. You can later change survival mode on, which causes everyone to have only one life, but it would've been better, if you could set the amount of credits yourself.With it's good replayability, animation and presentation, this title was a classic of it's time and before Dragon's Crown comes out, it doesn't get better than this.

Lots of minor bugs, visual or worse, crashes. Online is basically dead, so if you're looking for other players stick within your friend circle.Negatives aside, game's a lot of fun and definitely worth a playthrough if you've never played it. Stick to when it's on sale though. This port is exceptionally lousy, and in all honesty probably doesn't deserve support at all.			"

												One of my fondest memories is dumping quarter after quarter in the Tower of Doom arcade machine at a small ice cream shop in Ocean City, Maryland.  Such a complex beat em up and the fact I'm a fan of Dungeons and Dragons never hurt my chances of throwing down $20 in cheap thrills.  Well after years of not getting ports in America, it came to Steam and I could share this experience with my friends and, one day, my son (Or any future kids as well).  Adding online functionality means I can even share it with my pals all over the world.  It's a lot of fun.  And with the unlockable game modes means theres some new experiences even for old dogs like me.			"

												An excellent little bundle with two really fun games and some nice unlockables to keep the game interesting.  The price might be a deal-breaker for some, but if you ever see it on sale I wholly recommend it.  Every class has a unique feel and the branching paths and general pace of both games keeps things interesting for numerous playthroughs.  The Tower of Doom is the first of the two and feels somewhat limited in its controls, however the game does get easier once you get a feel for the momentum of your character.  While I do prefer Shadow of Mystara for its faster gameplay and smoother controls, I still suggest that you give the Tower of Doom a try.  Shadow of Mystara is the second game in the bundle and feels much smoother in controls.  Characters move more naturally and the inventory system is more complex without being cumbersome.   One thing of note is that the game seems to have trouble accepting any controller that isn't an official Xbox 360 controller.  That seems to be my luck, anyway.   If you can manage to get a game going with other people the game gets even better, but I suggest you check a guide to ensure that you can manage a proper setup for multiple players if you plan on using the local co-op function.

												Fantastic value for what you are getting.  If you ever played it in the arcade there were never enough quarters in the world to get you through.  Now that is no longer a problem and with full online co-op support with drop in and drop out you can play with your friends  from anywhere without having to both be sitting in front of the same screen.  Oustanding port by Capcom that does not lose anything from the original.  My only complaint (and maybe I just have not figured out how to adjust this yet) is the sounds of the actual heroes in the game.  They are EXTREMELY quiet compared to the arcade cabinet.  In the arcade me and my friends would always be parroting their ridiculous quotes like the infamous ""LIGHTNING BOLT"" as the characters say whatever spell they are casting out loud.  That was a huge part of the fun of this game was the extremely silly voice acting of the characters shouting out the names of spells as they were casting them.  It is very hard to hear them over the battle sound effects that are going on as you are almost always in large fights in the game.For $14.99 its a steal- as it includes both of the full arcade games.  If you can get it on sale (I nailed it for the $7.99) it is a stupidly good deal for the play through value you will get.  DO NOT buy this game for single player as it just feels extremely lonely and wrong to try and play it by yourself with a single hero.  You need at least 2+ people to truly enjoy this arcade masterpiece.			"

												I played this game growing up, so to see it spring up on Steam after all these years (along with it's sequel!) was a surprise. I can say that it has made the transition seamlessly and keeps the side-scrolling, button bashing fun that I remember from my childhood. Complete with the timed selection and shop screens to the skippable/fastforwardable cut scenes.If you enjoyed games like Golden Axe in your youth, then this game is definitely worth getting. It runs on any system, it has local co-op, the unlock/challenge mode is fun and it's a nostalgic blast from the past that stands the test of time.Enjoy.			"

												Wow playing an arcade game with infinte amount of fake quartes is so much better than spending double digits (not including the decimal) worth of actual qaurters; AND IT'S TWO GAMES OMG. I remember my first time playing tower of doom was at a hotel with my older brother playing co-op two player. That day we dropped just under 20$ in the struggle to beat the game unfornuatly we failed just short of the finale and to our dismay we were out of money..... Self loathing at ourselves for being lured into the epicness of the game and wasting our hard earned money we forgot it. That is until I discovered it on steam and with a sequel. So many memories came rushing back and then anger at the fact I could of waited a couple years and gotten two games for under 15$ instead of wasting under 20$ to play one (>.>). Never the less I am pleased with my purchase and hopefull I can once again play co-op with my bro. Thanks steam and thankyou wallet for containing more than my child self.			"

												Arcade beat-em-up at its best.I can't stress how much fun this game is, even single-player.  The game itself is challenging and engrossing, just like it was back in the arcade years.ratings are from 1-5Gameplay: 5 - No complex formulas.  No intriquet combo systems.  Just pure basic hack-n-slash gameplay of the arcade straight to your steam account and onto your PC.  It's a great romp from start to finish and includes not just other characters, but difficulty settings to keep you coming back for more and pit you against more challenigng enemies.  Discover each character's abilities and level them up by yourself or with local and online co-op (finding people to play this online is a challenge, as not many people set up lobbies for this).Sound: 5 - Nostalgia-city for most arcade-goers in the 90s.  The music and sounds are spot-on and have aged fairly well.  All the yelling, grunting, and character voices are all here. Graphics: 4.5 - The grapihcs get the job done with vibrant colors and great special effects.  Still, you may get bored looking at some of the same browns and greys, but each environment differs from the other in some way, making it not so bland.Control: 4.5 - The controls are flawless, but it does require learing which keys/buttons do what commands.  Still, with a 360 controller, it's nearly a walk in the park.  Using magic, items and having to select them can be a pain, especially in the heat of battle, but it still works and remember: this is an arcade port.Overall: 4.75 - Even solo, I find myself coming back and visiting Mysteria over and over again.  Though I only have 2 hours put into this game, I've been playing it since I got it a bit at a time.  I first finished the game with the cleric, and am currently working on the elf as of this writing.For those wishing to take a trip down memory lane, it's well worth the price.  Those looking for an interesting 4-player beat-em-up and have a few local friends to play with, it's definitely worth it.  Fans of hack-n-slash games will also find some enjoyment and there are unlockable items only attainable by purchasing with in-game currency earned while playing.			"

												Chronicles of Mystara is a port of two Capcom arcade beat-'em-ups from the mid-nineties. The main gimmick is that this is not only a solid beat 'em up, but one that's set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe, which means neat little features like access to a limited number of powerful spells that get recharged after a ""rest"", enemies that have mechanics like their tabletop counterparts (Undead, for instance, can't be hurt by any type of gas attack because they don't have lungs), and explorable environments with a few secret areas tucked here and there with bonus loot, and branching paths that, while not affecting the plot in any way, increase replayability in a MASSIVE way. With four to six playable classes, depending on whether you're playing Tower of Doom or Shadow over Mystara (the later of which has alternate variants of the Cleric and Magic User classes with different spells, bringing the effective total closer to 8), plenty of levels, and a rather ridiculous amount of loot to find, this is one beat 'em up with a LOT of meat on its bones. This port even comes with achievement milestones, adding even more to the pile. It's a fair amount of content for the asking price, especially on sale.Unfortunately, the playerbase is a bit small these days, so random matchmaking is a bit empty. This is definitely the type of game where buying a 4-pack to split with your friends is a solid investment.			"

												I saw this announced and instantly wishlisted it.  As soon as it was on sale(and I had money :P ), I snagged the 4 pack and have played it every day since. Nostalgia +10I feel like this game was one of those that fell into my ""awe"" zone as a kid.  I was taken aback by the ability to select a path, and the differences in the characters.  I thought it was doing things differently than any other title I had played like it at the time.  I had loved TMNT, Double Dragon, Legend, and Knights of the Round on my SNES, but this game was tucked inside of the UNL Student Union, I couldn't get to it.  My mom worked on campus, sometimes took me with her to work late, and I very rarely got the chance to talk her into allowing me to spend time ALONE AT NIGHT in the arcade. Moms... right?I watched the college guys, they were really good, god-like to my abilities back then.  I waited patiently, trying not to waste my precious quarters on other machines, taking in the secrets I could see them discover.  Anything that would save me from a trap or otherwise stolen quarter.  I remember that man, calling from the bushes.  Crazy.I never really got the chance to master the game, playing alone was not easy and college guys didn't want to play with a kid.  The game was really big to me at the time and there was a lot to take in without being able to take it home with me at the time.  I like that this allows infinite lives, but even on easy I die alot, I had to turn on the option to use gold as HP.  If you have a team and you can use each character's abilities correctly, this game is alot easier.  Solo play is very challenging.My associations aside, the game holds up well.  I still play many of the older games, and this is really a beautiful one.  Several aspects could be annoying to some people, like the victory yells and other sound effects.  I feel several things could have been touched up or corrected (Like typographical errors), and a revamped control scheme would have been neat.As is, I love the game(s), but the sale price for the 4pack (so my friends can play here or from home) was a much better deal than single price non-sale. $15 isn't bad, but everyone playing for $15 made it much easier to forgive the little things.  And multiplayer is very nicely done.  When anyone is done playing, they can just opt out and the game continues.  I wish I could get X-Men on here like this, more arcade and at-home multiplayer games would be nicely added to my library if I could multiplayer like the old days.  Online only and multicopy for multiplay are just terrible.  It is much nicer when everyone can game out on the same screen on the same couch.  So many good games could get this treatment!(I also think this would be a great series to revisit.  Don't make an HD remastering, create an entirely new title in the series!I would pay full game price for this game done for the new generation.  More paths and choices, more inventory and secrets.  If it could stay true to the original art style and not change too much of the original feeling, that would be awesome as well.  But wishing for that, is probably as good as wishing for Ducktales 2 Remastered)			"

												That game is some sort of relief for those who had a really hard time back then, spending thousands of quarters in those classic Arcade machines while trying to finish the game. Well, not only for them, because there're also those who've suffered with desync problems in Kaillera. The final touch that we have are the achievements that are present on this Steam version (where are the cards, damn it). Well, besides these considerations, the game is pretty much the same we're all used to, except that nowadays you don't need to carry a bag of quarters in order to finish (and also the hi-scores are pretty much irrelevant). Seriously, I don't know why the PC is such a poor platform for beat'em ups, there should definitely exist more of these. To put it short, choose your class and have fun!			"

												Fantastic value for what you are getting.  If you ever played it in the arcade there were never enough quarters in the world to get you through.  Now that is no longer a problem and with full online co-op support with drop in and drop out you can play with your friends  from anywhere without having to both be sitting in front of the same screen.  Oustanding port by Capcom that does not lose anything from the original.  My only complaint (and maybe I just have not figured out how to adjust this yet) is the sounds of the actual heroes in the game.  They are EXTREMELY quiet compared to the arcade cabinet.  In the arcade me and my friends would always be parroting their ridiculous quotes like the infamous ""LIGHTNING BOLT"" as the characters say whatever spell they are casting out loud.  That was a huge part of the fun of this game was the extremely silly voice acting of the characters shouting out the names of spells as they were casting them.  It is very hard to hear them over the battle sound effects that are going on as you are almost always in large fights in the game.For $14.99 its a steal- as it includes both of the full arcade games.  If you can get it on sale (I nailed it for the $7.99) it is a stupidly good deal for the play through value you will get.  DO NOT buy this game for single player as it just feels extremely lonely and wrong to try and play it by yourself with a single hero.  You need at least 2+ people to truly enjoy this arcade masterpiece.			"

												One of my fondest memories is dumping quarter after quarter in the Tower of Doom arcade machine at a small ice cream shop in Ocean City, Maryland.  Such a complex beat em up and the fact I'm a fan of Dungeons and Dragons never hurt my chances of throwing down $20 in cheap thrills.  Well after years of not getting ports in America, it came to Steam and I could share this experience with my friends and, one day, my son (Or any future kids as well).  Adding online functionality means I can even share it with my pals all over the world.  It's a lot of fun.  And with the unlockable game modes means theres some new experiences even for old dogs like me.			"

												An excellent little bundle with two really fun games and some nice unlockables to keep the game interesting.  The price might be a deal-breaker for some, but if you ever see it on sale I wholly recommend it.  Every class has a unique feel and the branching paths and general pace of both games keeps things interesting for numerous playthroughs.  The Tower of Doom is the first of the two and feels somewhat limited in its controls, however the game does get easier once you get a feel for the momentum of your character.  While I do prefer Shadow of Mystara for its faster gameplay and smoother controls, I still suggest that you give the Tower of Doom a try.  Shadow of Mystara is the second game in the bundle and feels much smoother in controls.  Characters move more naturally and the inventory system is more complex without being cumbersome.   One thing of note is that the game seems to have trouble accepting any controller that isn't an official Xbox 360 controller.  That seems to be my luck, anyway.   If you can manage to get a game going with other people the game gets even better, but I suggest you check a guide to ensure that you can manage a proper setup for multiple players if you plan on using the local co-op function.

												WATCH OUT FOR the ""Autosave Failed"" error when you instal the game. It's a permissions issue. The game can't create the folder it needs. You're going to have to manually create the folder:  C:\Users\<User name here>\Saved Games\Capcom\Dungeons & Dragons\Saved GamesNeed more Golden Ax (1)? This has got your fix covered. Anouther great (old) arcade side scroll with endless continues. Saves available at the end of each chapter/stage & cheat options unlockable. Not much following for the online mode. About 95% of my logged playtime is me in the online lobby watching a movie. Feel free to friend me if you want to play co-op. Your character saves can be revisited per chapter in case you need to go back & find that sword drop you missed. Only downside: unlike most D&D games it doesn't allow you to inport your end game character thru the game again. I recommend starting as the cleric until you can get the vampire healing cheat unlocked then play as one of the other characters... or just the female elf since she has way too many spell options, unlimited rapid fire arrows & these ranged options now double as easy healing.

But for me... its a problem, yes I'm aware there's ""elimination mode"" which only offers one continue, but thats sorta like removing a wart with amputation. Its a good game, but I just really wish there was a limited life setting, yes I know I can just CHOOSE to stop continuing after a certain point, but I don't really trust myself or my friends to do that...

												This game... Is very challenging. However, it is much more diverse and complicated compared to other arcade games from it's time. The graphics are great, and they incorporate the usage of D&D rules well. They're games that stay fresh, offering different classes with different skills. While the game is very fun even when playing alone, it's always a blast when playing with other people, as the classes synergize better, and the feeling of kicking butt seems a whole lot better. All in all, these games are VERY hard, but can definitely be done in one go. Like actual D&D, you can choose between various paths throughout the games, which makes every single playthrough feeling fresh, making you eager to see what you could've done instead. Both games are very solid, but the sequel, Shadow over Mystara, is a big step up from the first game. This game will keep you coming back, wanting to know everything you can do.			"

												How many of us are old enough to remember the glory days of the arcade? Before all this here internet gaming got itself going, well, we actually had to get out of the house if we wanted to go and play with other people. Oftentimes they would be found out at the mall, as part of a bowling alley, or maybe you were lucky enough to live near something like a Showbiz Pizza (nowadays known as Chuck E. Cheese) or an Enchanted Castle. They used to have all kinds of games that never used to see a home release- shooters, driving games... but my favorite were the multiplayer beat-em-ups. The Simpsons and Ninja Turtle four-player cabinets were really fun, and who could forget that X-Men double-screen six-player game? If you could get six players going on that, it was the stuff of legends.Out of all of them, well... my favorite really wasn't any of those. This was about the time in my life where I was starting to spread my little nerd wings, and well... I spied a certain franchise on a few arcade cabinets- Dungeons and Dragons. Guess where multiple bucks worth of my tokens could be counted on to reliably end up when I went out to game? It was always a chore to choose which of the two to play- unless I just dropped twenty bucks on tokens and played through both games, one after the other with a meal break in between. Those were the days... until I moved away and couldn't play them for the longest time.Most of the arcades have closed down- but thanks to some wonderful people, well... these two games have been preserved and re-released on Steam, and to be honest, I couldn't be happier. So go grab your character sheets, dice bags and cheez doodles, today we're looking at Dungeons and Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara.Consisting of two games- Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara, both of these games take place in the Mystara campaign setting. The premise, well, is very simple- you're one of an adventuring party in each game, choosing between four different classes in ToD- warrior, dwarf, cleric, and elf, with Shadows adding in a thief and a magic-user. You're tasked with finding out just what the heck is going onto cause a rise in monster attacks on villages, and from there, well... no, I'm not going to spoil it! Just play them in order- finish Tower before you play Shadows and you'll get the whole story!The action of this game brings to mind someone dropping a D&D adventure and a Final Fight arcade board into a blender and hitting frappe- you'll work through a number of levels, knocking the heads of classic D&D monsters like goblins, kobolds, gnolls, owlbears and others as you battle through to find yourselves the culprits as just just what the blazes is going on- picking up massive piles of shiny treasure, powerful weapons and magical artifacts along the way, gaining experience as you bash in heads. You'll hit levels at certain points of XP, granting better health, power and special abilities. The money you collect even has a purpose- sometimes you'll hit a between-level shop and be able to refill disposable things like burning oil, hammers, daggers, arrows...Oh, did I forget to mention that? Every character gets a number of ring menus full of stuff to use instead of their regular weapon- this is most important for your caster classes, because it's how you access your spells. Just tap the ring button, tap until you have the spell you desire (Spells go by level- you get a certain number of spells per level per life, and once you burn through them all, you better hope more scrolls drop out of chests or you're going to be out of luck and down to whacking stuff. For example, Fireball and Lightning Bolt are both third-level spells), and then select it and hit the action button to let that sucker fly. Just beware that certain spells just won't work on everything- Cloudkill doesn't affect skeletons, for example.A number of stages contain various routes or selections- you will sometimes be given a choice of routes to take, or you might be up against a time limit to kill something. You could also find secret treasures. All in all, they're both really solid beat-em-ups and worth plying over and over and over...The best part of these games, however, was actually included- the multiplayer. Feel like risking your sanity with some random Steam gamers? Make a public game and wait for slots to be filled... or you could just get a bunch of your friends together and make a private game- and then invite friends directly from your Steam friends list. Easy, simple multiplayer- you can easily kill a late night with this game, and it's a blast to play because you can keep going as long as you want and then people can drop in and out. That fluid, that seamless. All the other players have to do is wait a few minutes.Downsides to these games... well... hmmm... They end? There haven't been sequels? The fantasy theme might turn some people off? Each fighter is limited to one of two looks and can't change gender?The price point is fifteen bucks retail, but it might catch sales that could knock it to half or better. Even at fifteen, though, it's a good purchase, and completely worth it.You can't go wrong with this one- just buy it, install it, and enjoy.TL;DR - This will let you slay your boredom for 14d6+10 fun damage. 9/10.

												This is a straight up classic D&D arcade style game. I would recommend using the controller for classic feel that i first experienced in the video game arcades i populated back when horseless carriages were still new and scary. Story and structure are very basic and linear. This is not going to be a long nor sweeping game but the classic feel and the old school play style are excellent for the gamer who likes to swim in nostalgia. If you didn't start off back in the AD&D (2nd edition to you youngsters) then you might not get much out of it but for you geezers that love slaying an old school owlbear or troll or heck even a red dragon then put your quarters away, download the game and get ready for some arcade dungeon fun.

												I played this game growing up, so to see it spring up on Steam after all these years (along with it's sequel!) was a surprise. I can say that it has made the transition seamlessly and keeps the side-scrolling, button bashing fun that I remember from my childhood. Complete with the timed selection and shop screens to the skippable/fastforwardable cut scenes.If you enjoyed games like Golden Axe in your youth, then this game is definitely worth getting. It runs on any system, it has local co-op, the unlock/challenge mode is fun and it's a nostalgic blast from the past that stands the test of time.Enjoy.			"

												That game is some sort of relief for those who had a really hard time back then, spending thousands of quarters in those classic Arcade machines while trying to finish the game. Well, not only for them, because there're also those who've suffered with desync problems in Kaillera. The final touch that we have are the achievements that are present on this Steam version (where are the cards, damn it). Well, besides these considerations, the game is pretty much the same we're all used to, except that nowadays you don't need to carry a bag of quarters in order to finish (and also the hi-scores are pretty much irrelevant). Seriously, I don't know why the PC is such a poor platform for beat'em ups, there should definitely exist more of these. To put it short, choose your class and have fun!			"

												Wow playing an arcade game with infinte amount of fake quartes is so much better than spending double digits (not including the decimal) worth of actual qaurters; AND IT'S TWO GAMES OMG. I remember my first time playing tower of doom was at a hotel with my older brother playing co-op two player. That day we dropped just under 20$ in the struggle to beat the game unfornuatly we failed just short of the finale and to our dismay we were out of money..... Self loathing at ourselves for being lured into the epicness of the game and wasting our hard earned money we forgot it. That is until I discovered it on steam and with a sequel. So many memories came rushing back and then anger at the fact I could of waited a couple years and gotten two games for under 15$ instead of wasting under 20$ to play one (>.>). Never the less I am pleased with my purchase and hopefull I can once again play co-op with my bro. Thanks steam and thankyou wallet for containing more than my child self.			"

												It's a fun enough beat-em-up. I remember the old arcade game, and just what a quarter-eating beast it was. Picking this up on sale for $5 is definitely preferable to the $15 I would have spent at the arcade trying to get to the end. Relative to other brawler games from the era, there is some depth to this one. That said, even with the range of character options and branching story paths, it's still a short game (I beat both campaigns in about 4 hours) with a lot of repetitive action. There are better games for $15, but if you're nostalgic for the old arcade game, it's worth picking this up on sale.			"

I decided to get it with a Steam card and try it out. I made the right decision. It has not one, but two awesome Dungeons and Dragons arcade hack-and-slashers. Besides having very accurate rules, it's fun! I have and still enjoy it often with friends and family. You can play with a wired gamepad or with the keyboard, and even both at once! It is definitely a game I recommend to both the D&D community, and those who like a good arcade hack-and-slash.			"

But for me... its a problem, yes I'm aware there's ""elimination mode"" which only offers one continue, but thats sorta like removing a wart with amputation. Its a good game, but I just really wish there was a limited life setting, yes I know I can just CHOOSE to stop continuing after a certain point, but I don't really trust myself or my friends to do that...

												Chronicles of Mystara is a port of two Capcom arcade beat-'em-ups from the mid-nineties. The main gimmick is that this is not only a solid beat 'em up, but one that's set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe, which means neat little features like access to a limited number of powerful spells that get recharged after a ""rest"", enemies that have mechanics like their tabletop counterparts (Undead, for instance, can't be hurt by any type of gas attack because they don't have lungs), and explorable environments with a few secret areas tucked here and there with bonus loot, and branching paths that, while not affecting the plot in any way, increase replayability in a MASSIVE way. With four to six playable classes, depending on whether you're playing Tower of Doom or Shadow over Mystara (the later of which has alternate variants of the Cleric and Magic User classes with different spells, bringing the effective total closer to 8), plenty of levels, and a rather ridiculous amount of loot to find, this is one beat 'em up with a LOT of meat on its bones. This port even comes with achievement milestones, adding even more to the pile. It's a fair amount of content for the asking price, especially on sale.Unfortunately, the playerbase is a bit small these days, so random matchmaking is a bit empty. This is definitely the type of game where buying a 4-pack to split with your friends is a solid investment.			"

												How many of us are old enough to remember the glory days of the arcade? Before all this here internet gaming got itself going, well, we actually had to get out of the house if we wanted to go and play with other people. Oftentimes they would be found out at the mall, as part of a bowling alley, or maybe you were lucky enough to live near something like a Showbiz Pizza (nowadays known as Chuck E. Cheese) or an Enchanted Castle. They used to have all kinds of games that never used to see a home release- shooters, driving games... but my favorite were the multiplayer beat-em-ups. The Simpsons and Ninja Turtle four-player cabinets were really fun, and who could forget that X-Men double-screen six-player game? If you could get six players going on that, it was the stuff of legends.Out of all of them, well... my favorite really wasn't any of those. This was about the time in my life where I was starting to spread my little nerd wings, and well... I spied a certain franchise on a few arcade cabinets- Dungeons and Dragons. Guess where multiple bucks worth of my tokens could be counted on to reliably end up when I went out to game? It was always a chore to choose which of the two to play- unless I just dropped twenty bucks on tokens and played through both games, one after the other with a meal break in between. Those were the days... until I moved away and couldn't play them for the longest time.Most of the arcades have closed down- but thanks to some wonderful people, well... these two games have been preserved and re-released on Steam, and to be honest, I couldn't be happier. So go grab your character sheets, dice bags and cheez doodles, today we're looking at Dungeons and Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara.Consisting of two games- Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara, both of these games take place in the Mystara campaign setting. The premise, well, is very simple- you're one of an adventuring party in each game, choosing between four different classes in ToD- warrior, dwarf, cleric, and elf, with Shadows adding in a thief and a magic-user. You're tasked with finding out just what the heck is going onto cause a rise in monster attacks on villages, and from there, well... no, I'm not going to spoil it! Just play them in order- finish Tower before you play Shadows and you'll get the whole story!The action of this game brings to mind someone dropping a D&D adventure and a Final Fight arcade board into a blender and hitting frappe- you'll work through a number of levels, knocking the heads of classic D&D monsters like goblins, kobolds, gnolls, owlbears and others as you battle through to find yourselves the culprits as just just what the blazes is going on- picking up massive piles of shiny treasure, powerful weapons and magical artifacts along the way, gaining experience as you bash in heads. You'll hit levels at certain points of XP, granting better health, power and special abilities. The money you collect even has a purpose- sometimes you'll hit a between-level shop and be able to refill disposable things like burning oil, hammers, daggers, arrows...Oh, did I forget to mention that? Every character gets a number of ring menus full of stuff to use instead of their regular weapon- this is most important for your caster classes, because it's how you access your spells. Just tap the ring button, tap until you have the spell you desire (Spells go by level- you get a certain number of spells per level per life, and once you burn through them all, you better hope more scrolls drop out of chests or you're going to be out of luck and down to whacking stuff. For example, Fireball and Lightning Bolt are both third-level spells), and then select it and hit the action button to let that sucker fly. Just beware that certain spells just won't work on everything- Cloudkill doesn't affect skeletons, for example.A number of stages contain various routes or selections- you will sometimes be given a choice of routes to take, or you might be up against a time limit to kill something. You could also find secret treasures. All in all, they're both really solid beat-em-ups and worth plying over and over and over...The best part of these games, however, was actually included- the multiplayer. Feel like risking your sanity with some random Steam gamers? Make a public game and wait for slots to be filled... or you could just get a bunch of your friends together and make a private game- and then invite friends directly from your Steam friends list. Easy, simple multiplayer- you can easily kill a late night with this game, and it's a blast to play because you can keep going as long as you want and then people can drop in and out. That fluid, that seamless. All the other players have to do is wait a few minutes.Downsides to these games... well... hmmm... They end? There haven't been sequels? The fantasy theme might turn some people off? Each fighter is limited to one of two looks and can't change gender?The price point is fifteen bucks retail, but it might catch sales that could knock it to half or better. Even at fifteen, though, it's a good purchase, and completely worth it.You can't go wrong with this one- just buy it, install it, and enjoy.TL;DR - This will let you slay your boredom for 14d6+10 fun damage. 9/10.

												Stand Out Featues: One of the deepest arcade beat-em-up experiences available, both back in its day and today.  Characters have special moves, magic, swappable equipment and individual inventories.  Monsters have weaknesses that can be exploited or special rules that must be factored into combat strategies (Such as the Beholder, who will cause spells to fizzle if he's looking at the character when they attempt to cast).  Multiple paths are available to the party both in game and between stages, including hidden paths that can lead to powerful weapons or items.Pros: High quality pixel art that holds up well despite its age.  Aforementioned deep gameplay.  Excellent variety between the six playable characters to encourage replayability.  Game logic largely adheres to DnD lore, allowing players invested in such things to get an edge against the various monsters.  No longer swallows your weekly allowance, quarter by quarter.Cons: No in-built Playstation controller support, requiring 3rd party software to integrate (Windows/Xbox supported controllers okay).  Bonus features offered in the remake not exciting enough to recommend as a selling point.  Some ""arcade difficulty"" (I.E. sudden spikes in movement speed or invulnerability frames designed to drain your life bar and force more of your quarters into the belly of the machine).Would Recommend To: Fans of Beat-Em-Up games.  Fans of 90s arcade games.  Fans of DnD.  Millenials wondering why all those 30 something youtubers keep referring to the 90s as the golden age of gaming.  30 something youtubers and their audiences who cannot get beyond the 90s.  Anyone with $15.00 to spare, a few friends to play with, and a hunger for a fantasy adventure experience.			"

												A blast from the arcade beat 'em up past, and a more complex example of that bygone era of gaming. Good as a single player game, but joining friends is recommended for a better experience. The D&D theme helps make for a more interesting playthrough, but it is far from a RPG. While it does show its age in places, don't let that stop you from giving it a try.			"

												I'm just doing this for the Steam Award badge. But seriously, great beat 'em up that sprinkles in rules from AD&D. Comes with online multiplayer and very nicely detailed sprites and animation.			"

												If you have ever played and enjoyed dungeons & drgaons beat 'em up - this compilation is amazing. So many secrets and combos packed up in a ""simple quarter eater"" makes this game still fresh even if it is 20 years old.And added achievement system is highly satisfying.10/10 recommend			"

												Just plain great. A well made action game which is for fans of DND or just plain fast and fun gameplay. The variety between classes and the replayability of the overall game can put most triple AAA game offerings to shame. The addition of additional gameplay with ingame vault unlocks helps with the replayability. Give this game a shot if you love beat em ups. You will not regret it.			"

												One of my favorite arcade games as a kid still holds up today.Combat depth with every character playing very differently, as well as  the controls still being as intricate as they were on the cabinate.speaking as a fan, if you were into this back in the 90s... a must buy. though they did remove the continue sound bite, ""welcom to a dnd world!""as a modern gamer... This is a traditional arcade port in the sense that the developmentsensibilities remain the same... meaning, it was made to kill you. you need to get use to the controls as some of the more expected simpler actions may seem complicated to pull off in various scenarios, i.e. blocking during combat against a horde of enemies may frustrate you. you hold attack then move Backward to block... pulling off a slide is worse lol.for me, its not a problem... its like getting into marvel v capcom 2 again...but for the modern gamer... it might take some effort. all in all, it is pretty true to basic dnd and the controls are tight and responsive. the games are both pretty content heavy, with multiple choices and routes to take or discover on your adventure.The game functions very well... No framedrops as far as I've seen... and no crashing.I bought this as soon as it came out... played it for like an hour or two... and loved it... as of this review... I only recently hopped back into it after taking care of some ofmy backlog... and am full hooked again... its a great game to jump in and out of...if your not into playing any of your games atm but still want to just play something... This is it.			"

												Simply put it is one of the best beat 'em ups i've played, it is fantastic local multiplayer and it does a damn good job of recreating the RPG experience of playing D&D but in a wildly different fighting game set up! Also I should mention that this has 2 full games in it and both have a lot of replayability since you have to choose your course practically after every level.This game is worth the normal price but on sale I would say it would be an instant buy for me.

												Get it on sale, it's fun but not worth the full price,  Completed all challenges around 12 hours. Not much replay value after that.  This is not a HD remaster, just retweaked and repackaged.			"

												Great action side-scroller games. Have fond memories of playing it in the arcade.More interesting and hilarious if played with friends.Now that its on Steam, I can play it again with more friends.Works very well with a controller, as it was designed for arcade.Though some bosses were really a coin sink...

												Fun low priced game for friends. Reminds me of some SNES classic brawlers. One play through of the Chronicles of Mystara portion took me and one friend roughly 1.5-2 hours. The text scrolls a bit too fast but it kind of makes it comical. I like the ability to poke the shopkeepers haha. Pretty neat classic arcade game overall. I bought it as a 4-pack and it runs smooth for all of us.			"

												There aren't a whole lot of classic arcade games on Steam, and fewer of them are classic beat-em-ups. The two games that make up Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara, Tower of Doom and Shadow over Mystara, both scratch that particular itch quite well while throwing in RPG elements. Both games are quite fun with great spritework, and they're both emulated very well. I preferred Shadow over Mystara, but both games in this collection are well worth playing.			"

												If I could have told myself 20 years ago at Chuckie Cheeses that one day this arcade game would be available at my very own home....I still would have blown $10 worth of tokens trying to beat a boss. It loses a lot of the urgency to play well when you can just continue infinitely, but its fun to hack and slash through, and finally see the whole game past the first 2-3  stages. I thought it was pretty much only for nostalgic types, but the kids have got on and played through it as well and seemed to like it as a change of pace. It's not going to keep you occupied for 50 hours, but it is a fun and pretty quick playthrough. Probably not popular enough to remaster, so you've got the classic, very dated graphics.			"

												This is the old dungeon & dragons arcade game, those game were meant to played in coop with friend by your side, you could always solo it but it is not as much fun that way. I bought it just for that purpose for when my friend come over and we can have a blast playing it together, too bad it does not happen more often.			"
