""Remember: there are no problems, only challenges!""Considering all my experiences with Daedalic Entertainment so far, I tend to hold a middle ground in my judgements. The game is either perfect - like Memoria - or consists of a perfect idea ruined in rushed display - like Whispered World. On a 50-50 gamble, I took my chance and I'm happy to declare that The Night of the Rabbit went to snatch itself a place among the perfect ones.Meet Jeremiah Hazelnut, a young boy who lives in a forest hut with his mother, and it's the last two days of his summer vacation. Young Jerry ventures out to the forest to find himself an adventure before dinner, and ends up meeting a strange rabbit named Marquis de Hoto who offers Jerry the great opportunity to become a wizard's apprentice! Marquis promises Jerry that he'll be home before dinner, and takes him to the village of Mousewood, where he'll be trained in the art of arts: magic! As Jerry proudly declares: Anything's possible on a day in summer vacation!Before getting into gameplay, I'd like to take a moment to talk about the atmosphere of the game. The whole setting is already captivating with beautiful 2D art backgrounds, enchanting soundtrack and loveable characters as if they are taken out of a beloved children's book. Aside the trademark folklore themes of mainland Europe, numerous other mythologies are carefully wrapped up into a well-balanced setting of its own in this wondrous little tale. Character depth and storytelling are marvelous, voice acting is stunning and dialogue interactions vary between conjuring a warm smile on your face and inviting you to sudden striking realizations on human nature. Don't let the cute setting fool you; I took a pause to consider the wisdom behind an unexpected remark made in game more than once.For the gameplay: it is a bit more than your casual point and click adventure. For the most part of the game, you are presented with a townful of people and places to explore, and also a handful of side stories and/or quests to accomplish aside the main scenario with card rewards. Item combinations are imaginative, yet not obscure at all. With some observation, it is possible to go through the whole game. Through his adventures, Jerry will learn some spells that will enrich the gameplay and present you new options of exploration; like talking to statues, growing plants in mere seconds, changing shape... and even make impossible, possible!One of my favorite parts in the game is that you are encouraged to collect some mysterious cards in your explorations which you can use to play a card game named Quartets with the town's inhabitants. It is a lovely mini game that takes some attention and an exercise of memory. The game also contains some collectibles for you to look for - like stickers, dew drops and stories told by a mysterious woodspirit. They are not a must, but collecting them reveals some side lore to the game that you may enjoy very much. Every detail is carefully placed to make a whole masterfully. There is a variety of things to do in this game which offers at least 10 hours of gameplay roughly.As a final word, when I chose to play The Night of the Rabbit, I wasn't expecting this kind of quality in setting, story, narration or gameplay. This is a wonderful and imaginative tale that I'll remember for a long time. Jerry's tale might have ended here, but I wonder if Mousewood or Marquis made their last appearances... I wish not.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: The Night of the Rabbit Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Point & Click; Adventure; Story Rich; Atmospheric; Artistic  My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 12-18 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamersREVIEWNight of the Rabbit may be Deadalic Entertainment's best work yet... and that is saying something.  In my opinion, they are one of the premiere developers of point-and-click adventure games today.  All of their games have a certain ""charm"" about them that make them so appealing.  Well Night of the Rabbit may be the quintessential example of that ""Deadalic Charm.""The puzzles make sense for the most part, and there are in-game hints which can help you along.  The artwork is amazing and the soundscape is phenomenal. I really liked the music.  The voice acting is well done, although some of the lines are a bit forced and a bit corny. And the overall story is intriguing and well-told.  Also, I experienced no glitches/bugs or crashing. It is an undeniably well-crafted game.It is also a rather long game for the point-and-click genre.  It does drag on a little towards the end.  One thing that most Deadalic games do well is timing, where they end just as they start to get old... but this one definitely has an hour or three more than it needs to.  So: if you get bored of games easily, you might want to be aware of this.There are  lots of extras in the game that you don't commonly see in point-and-click games, like collectibles... and even a card-based mini-game similar to gin/go-fish.  Although I personally thought they could have made the card game more fun (it is very luck based), it was a cool little extra.All in all, though, I thought this was a great game.  Probably Deadalic's best work so far.  If you are a fan of point-and-click games this is a must play!Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												This game is a work of art.  The music, the art, the voice-acting, the story, and even the hidden collectables are magnificent.  Even if you use a walk through the whole time (some of the puzzles are less than intiutive), it is worth playing and sharing.  The creators even included 8 recorded stories, beautifully written and read, as one of the collectibles.  The dedication and care put into this game are evident and the experience is inifinitely better for it.  After playing it through once, I would happily play it again, just to get all the collectibles and enjoy the story once more. I wish more games were like this one.			"

												Enter the realm of Mousewood where a world filled with magic and warm feelings wait for you and your journey to begin. As soon you start the game, the first thing you will notice is how unique the art style is. With warm and vibrant colours, The Night of the Rabbit is the perfect (summer) adventure to play any time of the year, it's easy to fall in this world, it's charming and will win your heart, if you allow it. Without giving too much information, it's wise to understand that not everything is what's appear to be. There is plenty of mystery and magic surrounding Mousewood with plenty to see in a selection of different locations.Filled by imagination and creativity you will encounter puzzles through your journey. Depending on your perception, these can be easy to medium difficulty while others may take some time to understand. You will have to meet new people, do some favours, help others, gather materials and much more in order to advance the Story. While advancing through the game you will listen the amazing soundtrack that makes a nice companion. It's already easy for you to fall in the story due the charm of the art style but music always played an important role in these types of games and it's great to see that such role was not ignored during the creation of the game.While playing the game, enjoying the scenery, listening to the music, narration and other character's stories it took me about 14 hours -give or take- to finish the game. Not once I felt the rush or need to end the story in a quick session or two. It's a pleasant game to play in a very calm and relaxed environment that will leave you stuck to your monitor until the very end. If you are like me, I do enjoy to play certain games during certain seasons of the year. With Autumn coming soon and then Winter, The Night of the Rabbit is the perfect fit to play after a long tiresome day or during that rainy, cold afternoon while having some warm coffee or tea by your side to keep you warm. I know it may seem odd, but having a nice surrounding while playing some games can make the immersion even bigger (and better) and this is something important while playing any type of game. If you are a fan of point and click games, intriguing stories and astonishing visuals thanks to a well drawn art style, then this may be the game for you. It's a game telling a story, a game that asks the player not to see a journey but to go with it and tag along as you play Jerry, the main character.			"

												I really want to love this game. The visuals are stellar; it gives a very winnie the pooh-esque vibe that fills me with nostalgia. The characters are adorable and the writing in terms of dialogue is fantastic. This is just not an enjoyable GAME. Mind you, I've played Walking Dead, all of the Monkey Island games, three Ace Attorney  games, All three seasons of the new Sam and Max games, I even played a few Myst titles and Milo. This game has very little understanding of common logic. You grind every piece of furniture and tools in where you wish for it to go. No characters are helpful in terms of advice, some even lie to you about how you are expected to solve certain challenges. What frustrates me is what clues ARE given are just vague enough to drive you crazy. Puzzles like ""draw on a rock"" in the middle of several areas FULL of rocks can be quite maddening. Or perhaps you have all you need to solve a puzzle with a certain character, but the game refuses to recognize your solution until a certain amount of other events have come to pass elsewhere. Some Point-and-Clicks are quite guilty of this, but never has such a problem stopped me dead in my tracks so utterly. When I played past games and came to a solution, I felt satisfied, happy even. Here, I am frustrated at how much time is lost due to a require psychic understanding of the programmer's problem solving. I will give the game credit: the story is stellar. A very Whovian quality to the intention. I would reccommend watching it. or playing through it with a guide. But this is a very frustrating adventure game. If there was a more straightforward way to offer hints, or if the level design wasn't built to offer misleading soutions, I'd reccommend it. in it's current form: I only say watch it for its story.

												This is Daedalic's true masterpiece and it could possibly be the best p&c adventure game ever made. I can't recommend it highly enough.It gets the atmosphere perfectly... the game's world is absolutely beautiful and the characters are quirky and interesting. The themes are deep and though there is a bittersweet and nostalgic feeling to it in certain ways, the game is fun and lighthearted and it will quickly draw you in to its enchanted world. I only wish more games were this thoughtful and incredibly well done.			"

Posted: January 2, 2015
												The Night of the Rabbit is phenomenal. A great story, beautiful music, hand drawn art and clever puzzles, and it all works together perfectly. A near perfect point-and-click adventure experience.Lets start with the music. The first thing you hear when you start the game is a melodious theme that can only be described as the game in music form. It is near indescribable how perfect the main theme is. The rest of the music is also amazing, enhancing the atmosphere of the game, deepening the emotion of various scenes.The hand drawn art is beautiful, has a unique style, and is a perfect medium in which to tell the story of Jerry and his journey into the realm of magic. Visually, the game is very pretty to look at, but it's the attention to detail that truly brings this fantasy realm to life. In addition, the transition from cut-scene to game is near seamless. You almost can't tell you're watching a video.The story is just as mystery filled as you'd expect from a journey into the realm of magic. The intro does a great job of setting the tone of the story, and it carries all the way to the end. Jerry's story is told near perfect, the conclusion of his story is satisfying. But the end is so open, with so many questions remaining, so much left to explore. So many avenues for further adventure. I really hope this game gets a sequel. It truly deserves one, crafted with the same love and dedication.Like all point-and-click adventures, the gameplay is as you would expect. You use the mouse to interact with the environment, the people and objects within. The items you collect are then used to solve a variety of clever puzzles throughout the game. Many of the puzzles are crafty, and even though you can see the solution, there's always another clever obstacle to overcome. The puzzles are very seamless in execution.You can observe all the objects you can interact with by clicking on a magic coin in the inventory (a clever means of integrating a gameplay element into the story). This is a brilliant addition to point-and-click adventure gameplay as it's sometimes easy to miss key items lying around. The only downside is that the coin only shows the interactive elements for a moment, too short to take in everything. You can continuously observe the interactive objects by holding the shortcut key (holding spacebar), but it would have been nice to have the mouse implementation be given some better functionality.There is also a minor bug where you sometimes can't open the inventory by clicking on the backpack. There were only two points in the game where I observed this. The first was after exiting the boat, but going to the title menu and then returning to the game fixes this. The second one is more annoying. At the outpost in the frozen land (and only at this screen), the only way to access the inventory is via the inventory shortcut (pressing I). The mousewheel method of accessing the inventory may still work, but I never used it so I can't say. The bug is a minor annoyance, and to be fair, it's the only bug I encountered throughout the game.The Night of the Rabbit is exceptional. I recommend it to any fan of the adventure genre.			"

												There's a lot to say about this game. There's so much about it that I loved, and though it has its flaws, I think the pros far outweigh the cons. First and foremost, the real pleasure of this game is in exploring the world. Its environment and ambiance are fantastic. The art style, the many yet small world-building details, the sense of history and mythology, and the characters populating Mousewood all give layers upon layers to this world. And that's just the area in and around Mousewood--as the plot progresses, more worlds are opened to the main character, Jerry, and though they're less detailed than the ""home world"" of Mousewood, they're each interesting and beautiful in their own ways. They all contribute to the overall environment. I was definitely immersed. Secondly, the story. (I won't give an overview of the basic plot, because the previews and official overview tell you everything you need to know on that front.) In the early stages of the game, I wasn't sure if the central plot would really solidify, and that might be one of the game's flaws--the main plot takes some time to launch. In the beginning of the game Jerry spends most of his time helping the inhabitants of Mousewood in small ways. The purpose is obviously to familiarize the player with Mousewood and with all the characters, and in that sense it did contribute to the world-building; however, it did feel a bit slow in places. When hints of the central plot did show through, they seemed a bit disjointed, all vaguely connected but with no discernible purpose or relationship. It was almost like soup that wouldn't thicken, and it did distract me at times. However, as I got farther into the game (especially at about the halfway point), the hints started coming together. The soup thickened. And the further I played, the more I found the story to be multilayered and imaginative. The final scenes of the game really click everything into place. The end made me want to immediately replay the game so I could more fully appreciate all the hints dropped in the beginning. I'm not sure if this is a pro or con, but the puzzles were largely unremarkable. There were a few stand out puzzles I enjoyed, but for the most part they were pretty obvious. The real flaws of the game, in my opinion, are more mechanical than substantive. The voice acting is often overwhelmed by the music/ambient noises in the game (bird calls, wind, bug noises, etc.). I'm not really sure what the problem is, if it's particular to my computer or to the game's software (I think it's probably the latter), but in many scenes I could just barely hear the voices with my speaker volume turned almost all the way up--which is a shame, because I liked the voice acting that I could actually hear. Sometimes there are strangely-placed, longish pauses in dialogue that feel awkward and make scenes drag. And though I do love the art, the moving animation can be a bit stilted. Whether or not you buy the game depends on the experience you're looking for. If you want something fast-paced and high-action, I would pass. If you're looking for a fun, detailed world with colorful characters, and you have the patience to wait until the very end of the game to understand the full complexity of the plot, then I would highly recommend The Night of the Rabbit.

												I bougth this game because I like Deadalic point and click games however I have mixed feelings about it. The graphics are good, the hero is enjoyable but there is a lot of backtracking required. In the end I would recommend it if you are a fan of the genre or of the games created by Deadalic. If you are not, maybe it is best to look elsewhere. Good game but not the best in the crop.			"

												One of the best games that I've ever played when I first started my steam account. This game was what got me in love with story-based games for its beautiful storyline about a boy and a rabbit. It's graphics, music and even voice acting was pretty well done, and the storyline was really straightforward. It contained puzzles that you'll have to solve, it's not that hard and pretty simple for a nuthead like me to play (although I have to admit to looking up the guide list).Even completing the story I had to replay a secondtime only because it was really amazing and I wanted to collect the 'Bonus' storylines as it felt like an 'afterstory' to The Night Of The Rabbit. Until now I still feel like replaying it again just to see the storyline. Really worth my $20 I could say, never regretted it at all.			"

												Twelve year old Jeremiah Hazelnut gets his dream fulfilled, when he begins his training as a magician of the most important sort! A grand adventure it is! This game is one of the best adventure games I have played in a long time. The story alone is the most admiring part of this game and I'd say that is a big achievement in these modern times where most games needs to be ""idiotically interesting"" the moment it begins. I find it so adoring because Jerry's (Jeremiah, the boy you play as) dream is so damn relateable from my own childhood. If I should compare the game to Daedelic's ""Deponia"", which is the only other Daedelic game I played, I would say Night of the Rabbit managed to capture me much faster than Deponia did. Of course  Deponia was also split into three games which is kind of the killer for me (Still loved it though). Night of the Rabbit became more and more interesting and exciting the closer to the ending it got and does not leave me with disappointing questions in the end. 9/10 - The only problem I have, which is a problem I have with all puzzle games, is that I suck at them. Not the games fault, but at least the game was wondrously interesting enough to (find a walktrough) keep playing and complete.			"

												With the Deponia series up to a trilogy, Daedalic Entertainment brings you another one of their line-up of games that attempts to try and restore the nostalgia of the early point-and-click games from the 90's. That game is ""The Night of the Rabbit"", alternatively called ""The Rabbit's Apprentice"".Although the title is not a major problem of the entire game (considering how most of the game is focused on a young 12-year-old boy named ""Jerry Hazelnut""), it's harmless enough.In my opinion, this game feels ENCHANTING to play through. From the moment you start playing it from the moment it concludes. It's exactly how I feel a magical adventure needs to be driven. Obviously, I haven't played the Deponia series yet, so I wouldn't be familiar with the gaming elements that Daedalic Entertainment incoporates in their line-up of game titles. The story has a couple of pacing issues here because of the puzzles but even that dosen't deter that the puzzles are creative and thought-provoking (not to a brain-aching degree). The puzzles in this game were logical and that makes it much more prouder. But when the story picks up, it's usually around 6 hours into the game. Turning from a light-hearted beginning to a dark twisting turn towards the end. The story is deep, complex and revolves around the dark side of Mousewood. Many people might find this to be a derivative story, as Harry Potter had this kind of plot also but while I find it not the best story a game has to offer, it's enough to make a game to support it.The HD-graphics provided in the game are lush, clear, vibrant and sometimes colourful and really blends in with the tone of the story. Throughout most of the game, I took most of the magical setting of Mousewood and wanted Daedalic to expand more on the mythology of Mousewood as my interest is high.The music is absolutely WONDERFUL and it matches the music quality of Rayman Origins as my favourite video game soundtracks of my past gaming experience. Throughout the soundtrack, it follows one leitmotif and is heard in a couple of variations throughout each track and if you recognize that leitmotif, you'll know the whole game. Tilo Alpermann has done a great job of captivating the story of the game and transpired it into music.The characters are also well done, too. Each character I interact with has their moment on the screen. There is no comic reliefs, no over-the-top characters and DEFINETLY NO LOVE INTERESTS. The characters here are subtle and help add more to the story, development to the main characters and more to the history and setting of Mousewood.However... the voicework is a bit off. Most of the time, the acting ranges from ""not even trying"" to ""I'm REALLY trying"" and yet comes off as a first read of the script, with Jerry becoming the weakest.The sound mixing is inconsistent. For example, I had my music volume to 50 and my voice volume to 100 and yet I STILL cannot hear a word they were saying half the time. But a subtitles overlay option available resolves the issue.The dialogue was OK, but sometimes, the dialogue in the game can be a bit repetitive, as if they were trying to help pad the length of a point-and-click game. Repeated lines like a laugh, a ""Bah!"", or even ""mumbles"", ""whispers"", croaks"" & ""snores"" really makes me want to skip that portion of the dialogue. Sometimes, the characters in the game tend to slow down the speed of their dialogue to an absolute snail's pace.There were also a couple of bugs and glitches I spotted during the 3rd act of the game and that almost ruined the game's experience for me as it lags, stutters and just stops, and I had my computer down to the lowest settings.Oh, and the ""Quartets"" mini-game is the worst mini-game I have EVER played. The reason being is that the card game is like ""Go Fish"" and the opponent ALWAYS KNOWS WHAT CARD YOU HAVE!If you are a huge point-and-click fan, BUY THIS GAME. If you like being challenged with thought-provoking puzzles, BUY THIS GAME. It's one of those point-and-click games that wants to be explored and will be with you forever.7/10			"

Game has beautiful graphic and quest/riddles are logical and not overcomplicated. If we didn't solved anything right away it always ended - 'silly us , it was so obvious'. Story itself as the characters are just charming and reminds me a lot of Miss Potter fairy tales. I would recommend Night of the Rabbit to anyone who loves animals and has young soul or at least has young children :).			"

The artwork, the soundtrack, the voice acting and the puzzles are just wonderfully produced.

												Created by Daedalic Entertainment, this is the actually the first click and adventure game I have played from them and it appears that this game doesn't receive quite a lot of attention as the other more popular series (Deponia, Edna & Harvery, etc.) but The Night Of The Rabbit stands nicely  and here are my thoughts on it:(Edited 19th November 2014)1.) Graphics (9/10)Ah, this section is where the game truly shines. The background environment is really beatiful with a mystical charm to it and almost every parts of the game are interesting to view. No doubt that they have heavily emphasize on the artwork that compels you to explore further into the world of anthromorphic inhabited world of Mousewood. As for the characters, they are drawn in 2D graphics which works well for the beautiful background and simple to look at them. Quite a large amount of characters in here and most are based on animals.Despite all that, they are some minor problems I have seen in this game, in a sense with the dialogues that appear on screen does not match with the voice acting. However, it isn't really bad enough to ruin the experience.2.) GamePlay (7/10)As for this part, it is a simply, straight to the point clicking around until you make progress story wise game. It is a nice of them to include in a short tutorial on the controls and it was done in a fun way. As you continue on, you are required to solve many puzzles along the way, which requires you to combine items and using them. There are also  some puzzles which requires to be done in a certain order that would only work. No doubt that some puzzles can be challenging and you have to think hard in order to solve it.Unfortuntely, some puzzles can become cumbersome, back tracking involved routine and rather vague, despite the fact that you can refer to your journal which sadly offered only minimal help. There were a few several times when I got stuck completely  and had no choice but to end up relying on a guide by other players, which I have to admit this is a bit disappointing and it may cause some players to shy away. All in all, the puzzle part could have use more thought and polishing to it by the creators but still the job is done well enough for an indie game.3.) Sound / Voice Acting / Music (8.5/10)Oh boy this is another part where the game shines too, whereby most of all the characters (Except for a few particular residents of Mousewood) had their own voice acting that fits their personalities and appearance very well. From the main character to the most minor characters, it is nice to talk to them and listen to their various quirky and serious dialogues altogether.The music is really good too, even the main menu for a simple click adventure game can sound really mysterious when paused. Every parts of the game had their own distinct music and in my opinion it fits well on every mood.However, the most annoying part of the game is that during the process of solving a puzzle and if you made a mistake, you are forced to listen many of the same lines over and over again but thankfully this can be easily mitigated by simply skipping with clicks of the mouse. 4.) Story (7/10)The main part of the game, hmm to be honest I have mixed feelings about it. You play as a young boy by the name Jeremiah Hazelnut or simply called Jerry, a very tenacious and curious boy who would one day strive to become a famous magician. He is currently on a summer holiday which will end in two days and so Jerry decides to spend his two remanining days looking for adventures in an innocent child perspective right nearby the comfort of his home that lies at the edge of the town in a forest. As time passes, a strange mysterious letter appeared inside his mailbox and in it contains an magical incantation and an invitation for him to come over into the world of Mousewood.Jerry then gladly follows the instructions on the paper and with that it summons a very strange yet interesting character which happens to be an anthromorphic white rabbit namely Marquis De Hoto. The marquis turns out to be a magician and also a TreeWalker, who is capable of traversing through various portals found at certain places only and their main job is to help its inhabitants,  protect and restore the balance of many worlds. Being a naive minded yet excited typical of a boy, Jerry agrees to be his apprentice in order to become a great magician and from there the story continues.The first part of the game starts off pretty slow but as the game moves on we start to dwelve deeper into the mysteries of Mouseworld and other worlds that Jerry will visit in his quest, which picks up the story. But sadly, towards the last part of the game feels kind of rushed, sloppy and the ending, in my opinion was a bit lacking in its punch and left a few things unanswered. I'm not sure if this was intended by the creators to open for a sequel which I hope it may bring a closure to it.There is also the bonus content if you purchase the premium version of the game, it brings some stories which sets in the same universe of Mouseworld that you can see and unlocks along the way in your game play which brings a bit more content of the gameConclusion (8/10)In short, The Night Of The Rabbit excels in its Graphics and Audio department but slightly spoiled by certain tough puzzles and the lack of proper conclusion to the story as well as the quality dropping towards the end. Still, it makes for a good experience and I am certainly looking forward to seeing  a sequel being made for this game.			"

The Night of The Rabbit'The Night of The Rabbit' by Daedalic is indeed very enticing. The game starts with the life of an average boy, bearing the name Jerremiah Hazelnut, who has forever dreamed of being a greatly-renouned magician. One warm Summer day- also one of the last, a mysterious letter appears to slam harshly into Jerry's mailbox. At first it seems like a coincidence, but there is none. That starts a magical adventure as the apprentice of the Marquis de Hoto. Along this journey, you will hear whismical music, discovery new, vibrant worlds, meet unique characters, and enjoy the beautiful, colourful environment. On top of that also comes an outstanding plot, that has many variating twists. Along the way, you'll have to use your own logic to solve puzzles hidden in the point-and-click rythm of the game. But, sadly, smetimes the pace of the game can be slow, and the puzzles too challenging. By the end of the game, you have spent countless hours with the residents of the game, that it is almost sad to let them go.ProsOutstanding plotBeautiful, vibrant graphicsGreat musical scoreBecome a magicianSolve fun, but challenging logical problemsConsSometimes the pace of the game is a bit slowSometimes the puzzles are too challengingVerdictThe night of the rabbit has an amazing plot, and is natrually beautiful, and fun to play, but sometimes the pace of the game can get slow, and the puzzles can get quite a bit challenging.9/10			"

												This game, glitchy as it was prior to the patch, is sweet, and charming, and surprisingly immersive.  It is easy in adventure games to feel like your are just playing a fill-in-the-blank game that sucks up time but doesn't give much back.  But there is a truly emotional story here about friendship, environmental stewardship, and most importantly, redemption.  The music is excellent, and the characters memorable.  I was no fan of Deponia, because I disliked the characters, the heavy-handed message, and the cheap humour - Night of the Rabbit is quite the opposite: subtle and sweet.  I highly recommend it, even if you don't usually play adventure games - the story itself is well worth it.			"

												One of those rare titles that get better and better as the game progresses, ending with a beautiful, spectacular, satisfying conclusion. Only a few gripes - Jerry walks too slowly and though you can double-click to different screens, sometimes you just have to watch him slowly trudge along from one part of the screen to another. Also, the game takes a while to really get going, and this could put some people off (it almost did that to me). Some of the cool spells acquired later have great potential, but are usable in just very few situations - some just have one or two uses in all - which is a bit disappointing. Feels like they ran out of time to flesh some things out like those later spells.Otherwise I strongly recommend The Night of The Rabbit, especially for fans of adventure/point-and-click games. Great story, lots of fun. 9/10			"

												I must admit I found this game during Black Friday, as a simple coincidence, and at first I thought it was going to be a simply point and click. How wrong I was.This game is AMAZING: the art, the music, the story (so far, because it seems I still have quite a lot to do), the characters design, the backgrounds, everything makes a whole that's just a wonderful piece of art for the eyes.I must admit sometimes the game kind of expects a bit too much from the player to think by himself/herself, by not giving enough clues of what to do, but even with that you can keep going on.Sometimes you have to use the imagination to progress, and I enjoy that a lot.It also gives you hints about what's really going on, but it never lets you know everything before the correct time, which makes you come back for more.It's like reading a book and playing a game at the same time, and those two things are two of my most favourite hobbies.What else can I say? I wish I could have found it before. "

												This is a great game. The plot is interesting and the art style is so cool. It can get a little tedious at times, like when you can't figure out what to do, but that's what walkthoughs are for. It does not have much in the way of replay-ability, but that's not what point and click games are for. The game is very well done and dosn't have many characters that leave you wondering why they put them in the game. If you haven't played this game you should. It's well worth the price.			"

												Daedalic Entertainment Game Nr. 8 for me The story is really fine for people that love fairy tails. For people who like Deponias jokes it isnt really the right game. Enjoy the whole game and every part of it and it has a really important SECRET MESSAGE! STOP TRASHING THE WOODS/ PLANET OR THE WORLD WILL GET SLOWLY TO THE NIGHTMARE FOR ANIMALS/ PLANTS AND FOR US. This game has really charm, the graphics are really great. I only miss more animals like deers, skunks, squirrels, badger and Co.The main music is really good, you can hear it 5 times and its still good to hear it, the rest is satisfied enough.The game lenght is for 19.99 a bit to much, it could be a bit more but its okay, the best is you use a 50% or higher discount.So for story and point and click adventure fans its good, for people who want funny dialogs or dont like point and click adventures, it isnt. I give this game because the fantastic gameplay for me personal 93 % points. If there would be more gaming contend it would get even higher. I hope for a 2nd part in the future. Thank you for reading and hopefully enjoy your game :)			"

												I've been playing adventure games since the Sierra heyday, and this is quite possibly the most enchanting and enjoyable adventure game I've ever played. It recalls the sense of wonder, yet subtle danger, that I remember from some classic animated films like the Secret of NIMH - the kinds of stories that prove they can be kid-friendly without talking down to their audience. Great beauty and admittedly cute characters exist in the shadow of a palpable darkness, with an intriguing mystery of the Marquis overlaying it all.This game does fall into the trap, like so many adventure games, of having several overly obtuse puzzles, but this is at least relatively minimal. The positives more than outweigh this: solid and simple interface, a well-written story, outstanding voice-acting, and some of the most beautiful scenes you'll ever see on your monitor. Great for kids, yes (although it may frighten them at times), but a joy for anyone who loves classic adventure games... and anyone who remembers what it's like to be a child two days before their summer vacation ends.This is a game that will make you smile.

												This game has a wonderful story line and is fun to play. The game makes you think about things in ways you might not expect to solve the different problems you need to solve for the people you help. For me the audio book stories you can collect are a bonus and I love to sit and listen to them, I only wish there was a way I could buy them separate from the game since I already have the game and sadly didn't get the premium edition. While I felt the vioce acting was good, I do agree with my husband that it won't compare to voice acting you hear in many main stream games, though I think it is amazing for the low price this game is. I truly hope that they make a second game to this so I can learn more about the Treewalkers and the lovely animals of Mousewood.			"

												Okay...spoiler alert, first off. (Spoilers will be noted throughout the review.)+BEAUTIFUL music. All of the music fit wonderfully with each and every scene.+Lovable characters. Every little creature in Mousewood (save one or two) caught my attention and made me love them almost immediately. They're freaking adorable.+Voice acting. The voice acting was great. A little bit awkward in a couple places, but fun nonetheless.+The graphics are lovely. They usually have a good deal of color to them and can set a scene very well.+The mini-game, Quartets. This, I can say without a doubt, was a fun little game. I loved it. The point of the game is to...well, it's like go-fish, only instead of getting a pair of two cards, the goal is to get all four cards of a suit and make a quartet. Whoever has the most quartets by the end wins, and you can play with ALMOST everyone in Mousewood. I genuinely enjoyed the mini game.+/- Story. Story was...meh. The story was very...grindy up until the middle where The plot finally came into play. The only thing that kept me interested that long was my love for a couple of the characters. Even towards the end of the story (SPOILER), it got so bland and many of the questions posed in the game were not answered properly. There was so much more that could have been done with it. (Jerry's dad? Anyone know that guy? Who is he again?)-Puzzles. Puzzles puzzles, those freaking puzzles! I cannot even begin to explain my frustration with those puzzles. Several times I rage quit because they just made no sense to me at all. I put the game down for a week or so on several occasions, and then came back, only to have to resort to a walkthrough, Honestly, the puzzles are what spawned my dislike of this game. It's all either trial and error (and error and error and error) or go find a walkthrough. Most of the puzzles make little to no sense at all, and the hints given to you are obscure. You're given a spell called ""Advice Seeker"" and more often than not it doesn't give you any suitable hints on what to do to actually progress in the story. So for a good long while I was wandering around, wondering what on earth I'm supposed to be doing. When I found out ""hey, this guy needs some ____!"" and actually got him some _____ he wouldn't take it. Why? Because he's picky.-Dialogue (when using items and such). BECAUSE there's so much trial and error to this game, there's going to be a lot of your character telling you that's not how this item should be used. But...could they at least do it in a less annoying way? The reason I hated the trial and error because Jerry's response (over and over again) was always (the same thing every time you used a certain item) something along the lines of ""Mmm...I don't think so."" or ""That doesn't go there!"" or ""That doesn't need any special spice."" (yes. yes that's a thing.) It gets tedious. And annoying. Very quickly.+/-The Audiobooks. Throughout the game, you will come across a fascinating character. In fact, you meet him in the very first scene. The Wood Sprite. He's a great guy. He loves telling stories. Later in the game, he'll give you stories which are saved in your bonus collection as audio books! Ain't he swell? Yeah, well...that's all fine and dandy, but the audio books are (I don't know what else I expected them to be) quite long for my taste. Especially when I'm trying to rage through puzzles. The books are somewhere between 8 and 15 minutes long (though I've only listened to two) and a bit monotonous. I actually dozed off a bit during the first one. (However, I was in a dimly lit room at the time.) So...they're cute, but long. And they take a bit away from the immersion (if you ever manage to gain any) in the story. +/-The ending (obvious SPOILER here). Gods. I don't know what to say about that freaking ending. It was just so...anticlimatic that if it wasn't for the explanation of the past of my favorite character in the game (Marquis de Hoto/the rabbit) and why he was having his troubles throughout the story, I would have downright put the ending into the negative section of this review. The last puzzles were fairly simple compared to the rest of the game which made me rage a bit, given how...boring the results of the puzzles actually were. The actions of Jerry (the main character) during the last few scenes were not even remotely impressive. You would think if you spent all that time learning about the inhabitants of Mousewood and all those spells you would at least be able to use them in a SLIGHTLY impressive manner. But no. Not Jerry. The final battle was downright upsetting, as well. It was...one hundred percent different from anything else done in the rest of the game. Okay, maybe not one hundred. Maybe like ninety-five percent. Everything about the ending was just...bland and altogether anticlimatic and IT LEAVES SO MUCH UNTOLD. SO. MUCH.All in all...no, I would not recommend this game, at least not at full price. Maybe at like...75% off, but not full price. It left me so disappointed. The only thing that raised my opinion of it at the very end was the Marquis. No, I would NOT play a sequel to this if one ever came out, not unless they severely dumb down the puzzles. Or at least make them reasonable.			"

												At first glance, this game looked very promising. Decent music and graphics (comparable to Deponia series) and voice acting wasn't bad either. From a pure technical point this game is comparable to other Daedalic titles, so I picked it up as I've enjoyed every one of them so far.BUT the story turns out very weak. The main character is like a toddler Guybrush Threepwood, the story weak and shallow. Dialogue lines don't change after the first conversation, which makes it tedious if you have to explore more deeply. The biggest problem I had with the game was its puzzles. The puzzles mostly make or break a game of that kind. Puzzles of this game often times don't follow the story and you have to talk to random people or try random stuff to progress. Some puzzles are illogical and often times the solution is set in strict trails. Two simple examples:- for one puzzle you have to polish a trophy and put it on a window sill. The only way to solve the puzzle is to put the unpolished trophy first and polish it after it won't be accepted. You cant polish it beforehand although it's obvious you'll have to.- for another puzzle you have to plant a tree that will soak up water. If you try that at night, you wont be able to and get a generic message. You have to change to daytime to plant the tree and it will work. I've run across this kind of stuff all game long, making it a very tedious experience. Good point & click games will give you hints, so you stay on track. This game will give you nothing , even if you did everything right and didn't follow some stupid random rule. Some puzzles have week puzzles, some a week story, but this has both. It was the first daedalic and first p&c I won't finish.			"

												I am... Genuinely impressed.Normally point-and-click adventure games tend to either be bland, or only hold their draw for a short time and a single playthrough.This one is incredibly deep. What starts as an almost stereotypical childish adventure slowly gains layers of complexity, without losing any of the charm that a childish adventure can have.The gameplay, however, possesses all the flaws of any Point-and-click game. Though this one does indeed try some interesting changes to the formula.Virtually every point-and-click adventure game that requires you to combine collected items to solve puzzles becomes an infuriating quagmire; unless you happen to find the exact combination, in the exact order, that the Developers designed, you cannot progress--regardless of whether or not your idea could work.Add to that the fact that you almost need to be able to read the Developers minds in order to solve many of them, and the game quickly becomes a matter of alternating between pulling teeth and finding a needle in a haystack.Still, the plot alone can carry you through the whole game. There are a surprising amount of subtle and charming jokes, which are delivered quite well (If the main character cannot manage to find his success, he can always fall back on becoming a highly-skilled plumber with a charming Italian accent. And we all know how successful those can be).You have to use a walkthrough to be able to really enjoy the game; which is the strongest mark against it.But this game is deffintely worth it's cost.The ending in particular is incredibly satisfying, and leaves just enough open ends to tease any number of sequels.I greatly hope to see some, some day.

												Taking cues from LucasArts' reign as top dog of the point-and-click adventure genre, Daedalic Entertainment seems to get better and better at creating worlds and stories that stand tall on their own, despite being inspired by classic tales we all know, and most of us love. If I were to describe Night of the Rabbit as X meets Y, I would say it's half Alice in Wonderland, half Wind in the Willows, which basically makes it a children-oriented fairy tale with furries and outlandish characters demonstrating thinly veiled moral points. Join Jeremiah Hazelnut in a quest to become a magician while also learning the importance of staying level-headed against adversity. Most of the game takes place in and around Mousewood, a pitoresque society of assorted small animals, and while at times the story turns a bit campy and preachy, it is, for the most part, an enchanting journey for children of all ages. In terms of quality and production value, the hand-drawn style fits the setting perfectly, the voice acting and music are more than adequate and the rich content (achievements, collectibles, side stories and a Go Fish-type card game) adds a layer of pixel-hunting to the otherwise simple puzzles. Although I detect a certain oscillation in the writing and animation quality (at times, tNotR feels more like an homage to LucasArts than a spiritual successor), I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a weak spot for fairy tales and puzzle solving, perhaps doubly so as an introduction game to the genre. BUY IT if you:-Are a child, either literally or at heart, and would rather curl up with an A.A. Milne book in front of a fireplace than join a gang and wack pigs in South Central.-Enjoy lightweight adventure games and intuitive inventory puzzles.-Are a fan of Daedalic Entertainment and the highly derivative but otherwise funny and enjoyable Deponia series.DO NOT BUY IT if you:-Want mature content in your entertainment or expect any kind of deep or complicated plotline to keep your juices flowing. -Are a hardcore point-and-click adventure fan and are sick of all those ""combine tuft of hair with stick to obtain brush and then use on an obvious brush-lacking trigger prop"" newbie puzzles. -Find the ten or so hours of raw gameplay unsatisfactory for whatever price it is at the time of purchase.

												What can I say? I thoroughly enjoyed this game; it exceeded all my expectations, and then some. (This is especially right after having played A New Beginning, a game which I probably wouldn't wish on anyone.)Pros:- Very captivating storyline; the game is mysterious throughout, and succeeds at maintaining suspense- Voice acting (English) is truly exceptional, especially for a game which doesn't have English as its native language- Art style, cutscenes, and music are all utterly beautiful and very fitting; reminded me very much of those cartoons I used to watch as a kid of talking animals in enchanted forrests- Main character is likeable, which makes the game all the more a joy to play- Fairly interesting mini-game (Quartets)- Unlike most other point-and-click games, this one has several different types of objects to collect along the way (e.g. dewdrops, stickers, cards, stories) which make you pay more attention to the environment; personally, this made me appreciate the art better- Generally solid gameplay, very decent amount of contentCons:- For most of the game, there will be concurrent side-missions or objectives available for you to do (e.g. constructing a net to catch a dandelion seed) which you will only be able to actually solve towards the later part of the game; the fact that these objectives can still be activated by the character early on in the game makes it a bit confusing for the player, because it is unclear what should or can be done first, especially since the main plot is still linear- Rather strange mini-game in the finaleOverall, this is a very beautiful and captivating game which I would recommend to anyone. It even comes with audiobook stories which, if you'll excuse me, I shall go listen to now.To Daedalic: Please produce a sequel to this game! Especially with the way it ended.			"

												I seldom play point n' clicks, but I must say that Daedalic are a force to be reckoned with in the genre. I'd recently played the entire Deponia series and had an absolute blast with it, so afterwards I simply had to seek out their other titles. The Night of the Rabbit was my first choice, and I do not regret it one bit.This game was a wonderful experience. It has a very whimsical and sometimes touching story with a colorful cast of characters with great voice acting, a gorgeous art style that reminded me of Child of Light and Over the Garden Wall, and a fantastic musical score. For a point n' click it also never went into frustratingly difficult territory in regards to the puzzles and solutions. Also, the Quartets card minigame I found shockingly addictive.If you're a fan of point n' clicks, it's a no-brainer that you will enjoy this title. Also if you've never played point n' clicks before, I'd say this game would be the perfect introduction.			"

												Definitely one of the best Daedilic games out there! The only one better are Chains of Satinav and Memoria but only barely. This is a amazing story that you'll just love. What makes this better then their usual stuff is that this game has a wonderful main character. Yes, there are some green vibes to it but it doesn't overwelm it either. The story is profound, the art is beautiful, and the music is perfect. There are moments in the game that send chills down your spine and possibly even tears. Plus, this is the only Daedilic game that includes things besides the story such as its own trading card game, short stories and collectables. The ending had a twist to it and I really hope it gets a sequel. It really deserves one. An absolutely fantastic game that you must play!			"

												I love 'The Night of the Rabbit'. I tend to gravitate towards the dark, horror sort of games, but I adore anything anthropomorphic. This is also in a deeply discounted bundle of games, so I thought, why not? Even if all the other games are awful, this game made my puchase worth it.The art is fantastic, reminiscent of a leatherbound fairytale book. While playing, I often found myself admiring the details of the enviroment and characters. The characters are loveable and intriguing. The voice acting is superb. I really feel like a lot of care was taken while choosing a voice for each character. I think the dialogue is a bit repetitive at times, but it is just a click (""One click - everything's just one click!"")  to hurry past the more monotonous parts. But the story... What an entertaining, interesting, heartbreaking, endearing, fun. thought-provoking story. (And the bonus stories!! So well-written!!) Set to a pleasing soundtrack, 'The Night of the Rabbit' is quite lovely.With all that being said, there are a few scenes in the game where it seems like the character faces don't really match the situation, and it kind of lessened the immersive experience for me. A character receives serious information while smiling... Another says a tearful goodbye with a face of contentment. The voice acting swoops in to save the day, though, and it isn't anything that ruins the game. Also, some of the puzzles are quite difficult, with little to no direction of what to do next. This leads to either a LOT of guessing and misdirection, or the use of a walkthrough. But, this also leads to a strong sense of satisfaction when a puzzle is solved. Overall, 'The Night of the Rabbit' is a stunning game, with a story I hope to see continued. I would absolutely love to meet these characters again. Thank you, Matthias Kempke!			"

												Just last night I finished the game and I am looking forward to a sequel. Before my review I would like to note that this was my third point and click adventure game (all from Daedlic) so I am not particularly experienced on this field.Story: In my opinion the strongest point of the game. As the description says we follow the adventure of a young boy whose dream is to become a magician. On a summer vacation anything is possible! It sounds like and starts out as a light-hearted fairytale with talking woodland animals. (It reminds me a bit to The Whispered World.) However, even the starting cinematic hints that there are more to it. The story picks up slowly as Jerry, on his training to be a Treewalker, first just do all kind of chores for the locals, which took about half of my game time. But the subtle referances that things weren't as they looked kept me going. There are a couple of threats looming over Mousewood, the home of the woodland critters, some more immediate and more apparent, some not. The initial innocent tale about talking critters expands into a complex one with harsher elements. I find the plot intriguing and creative. It has more than one layer and gives a couple of twists in the second half of the game. We get answers to some of the mysteries, but at the same time more questions arises. There remain some loose ends hanging, that makes me hope there will be a sequel. Gameplay:There is only one click option, and the game decides whether you look, talk to, pick up, etc your target. Jerry's adventures centers around a place called Mousewood and its close surrounding. He needs to visit same places over and over again, but some other, smaller areas open up briefly too. The game lacks a bit on exploration-wise in my opinion. There are riddles, hidden objects and lots of item combinations. Unfortunately I found myself often opening a guide because my logic works differently than Daedlic’s. During his training, Jerry learns some useful spells. With the help of them some previously inaccessable places open up or he can interact with objects in new ways, which sometimes help solving puzzles or give extra flavour to the game. After a while day and night cycles are introduced too which, again, alters how and where we can interact with objects and people. There are collectible items too, built in, simple card game (the pictures on the card you collect too) and audio books as bonuses. I think these are good, refreshing ideas which brings the game above average. Unfortunately the puzzles I don’t find particularly interesting unlike the ones in The Whispered World. Characters, voice acting and dialogues:Jerry’s behavior is belivable and suitable to a 12 year old child: how he impresses himself when he manages something, his goodwill and slightly naive attitude to the wold, playful and adventurous. I find him a likable main hero. He meets lots of different creatures (funny ones, charming ones, witty ones, etc) and they have all well thought-out personalities. The voices are fine and matches the characters. There are a decent amount of dialogue options, and fortunately we can replay most of them or at least get a summary afterward.Music:The game isnot short on them. I really like the menu music and some of the in game ones, but there were a few which slightly annoyed me hearing it over and over again. Graphic:Charming cartoonish characters and spectacular, detailed backgrounds. I can only say good about it.Overally I think The Night of the Rabbit is worth its cost. Because of its setting it is perfect for younger audiance, but it can suit well for older players just as well due to the deeper thoughts arising later during the plot. I don’t think it is the best game when it comes to puzzles but it definitely has some nice features, and because of the story I might even replay the game to see it evolve again, now with a better understanding of what is what and who is who in real.

												I absolutely LOVE this game. I am completely sucked in what a wonderful story line. The only thing I would say the game lacks is some sort of a hint system. You wander for hours and hours at times trying to figure out what to do. There are so many things to click and the map just gets bigger and bigger its very difficult to play without a sort of hint system.			"

												The night of the rabbit is another wonderful Point and Click adventure from Deadalic Entertainments. The music is wonderful, the visuals are really good looking and I didn't had any bugs during my playthrough. It took me about 10 hours to finish the game and get all achievments. To be honest this game looks childish but is definitely not easy!  Some combinations or task are in my opinion not really logical. Therefore it will be very hard to finish the game without any help or maybe you are just more clever than me. Nevertheless this game was really good and had a really nice story. "

												Amazing Game! totally worth the price! It's one of those games that change your outlook on things after ya beat it. Plus, when ya beat it, you'll understand the cards of Quartets and love the cards even more :D I highly recommend this game for all ages. It does have some difficult puzzles that are a pain, but they make sense later on. It's a simple point-and-click game, but the art is beautiful! Hopefully they'll have the actual card game out soon! I can't wait to teach/share this wonderful game!			"

												I loved this game.. It was so charming, but not saccharine in any way and I didn't feel that it was heavy handed in any moralistic messages at all. It was so much fun being totally immersed in the world of Mousewood. The story was engrossing and pulled me in, immediately. I really thought that the voice actors for all of the characters were BRILLIANT. Kudos especially to the young fellow who did the voice of Jeremiah Hazelwood. Point and click games are my favourite and the navigation and mouse control were much appreciated; no queasiness from first person keyboard navigation!I would LOVE a sequel....RECOMMENDED!			"

												I admit to having had some reservations about starting this game, as I had felt a bit put off by the ""twists"" in both The Whispered World and A New Beginning after completing them. In fact, the twist in The Night of the Rabbit is particularly jarring, given the otherwise cheerful/uplifting tone of the first half of the game.Even so, the game is beautifully animated, and it's so far my favourite of Daedalic Entertainment's games, with a story that will stay with me much longer, twists and all. In addition, the eight-story audiobook is a nice world-building bonus, and the Quartets mini-game is a fun distraction I wouldn't mind trying in real life, potentially adapting it for more players.Definite recommend if you love animated point-and-click adventures like I do. Biggest complaint would be some minor technical glitches with dialogue, and that a lot of the end sequence is narration over black screens, but the amazing animation that IS shown more than makes up for it.

												I don't think you have to be ""into this kind of game"" or anything. It's just an atmospheric point & click adventure that features a lovely and immersive story that will teach you about magic, make you think about the ambitions you strive for and maybe even change your way of thinking about the world as it exists today. The amazing soundtrack and the hand-painted art style (as you might know from various other titles that were created by the German developer studio ""Daedalic Entertainment"") complete this awesome experience and caught me from the very beginning.I might even say this is my favourite adventure so far.

												Don't be fooled by the light hearted opening. The game actually has a pretty deep and interesting narrative once it gets going. However the process to get to the good bits is a bit of a drag since you will mostly be doing mindless tasks around Mousewood for the majority of the game.			"

												'The Night of the Rabbit' is a fantastic game! For those who enjoy having to think hard and outside the box, I believe this game would bring many fun filled hours!The storyline is nothing to scoff at either, points in the story you might of thought to be plot holes at one point will eventually be sewn up neatly and tied together with a nice finish. All in all the story telling, if graded, is an A+ easily in my eyes.The game, while in all is not overly long, the amount of thinking needed to actually advance will definitely stump you for a good while, that alone is enough to lengthen the game time considerably.(Also, it doesn't hurt that there are achievements. Being a completionist myself, I think you'll have a lot of fun trying to get them all!)			"

Puzzles were challenging enough (I checked for help online :blush: ), especially when you can travel in many different locations. You can get some achievements by doing some minigames  inside the game, but very well implemented, like when you have to find water drops while playing the game.Raccomanded to every point and click adventure game lover+ Graphic+ Well acted+ Great setting (fairy tale)+ Good story+ Long enough - Some animations were not that good- Some minor bugs			"

												Oh my god, where do I start? I hardly ever like point-and-click games. I bought this one because the story and the scenarios looked really interesting but I didn't think it would be this great! The characters, the soundtrack, the puzzles, everything together built the incredible universe that this game is. The puzzles can be really tricky (or I'm just slow sometimes :P),  but in any moment they made me tired and they're not repetitive at all. I strongly recommend this game, even if it's not your style. The history is very original and it will for sure hold you until the end. Also Jeremy and Kitsune reminds me a lot of Chihiro and Haku from Spirited Away.... And I'm really addicted to the Quartet game.			"

												This is game is sort of an odd one, but I loved it.  A slow, seemingly child-aimed point and click adventure game opens up to a bit more wonderous story with some great depth in lore and setting, but like an origin story it ends before it can really get into that enticing depth.The story follows one Jeremy Hazelnut as he finds himself whisked away on a wizard apprenticeship in some alternate dimensions.  As stated above, it opens a bit slow but a bit less than halfway through the game the background and world building that has gone into the game begins to show itself.  The puzzles are occasionally a bit confusing as is always the case in P&C games, but as the game goes on that problem pops up much less often.  My only real grip with the puzzles is that as you progress you learn spells as part of your apprenticeship, but you end up barely using them for the importance it is presented with in the story.  German voice acting is robust and enjoyable, and some of the music is downright amazing (although sadly not on the soundtrack).  The ending of the story opens up a much deeper setting that sadly this game does not get into exploring, but if Daedelic ever makes a sequel I am very much looking forward to seeing more of the story.The game comes with some some audio stories collected as you play the game that add a bit to the world building.  While they are relevant content, unfortunately they can be a bit... difficult to listen to.  Listen to the one with the deer who can't sleep, and pass on the rest.Game performed flawlessly, no audio or performance glitches.  I played about 14 hours (minus one or two for listening to the audio stories and away).  I really enjoyed myself, its one of the better P&C adventure games I've played.  I'd recommend it.			"

Short version: 84%Night of the Rabbit is an excellent 2D adventure game with a charming storyline and setting, a memorable cast, interesting puzzles, and lots of side content. And don’t let the theme fool you: this game is as much for adults, as for children.Long version:The Night of the Rabbit is a wonderful magical fairy tale from Daedelic Entertainment, the company which really knows how to make a modern 2D adventure game. The basic premise may sound familiar: you play as Jerry Hazelnut, a 12-year-old boy, who suddenly finds himself in a magical world where he becomes a wizard-in-training with the ultimate goal of saving the Forest from the evil magician.The setting uses the same cartoonish forest inhabited by talking critters we saw in hundreds of children’s books, but this doesn’t make the game dated or old, quite the opposite. This world was crafted with lots of love and care, which is also shown in the almost three hours worth of audio books (unlockable in the game, included as additional download in the special edition). And the story won’t disappoint either… it’s fun, it’s clever, it’s charming, and more importantly, it’s perfect even for an adult.Strangely, the same goes for the puzzles, but in a wrong way. The initially harmless and easy obstacles quickly turn into desperate try-everything-with-everything scenarios. Even the plot has a few dark twists, setting a more adult tone, which may create an uncomfortable discrepancy between the first and second halves of the game.All stages feature jaw-dropping graphics and lots of detail, and the English voice cast with their charming accent fits the theme perfectly. The same cannot be said for the acting, but it’s nothing major to really worry about.Overall, it’s an excellent adventure to embark upon, whether you are young or old, so put on your wizard hat and have fun!

												First off: I really enjoyed this game. But there are some complaints: a glitch where the dialogue would flash through at incredible speed and you'd have to exit the scene and come back to get it at the right pace again. A couple of other glitches include not being able to complete achievements (for the LIFE of me I couldn't get the Snail sticker, clicking on it does nothing) and sometimes the game will freeze, or the mouse will disappear and I'd have to close the game and relaunch it (SAVE OFTEN). The puzzles are unfortunately not very intuitive, and the 'advice' spell is literally next to useless. To those claiming that the dialogue is too long and when you accidentally click into an interaction you'd have to click through it all again - just press Esc. This will instantly end that conversation.But overall, it was an enjoyable experience. The art is beyond reproach and really gave you that old nostalgic feeling. The characters are likable (except Humbert - I would dearly love to drop-kick him into the brook) and I thought they were mostly well developed. The story is certainly very interesting, although the environmentalist message seemed oddly shoehorned in, and the crow problem was never solved, though the townspeople claim it has been. I really like the plot twists at the end, I thought they did a pretty good job dropping hints that lead to the big reveals.			"

												The Night of the Rabbit is a fun adventure with a knack for randomness and droll humour.Meaning I absolutely loved it.Starting the game, expecting another take on Alice in Wonderland, I was surprised by something completely different and an original story.The developers spent a lot of time and put a lot love into the story and its art. If you are an avid fantasy and scifi fan you will find quite a few nods - ranging from subtle hints to obvious whacks - towards those genres which I loved!I wouldn't recommend the game for kids - the look of the game might be decieving but the puzzles are quite hard and the humour might not be understood.All in all, I thouroughly enjoyed the story and its fairy tale charm which sparked with creativity. I can only recommend it, it's a wonderful game. :)			"

												The Night of the Rabbit is a point and click adventure game with a great soundtrack and nice visual art.This is a pretty solid, likeable point and click game and I liked it so much that I decided to write  a review. But the point I want to underline is, the story of the game. At the beginning I was like, ""Ok, the looks good"" but as I proceed, I liked the story more and more. And at the end, I really felt satisfied. I mean, it really felt like a proper endind. The characters were detailed and entertaining, adding the gameplay more fun overall. The atmosphere is simply captivating.If you are an achievement hunter, some of them might be boring to obtain but compared to other games with mind-melting achievements, they dont look that frightening.At some points, outsmarting the game may be difficult because some solutions were hard to think of. But these strange solutions aren't so frequent and not so frustrating.TL DR, this game is a really good point and click game, perhaps one of the best P&C games I have ever played.			"

												Upon finishing the game I knew I had to immediately write a review because this game is nothing short of phenomenal. It's a beautiful game that is different from any other point and click game I've played for free or otherwise. When I began to play I wasn't sure if it was worth the money, but upon completing the game I think it was well worth it. The Night of the Rabbit has such a rich vibrant story there's little more I could ask for (especially in a world littered with games that have little to no actual plot). The game art, soundtrack, and voice acting are nothing short of sensations. I cannot emphasize enough for truly awesome the story of this game was. If you're some who enjoys the plot of a game I would highly recommend this to you. This game isn't without its flaws, but now I'm just being nitpicky. I would have maybe liked a little more guidance when trying to do some of the tasks in Mouse Wood. At times it was difficult to figure of what I was trying to do, and I would have to consult a walkthrough for guidance, despite this it was still fun to solve the puzzles and complete tasks.Do you recommend this game? YES I'd recommend it to just about anyone. It is simply an over-all good game. I don't think I could have been more pleased with it. I may not play through it again anytime soon, but it now has a place in my heart, and I know, one day, I'll come back so I can go on this beautiful adventure again. I look forward to that day. Happy playing. "

												This game is a wonderful entartainment and adventure at the same time. This is a traditional point&click adventure game with a fabulous (exactly!) graphic. The graphic part is the major merit here but not only. As much as I like adventure point&click games, I often get bored from here to there, so I find myself forced to scroll the tale down. However, this little adventure game didn't bore me at all! It reminded me a bit of Alice in Wonderland (because of the rabbit and another world setting) or Harry Potter (because it's about magic) or Grimm fairy tales (because of the fairy tale and all those mice and all). However the story and the setting is quite fresh. It's like without a meaning on one hand, on the other it's just a masterpiece.During the game you collect playing cards. They'll be used for an extra card game, which is pretty fun and you can play it also after you finish the main game.There're also some kind of improvement in your movements later on in the game, so that you don't need to wait ages till your protagonist reach a point you wish him to reach. The length of the game is satisfying. It's not short. It's not very long. It's just reasonable. Getting to the credits can take you around 19-20h of gameplay. I haven't noticed any bugs. Controlling system is pretty simple and obvious - as this is the point&click game ;)All in all, this is a tasty pretty little game, which I can recommend for everyone who loves fabulous adventures and decent point&clicks.

												The children's story of Jerry Hazelnut and the Maquis De Hoto is just ""wow""... The creativity is just amazing and it makes for such an enjoyable game... Especially with the hint of the Ninja shadow bunny planeswalker!!! So cool. Definitely a thumbs up. Note : I had to complete the game with a walkthrough. The hints were really lousy.PROS1. StorySo interesting. It's great to see all the little details in the story slowly get unravelled as the game progresses. The blurred overlap between a boy who is dreaming up his own imagination and a real fantasy world is fantastic.2. ArtworkFantastic. The details of Mousewood are so intriguing. The level of creativity is something amazing.3. SecretsDewdrops. Need I say more?4. Card GameVery cool. It's nice to know that there's another game designed within a game. It's the hallmark of the good game to have mini-games within the main game. E.g. Final Fantasy series. Do note that The Night The Rabbit is a simple game of Go Fish.5. Credit EndingNice to see that there was so much more. I won't spoilt the ending but there's a lot more to do. It's much better than the standard boring credit roll. I must admit that I didn't really pay attention to who's who in the credits though. CONS 1. Frog ClickerVery tedious method of travelling. Can't you just blow on the horn to call Plato, the frog.2. SpellsNot really useful except in specific circumstances. I was hoping for the spells to interact more. E.g. Stone Whispering spell was good as you could use it on all the statues, Green Growth and Fox's Cunning were a little too limited.3. ItemsWay too limited to be used only for specific locations. It would be great to use them on non-quest objects and Jerry would tell you if it was not important.4. HintsYou need better ones.			"

The Night of the Rabbit is a modestly achieved point-and-click adventure, without splendor or major grievances. Its particular tone and style makes it more suitable for a younger audience and may simply not be for everyone.It is adorably filled with tons of imaginative little ideas, easygoing humour and clever references to other classic adventures. Scenes are generally pretty and well rendered, albeit often with uniform levels of detail.I found myself enjoyably humming the game's music regularly in between playing sessions. The majority of puzzles rely on conventional logic, challenging in their own rights but never a strain to solve (only a few items are obtained or used somewhat arbitrarily).Individual components are mostly soundly executed but their overall sum unfortunately does not translate into a very exceptional experience. The game does not intentionally sabotage its appeal in any drastic way; its only real recurrent negative quirks are dull writing and repetitive dialogues.Despite its promises of magic and adventure, the game remains uniformly average with few moments of awe delivered at a slow pace.""You alone can help us.""Typical inventory puzzles have you play errand boy for perfectly incapable townsfolk who would likely forever remain in limbo if you hadn't shown up to fix everything for them. Its uncharacteristic leading young man is neither especially charismatic nor particularly witty, making these tasks rather mundane. Secondary characters are a mixed bag of highly intriguing and static types.The plot becomes more compelling, perhaps a little too late, after an interminable initial exposition. Once you finally get to the real magical bits, you will find the world portals lead to small underdeveloped and self-contained areas where each spell you learn has a handful of highly specific uses.A more interesting game mechanic lets you switch between night and day, which significantly alters areas you can visit.Increasingly mysterious story threads with no immediately obvious connections are satisfyingly and nicely tied together in a properly lengthy conclusion, served as an elaborate cutscene that explains everything in detail. Reaching the end feels good.A surprisingly twisted final segment lets you briefly revisit the other small worlds in a re-imagined version. This original part breaks positively from the regular pacing of the game.There are a few missteps, such as when your magical adventure temporarily turns into a moralizing threat of ecological disaster that is not even central to the main plot.Technical glitches sometimes make the game skip dialogues or break down the UI, in some cases forcing a restart. Save often.A journal keeps track of current objectives and even occasionally offers subtle cues towards their solution but its information is poorly organised. An ineffective in-game hint system disguised as your first spell simply repeats key dialogues you've previously heard without providing additional direction.Annoyingly, there is no way to pause the game during dialogues.There are a surprising amount of optional collectibles for a game of this genre: dewdrops, cards, stickers and audio books. Most of them are entirely useless outside fulfilling a compulsive need for completion, except for the dewdrops, which expose a minor plot detail ahead of the ultimate reveal, and audio books that add a lot of folklore to the game's world if you have the patience to sit and listen.The optional Quartet memory game is very basic and not very challenging. Completing your card set does not improve your available strategies and playing it becomes rapidly boring.Overall I found The Night of the Rabbit simply too banal to recommend to everyone. It is by no means a bad game, in fact it is moderately enjoyable, but with better pacing and a fully revised dialogue system it would have been vastly improved. Perhaps you will enjoy it better than I did but make sure you get it during one of Daedalic's insanely advantageous sales.Otherwise I would instead recommend the more fulfilling and better executed Memoria by the same developer.

												Yet another great adventure game from Daedalic. I was positively surprised by the long running time of the game and the difficulty of the puzzles - although sometimes there were missing some hints on how you can proceed. I really liked the idea of explaining all those modern adventure helper features as part of the story. The art looks fantastic.The game tells a really nice story which becomes really deep towards the end of the game, with a well executed ending.I was first reluctant to buy this game because I thought it would be too childish and too much of a fairy tale. Well, it IS a fairy tale, but a really good one, my doubts were unfounded. Got the game in a sale, and in retrospect should have bought it at full price, supporting this developer to continue making these great adventure games.			"

												This game has a very moving and interesting story. All of the characters are completely unique and together they all make a well-rounded and thoroughly thought out game. This isn't your average point and click it takes serious thought and concentration. I had to look up things from time to time because I got completely stuck on them. It was a very emotional experience. It has twists and turns like any good game should have, only I didn't see some of them coming. If you like point and click game that are beautiful and have a fantastic story (along with book collectables, stickers, mini-games, ect.) then I definitely think this is a game you will like. It is definitely a 10 in my opinion.			"

GameplayThe Night of the Rabbit is a point & click adventure game. Classic gameplay for the genre is you solve problems by collecting items and using them on objects in the game world or combining them in your inventory first. The Night of the Rabbit doesn't add any real puzzles to that. There is one cards minigame, though. After the first bit of gameplay you'll learn a 'skill' that enables you to highlight all objects you can interact with by pressing a button. This is always useful in point & click games. However, there are a number of optional items to collect for some achievements and these do not get highlighted. So if you want all the achievements, you're still in for some pixel hunting.StoryJerry is a 12-year-old who wants to be a magician. One day, a man-sized rabbit appears to him and takes him to another world called Mousewood, where he will train Jerry to use magic spells. Mousewood is inhabited by all kinds of man-sized talking animals. You're probably thinking this story sounds extremely generic. And you would be right, of course. Most fairy tales and other stories for children involve magic and/or talking animals. So that's what you need to know about the story of The Night of the Rabbit: it's a story for children and an unoriginal (even a bit boring) one to boot.The only other element that's worth mentioning here is that Mousewood is being attacked by feral crows. This may sound familiar if you played The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav, also made by Daedalic Entertainment, where the exact same element was a large part of the story. For a studio that only developed about a dozen games, this may come across as lazy or at least repetitive.Graphics and soundThe Night of the Rabbit's graphics are cartoonish but they look sharp, colourful and full of life.The music is not particularly memorable, but it does sound nice and varied.The protagonist's child voice actor does a decent job for his age, but you always hear a voice actor reading lines and you'll never hear a character with personality, so there's little feeling of immersion.Most of the other voice acting sounds like it was meant for the dubbing of an animated film for young children: the voice actors force their voice and try to sound very weighty in every line they speak, which makes it all sound very fake and a bit ridiculous even.The humour is tailored for children, too. Ok, I get that I find myself in a world inhabited by animals that talk and all that, but the humour could still have been a bit more original than childish wordplay like a book called 'Harry Otter and the Chamber of Egrets', a message signed 'Anonymouse', and so on.On Steam's extra featuresThe Night of the Rabbit has 8 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 4 while running the game.The Steam Achievements can be split up in a few categories:  some unmissable, story-bound achievements a few 'collections', so you need to gather a series of items spread across the whole game world by clicking on them. These items can't be highlighted and need to be clicked with the very tip of the (large) mouse pointer. One of those collections has a few items that are so small they are nearly impossible to spot, so you need a guide. And even then, sometimes it's still a matter of pixel hunting to click on the correct tiny spot. typical Daedalic Entertainment chores. In this case: click 1000 (yes, a thousand!) times on an object to get an achievement. This is the worst one yet: in The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav you have to click some buttons 400 times to get two achievements and in The Whispered World it takes 500 mouse clicks for one achievement. Final thoughtsI'm calling this one quits. That may seem a bit unfair, after only a couple of hours, but I don't like what I've seen so far. This is a game made for children and maybe for people who are at a nostalgic point in life where they are into stuff made for children. That's fine, but I don't belong to either of those target groups so this game is not for me. Also, looking forward a bit by reading the reviews and achievement guides, I see that I'll be spending a lot of time getting frustrated by illogical puzzles (or using a walkthrough) anyway, and I'll be wrecking my mouse and my wrist to do the mind-numbingly boring chores Daedalic Entertainment misguidedly calls 'achievements'. Also, there are so many great games out there to play, even good games by Daedalic, so maybe I'll come back to The Night of the Rabbit at some point but for now, it's a 'no' for me.			"

												The artwork and animation of this game is beautiful. The game itself can be quite difficult (which can sort of be expected of puzzle games) but I found myself having to find walkthroughs for some parts as there WILL be some gnarly puzzles. It's more or less because of the multitude of options and things you can craft and if you didn't pick up the right parts at the right places, you miss things later on and have to go back and look. At a first glance, it may appear to be orientated towards children; but don't be fooled, there's more than meets the eye.The story itself has a dark type of undertone; it mixes (Disney) Alice in Wonderland with Harry Potter with Child of Light and a 1990's-style point-and-click feel. Great for everyone of all ages, very perplexing at times. The only complaint I have of this game (so far) is the cheesy, cliche' sayings that the main character says from time to time. The voices (although VERY well done) tend to get repetitive and annoying, especially as you're experimenting with different combinations of objects. You may also need some patience, as the character walks pretty slow. Also, the game goes for $20, and the developer pack with 11 games was on sale for $15.99 (which I don't care for the looks of the other ones) so I ended up biting the bulleting and buying the whole pack as it was cheaper than buying the game by itself (ugh). Altogether, as it stands where I'm at in the story, I give this game an 8/10. Good story, amazing artwork, brain-teasing riddles/puzzles and content value. OH, AND IF YOU'RE WALKING FROM AREA TO AREA, DOUBLE CLICK ON THE ENTRANCE/EXIT TO TRAVEL FASTER.			"

												For any Daedalic fan, this is a worthy addition to your library. This is a game that I would not regret buying at full price (I got TNoTR on sale) for it is a quite meaty game. You'll get around 15 hours of gameplay and maybe more if you listen to the audio books ingame. While the game was mostly enjoyable there are some glaring issues such as pacing...For a huge chunk of the game, there's not much plot progression until toward the end. You're going to be mostly trying to set up a festival in Mousewood and trying to complete your magician's training. Afterwards the plot speeds up and it feels crammed, especially with the additional exposition they add at the end. I don't get the feeling that the game's development was rushed at the end but the final act implies otherwise. With the pacing problem it did make it difficult to play through most of the game because I felt quite bored. I wasn't engaged in the plot until at the end. What really pushed me through was the visuals, audio, and world.Visually the game is stunning and the audio is complements it greatly. I never got bored of looking at the game's backgrounds or character designs. The voice acting also stands out too, I particulary enjoyed the Marquis' voice actor. And the theme song of the game is very enjoyable to hear. It's one of those songs that can get stuck in your head but you're not bothered by it. There's also the world the game inhabits which I feel like isn't explored enough in this game. There's good potential, as for many game universes, to expand the lore of this universe with how it goes about it's ""Alice in Wonderland-like"" idea. And with an interesting character like the Marquis de Hoto, I feel there's worthiness for a sequel especially with how they ended the game. Overall a solid, competent, point & click adventure from Daedelic that suffers mostly from it's pacing issues and a few plot decisions such as the exposition cram at the end. But it does make up for it from everything else; ranging from visuals to dialogue. A worthy buy for $20.			"

The puzzles are also not too hard (I kinda have a hard time finishing Deponia series without a little bit of walkthrough, I just can't grasp the logic)The story is also another thing to praise. It starts with a relaxing ""I'm gonna learn all the spell! yayy!"" atmosphere and ends giving you a lot of things to think. Though I guess all Daedalic stories are like this.  You can also get all the achievements in one go and I love the bonus items (stickers, stories, etc) I rate this game 9 magical dew out of 10 "

												The Night of the Rabbit is yet another a superb Pont and Click adventure from Daedalic, with a beautiful game world and a great, albeit slightly lacking story. The game places you in a detailled environment full of loveable characters and beautiufl scenery, all the while engulfing you in one of the best soundtracks for a video game. Every single area in this game shouts passion and love for what the designers do. The music follows a theme, however manages to set the tone perfectly for every part of the game and never gets boring.The story is good, however it seems as if the release date for the game came more quickly than anticipated for the developers, as it seems a bit rushed in the end, leaving many things unresolved and many questions unanswered. Then again, that does give us reason for a sequel.Mechanically, it's a typical Point and Click. The puzzles are partially slightly confusing and you might need to run around a lot, but they're all doable and running around isn't a bad thing, really, as the game world makes for a great place to have a stroll.The game has its flaws but all in all it's a dazzling piece of gaming art which is definitely worth a look if not a full playthrough.

												As many other reviews have said this game was beautiful. The voice acting is top-notch and the music fits in perfectly. My biggest praise of this game is while many puzzle adventure games can quickly turn into ""rub every item on every clickable thing in the wolrd untill something happens"" The Night of the Rabbit managed to stay away from this. I only had to look up a guide once around the middle of the game because I got stuck. Somewhat frustrating because I had solved the puzzle but was basically trying to do a piece out of order, the logic was the same the game just got there in a slightly different way. Agian its bound to happen and I really only felt that way once.Final thoughts is this is a great introduction to the genre with a story thats not complictaed but imaginative and very family friendly. Surely worth the $5 I spent on it when it was on sale, but a full $20 might be a bit of a stretch in my opinion.			"

The storyline is delightfully original. The voice acting is total perfection. The puzzles offer a good mix between doable and difficult. I admit, I did have to resort to an online guide on more than a few occasions, but I think I can chalk that up to my impatience. The music and art behind the Night of the Rabbit creates a unique world that is so enchanting you'll never want to leave.			"

												Wonderful graphics and protagonists....really a lovely Game, (that's why Thumbs up)......BUT:I played the german original Version and the Voice of the Main Char is getting on my nerves. It's okay, he does a good Job but he really is too old to act for an 12 year old Boy like Jerry Haselnuss. And the typical Humor of ""Deponia"" and other Games by DAEDALIC is completely lacking.2nd thing..most of the Music is wonderful. Really. But some Backgroundmusic during the Dialogues (when the Marquis is talking etc.) sounds like selfmade with old Synthesizers. Like old SNES Games. *brrrr*In General i would say....I am too old for this Game (i am nearly 30). Problem is: the Game wouldnt even make fun for Children or so till 16, because most of the Riddles are very hard (as i have seen it's not only my opinion). So the Game confuses a bit with its childish way of Storytelling, some moral-teaching aspects, Voiceacting and Art (like a childrens game), because it is on the other hand not made for Children, due to the fact of the hard Riddles and some hard-to-get-pieces of the Story (because they tell not much, whats going on anyway). And most of the Story is told in a cinematic (drawn pictures-slideshow) at the near end of the Game....somehow to explain everything. Even I was then like ""aha....that's what all is about...."" Instead of really telling the Story during the Gameplay-time). But i have to say...the Graphics and over all ""Ursula"" are very cute. If you play it....I think at least you should be a woman or a man who loves Beatrix Potter, Animals and....Children's Books ^^"""""" Because while playing the Game i always had to think on her. And somehow i cannot loose the feeling that DAEDALIC is very ""greeny""....telling children (or me, a grown up woman) about saving nature and the bad world outside constructed by enterprises XDDD  Overall......not for all DAEDALIC Fans.

												The Night of the Rabbit is brilliant! One of the best point and click adventure games I have seen. The Night of the Rabbit has logical but sometimes challenging puzzles. Being able to use items several times instead of once wass surprising to find. An intresting mystery with hints to the truth are hidden if you do not explore. I found that this game was very refreshing from the usual dark fantasy or shooting games today. The atmosphere flows perfectly from easy going to being unnerving. This game is very subtle in the best way possible. If you like puzzles, story, mystery, or even indie games. Buy this game. Young or old you will not be disappointed.			"

												A visually sumptuous adventure game with great humour and real emotion. Voice work is well executed and effective, and fit well with the occasionally ominous tone. A much more mature story and characters compared to Daedalus' Deponia series. Most of the puzzles are well constructed and intuitive, with a few issues. A couple of puzzles were obtuse, and required something approaching a pixel hunt. In one case you have to stay and wait for an NPC to follow the same routine you've seen him do a dozen times before so you can see the outcome of your actions; I had left the location to do the next step in the plan only to find out I had to return and wait. Frustrating. The finale ultimately comes down to a timed ""battle"", which felt overlong and slow. There was no challenge once you grasped the concept, but you had to repeat it 3 more times. If they feel the need for combat they could learn a thing or two from the Monkey Island series.Overall an enjoyable game, I would recommend it to any fan of point and click games. I can't wait to see what they do next.			"

I'm not one usualy for point and clickers but this is challenging (mind you I did have to use a walkthrough in a couple spots) and if you're someone who get's into the story this game diffently is up that ally! It's a beautiful story, I'll be playing it again for it, as well as the achivments. I did run into a couple problems where the game broke and I'm not sure why, it could have been my computer, but I would recomend not playing it for hours straight. Power down, get up, move about, grabe a bite to eat, then after awhile resume playing because until you finish it your going to be itching to play more until you finish it.			"

												The Night of the Rabbit is brilliant! One of the best point and click adventure games I have seen. The Night of the Rabbit has logical but sometimes challenging puzzles. Being able to use items several times instead of once wass surprising to find. An intresting mystery with hints to the truth are hidden if you do not explore. I found that this game was very refreshing from the usual dark fantasy or shooting games today. The atmosphere flows perfectly from easy going to being unnerving. This game is very subtle in the best way possible. If you like puzzles, story, mystery, or even indie games. Buy this game. Young or old you will not be disappointed.			"

												Wonderful graphics and protagonists....really a lovely Game, (that's why Thumbs up)......BUT:I played the german original Version and the Voice of the Main Char is getting on my nerves. It's okay, he does a good Job but he really is too old to act for an 12 year old Boy like Jerry Haselnuss. And the typical Humor of ""Deponia"" and other Games by DAEDALIC is completely lacking.2nd thing..most of the Music is wonderful. Really. But some Backgroundmusic during the Dialogues (when the Marquis is talking etc.) sounds like selfmade with old Synthesizers. Like old SNES Games. *brrrr*In General i would say....I am too old for this Game (i am nearly 30). Problem is: the Game wouldnt even make fun for Children or so till 16, because most of the Riddles are very hard (as i have seen it's not only my opinion). So the Game confuses a bit with its childish way of Storytelling, some moral-teaching aspects, Voiceacting and Art (like a childrens game), because it is on the other hand not made for Children, due to the fact of the hard Riddles and some hard-to-get-pieces of the Story (because they tell not much, whats going on anyway). And most of the Story is told in a cinematic (drawn pictures-slideshow) at the near end of the Game....somehow to explain everything. Even I was then like ""aha....that's what all is about...."" Instead of really telling the Story during the Gameplay-time). But i have to say...the Graphics and over all ""Ursula"" are very cute. If you play it....I think at least you should be a woman or a man who loves Beatrix Potter, Animals and....Children's Books ^^"""""" Because while playing the Game i always had to think on her. And somehow i cannot loose the feeling that DAEDALIC is very ""greeny""....telling children (or me, a grown up woman) about saving nature and the bad world outside constructed by enterprises XDDD  Overall......not for all DAEDALIC Fans.

												For any Daedalic fan, this is a worthy addition to your library. This is a game that I would not regret buying at full price (I got TNoTR on sale) for it is a quite meaty game. You'll get around 15 hours of gameplay and maybe more if you listen to the audio books ingame. While the game was mostly enjoyable there are some glaring issues such as pacing...For a huge chunk of the game, there's not much plot progression until toward the end. You're going to be mostly trying to set up a festival in Mousewood and trying to complete your magician's training. Afterwards the plot speeds up and it feels crammed, especially with the additional exposition they add at the end. I don't get the feeling that the game's development was rushed at the end but the final act implies otherwise. With the pacing problem it did make it difficult to play through most of the game because I felt quite bored. I wasn't engaged in the plot until at the end. What really pushed me through was the visuals, audio, and world.Visually the game is stunning and the audio is complements it greatly. I never got bored of looking at the game's backgrounds or character designs. The voice acting also stands out too, I particulary enjoyed the Marquis' voice actor. And the theme song of the game is very enjoyable to hear. It's one of those songs that can get stuck in your head but you're not bothered by it. There's also the world the game inhabits which I feel like isn't explored enough in this game. There's good potential, as for many game universes, to expand the lore of this universe with how it goes about it's ""Alice in Wonderland-like"" idea. And with an interesting character like the Marquis de Hoto, I feel there's worthiness for a sequel especially with how they ended the game. Overall a solid, competent, point & click adventure from Daedelic that suffers mostly from it's pacing issues and a few plot decisions such as the exposition cram at the end. But it does make up for it from everything else; ranging from visuals to dialogue. A worthy buy for $20.			"

												Fun, and this game is safe to play with your family.  For basis of comparison, think ""Emerald City Confidential,"" but with more polish and whimsy, more puzzles to unravel, and cards.  In addition, the fast travel system is very handy.  Besides, who doesn't want to be known as ""Jeremiah Hazelnut""? Note: The ""Continue"" button does not always load the last savegame position for me, whereas the ""Load"" button always works for me.  You are likely to miss achievements and collectables during your first playthrough, assuming you aren't using a guide.			"

It was good that it was not too quick as well with a lot of variations while working on the plot (from playing a card game with other characters if you want, to finding stickers if you want to, and finding dewdrops as well - all which are optional while playing).  I truly enjoyed this!  Point and click adventure games <3 <3 They make me swoon!			"

												Pros:* Beautifully hand-drawn artwork* Excellent characters and unique story (think Harry Potter meets Alice in Wonderland)* Moderately challenging puzzlesCons:* Pacing can be a bit tedious* Puzzles lack fluidity -- you must do things in a precise order* Minor glitches here and there in the game itselfFew games these days try so hard to tell such a unique and whimsical tale. The story of a boy growing up, learning, and battling the forces that would seek to corrupt him. This is not a game for everyone, but if you can look past the few adventure game frustrations, and the slow start, you will be treated to a magical world, incredible art, great voice acting, brilliant score, and a story worth sticking around for. Few games have made me feel like a little kid again, discovering a new world, like this game has.			"

												An incredible game that has impressed this hard to please gamer. In truth I had some problems with this game. There were instances where there were leaps in logic with using some items. Things that don't seem to make sense or others that you thought would work and technically did work but were just using it in the wrong part or order. It seems many point and click games have these issues to some degree. Despite this fact I find myself utterly pleased with ""The Night of the Rabbit"". I enjoyed it so much that I might actually play through it again so soon after having just beaten it. The story is intriguing and charming. The art was pretty good even if some animations were lacking. The music was great. The only thing I find this game lacking is a sequel.			"

												The Night of the Rabbit is yet another a superb Pont and Click adventure from Daedalic, with a beautiful game world and a great, albeit slightly lacking story. The game places you in a detailled environment full of loveable characters and beautiufl scenery, all the while engulfing you in one of the best soundtracks for a video game. Every single area in this game shouts passion and love for what the designers do. The music follows a theme, however manages to set the tone perfectly for every part of the game and never gets boring.The story is good, however it seems as if the release date for the game came more quickly than anticipated for the developers, as it seems a bit rushed in the end, leaving many things unresolved and many questions unanswered. Then again, that does give us reason for a sequel.Mechanically, it's a typical Point and Click. The puzzles are partially slightly confusing and you might need to run around a lot, but they're all doable and running around isn't a bad thing, really, as the game world makes for a great place to have a stroll.The game has its flaws but all in all it's a dazzling piece of gaming art which is definitely worth a look if not a full playthrough.

												This game is pretty magical!The story is like a fairy tale, with some dark undertones which make it quite interesting and not overly childish. The music is absolutely amazing and it sets the mood nicely. The voice acting is quite good (with the British accent making it sound even more like a folk tale from the English countryside).Of course, as is the case with many Daedalic games, there are some obscure riddles and conundrums that make little sense, but overall I've found the difficulty and the general logic behind them better (compared to Deponia for example, or the Whispered World) and the story and presentation so engaging, that I wholeheartedly recommend this game!

												The Night of the Rabbit is a game that has earned a special place in my heart for its beautiful art, endearing characters and a very nice story. You can't help but feel that this game was made with a lot of love.That being said, if your measure stick for a point-and-click adventure game is the logic and cleverness of the puzzles, then this one might not be for you. Really, most of the time the puzzles are simple, though they also often involve a lot of 'walking around'. The only times they become challenging are when they don't make that much sense. And that happens more often then I would like.Everything else about the game, though? Good or better. Well thought storyline, charming vistas, excelent voice-acting, a likeable if not particularly brilliant protagonist, wonderful soundtrack, solid gameplay, etc. It all fits very well with the overall 'children's story book' idea of the game.To sum it up: if you can take the puzzles more as an excuse to enjoy all those good aspects than as the beginning-and-end of the game itself, I would tell you to grab The Night of the Rabbit right away. You won't regret it (unless you do).			"

It does suffer a wee bit from that old Point-and-Click Adventure Game Syndrome of occasionally mind-bending jumps of logic, so I have no shame in saying I played this game with a walkthrough open for when I couldn't find the way forward. It's a pretty short game - I finished it in a little over eight hours - but I spent those eight hours utterly absorbed in the world and the unfolding mystery.  Would definitely recommend for any fans of gentle, story-based, point-and-click adventure games.			"

												This game was... magical, pun intended. It felt slower-paced than many other puzzle games I've played, which could be good or bad depending on what you're in the mood for.The music, voice acting, and especially the backgrounds were superb; the characters were distinctive and most were well-developed. And effin' loveable.The plot was interesting and didn't dip into as many cliches as it could have. I also liked how the story was set in and around one area, instead of moving linearly from place to place, set of puzzles to set of puzzles--it felt nicely centered.The puzzles were mostly fair; there were a few places where something was either badly laid out or just odd, but for the most part everything went smoothly. I did end up using a walkthrough for the second part, have to admit.The ending... wow. It tied everything up with a minimum of deus ex machina, explained all the little things that hadn't made sense to me over the course of the game, and gave nice closure with room for a sequel (Matt Kempke, if you're reading this, the reception in Germany doesn't matter; there's a lot of us who would love sequels). Plus, dat twist!A solid 9.5/10 (just needed a bit more help on some of the puzzles than the game provided). Play this game!			"

												Let me make this clear: The Night of the Rabbit isn’t going to be the best adventure game you have ever played. It wasn’t created to do that. Its design upholds the genre’s conventional mechanics to the point that it doesn’t open itself that well to anyone but fans of the genre. Does that really matter, though? It’s completely filled with charm, beautiful art, lovely music and good characters. While we shouldn’t ignore its problems with the flow of the story and illogical puzzles, this shouldn’t stop anyone who is a follower of the genre from jumping into this world of magic and talking animals to enjoy one kid’s dream of a delightful summer adventure.

												Although I haven't finished the game yet, The Night of the Rabbit is, by far, one of the most adorable games I've ever played. The plot, itself, is also quite interesting. It's a point-and-click RPG where you play as Jerry Hazelnut, a twelve-year-old boy longing to become a magician. There are loads of hidden objects to find as side quests, though the main story is about how he became a magician. The gameplay is simple, the art is clean and adorable while the puzzles are really fun to solve and they make you think. The only things I didn't really like was the lack of a map, which made you have to memorize where everything was placed, and the journal, which didn't give you any real objectives to follow. You are pretty much left on your own. However, the compelling story is enough to keep me interested and the characters are really quite cute! I definitely recommend this if you want something with an interesting story line but has a relatively casual feel to it!			"

												The Night of the Rabbit Review - Raymond KTSummary: Becoming a magician and learning the craft of magic is the greatest dream of 12 year old Jeremiah Hazelnut. During the last two days of his summer vacation this dream finally seems to come true. Out of thin air, an elegantly dressed rabbit that goes by the name the Marquis de Hoto appears, carrying Jerry with him into an enchanted realm...The Night of the Rabbit, regardless of what it’s called and the few other minor complaints I had, is a triumph. It’s Daedalic once and for all proving that they are indeed capable of producing an adventure that can stand tall with the classics of the genre. Night of the Rabbit faithfully follows the tried and true traditions of the adventure game genre while leveraging modern technologies in a very well-produced game. Appropriate for the entire family and providing a compelling, well-written story, this one is worth a look. The Night of the Rabbit still contains all of those classic ""ah ha!"" moments when you, at long last, cease to be dumbfounded, and the novelty of the magic spells surprisingly doesn't wear off, continuing to be implemented cleverly throughout the long experience. With a lot of patience, you could find yourself having a bloody good time. Overall an excellent title! Lose yourself in a tale of magic and wonder, where anything is possible and where nothing is quite as it seems: All in all, Night of the Rabbit is an extremely enjoyable game, one certainly that most adventure game enthusiasts will have a fun time with.A great way back into the point and click genre - but be prepared to invest a little time.

												""jeremiah hazelnut, the kid that smoked way too much weed and started a journey to become a magician with the help of a rabbit"".Anyways, to be completely honest, the first 3 hours spent in this game, I was bored. The story didn't really catch my attention, but after finishing the starter quests I finally realised we are talking about a really good game here. Here is what you should expect:Puzzles: If you've played Deponia, the puzzles are way easier. I used the guide only 2 times through the whole game which surprised even myself, since in Deponia I used it about 20 times in each game (especially in Goodbye Deponia). Fun puzzles and straight to the point with many hints to tell you what to do.Story: The story, to be honest. is weird. Weird, but personally I found it quite fun. At a point it becomes quite emotional but the main character gets back on track and finishes it off with a happy ending. Length: Longer than most point and click games + it has a bonus collection where you collect stuff throughout the game (has also audio book which can give you more details about the story). I should go back and collect the rest, but oh well.If I had to grade this game, I'd say 9.5/10 (lel.)The story is just, weird. The game however is plain amazing, probably the best point and click I've played (placing it even above Deponia which is one of my personal favorites).Overall, a fantastic title worth playing.			"

												I expected to like this game, I love point and click adventure games and I've played pretty much all the others from Daedelic and loved them but I have to admit I don't like this one much, maybe I was stupid for buying it being an adult and all but usually these games just look like they're for kids but are really for adults or at least people in their mid teens but this one? Yeah this one is for kids. I also really, really, REALLY hate the voice acting in this game, literally the worst ever every time the Mom talks I want to find a hidden object and attack her face with it and the kid? Well let's just say I wouldn't be too upset if he fell down a well and never got out (Too dark?) But anyway this game isn't bad, just don't expect it to appeal to adults as much as the other Daedelic point and click games.			"

												Sometimes Daedric games are all build up to a less than stellar ending after nothing but fantastic story arcs. In this case however the ending and plot reveal didn't feel undersold or spoon-fed (until the extra scene after the credits, but that's a fairly minor complaint about a scene set up, as usual, to hint at a possible sequal.)Can't emphasise that the art and music are goregous without sounding like everyone else but that truly is the case. Puzzles were challenging but didn't suffer from horrendous leaps of logic only seen by a developer. Voice acting very good. Would rate 8/10. Very hard to think of any let-downs. Possibly the card-game minigame which is downright strange and tacked on. Most of the achievements are based around hidden object puzzles. The extra content is nice but searching the screen for stickers and a slightly blue pixel that could represent a dew drop is not my idea of fun. Further while I appreciate the immersion by having audio-books about the world available and collectable the stories are somewhat twee and have only a superficial linking to the game story as a whole.

												I honestly would have never thought I'd be interested in this type of game even up to maybe a year or so ago, point and click story/puzzley type things. But this one was actually probably one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a while. I had it in my library for quite a while from a Humble Bundle package and just had never opened it up until recently.To be honest, the thought to play it hadn't even really crossed my mind until I was sorting out my music library, trying to get everything in one place. I realized I had a few game soundtracks on here tucked away in folders where they'd downloaded alongside the games from Steam, and out of curiosity decided to listen to some of the tracks from The Night of the Rabbit. I found the soundtrack to be beautiful, and that was what had me interested in finally trying out the game. When I started playing it and heard the tracks playing along with each different scene I felt like they matched up perfectly,  and even loved the choice of the creepy distortion effect toward the end of the game when you're making your way through each scene of Zaroff's show to take out the nails from the tree.  They have done a good job of setting each scene to the right music so that you get a sense of when it's supposed to feel calm and relaxed, or when something's happening and you need to take action right away, or as in the aforementioned case you feel unsettled when you need to feel unsettled.And like I said, I hadn't even thought up til then to try the game so I had no idea what the art was going to look like. I figured some of the few pictures I had seen were just from cut scenes or something, but nope - the game looks awesome throughout. The art style is fun in itself. It's essentially like being able to interact with an incredibly beautiful picture book.It's fairly straightforward to play and very relaxed. My Steam account as of this writing only shows me having played 2.6 hours of the game, but I must have played more like around 30 hours of it during a 2-3 week span when I did not have internet access. The puzzles can be tricky if you're playing it for the first time and don't have any sort of guides to help you out, so it does make you think. There are a few achievement related things you can miss if you're not paying attention or just not looking in the right places, but nothing that's related to the story itself. Once I got access to internet again I ended up finding a guide to go back and complete the achievements I was stumped on (I was missing just one single dewdrop and still needed to find a couple stickers and some quartet cards, I've heard there is a bug with the ""A Good Hand"" achievement but some have reported being able to complete it after playing against the Man In Green in his home area - I'll try that out later).Anyway, TL;DR: The game is fun. The art and music are perfect for it. Do try your first playthrough without a guide. I want a sequel. :P			"

												This game was a delight to play.  I'm glad I had some free time to dedicate to it because I was able to wrap myself up in it like a warm blanket and experience the whole thing.The story is a charming combination of Wind in the Willows and Harry Potter, with some Winnie the Pooh mixed in for good measure.  I enjoyed all the characters, and I found the voice acting to be quite decent.  The sound track is excellent, and being as it's available as a part of one of the packages, I recommend buying that package.The puzzles are about the only thing that I have any complaints about, which is a problem because the puzzles represent the bulk of the gameplay.  The puzzles were for the most part quite good, with solutions that made sense in retrospect (and usually in prospect too).  Sometimes though the puzzles would be constructed using an object or an ability you have in a way that you hadn't before, or after a period of time that you weren't thinking about it anymore.  And there is such a vast quantity of things to try, and people to try them on, that I needed to resort to a guide on multiple occasions.  That got frustrating.  The game has a hint system, the first spell you learn in fact, but it is the most useless thing I've ever seen.  I can't say that having the hint tool was ever any better then not having it would have been.To be constructive, I would have liked to see a bit more contextual hint system.  It could have been, they built it as a spell you can cast.  If they had just made it a spell that you could cast at specific things, it would have allowed for a hint system that gave you information directly related to what is currently obstructing you.  As it is, looking things up in guides is far from perfect.  It's easy to read something you don't want to, and all to often all I needed was a nudge in the right direction, not a detailed explanation of every step.There are other little things, like the story pacing is a bit off.  There were some funny bugs from time to time.  Things like once I returned to an area I didn't need to return to, and found an oject's name having changed to ""object105_txt"" or something similar.  Or another time, similarly when returning to a location I didn't actually need to be in, the main character triggered dialog, but no sound played.  So he just stood there talking silently for about twenty seconds.  The bulk of these bugs seemed to crop up in the final chapters of the game, so I have to wonder if the game was built chronologically and got a bit rushed near the end.  All in all, a solid game and one that I heartily endorse.			"

												Summary: A good, item based point-and-click adventure game aimed at a younger audience. Nice story, setting and good voice-acting. Pacing problems, low puzzle variety, relatively tame humor and wasted opportunities prevents the game from being great. Still very much recommended, especially at a sale. Full review: You play as Jeremiah Hazelnut, a young boy dreaming of becoming a wizard. When contacted by the mysterious Marque de Hotto, you jump at the chance to travel to mysterious places and learn magic. The story is overall good with a nice setting and some interesting characters. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience than me, however, with relatively toothless humor and tame villains. There are some darker parts to the game, but nothing worse than seen similar modern fairy tales for kids. The environmental message is nice, but perhaps a bit ham-fistedly told. One problem is the pacing, which is a bit off. This game loves to hear itself talk to the point of overshadowing the gameplay. The endless exposition by the Marque at the early stages of the game bored my girlfriend to tears and I had to continue on my own. This continues to some degree throughout the game with dialogue being repeated a lot and taking just a little too long to skip when you are trying to see if a character has something new to say. An especially atrocious example of time-wasting is the fast-travel system which takes so much time to use it is generally more efficient just to double-click yourself scene by scene until you get where you want to go. The puzzles are entirely item-based so if you’re looking for more puzzle-variety you’re not going to find it here. Even the spells you learn are essentially items and do not work together in any interesting ways. An example of wasted potential. As they are, the puzzles are mostly logical, but suffer from the same problems as other item based puzzle games. Additionally there are loads of red herrings in the game, with objects having no function, no function until much later in the game or having multiple interactive areas (for example tree and hole in the tree). This can lead to some frustration, especially if you’ve tried the item on the hole in the tree, but were given no indication that you were supposed to use it on the tree instead. There is usually no guidance or humor offered by the protagonist from using the wrong items either which is a shame. To give some variety there are a fair bit of collectables, as well as a mini-card game and some additional audio books to listen to. Personally I found both the card-game and audio books rather dull, but it’s nice that they are there. I mostly enjoyed my time with The Night of the Rabbit, but I could not shake the feeling there was a great deal of wasted potential. Perhaps it was because I’m not the age group it is aimed for, but the setting is so nice and some of the characters so interesting… it just seems like they could have done something more with it. It’s all very… tame. However, it is still a good game even if it is not great. So I do recommend it, but personally I would not buy it at full price (20 Euro atm).			"

												Where do I begin... This game is ridiculously convoluted in the way the puzzles are designed and the jokes are awkward. It's a shame that there are no real puzzles instead of you just having to find, combine or use random items over and over, because it does get pretty boring after a while. Can't deny that the soundtrack is mostly pleasant (not very memorable though) and that the art style is nice to look at, but those factors don't matter when the game is inherently unengaging. I don't hate this game, but when comparing it to games being sold for the same price I think those €20 are better spent on for example Samorost 3.			"

												This is probably one of Daedalic's best point/click games.  It's an Alice-in-Wonderland type fantasy that you'll finish in about 15 hours, but unlike Deponia or Memoria, there are these extra little collectible stickers and dewdrops to find as you play through the story, and also Quartets - a playable card game within the game.  Quartets is like Old Maid or Go Fish, and you won't find it as interesting as say, Gwent in Witcher 3, but you get an achievement if you beat every resident of the village.  Music is usually of the renaissance fair flute-and-violin variety, but it's done well and fits the theme of traveling among creatures in the forest.  Might be worth full price if you like these games, otherwise it shows up in a sale bundle every few months.			"

Beautiful Game, Cried At The EndThere's probably supposed to be some sort of deep, hidden meaning about industrialism and human destruction/pollution, but I'm too busy wiping away tears and hoping for a sequel to care.			"

												More a piece of art than what would traditionally be considered a video game.  Virtually no fighting or direct confrontation. If you are into immersive, leisurly paced, whimsical adventures you are in for an amazing time. This game is all about slowing down, relaxing, and soaking in your environment. It plays out like a mix of red wall and a fairy tail. Lots of fetch quests, and looking for things in this point and click world. The characters are all adorable, and they really drag you into their pace. The art is right up my alley so I love it. That being said, it's not really long enough to justify the full price for me from a consumer basis. It took me two days to beat it at a slow pace. That being said, I would be willing to pay full price, because I think that this game is a tidy piece of art, and the studio deserves your patronage so that it might continue to make these fantastical worlds.

												I loved this game from start to finish.  The graphics are lovely, like being in a story book.  The voice acting was also very good.  I'm a huge fan of point & click adventure games and this one hits the mark for me.  I wouldn't say that this is a funny game like sam & max or monkey island, but that's ok.  It is a charming game and I sincerely hope they do make a sequel I would love to return to mousewood.  I felt that the puzzles were just right, most of them I was able to work out myself.  The solutions were logical and did not feel like just combining a bunch of random things.  If you are a fan of story-rich point and click this is a great game to try.  The demo had me hooked after about 2 minutes.			"

												Just finished this game, or story if you will. The Night Of The Rabbit is the most exciting tale I have yet dived into on my computer. The game is well priced and is very atmospheric and illustratively beautiful. The jist is a young boy strives to become a magician, a relatively simplistic beggining with a complex and engaging ending. I won't say too much more. I cannot think of a disatisfaction in playing this game. There are some nitty bits, as at times the animation was not perfect it didn't interfere with the gameplay. Wonderful game all-in-all. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for the listed providings; a great story, a great atmosphere, and a great ending.			"

												As with all Daedalic games Ive played so far, great great game. Great story, but slow beginning. But bear with it, it gets pretty fun and exciting. The only thing that continually bothered me was that, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Jerry has a ton comments when you click on items to investigate them. And if you click it again, he spews the same pointless 10 line dialogue! Thank god you can click to skip through the lines, but dang. Supremely annoying, especially when this is a game where you are going to spend a lot of time clicking on the same things over and hoping the right thing happens.I think puzzle solving wise, a bit easier than The Dark Eye and Memoria, but the parts I did get stuck on, I would not have got unless I tried every possible item combination. I used a walkthrough for those parts.Love the music, love the idea, love the characters. Pretty nice voice acting. I recommend this game, if you like this genre of story-rich, puzzle solving adventure game. Though when the game ended, I felt a rush of emotion, having been taken on a rollercoaster of a story, but a few hours later, I realized there are a lot of unresolved mysteries.			"

												6 hours in, I suddenly realized I was 6 hours in...!  Intriguing story that pulls you in right away, with very good art and music design. The puzzles are challenging and difficult but never so unweildy that you feel angry at the solution for being off-the-wall. My only complaint is that the voice acting is very slow. Happily, you can click through to speed it up.			"

												That there are absolutely no context clues is a death sentence for an adventure game. Enough has been said about its other aspects, but this in particular makes it look like Daedalic has forgotten how to write one. I've played many of their other titles and so far liked every one of them, but this one is just frustrating.Example - you have three things that each do the same thing according to their description. Item 1 and item 2 simply give a ""I should hold on to that"" when trying to use them in the exact right spot, item 3 miraculously works. Example - you need to combine something with a liquid. Attempting to use the several containers you have with several liquids gives exactly the same response as combining them with rocks. ""Use mug on water"" - ""my mug is not a weapon"", really? Example - an item can be in different states, you need one of them in a specific location. Use the right item at the right time in the wrong state, the character simply and literally says ""No..."".Sorry, but that's just thoroughly unenjoyable. I've been playing adventure games for decades and this is the first one I've come across where exclusively the correct combination of items (or sometimes a future but still unavaliable combination) shows any interaction at all. And that from the people who made something like Edna Breaks Out where almost any conceivable action at all has a unique line of dialogue.If only the characters, the story, the humor, the puzzles were able to save it, but as others pointed out, that's far from being the case. At least the artwork is nice.			"

												This is one of the best games I've played in a long while! An excellent point-and-click adventure game. Some of the puzzles are a bit difficult to figure out since you have to collect items to use and it isn't always obvious what exactly you need or where to find it. But other than that very interesting and engaging. Excellent soundtrack, very beautiful storybook-like artwork. I definitely recommend this game for all ages!			"

												I think the Night of the Rabbit holds the all characteristics that a wonderful point-and-click adventure games needs.Great artistic style and music.The art is amazing, especially the design of the different settings. The use of color and shading really brings out the atmosphere. This is also true for the music, really adds the touch to each of the places you will encounter through the game. Character design is also wonderful, and the character voice truly displays the character personalities.Classic puzzle solving.Very classic mechanism. Talking to NPC and bring items to them. The item collecting, combining and utilizing are all the components I enjoy about this type of adventure game. Although I will say some of the puzzles and item combinations are not as intuitive as it could be. Some item usage are rather a stretch. There is a help mechanism in the game the player can utilize, but I have to say it is rather useless. The help mechanism only continuously repeats the general goal of the section of the game you are on, it does not provide small clues to the smaller parts of the puzzle. The journal is more helpful in every way, although it does not provide hints, but it does keep track what you have to do. But this is a puzzle solving game, it would take away all the fun if the puzzle was too simple. Interesting story.The story isn't just about a boy with a dream, it has a lot more just than that. But it is hard to speak about how I like the story without spoiling a big part of it, so I guess I won't be talking too much about it. There are a lot that lies behind Jeremy's adventure. The people of Mousewood, the story of the Treewalkers, all the environment and the people of the other worlds. I feel like there are a lot more the game could have emphasized on, but the game was too short to cover everyone's story. I do hope there will be a sequel or maybe DLC to bring out the others' story.The in game small game, item and achievement collections are great touches to the game itself. Adds a lot more to the game itself. Overall, this is a great point-and-click adventure game, and I would be totally excited for more stories.			"

												+ Fantastic artwork and character design+ Decent voice work throughout+ Great plot with a satisfying ending~ Very few bugs (2x unvoiced speeches, 1 bugged quest)~ Long (but skipable) speeches~ Some quests rather vague and no hint system~ Not much puzzle diversity (fetch & combine)~ Bonus audio books are long but add nothing to the game~ Minimal storybook like visuals and animation - 1 quest bug, unsolvable until reload- Saving often doesn't record last few actions but does cure the aboveOddly the game feels like it's for younger (teens) players with long storyline conversations without interaction and yet many quests are tough to work out with no hints from characters or the help button and the pixel hunt extras are really tough!Adter Whispered World was afraid that the ending would be a let down but instead it was extremely well thought out and answered many questions (note.. the ending took about 15minutes so make sure you have time to enjoy it)Conclusion: 8/10.

So, become the magician you always wanted to be and help everyone with your most powerful weapon - your cunningness.			"

												It's very frustrating that I can't recommend this game, because I quite wanted to like it. There are several things I DO like about it, but, imo, they do not adequately compensate for this game's shortcomings.The art and music of this game are wonderful, and I do not use that word lightly. The art style is one that draws your eye to every superb little detail. The music too is well-crafted, perfectly suiting the atmosphere of the game. The characters, with the sad exception of the irritating and monotonous protagonist Jerry, are delightful, delivering funny and engaging dialogue with tremendous voice acting.However, the most important part of any game that has puzzles is that the puzzles are fun and challenging, without being overly difficult or convoluted; this game's puzzles fail on all these points. The puzzles depend on you clicking on everything in the game world, to make sure you have all the necessary items. Then, if you cannot deduce the often absurdly specific solution to a problem, you have to resort to trying every possible solution. Compounding this problem is Jerry, repeating himself every time you get something wrong, and it gets annoying VERY quickly. All in all, the needless complexity and ridiculousness of the puzzles means that they are an unpleasant distraction from an otherwise very enjoyable game.I feel, with this game's strengths and weaknesses, that this game would have suited the visual novel medium better, so the characters, music and art could have more room to express themselves.If you are a veteran point-and-click player who's used to these sort of poorly designed puzzles, then by all means pick the game up. Otherwise, I would suggest that the best way to experience The Night of the Rabbit would be to watch a playthrough on YouTube.			"

												2 out of 10.Visuals are nice, the music is passable. Voice acting is downright annoying and the dialog just goes on and on and on and on.... I like long dialogue in games (and adventure games are all about story and dialogue) but this one is just an incoherent, illogical, mind-numbing. non-sensical mess. You'll hear the same repeated lines over and over and try to complete utterly illogical, pointless puzzles to advance the game. You'll then grind and grind some more, pixel-hunting for the one object that you must click or the one object that you must use with something to continue. And the ending... the ending takes the cake - I've never seen such a letdown in an adventure game; the ending was bad even in the context of this game, which is saying a lot, because the game is already awful.Some reviews mentioned that this is a children's game but that's not correct: no child in their right mind would suffer through this mess of a game. They may get wooed by the nice visuals but 5 minutes into the game they'd give up in utter boredom. Only an adult who paid money for this would try to finish this game, trying to see if there's some sort of sense to it and trying to see if there's something to be gained for the money paid.There's nothing, as is the case with most Daedalic games. I should've learned this from their earlier games but from now on I'll avoid anything this incompetent bunch dumps on the markets and I advise you, reader, to do the same. You'll save your money and you'll use your time for better things.			"

												First of all, I tried playing on OS X, and the game bugged out on me from the first moment. It just skipped dialogs mid-sentence without any keypress, and this was a repeating problem, maybe on every fourth to fifth dialog box.That quickly turned me off the game, but even without that, my first impression of Night of the Rabbit can be summed up in the word ""tedium"". Starting with the ""tutorial"", it was a slow, tedious, and confusing experience, which was kicked into high drive by the aforementioned bug.And ""it's for kids"" is no excuse, Putt-Putt for example was for kids, and it was anything BUT tedious. Making a game feel like the worst things about school is not the way you make a game for kids (or for adults tbh).			"

												I'll keep this shorter than my others as other players obviously have the same problem(s).  Beautiful game, nice voice over work, etc., but seems to have some performance issues (overlooking those here).  Where this game falls apart is like the other games this company makes - it's the ""I want to throw my computer out the window"" difficulty of the puzzles.  This is the second game that I've played by this company (have them all thanks to a bundle deal) and I really wish they would figure out how to help players along with regards to their puzzles.  They are often vague and little help is offered in game by the environment or other characters.  Nobody should have to result to written or video walk through guides to get through a good point and click game (although this one has been a bit easier than Deponia).  For that reason and that reason only, I'm not recommending the game since there is no ""neutral"" option.  If you don't mind having to consult outside help to progress through the game, give it a try.			"

												Highly recommended! this piece of art is serving fantastic yet amazing gameplay. The intringuing puzzles are so great and blend perfectly with the storyline. quite simple, but very enjoyable and fun. the graphic, the ambient, and the music makes this game even more worth playing. I love the color and the design of each texture and character of the game.The main story is about the jerry hazzelnut the magic apprentice and the magical rabbit marquis de hoto. The story will take your magical imagination up up and away from things you can ever imagine. and i hesitate no more to tell you that this is one of the best indie point&click game i've ever played!also if you mind to buy the premium edition, which is include great soundtrack, 8 audiobook from the story of the woodsprites, and a wonderful game comic, i tell you, it's totally worth it!! you won't regret to spend a few extra bucks to get those content! even ""near the river"" song is one of my favorite song on steam music player.9/10			"

												Man did I ever want to like this game. The visuals are pleasing in all sorts of ways, the soundtrack is uplifting and after finishing some of the other daedalic adventures I was aware this game had a different style but I had faith I'd enjoy it. In the end I won't be finishing The night of the Rabbit. There is alot that you might enjoy and I'd recommend it for kids because the puzzles make much more common sense the Deponia or Edna and Harvey. The problem for me is that it just isn't interesting so if you are on the edge wheather to play this game or pass I can't recommend you pick it up.			"

												Nice art and story, but the areas are very large, and you must spend so much time tracking back and forth over them looking for items you missed.  Also, there's simply too much dialogue.  The story and characters are interesting, but the amount you have to listen to them renders them a bit boring.  It's a bit strange to have these sorts of problems when the previous Daedalic games I've played (Chains of Satinav, and Memoria) were such smooth affairs.			"

And looking back, it was money well spent, I recently finished it, and after some time i'd very much like to play it again. the game has great music, characters, plot, etc. My point being of you like point & click games then enjoy.

It looked dark and mysterious, with anthropomorphic forest animals! but the story is about a little English boy who leaves home on a magical adventure with a rabbit-man and is more quaint and cutesy than significant in any narrative way.I've played Daedalic Entertainment games before, and enjoyed the storytelling. I love the Deponia series, but this one did disappoint. I'm not turned off the developer completely, but I am done with this one.			"

												This game is amazing...Until it's annoying.The design is great, the story is great, but at some point the puzzles STOP making sense.I've played quite a few point and clicks and I usually only have to check the answers like 1 or 2 times during the game. In this one I had to play some parts with my internet browser open on a playthrough page, and it really spoils the fun.Moreover even after finding the answer it sometimes still makes no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense. And it's really annoying when you start to feel stupid at the middle of the game after you came to enjoy the beautiful universe and interresting storyline.So unless it doesn't bother you or you are especially skilled with circonvoluted logic, I wouldn't recommand Night of the rabbit.

												This is another deep and interesting story from Daedelic Entertainment. These adventure games often make me love what they do, but at times their games can be a bit too tough for me and I got through this one alright. It wasn't too difficult, but like all of them it has a really interesting story.The kids voice is not as annoying as the kid's from Whispered Word, but this one is tolerable. There are a lot of interesting ideas  here with how trees can be used to travel to new worlds if their roots have gone so deep that they dip into dreams and a interesting metaphisical world to come out of it too.The characters are bright and colourful and sure to leave an impression on anyone who plays this. If you're a fan of their stuff (Deponia, The Whispered Word, Edna and Harvey) you'll certainly enjoy this. If this is the first game of there's you are considering buying, I'd certainly suggest you get this game if you're looking for a much more likable protagonist than Rufus from Deponia and you want to try out a quite imaginative adventure game too.

												SPOILER ALERT... I'll start off by saying this game does a few things very well. 1. Music - It's beautiful, and it fits very well with the graphics and atmosphere of the game. I really love it. 2. Graphics/Art style/Atmosphere - Also beautiful. Everything looks so polished, vibrant and colorful. The game looks great. It feels like a fairy tale. But when it comes to things I like about this game, that's where it ends. The story is... well, here... A boy wants to be a magician. So a letter comes flying out of the sky, right into his mailbox. It has directions on it in the form of a poem. The boy follows the directions, and a magic box appears with a rabbit that tells the boy that he'll be his apprentice, and go on an adventure, yada yada yada... That's it. The boy gets to go on an adventure and be a magician. I don't see how that's an intriguing story, but I let it slide because I thought the other things might make up for it, and maybe it'll get more interesting the farther I go. Now, I should say, I didn't finish the game. Maybe it does get more interesting... I'll never know. And I don't really care, to be honest. But let's talk about the one thing that caused me to stop playing this game... The puzzles. The top reviews of this game didn't have many positive things to say about the puzzles, although they absolutely loved everything else. I, for one, thought the puzzles ruined the entire game. One very positive review calls the puzzles ""brain-scratching""... As if that's a good thing. Normally, it would be a good thing. But in this case, it's not. I'd also describe the puzzles in this game as ""brain-scratching""... As in, I'm scratching my head so hard that I actually start to touch my brain after reading a walkthrough and asking myself how other human beings thought that this would make sense. The very first ""puzzle"" of the game is using a stick, which looks the same size of a stick you would use to roast a marshmallow, to completely remove a thorny bush so that you can gain access to berries your mother asked you to pick. I felt that it didn't really make sense. The bush completely disappeared after wacking it with a stick. That just seems weird to me. At first, I didn't have a big problem with it, but now that I know what the rest of the puzzles are like... I do. It does make sense somewhat. People clear bushes and leaves out of their path while walking by using sticks. But it's just not something you'd think to do, even though, via luck, I did. The next puzzle was the one involving the letter. The letter gives you directions in the form of a poem. So the game helps you with this puzzle. Cryptic, but it's help nonetheless. The solution for the puzzle is one of the most bizarre things I've seen in a game. You find an empty pop can. You're supposed to put 3 acorns... smashed chalk (powder)... a piece of tree bark... and a carrot... IN THE POP CAN. Now, let just me say, the letter gives you hints, so it's not completely random. If you played the game, you'd understand. But the puzzle still makes absolutely no sense. You know how the top of pop cans look, right? You could barely fit your tongue in the hole used to drink from it. The game expects you to know to put a carrot... A CARROT. Not a mini carrot. A fat, large carrot... into the pop can. Not to mention a piece of tree bark, which also looks very large. And they're in there together. It's just so illogical and stupid that I almost lost hope for the game right there... and it's nearly the beginning of the game. It's not like you're a magician at that point. You're a kid. And even if you WERE a magician, the story/magic being involved should not eliminate logic from the puzzles. Nothing should. Those things DO NOT fit inside a tiny pop can. There's a puzzle later on involving a rake and a leprechaun. You need to make the leprechaun step on the rake and smash his own face. He moves to different locations, and you basically have to follow him until he goes to this clover leaf where he gains his powers from... he hops around on it, and you need to put the rake there before he hops around on it. It makes sense, but it's just not something you'd think to do. And that's a theme with a lot of the puzzles. Trial and error. ""I guess that makes sense, but nobody would ever think to do that."" There was a puzzle with a little mouse not letting you go to a new area unless you give money, although when you talk to him, he talks about wanting something sweet and surgary. In another area of the game, there's an empty bee hive, and you have a sugar free lollipop in your inventory. He doesn't accept the lollipop because it's sugar free. So you go to the bee hive and put honey on it. Then he accepts it, and lets you by. That makes sense. That was the only moment in the game where I actually thought the puzzle made perfect sense, and that it's something that people would think to do because it's logical. When you talk to the little mouse, he mentions another character in the game is his baby sitter. That's all he mentions. This character in the game is his baby sitter. In your inventory, you have an ad for violin lessons. It's just something you have, among the other billion things you have in there. That's another problem with the game. Inventory. You have a ton of crap in there. And you don't want to use all your items on different things because you, for the most part, get the same dialogue every time, and it's just an annoying thing to do. It's not fun. But anyway... You need to give the ad for violin lessons to her. Later on, you need to get to another area, and the little mouse is back. This time, he wants money. Now, I looked at a walkthrough, so I would have never known to give his baby sitter the ad for violin lessons, but imagine if you didn't know to do that. You would be stuck. WHY would she want that? NOTHING implies that you would have to give her that. She comes in, and says ""look at this ad for violin lessons, you could be a star, you're the perfect mouse"" or something like that, and the little mouse leaves with her, allowing you to go by. It's just... like... why? WHY would anybody think to do that? Unless you use every item in your inventory on everything. At the time, I had 19 items in my inventory, so I wasn't going to do that. Even in games where I don't have a lot of things in my inventory, I try my best not to use items on everything just because. I want to think about it, understand why I'm doing it, and then do it. It needs to make sense. And that doesn't. It makes absolutely no sense. Why would she want that? Why would you have to give that to her? ANOTHER PART. You're asked to find an anchor, a rudder, and to remove a giant catfish that's blocking your way. Alright. Fine. Anchor... You use a grappling hook. I GUESS that makes sense, it's for a leafy boat that isn't an actual boat, it's not very heavy, so that's fine. Then you use a spoon as a rudder. A spoon. When you pick up (or find) the spoon, it's very large... but in your inventory, it looks small. Like a regular spoon. Large or small, it barely makes sense as a rudder, but fine. Then, to get rid of the giant catfish... you use... valerian drops. That's when I had enough. Why on earth would you use drops used as a sleeping aid on a giant catfish blocking your way? WHY WOULD ANYBODY DO THAT?! ... It makes NO sense. You only use a few drops anyway, and the river current is flowing rapidly... WHY WOULD THAT MAKE THE CATFISH GO AWAY?! EVEN IF HE FALLS ASLEEP. IT MAKES NO SENSE. I mean, I could go on. There are little things. Sometimes, while Jerry (main character) is talking, the audio cuts off before he could finish the final word of his dialogue. Bottom line: I just don't see how you could enjoy this game unless you don't mind looking at walkthroughs constantly or using every item in your inventory on everything. That's just not a fun gaming experience for me.			"

												The Night of the Rabbit is a really charming game. The art (both audio and visual) were absolutely beautiful and played off of one another very well to help create a mood and atmosphere relative to the plot. The characters were lovable and relatable, and the plot was mostly well done in its creation. The mini game, Quartets, was another fun way to pass the time if you didn't particularly feel like going on with the main game itselfl.Unfortunately, that's about all that's positive to say about The Night of the Rabbit. I've enjoyed point-and-click puzzle-based games for nearly ten years, but the puzzles in this game were nearly impossible to figure out on your own. I ended up looking up close to half of the game just trying to progress. A lot of the stuff I did get were from the very vague clues that I was actually able to understand, or just from randomly clicking on things in the hopes that it would either work or give a clue clear enough that I would be able to figure out the missing elements. While the daytime/nighttime game mechanic was really, really cool, it also made for more complexity. Some actions are only able to be performed at night, and some of those weren't even made possible until a puzzle during the day was solved. It created a bit of an issue for me, trying to solve two puzzles at once in two completely separate areas. In addition, the ending of the story was incredibly anticlimatic. I don't want to spoil anything for those who still want to buy the game, but after all the puzzles that I had seen and after all of the involvement in the story, I expected something a bit more satisfying. It felt a bit like being cheated; the end had potential but fell very, very flat. In the end, I don't think I'd recommend the game, or at least not at its full price. I was lucky enough to catch it while it was on sale, but for all the unsatisfaction of the ending and the frustration of having to look up a walkthrough every twenty minutes, I'm not sure it's worth the full $20.

Plus a bunch of the solutions don't make any sense. I found myself stuck and having to look up hints and answers, or trying every item in my inventory. Way too frustrating, although the actual story is great.			"

												Not really my cup of tea. Obviously this is a point and click with many very obviously hand drawn graphics and animations, which is really cool except that they pause for several seconds after completion. I have a fast enough computer that it would be odd for any sort of pause to happen anywhere in a game as simple as this. The amount of time it take for two characters to even have 1 short conversation is absurd and I honestly just can't stand to finish it. The puzzles are all either incredibly easy or just really unintuitive. I didn't run into any sort of puzzle where I thought, ah! that was a good challenge! Nope. This game isn't fun unless you are ok with waiting 5 seconds, every 5 seconds.			"

												It took about five lines of dialog for me to get the feeling that the game might be aimed at an age group maybe 20 years younger than myself. But then, I can't imagine anyone in that age range having the sheer amount of patience that this game requires you to have in order to complete it.The game often has to simply... take breaks, halting all progress in order to stop and explain to you what's going on. If I'd written the review right after completing it, rather than giving it some time to cool off, my review would likely have just been the words ""SHOW, DON'T TELL"" over and over again. The fact that a point-and-click adventure game has to rely on heavy narration to convey its plot seems extremely poorly exectued. Secrets in the game are completely pointless - Collecting all the dewdrops reveals a 'secret' that's completely meaningless until it's explained to you at the end of the game - which was five minutes away anyway.The art is good, and the story CONCEPT is great, but the execution comes off more like a Putt-Putt or Feddie Fish game due to its hamfisted storytelling and constant reliance on the main character trying to be cute/funny. After having to listen to a Dwarf sneeze and cough for five minutes in unskippable dialog, you'll understand what I mean.			"

												It's cute, creative, and different, but e x t r e m e l y slow paced to the point of being unbearable. The art is good, the writing and voice acting is mostly pretty bad, but in a charming kind of way. You have to sit through ten seconds of commentary for each mundane action you take, which you could have read on the screen in about three seconds. It's unfortunate but this particular aspect has made the game way too boring and frustrating for me. It might be good for kids if they have a lot of patience, but it really moves like molasses. I hope I can get more into it at a later date, but for the time being it's a drag.			"

But the actual Point & Click game -part is not good. It's not horrible but it can't compete against the good quality P&C adventure games out there. The ""puzzles"" can be tediously ridiculous. It really boils down to trial and error and that is not really much fun. The game also still has some bugs in it. None will break the game though.9/10 for the story part4/10 for the game part			"

												A point-and-click adventure that tries to be half Winnie the Pooh and half Alice in Wonderland, with some Guybrush Threepwood thrown in. But it ends up being too cutsie by far. The sticky-sweet cloying wears thin quickly. Perhaps the game was intended for young children, but there are aspects of it that they might find frightening. If you really like British 'twee', you might enjoy this game immensely. If not, you'll probably just find it annoying.One tip for early on in the game: There is a stick to the left of a circle of mushrooms. Clearly it's something you want to pick up because it's obvious that you need a stick to get to other items in the area, but the activation shape for the stick is only a few pixels wide and not actually on the stick, but rather a smidge down and right from the left end. I ended up having to read a cheatsheet to figure out why I couldn't make anything work, only to find that the stick was indeed required. A bit of very careful moving of the mouse around the stick revealed the tiny activation shape. This bug might be specific to the Mac version.			"

												Of all the Daedalic adventure games I've tested out so far, this is the 10th I think, this is by far the worst. In fact, I couldn't even be bothered to try to finish it. I didn't really like the two Dark Eye games either (Chains of Satinav and Memoria), but at least they held a certain amount of interest value, enough for me to see them through. All the others I really loved, even 1954 Alcatraz.This game is just horribly boring. The kid you're playing never gets to the point, and the rabbit he's following is even worse; even when he says ""we must hurry"", he spends another 30 seconds on a few more useless comments. In addition, the game even lags (on a GTX 970), the music is horrible and the brightness/contrasts too high (my eyes hurt after playing it for 45 minutes). Could possibly work as a sleeping aid, other than that: stay away! Try the Deponia games, Edna & Harvey or The Whispered World instead.			"

												I want to like this game, but I'm finding it harder and harder to want to play. The graphics are nice, the voice overs are well done, and the characters are quirky. The puzzles are not terribly intuitive, and I can see wanting/needing a walkthrough for certain portions. However, the reason I cannot recommend this game is the pacing. It is slow. Terribly, horrendously slow. Glacially slow.  Heaven help anyone who accidentally clicks too many times and restarts a dialogue with someone to whom you've just finished talking. Perhaps it is my fault for choosing a point & click adventure as I know they're typically a lazier pace focused on story...and perhaps the story in this game is wonderful. I'll likely never know, as I can't tolerate spending 55 minutes out of ever hour I play clicking through dialogue, and the other five minutes actually getting to click on an object (just to hear more dialogue).

												This would be a decent adventure game if it just wasn't so damn boring. I've tried, I really did, two times and just couldn't stand more than a few hours of it. Be warned, this game will bore you to death with awful dialogue, delivered by super-irritating characters that just go on and on and on, with nothing meaningful or useful to say. And then they start to repeat themselves. OH, GOD, NOOOO!!!! Make them stop!The puzzles are inventory based and are harder than they should have been, just because there's no direction whatsoever. You have a general goal, but to accomplish it you'll have to overcome a dozen other little puzzles that have zero explanation or logic to it. I'd give it it try, no matter how illogical they were if not for the godawful boring dialogue that makes me want to bang my head over the keyboard. Also there are achievements that require you to collect all the crap scattered around the game, uber-hidden in super detailed backgrounds. Yaaay, a pixel hunt. And then, reading the forums looking for fellow haters, I found out that one of the crap things is located in the prologue (tutorial) of the game. Since I can't get back I guess I have to replay the game. And you'd think the game would have warned you to be on the lookout for item collections BEFORE introducing them. Well fu game.			"

												Lose yourself in a tale of magic and wonder, where anything is possible and where nothing is quite as it seems: join young Jerry and follow a peculiar white rabbit to the wondrous realm of Mousewood, a land where critters can speak and where mystery abounds. It is here that Jerry’s dream of being a magician comes true, though a haunting, sinister force casts a long shadow over the forest. Someone offers the residents of Mousewood a deal of their lifetime - tickets to the greatest magic show that the world has ever seen. But the price is steep, as they'll have to stake their most precious possessions and also their lives. As the shadows grow deeper, the residents of Mousewood have only Jerry to turn to. On an adventure full of laughter and tears, joy and fear, the young boy will face the ultimate trial, leaving behind the world he once knew, and his childhood, too, will become a thing of the past.

Had to check youtube..And if i run the latest version then why nobody complained?!-Game is installed on an SSD...AN SSD!!!..Yet has frozen/not responding moments that takes many seconds more than what it should load (SSDs are kinda instant, specially for an adventure game)..Even the inventory!Other than that, the game looks challenging but i'll pass with the many BUGS that it has.

												The game description starts by saying: ""Lose yourself in a tale of magic and wonder"". The best description they could possibly write! It is a beautifully drawn world of magic and wonder that will make you feel lost..... No clear plot, a massive amount of things you can interact with and people to talk to without clear reason on why am i doing that and a constant feeling that you just dont have a path to follow. Personally i found it was not fun, it was more of a chore. And games should be fun.			"

												One of the worst adventure games I played in years, no redeeming features except for good graphics.The conversation system is terrible, every time you talk to someone they repeat the same conversation. But you neer know if they might on the rare occasion have something new to say, so you end up hearing the same nonsense again and again. Your character walks everywhere very slowly unless you are moving between screens.I wouldn't mind these issues so much if the gameplay was better. The story is boring and some of the puzzles are illogical or only solvable by extensive trial and error. I don't expect to play these games with a walkthrough but I wouldn't have the patience to try every illogical action to find the one that works.I use to really like Daedalic adventure games by the last few I've played have been terrible so I am giving up on them.

												I have very mixed feelings of this game. The concept, the art, story, and the point-and-click mechanic are well done. Most characters if not all are voiced. Also, occasionally it makes you giddy. Truly a game made for the curious!Unfortunaly, the pace is painfully slow and annoying. The game certainly does not hold your hands, which is good if only the the game could somehow point the player to the right direction. The advice button the player is given just repeats what your primary objective is, not how do you stop the leprechaun from running away. How the player solve each puzzle is sometimes vague, or might be considered very ludicrous. At first I tried to solve which items to use by process-of-elimination, but in the end I've looked into completed walkthroughs far too often enough that the story discovery didn't matter so much. Again, the advice button did nothing to hint. Again, some dialogues had me do process-of-elimination too.  "

												Positive :This game is good to play, nice story,nice artwork and nice side-quests like collecting stickers,cards and the water  drops. The story-plot is interesting and makes you want to solve the mysteryNegative: The main character is such an unsympathic gooder with such unfunny sentences....and the pauses between 2 sentences are waay too long, Next is the repeat problem. If you click one time too much,the whole description or conversation of the person or the object repeats,same with trying to combine two things from inventar.This angers one so much.The last quarter of the game,more and more objekts you try to combine simply get a ""MHHH...."" as comment,instead of any response,what kind of gives you the feeling,daedalic team didn't enjoy making this game. this thought haunts you from there until the end,because everything gets way too fast starting once you have to deal with the lizards. Most of the Zaroff part is only text with blackscreen,instead of pictures,even the parting between master and pupil!!!!  "

												First of all, I have to say that I love Daedalic Games. After finishing the Deponia Triology along with Edna & Harvey, I expected a lot from this. But sadly I was wrong. You get to play this 10 year old (or 8?) kid who is kind of stupid. No offense, I'm just being honest. He always asks the stupidest questions. I mean, I expect that from a little kid but I don't think it kind of makes sense considering his role in the game. Not to mention the other characters are also very childish and annoying. And some of the puzzles are really impossible to solve without a walkthrough. After I read the walkthrough, I was always like ""Really? Is this a joke?"" No way a person would think of doing that. And the card game? It was definitely one of the most annoying things in this game. Even though I memorized the card the opponent picked out and chose it when it was my turn, it turns out he doesn't have that card. But he just got it from me...I won't recommend the game because it just wasn't a nice experience overall. It was boring most of the times, and also annoying. I didn't feel like Daedalic worked well on the storyline on this one. I might be wrong. Or maybe it's just me. But compared to Deponia, this game is extremely bad.  "

												What starts off as a rather cute and perhaps a touch saccharine point-and-click adventure about a boy who meets a magical rabbit and finds himself in a mysterious world of talking animal-people quickly turns into a click-fest of trying to find which random object that has been lovingly painted into the background is the thing you're trying to find (or for that matter click on).The art style and scenery is so beautiful and picturesque -- as is literally everything about the game -- that even with the help of the little magic coin you'll often find yourself going over the same maps trying to find whatever it is you missed, as things tend to blend into the foreground and background.It's a beautiful game, but a trial in frustration that feels at times a little too childish and without direction.

												This game is less a story about magic and fantasy and more about the quirky animals in the town the story takes place in. The game is akin to ""The Wind in the Willows"" more than anything involving magic or faries or dragons. Unfortunatly that's not what I expected when I bought the game, so although the game was good, it didn't satisfy. I know there are people who will enjoy this game, my concern is that those people won't know this game exists because it doesn't market to them. Overall, use caution before buying this game. You won't be throwing fireballs to solve puzzles, you'll be performing chores for the local frogs, and rats, and owls.			"

												I had such high expectations for this game even before it's release. At the moment though I am let down and disappointed by the technical difficulties the game experiences as well as the lack of progress. The puzzles often lead to dead ends rather than chaining to the next puzzle, pushing you further along in the story. If this weren't bad enough to deal with, the convoluted puzzles have far fetched solutions that and it is difficult to come up with the solutions. Although the environment and atmosphere of the game are pleasant and charming my immersion into the game is brought to a halt every time my game crashes (which is quite frequent.) I am using a fairly new iMac with decent specs and good processing power that can match the unbelievably high requirements provided by this game. For a point and click adventure it certainly is convoluted. My recommendation? Wait for a patch or fix or even wait for Daedalic’s next game because this one isn't ready for playing.			"

												The Night of the Rabbit in a nutshell:Plot: 11/10 magic rabbitsGameplay: 9/10Why not 10? It has some lags. They aren't critical ( for example: two mugs in backpack) but sometimes they are... a little bit nasty (i couldn't get one sticker in Mousewood because.. it just deasappeared [but at night i can see it, but clicks don't help]). But it makes no odds when there's no need to get 100% achivements, when you just ""read"" the storyline and discover that magic world.Daedalics always knew how to do realy eciting stories. And this time they did more than good magic story.One was hard for me: Jerry is not Rufus, he won't steal others things :DD "

												I highly recommend this game to any point and click adventure fans out there. It's very reminiscent of MI3 (Curse of Monkey Island) and although the humor is not as good - the writing is superb. It may be a little slow to explain exactly what's going on, but by the end you will be amazed at how deep and complicated the world and story is. It really was a breath of fresh air. A card game is also in the game that sidetracked me a lot because I enjoyed it so much.Highly recommended for you adventure-seekers.			"

												The Night of the Rabbit in a nutshell:Plot: 11/10 magic rabbitsGameplay: 9/10Why not 10? It has some lags. They aren't critical ( for example: two mugs in backpack) but sometimes they are... a little bit nasty (i couldn't get one sticker in Mousewood because.. it just deasappeared [but at night i can see it, but clicks don't help]). But it makes no odds when there's no need to get 100% achivements, when you just ""read"" the storyline and discover that magic world.Daedalics always knew how to do realy eciting stories. And this time they did more than good magic story.One was hard for me: Jerry is not Rufus, he won't steal others things :DD "

												This game reminded me of The Curse of Monkey Island stylistically. However in terms of story, mood and atmosphere, I felt I was playing a click-and-point rendition of Disney's the Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad.There's a strong ethereal quality about this game, the beautiful artwork and soundtrack being one of the most enchanting things. The characters are quriky and well-voiced, and the story is very original. The puzzles can be perplexing at times without a guide to help, but generally the game manages to sustain itself on keeping puzzles fun and relevant to the storyline.Definetly one of my favourite click-and-point games yet.

												The game is very beautiful and the music is also georgous. This makes it easy for me get into the game and it to me is important for a point and click since you are stairing at the same screen for a while sometimes trying to figure things out. The story is awesome. I have really enjoyed following the main character, Jerry, and learning who the other characters are. The one down side that I feel there is to this game is some of the hints seem a little too vegue, or some of the points it seems as if there are not hints at all. This is easly remedied as there are lots of gides out there, I just feel bad when I have to look and I was just missing something small.			"

												This point and click adventure tells a story that can be enjoyed by players of all ages; managing to take craft a world that contains the feeling of a children's tale without being written exclusively for children. Graphically it is beatiful, even when chugging along on my outdated gaming rig. Sound quality and voice acting was also well done.It isn't without it's flaws. The subplot of the story about the intrusiveness of humans on an animal's world is to be expected in a game primaryilly set in a town of talking forest animals, but it reached a point where it was too blunt in your face for even my very high suspension of disblief at one critical moment. Also, while the sound and audio quality were wonderful, it did as mentioned ""chug along"" on my outdated gaming rig leaving me uncetain on whether the quality was an issue of my system or on polish of certain sections of the game.With that said I finished the game, outdated gaming rig nonwithstanding, and would certainly recommend the story to anyone who once enjoyed the old point and click adventures from the playstation; it's a wonderful story, and the optional ""collectables"" gives my OCD a nice rewarding scritch. Anyone wanting to get the game for their children is encouraged to play through it first themselves; not only do I believe anyone would enjoy this story, but what is appropirate for your children is a judgement call you should make yourself and not rely entirely on a thirty something single man behind the computer.

												Let me start by saying that this is not Daedalic's best game, but let me quickly follow that by saying it is still a fantastic game. Night of the Rabbit has a beautiful art style that is very evocative of childhood (think Winnie the Pooh) yet is far from childish. It also has a gorgeous soundtrack (do not miss out on this!). If you have children, Night of the Rabbit is certainly Daedalic's most child-friendly title (as opposed to Deponia, which is a terrific game but overflowing with innuendo)--no bad language, no innuendo, relatively straightforward puzzles. I feel that Night of the Rabbit has three weaknesses, however: its story is somewhat predictable (not necessarily in a bad way, but many of Daedalic's titles such as Deponia or The Whispered World have very surprising endings), it gets a little preachy with its environmental message (not that the message is bad, but no one appreciates being clubbed over the head with it), and the idea of using magic was cool but dramatically underutilized. Nevertheless, I recommend Night of the Rabbit simply to enjoy the beautiful art and music--it really is an experience.			"

												Just played through to completion, got all achievements except for one.  ""A Good Hand"" is glitched.  I played and won against everyone, twice for good measure, and still no :(That aside, Night of the Rabbit has some great artwork that is accented well by the immersive storty.  It has a lot of the hallmarks of a traditional point-and-click adventure.  They do waste a lot of time with pauses and slow-moving dialogues, and there are some rough spots to the engine (Lags on some setups, like mine.  Turning down the graphics and setting to windowed mode helped. - Radeon HD 7800 series, 8core cpu, 8gb ram).I picked this game up as part of a Humble Bundle, but after playing it through I would set my maximum price around $10.  Currently, it is $20 on steam.. and it would be worth that if they fixed the lag and glitched achievements.Oh, and if you do not get ""Card Collector"", try exiting and reloading.  Worked for me.

												I've been playing Point and Clicks since I was five. Some of my earliest memories are trying to find the right sized floppy disk of King's Quest 5 so I could keep playing the darn thing and maybe see if there's a chance to kill cedric. My point is, I've played a lot of point and clicks, so I know what I like and what I want out of one. Night of the Rabbit is pretty damn close to being exactly what I want- a point and click with gorgeous art and atmosphere, good characters, and a nice story. The problem lies a bit in the exectution.While the art is gorgeous, there's not a lot of animation to be found. The characters mostly stay in one spot and bob their heads to talk, even during the cutscenes. While this isn't unforgivable, it does tend to detract somewhat from the visuals after a few hours. It kind of leaves you a bit taken out of the moment when the sprites never really change their appearence despite what's going on around them. Emotion has to be conveyed soley through the voice acting, which can be hit or miss. The puzzles range from logical to 'okay, if I didn't know about the first haiku ever written how in the nine hells was I supposed to know how to solve this puzzle?'. While this isn't exactly a deal breaker for me (I grew up playing King's Quest, I'm used to nonsensical) it can be a bit annoying. The other complaint I have about the puzzles is that they will frequently rely on you having an item you didn't even know existed in the game. Key items can be a bit hard to find in the densly packed backgrounds. While I'm glad the game didn't do the hand holding glowing cursor fix for aquireable items most adventure games now do, it was still a bit hard to process sometimes. It's also a bit upsetting that there's no real trial and error (except for one bit near the end) and Jerry will often refuse to do an action if it's not going to work. While I understand that not everyone is as masochistic as I am, it wouldn't hurt to let us screw things up every now and again. I'm not saying that I need full on dead end situations, but a little fustration can be good in a game. There's one puzzle involving a door that would be easy to instigate a trial and error situation and not screw the player over in the process. Near the end there's a few puzzles like that, thankfully, but it was too little to late for me. The journeying to other worlds mechanic is sadly lacking- I was chomping at the bit to explore a celtic-lore themed world only to find that the place (and indeed all the other non-hub worlds) consist of a mere two screens. Dissapointing to say the least. The sound can be a bit buggy- dialouge will sometimes bunch up or just skip, so I really hope you're playing with subtitles on. A few times Jerry would start an animation to do something and then just stop- but repeated clicking seemed to fix the problem. The story was wonderful, but it almost all gets lumped into the final cutscene. This was hugely dissapointing because as I said it's a very good plot- it's just hard to process it all when it's given to you in a densely packed cube of information at the end. I would have loved to see it metted out more over the course of the game, as you would expect a point and click to do. We aren't here for the gameplay, so the story better be pretty freaking awesome and well executed to keep us here. There's also some pretty weighty plot threads left dangling, which in a game that I'm not sure will ever get a sequel is nearly unforgiveable. Even with all of this I do find myself enjoying the game quite a bit- there's a lot of extras and fun things to be found in here. I think it might even be a lot of fun to play with a younger child, although I haven't had the opportunity to do so yet. I'm actually quite looking forward to a sequel, should it get one, and hope that it would expand on the world traveling aspect of the game and perhaps not wait until the final moment to really get into the plot. All in all I would recommend buying the game, but I'm not sure I would recommend buying it at full price. I myself bought it on sale, and hope that you would do the same.  "

												 I initially only purchased this game because it was something I could play while one of my arms was badly broken. I soon came to realize that this game was far more than I had originally thought. The Night of the Rabbit is a wonderfully told story, full of twists and turns. The game is fully voiced, and includes beautiful art, and an amazing soundtrack brings the game to life in a delightfully unique way.  The gameplay itself is based around large scale logic puzzles, often involving many steps, each with a puzzle all their own. (A puzzleception if you will.) While often difficult, the gameplay can be quite relaxing. Overall this game was well worth what I paid, and probably more. It left me on the verge of tears, and I loved every second.Story: 10/10Gameplay: 8/10Aesthetics:10/10 "

												This is a rather long and beautifully drawn game. It has some issues though: the pauses in dialogues are too long, the dialogues are not shortened when the important things have been said already, and the last part of the game is glitchy. Some puzzles can be irritating as the locations where you can find things to use are a bit too numerous. Anyhow I fell in love with it somewhere in the middle, where it makes you really curious and the feel gets truly magical, with creative settings and interesting characters. I even got all teary a couple of times! The ending does not truly satisfy me though: there are many plot holes where I imagine that really cool things could have been done, but the settings and character designs make up for it.			"

												SCROLL DOWN TO THE BOTTOM IF TLDR;This is probably the first time i have played a click and go adventure game such as this properly, i knew of the classics as a boy but never actually played them myself.The only adventure games i had seriously played until now were of the telltale variety and as much as i adored their stories and characters, i couldn't help but feel they were severely lacking in genuine interactivity outside of choosing dialogue that led to the same conclusion.It should be said that these kinds of adventure games had never really appealed to me before so i should thank telltale for igniting that first spark of curiosity, thus began my search for a ''proper'' point and click adventure game.After stumbling across the name Daedalic and sifting through their numerous adventure titles i had finally settled on night of the rabbit, and at first glance it instantly appealed with it's art style and design, it's music and it's mystery and of course the enigmatic rabbit himself the Marqui De Hoto.I eagerly started the game and was pleasently surprised at how well the game accustomed me (a first time point and click player) to it's mechanics and controls, i was however not so enthralled with the introduction of my player character Jerry Hazelnut.Now i have no idea if Daedalic intended to make a bland character so the player might more easily project themselves into the world or if they did try their damndest to make an engaging protagonist but i feel they failed on both frontsJeramiah Hazelnut is hard to feel for, relate to and to like, and his voice actor is the absolute worst.At least the actor is very good at READING his lines, bless him.I don't entirely hate the character, he does have a few funny lines here or there and some of his dialogue is well written.It is a shame then that his lines are delivered so blandly and more often than not with incorrect pronunciation that he could get tiring and take me out of an otherwise engaging scene with other characters.Speaking of other characters, the rest of the woodland cast you encounter are voiced alot better and are eccentric and rather adorable.The game instantly gives off a wind in the willows/winnie the pooh vibe and as such i felt oddly nostalgic as i played, it reminded me of the kinds of shows i watched when i was younger (animals of farthing wood/red wall)As for the game mechanics themselves, they're easy to get to grips with and the first few puzzles were quite simple and easy enough to figure out.However part way through the first act i began running into the trouble of ''rub everything you have on everything till it works!'' something i had heard was an imfamous problem in some adventure games.Now either i'm as thick as a sack of bricks or you need to be able to read the designers minds in order to solve some logic puzzles, throw in the added problem of having many differant problems to solve at once that give you access to differant items or areas that may be needed for other items or areas and you have the cause of some major pacing issues.I'm ashamed to admit i needed a walkthrough at least five times and everytime i kicked myself when i discovered the answers, causing such reactions as ''you must be joking!'' or ''how was i supposed to figure that out?!'' the game does not hold your hand and requires some patience, though as frustrating as it got i still felt engaged enough to get through it.Being about magic and such i expected the game would be full of it and puzzles to solve accordingly, however what i got by the end was (what i feel) ultamately underplayed.Too few puzzles actually involve magic and the spells you do learn are rather underwhelming and a little useless especially the help spell, it only explains where you are in the story and not how to progress.The story itself is a rather intrigueing mystery, it has great atmosphere and build up and can get a little emotional sometimes.Although the game tended to show or mention a few themes or characters then never fleshes them out or leaves them unresolved and certain things really needed more focus.The game also has a bunch of unlockables such as movies and quaint mousewood audio books, and collectibles which is novel.There is also a card mini game that can be played with most anyone in the world, it's alright not too bad but not that good either.All in all i feel quite strange about this game, i liked it very much so, but i want to like it more.I feel the game is complete and satisfactory, but not as much as it could be, it has some interesting ideas and a great story and cast waiting to be expanded.I think i will wait a while before playing another point and clicker but thanks to night of the rabbit i certainly want to play another one, this game was a whimsicaly frustrating delight that made me feel young then old again.Cons--Dodgy Pacing and story focus-Cardboard Protagonist (with even flatter voice over) delivery took me out of some scenes-frustrating ''Kick yourself when you realize the answer!'' logic puzzles-certain themes, stories or characters being introduced or hinted but not fully realized or resolved-useless help spell-not enough spells or sensible puzzles that use them-The game is a bit on the short side i thinkPros--outstanding visuals, animation and appealing design-intriguing story and lore-quirky, often fun characters-fitting sounds and music-wreaks of whimsey and atmosphere-collectables, unlockable bonuses and an alright card game adds additional replayability-Marqui De Hoto

I must admit that throught this game I was waiting for the dark twist that would keep me up at night (this is brobibly due to the fact that I also played the Diponia trilogy, and the Edna and Harvey trio). The fact is this game is not dark (though it was somtimes creepy). This game was a delight to play. With its beauty, story, and delightful Alice in wonderland feel this game is a win for the whole family.I give it a 8/10.			"

												The short review;Ultimately I do really like this game. There are some very annoying things about the pacing of the conversations and the main character's personality but it is a really charming world with a good story! I love Daedalic for their enviroments, the cosy and magical atmosphere, interesting worlds and the puzzeling. The mechanics were interesting but unexploited, the story somewhat lacked a connection to the main character. Even if the story was very nice, in the end it sort of lost its meaning.  However, if you like magic and beautiful fairytale-like graphics, this is a game for you.And now for the long review; SPOILER WARNINGTHOUGHTS ON THE STORYI must say the story, nay, the main character was a little too heroic for my taste! The story is actually very nice, I would say it is about following your dreams even if critizised by others (which feels very relevant for those working in the game industry - atleast where I'm from). Removing the characters personality from the story I actually appriciated it a lot, the pacing was good, the game opened up successivly revealing new areas with new characters and new quests. I never found the story frustrating or the pacing irritating apart from maybe the end with the stage and everything, the finale.     I did like the twist in the end that sort of turned out not to be a twist at all (?) lol, but it felt a little far-fetched, rather wishing to make a point than actually making it. In the end the good guy turns out to be a bad guy, who turns out to be a good guy? ... So I guess the fable-side to this story is not to believe someone is evil only because people say so, and its' never too late to make things right.As mentioned above there was a lot of praising of the main character, Jerry, (from others as well as himself, especially from all the female characters who NATURALLY were all in love with him or called him sweetiepie as they watched the children, baked cookies or waited for that new fashionable purse) which really got on my nerves, apart from the grumpy garden owner and the gome maybe (yay for them!). Jerry didn't really feel like he had much character development through the story - he did doubt his wishes to become a magician in the beginning, but not enough to feel like a change in character as the story developed. Very early on he seemed over-confident in himself and it did not really feel like he went though a struggle. Even though there were some ties in the story to Jerry's past (his father) it still felt very vague and not really reason enough for me to care. However, when I realised Jerry had lost so many years of his life and his mother had been waiting for him I did feel touched and was motivated to change it back. For me that was a big motivator along with the wish to explore and the will to adventure. However, it may just be that his personality irritated me so much that I cannot write much positive stuff in this section, haha. I'm still not sure what Jerry ought to have learned from this, and even if he learned that he CAN be a magician for a living, or something, I never found out which was slightly disappointing.     Also, sometimes it felt like the characters took a little bit too much of the game - in many conversations there were a lot of small-talk that wasn't really related to the story and didn't really fit into the character's personality. Simply sillyness, which can sometimes be fun, but combined with the odd pacing in the conversations (weird pauses and so) it made me very frustrated. The end was also a little bit caotic, that the bad guy was evil, but then only now and not in the past, but then then that scene in the end where the recent and evil version of the evil person who-shall-not-be-named helped Jerry get back... At first I thought that Jerry was the apprentice that turned evil and that he was Zaroff, and that he was brought back in time to see all this to ultimately give up his magical powers to prevent it from happening or something.. just for a brief moment. I was slighly disappointed when that wasn't the case lol.Graphically it really felt like the game changed in time. As the player got further and further away from Mousewood the graphics gets darker, with the Dwarfs homes and the Moths, and to the west the forest. Also the different worlds in which Jerry found the different spells grew darker, and the growing threat from the Lizards was very nicely portraid.  THOUGHTS ON THE MECHANICSThe game mechanics progress nicely along with the story as the player learns new spells which kept me interested. I did not expect any of the mechanics of the different spells and I must say they feel very unique. It was also combined with several mini-quests (collecting stickers, raindrops and what not) which was a very nice detail for giving the player some extra feeling of progression and raising atleast my awareness.    I felt a little dissapointed that the spells were used to little when the focus was so much on magic otherwise. Much of the game consists of finding, combining and using things to get new things to take you to new places like in Deponia, though slightly less difficult. In comparison to Deponia there were alot of items that stayed with the player through the whole game, and I must say I had a little ""Aha!"" When I realized I was going to make another magical circle in the end. The was also alot more centered around Mouseville compared to Deponia which was much more stretched out over different scenes and places, so Night of the Rabbit felt much more compact and interesting to me. The world changed more and as a player I was able to interact with it much more over time, strengthening the bond to the world and its inhabitants. SUM OF THE CARDEMUMIn the end I found myself really wishing for the world which Jerry originally came from to be changed, for me to be able to use the spells I learned to see the world in a different way, maybe that the rocks that once were quiet really weren't and that I could use fox-cunning to create illusions to amuse a child or something to prove that Jerry will continue to use his magic in this world too, and ultimately becoming a Wizard in this world too. Too see that all this affected him somehow. That is what I lacked in the end.			"

												The best way for me to enjoy the game was to have the walkthrough minimized on another screen. There were a couple times when I wanted to punch the 'puzzle' designers in the face. Or stick them in a locked room with a handful of random objects and a short, obnoxious, repeating soundbyte. On the whole not horrible though, averaged about 1 'hint' for every hour of play. The story is what kept me going but I had to roll my eyes at the ending for a few reasons. Through the game they were pretty good about layering in hints as to certain things so you would get a sense of what was going on. However at the end of the game the entire plot is dumped on you in a long cutscene. Why include all those hints if you didn't want us to pick up on them? Additionally while I do like the characters and understand why the entire series would be broken up I feel that much more of the arc could be covered in a single game if every trivial step wasn't so obscenely convoluted. The last stinger actually made me excited and want to play the next game though, I will certainly consider picking it up when it goes on sale.			"

												This game is the most amazing fantasy game I have ever played! The scenery is gorgeous to look at, the characters are all lovable and memorable and the voice acting is at its best; and the story? Don't get me started. It’s a beautiful little adventure full of adventure, heartbreak, tenderness and most of all MAGIC! The puzzles can range from simple to challenging. Plus there are many collectibles in-game including 8 original audio stories you can listen to based off the lore of the world; Never before I seen something to be unlocked in a game! The lore of the world is vast and even though we get a handful of it I have a feeling more is to come. If you want an enchanting point and click gaming experience I HIGHLY suggest this game!			"

It has a lot of the hallmarks of a traditional point-and-click adventure.

Currently, it is $20 on steam.. and it would be worth that if they fixed the lag and glitched achievements.Oh, and if you do not get ""Card Collector"", try exiting and reloading.  Worked for me.

												This point and click adventure tells a story that can be enjoyed by players of all ages; managing to take craft a world that contains the feeling of a children's tale without being written exclusively for children. Graphically it is beatiful, even when chugging along on my outdated gaming rig. Sound quality and voice acting was also well done.It isn't without it's flaws. The subplot of the story about the intrusiveness of humans on an animal's world is to be expected in a game primaryilly set in a town of talking forest animals, but it reached a point where it was too blunt in your face for even my very high suspension of disblief at one critical moment. Also, while the sound and audio quality were wonderful, it did as mentioned ""chug along"" on my outdated gaming rig leaving me uncetain on whether the quality was an issue of my system or on polish of certain sections of the game.With that said I finished the game, outdated gaming rig nonwithstanding, and would certainly recommend the story to anyone who once enjoyed the old point and click adventures from the playstation; it's a wonderful story, and the optional ""collectables"" gives my OCD a nice rewarding scritch. Anyone wanting to get the game for their children is encouraged to play through it first themselves; not only do I believe anyone would enjoy this story, but what is appropirate for your children is a judgement call you should make yourself and not rely entirely on a thirty something single man behind the computer.

Currently, it is $20 on steam.. and it would be worth that if they fixed the lag and glitched achievements.Oh, and if you do not get ""Card Collector"", try exiting and reloading.  Worked for me.

												Let me start by saying that this is not Daedalic's best game, but let me quickly follow that by saying it is still a fantastic game. Night of the Rabbit has a beautiful art style that is very evocative of childhood (think Winnie the Pooh) yet is far from childish. It also has a gorgeous soundtrack (do not miss out on this!). If you have children, Night of the Rabbit is certainly Daedalic's most child-friendly title (as opposed to Deponia, which is a terrific game but overflowing with innuendo)--no bad language, no innuendo, relatively straightforward puzzles. I feel that Night of the Rabbit has three weaknesses, however: its story is somewhat predictable (not necessarily in a bad way, but many of Daedalic's titles such as Deponia or The Whispered World have very surprising endings), it gets a little preachy with its environmental message (not that the message is bad, but no one appreciates being clubbed over the head with it), and the idea of using magic was cool but dramatically underutilized. Nevertheless, I recommend Night of the Rabbit simply to enjoy the beautiful art and music--it really is an experience.			"

												Daedalic once again delivers another amazing adventure game. Night of the Rabbit is in the vein of many fables and fairytales, while still containing Daedalic's penchant for serious themes later in the story. The quality of the writing and animation is very high and the game is packed with a series of audio shorts and other extras.			"

												The Night of the Rabbit is a nice short game that tells us a nice short tale. The graphics are very lovely and the soundtrack fits the atmosphere nicely. I absolutely loved the Quartett game, because it reminded me of my childhood (my parents used to play this card game with me a lot). And the story really progresses in a good pace after you learn your basic magic spells.I did like quite most of the riddles, but a few of them were so hard, I had to look the solution up on the net. And sometimes, there were just too many riddles, so that the story wasn't really progressing in the beginning of the game. I always thought I loved Point and Click games, but I think I would have been much more happier if I could have moved the main character by not clicking. But that's just a preference. All in all it's a solid and charming game, especially the last part was incredibly good! The end may or may not have hinted that there could be a sequel, but let's see. :D			"

												Another great title from Daedalic! The narrative is fairly simple, clearly intended to be friendly to a younger audience, but it had the charm of some of my favorite childhood fantasy stories, such as Redwall or Harry Potter, that I think still appeals to many adults. The mechanics are what you'd expect for any point & click game, so no surprises there. Nothing too challenging here, which was somewhat disappointing; then again, too great of a challenge might have detracted from the childlike wonder this game is meant to instill. Thoroughly wonderful experience!			"

												This is the game that introduced me to the awesomeness that is Daedalic Entertainment, and is still my favorite out of all their games. A whimsical story with charming and mysterious characters, this game promises to take you on a huge adventure! My only complaint would have to be some of the fetch quests, and sometimes it's easy to get stuck. The plot, storybook-like cutscenes and soundtrack (seriously, it's one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time) make up for any flaws. My suggestion however is to please, please make the soundtrack available as a buyable DLC? If I'd known how amazing the music would have been I would have saved up to buy the premium edition! Also I hope there is more to come, there's still a lot of questions that need to be answered! I understand the need for some mysteries to remain unsolved, but I mean, with an ending like that? Come on! The audiobooks only seem to confirm that there is a whole world yet to be discovered, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who wants to find out more. Basically: If you like point-and-click adventures with a really good story, this is a must-have. And don't repeat my mistake; for the love of all that is good, buy it in premium edition so you can have the soundtrack.			"

												At first it seems like a cute soothing adventure game... but then the rabbit hole goes down quite a bit!Beautifully painted illustrationsGreat soundtrackGood story with a positive messageInteresting characters with decent voice acting, Some dialogue can be quite long and slow, but it sets the mood and characterization... until you accidentally talk to them again. Thank goodness for being able to skip through dialogues.Puzzles with varying difficulty. I must admit I needed to look up the guide for a couple of solutions.Offers a decent amount of playtimeI especially liked the final chapter presentation.The only thing that could've been improved was the Quartet card game speed.Being a linear adventure game, there isn't much replay value, but I do recommend watching the beginning again after you finish the game, as it will make a lot more sense.All in all, it was a nice adventure and I enjoyed it very much.

												Potatoes and Rabbits TooAs video games become more and more about violence it's hard to find something pleasant or enchanting. Fans of adventure games like Sam & Max or Secret of Monkey Island will love this fairy tale. You play the part of Jeremy Hazelnut a young boy on his second last day of summer holiday with a homework assignment postponed until the last minute and the chance for adventure dwindling away Jeremy is whisked away by the Marquis De Hoto, a magical rabbit who takes him on as an apprentice.In the woodland village of Mousewood (and now a couple of inches tall) Jeremy meets the many furry inhabitants and goes on errands for them while the greater story unfolds. It does get a bit too wordy occasionally but it's still one of the best adventure games I have played.The animation is lovely and the locations are whimsical. The voice acting can get a bit stiff but the character design is so cute you might not notice. If you see this game in a store or on Steam then don't hesitate to make a purchase if you are a fan of the genre. I finished the game in about 15 hours but missed 3 of the achievements. There are also some Steam trading cards featured.			"

												This game is beautifully drawn, and overall lovely to play. I enjoyed all the characters' personalities, and the story was engaging. Some dialogues were long as on these kind of adventure games they always tend to be, but with subtitles on you can skip them if you are a quicker reader than they are talkers ( make sure you don't miss anything important though! ). Also, there are a couple of optional 'mini games' inside which were a fun to discover. I think this game might have ruined other games for me, as I don't remember enjoying anything that much since the Longest Journey came out.. Ugh, but it was worth the wait to find something truly enjoyable. Thumbs up from me!			"

												I really liked this game, and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys point and click games.The puzzles were all logical, though I'm absolutely terrible at solving them. Many of them relied on remembering little details from long before or wandering around aimlessly looking for a hint. This is the biggest downside of the game, and I relied much more heavily than I'd like on walkthroughs.Another issue with the way the puzzles is presented is that it appears that you can do them in whatever order you would like, but in actuality the game is very linear, and you must do certain actions or entire puzzles before another one can be completed.Where the game really shines is the presentation. The art is wonderful, and I love the scripts. The characters are very likeable and you will end up loving many of them. The story is great, though a bit predictable.Great game, fairly easy, great story.			"

												This Game is just breathtaking, The Music, the scenes and pictures that u are going to see, the story all in one just a win for you, if u gonna buy this game :D !!At the beginning I was a bit sceptical. But after the first 1 hour, i couldnt stop playing it and  I finished the game at the same evening.The Puzzles were really good (although this game is for kids of an age of 3 or more. i really needed some time at some of the puzzles :D i dont know if it was just too late for my brain, or if a 21 years old person really needs that long for puzzles that were ment for kids ^^')I can recomend this game to everybody, who loves games with a good story, amazing music and scenes and a lot of brainwork ;)			"

												Visually it's a great game and the voice acting was generally very well done.   Some of the puzzles were very logical, while other ones were hit and miss, ie: you could only combine certain elements in a certain order, even if it shouldn't matter what order things are done, causing you to think you must have done something wrong.    Also, the dialogue sometimes is matched with character movements, so even if you try to quickly skip over lengthy bits, the game just waits until the animation has completed before moving onto the next bit of dialogue, basically forcing you to wait for it. Aside from some of those less than logical puzzles, the story itself was really well told, and there is a great epilogue to help tie things together.			"

												What a wonderful Adventure. Beautifull dialogues, pictures, music, emotions and everything just fits perfectly. Unfortunately the riddles are ... a real p.. in the a... and far from any logic. This makes it really frustrating the longer it goes and even solving the riddles does not bring satisfaction, nor does it feel rewarding. Just like error and trial.Nevertheless i would DEFINITLY recommend this Game just for ist beauty and neatless Artwork....AAAAND lay close to use a GUIDE :DHave Fun guys!			"

												The Night of the Rabbit is one of the best point&click adventure games I have played for years. While the gameplay could be better, the story is strong and the graphics are gorgeous. But where this game really shines is in its charm and the great feeling it gives of embarking on a fairy tale.			"

												An enjoyable game with wonderful music, charming and likable characters, lovely graphics, delightful voice acting, user friendly controls and features (compared with other Daedelic games) albeit with a few concerns which fortunately, did not detract too seriously from a positive experience.This game was a breath of fresh air after playing other Daedelic games- particularly in terms of the likability of the characters (a highly subjective opinion of course), the user friendly features and the logic of a good protion of its puzzles. There were still a number of puzzles that missed the mark on this count and may cause some frustration. Personally, the world was a charming one and I didn't mind going through it multiple times while trying to figure out what the solution was. Mini games and optional side quests also helped enhance the experience and take attention away from the potential points of frustration (not totally but sufficiently so for me). Did I mention that I really enjoyed the voice acting? I could listen to the woodsprite all day and night.I appreciated the mystery and 'grandeur' of the storyline and script (which can in some cases be seen as taking itself too seriously- but a healthy dose of suspension of belief will cure that) with its fairy tale atmosphere.The inclusion of the Japanese mythological creature was somewhat dissonant and the voice acting and script for those elements felt forced and a little jarring. They felt similar to caricatures that were pummeled into the script for the sake of including them particularly when considered side by side with the other characters. Another concern was that layers of stories, the build up of certain mystery around characters, and hints to potentially moving elements were dealt with almost all at onceat the end of the game in a cutscene. Certain story items were practically mentioned like an afterthought and discarded while too many layers and elements were crammed together. That felt a little unsatisfying in the face of the great story telling up until the finale. All this being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the game and its story, and would play it again. Thank you very much for the great experience!			"

												At first it seems like a cute soothing adventure game... but then the rabbit hole goes down quite a bit!Beautifully painted illustrationsGreat soundtrackGood story with a positive messageInteresting characters with decent voice acting, Some dialogue can be quite long and slow, but it sets the mood and characterization... until you accidentally talk to them again. Thank goodness for being able to skip through dialogues.Puzzles with varying difficulty. I must admit I needed to look up the guide for a couple of solutions.Offers a decent amount of playtimeI especially liked the final chapter presentation.The only thing that could've been improved was the Quartet card game speed.Being a linear adventure game, there isn't much replay value, but I do recommend watching the beginning again after you finish the game, as it will make a lot more sense.All in all, it was a nice adventure and I enjoyed it very much.

												I really wanted to love this game.  I really did.  The visuals are stunning and the story started off wonderful.  It really started feeling like a summer adventure at first.  I haven't finished it and I don't even know if I'm even close to finishing it.  However, the puzzle design and the path the story takes made me lose most of my desire to finish this game.A lot of the puzzles are poorly design.  Maybe I was overlooking details, but I could be stuck on a single puzzle for an unreasonable amount of time that by the time I solved it, I was too frustrated to enjoy my accomplishment or I had to pull out a guide. I can excuse one or two puzzles like this and especially in a game this size, but currently, for me, this happened way, way too often for my liking.  It sucked all the fun out of it for me.And while I said the story started off great, I got to a path where I just completely lost interest.  I stopped caring about the characters.  I don't know whether that was due to frustration from the puzzles or the story itself, but I stopped caring.  I didn't feel the same motivation the main character had and everything felt like a chore.  It stopped being fun.			"

But still manages to follow the fine red line throughout the story. Which is great. The puzzles are a bit hard at times, so a guide is handy when you bump into these parts.Overall a great game I'd recommend to people loving an adventure. With an extraordinary soundtrack. Wow!			"

Posted: December 15, 2014
												The Night of the Rabbit is a splendid point-and-click adventure. The storytelling, aesthetics, and puzzle-centric gameplay are all somewhere between solid and outstanding. In all, it's like playing through a really good children's book, complete with lovable characters, sinister villains, and some surprisingly complex moral lessons. Right off the bat, when you start playing this game, you will notice one of the game's biggest strengths--the lovely visuals. The Night of the Rabbit is simply beautiful. And even though each screen features a tremendous amount of detail, the game's various areas never seem cluttered. Important points of interest, such as items to pick up and tools to manipulate, are subtly and effectively foregrounded so that most (but not all) will draw your notice quickly as you explore new places. The gorgeous environments go a long way toward shaping this game's effective atmosphere, as does its stellar music. Just listen to the title music at some point--it's lovely, evocative, and downright moving. Regardless of where you are in the game, you will be tempted to slow down and simply look and listen. The orchestrations usually focus on one or two instruments (such as fiddle, flute, or xylophone), and the music definitely carries a live-recorded vibe. But while the game's visuals and atmosphere might be impressive, the game's single greatest strength is in its splendid cast of characters. It's hard to describe, but each and every character truly belongs in this game. Many of the characters can come off as a little one-dimensional at first, but as the game goes on, those same characters receive much greater depth and complexity in most cases (such as Steinberg the dwarf, the Little Man in the Green Hat, and the ornery hare patriarch). The game's cast of rounded, interesting characters even extends to its main villains and heroes. Jerry Hazelnut is not a simple character a la Link from the old Legend of Zelda games. And neither is his mentor, the Marquis de Hoto (and title rabbit)--or his eventual enemies. The game also features excellent voice acting, which helps deepen the portrayal of the broad and varied cast of characters. Although there are a few oddly read lines here and there, and the subtitle text sometimes differs slightly from the spoken dialogue, the voice acting in this game is really well done overall. The voices for the different characters are as unique and interesting as they are, and the voices blend well into the fabric of the game's world and sense of storytelling. I can't imagine playing this game without listening to the characters' voices. No point-and-click adventure can succeed without a top-shelf story, and The Night of the Rabbit definitely delivers the goods in this area. The story is rich and interesting, although the overarching plot can get a little confusing at times. This is one of those games that constantly promises that ""all will be explained in time,"" and while most of the game's action doesn't depend on the purposefully obscure plotlines for meaning, it can still seem a little overbearing to go through so much of the game without understanding what is happening on a meta level. You don't even get a clear sense of who the bad guys are or might be until about halfway through the game. In addition, the game is a little heavy on the front and back ends. There are too many layers of framing around the game in the beginning, and while the game does a nice job of integrating its tutorial so that it doesn't seem completely like a pointless exercise, you will wish the game would just step aside and let you play at first. The game's ending, too, features a lot of text and a lot of story exposition--mostly because the makers of the game save so much of the villains' backstory and motivation for the final sequences. Nevertheless, The Night of the Rabbit's story somehow manages to live up to its lofty promises. By the end of the game, you really do feel as though you understand all the vagueries the game plagued you with earlier. The roles of the mysterious characters, the identity and purpose of the villains, and your role in bringing a peaceful resolution all come clearly into light at the game's conclusion. That said, I'd say the story's greatest strength is that it doesn't rap up every loose end or explain away every detail. Some characters who are in need at the game's outset are still in need at the game's end. Your actions don't solve every single problem in the game's world--they just show how so many problems can be dealt with through the power of community, friendship, and selflessness. As a point-and-click adventure, this game requires a methodical approach. If you look everywhere and pay close attention to the game's visual details and textual clues, you can probably progress pretty smoothly. Most of the game's puzzles are highly intuitive, if you can remember which items you have and what the game's context clues suggested those items might be used for. The few times I checked a walkthrough for help, it always turned out that I was on the right track, and it was just the method I was messing up. That is a slight problem though--sometimes you can't easily figure out how to complete puzzles even though you know you're holding the right materials. A few puzzles are a little finicky or require an unintuitive arrangement of steps to complete. Furthermore, the game's richest gameplay segments come at the beginning and middle. As the game goes on, and you finish exploring the core areas of the world, the game becomes much more linear. Once you reach the point where the game is introducing one new area at a time, you are likely done with the game's most interesting puzzles. Still, the end game's new areas and characters are just as fascinating as those from earlier in the game--and sometimes even more so. The gameplay also struggles with some pacing issues. Jerry just kind of meanders from place to place regardless of plot context, and there are awkwardly long pauses between many lines of dialogue. The farther you get into the game, the more rough-around-the-edges the animations and loaded events (like subtitles/dialogue) get. But overall, if you can adapt to the game's slow-ish pace, your experience will be that much richer for it. So yeah, The Night of the Rabbit is essentially an interactive storybook--a good story told by a masterful storyteller. It's lovely, it's deep, and it carries a surprisingly mature message: avoid humanity's darker instincts for selfishness and greed, learn to live peacefully with your friends and neighbors, and nothing is impossible.

												Pros: It's a beautiful point and click game that has a unique and interesting plotline.  It's level of language and range of (generally) cute characters make the game appropriate for children but still fun for us older kids too.  Particularly the opening screen's music is nice as well!Cons: Many of the puzzles are not easy to figure out, so this may/will cause frustration for any purists that aren't willing to use a game guide.  I found myself going back to the guide to see to the particulars of a task.  (Good luck figuring out how to catch a dandilion seed on your own!)Over all: I definitely recommend checking it out for the stylized art and plotline.  However, definitely have a walkthrough/guide handy.  If you can, dual screen tag team it with the game on one screen and the guide on the other.  It'll save you time from having to flip back and forth between the two when you (inevitably) get stuck.			"

												 I initially only purchased this game because it was something I could play while one of my arms was badly broken. I soon came to realize that this game was far more than I had originally thought. The Night of the Rabbit is a wonderfully told story, full of twists and turns. The game is fully voiced, and includes beautiful art, and an amazing soundtrack brings the game to life in a delightfully unique way.  The gameplay itself is based around large scale logic puzzles, often involving many steps, each with a puzzle all their own. (A puzzleception if you will.) While often difficult, the gameplay can be quite relaxing. Overall this game was well worth what I paid, and probably more. It left me on the verge of tears, and I loved every second.Story: 10/10Gameplay: 8/10Aesthetics:10/10 "

												The Night of the Rabbit is an interesting adventure game with a storline like no other.  As you assist Jeramiah Hazlenut in his quest to help the citizens of Mouseville, clues are laid out in plain sight for you to use to help in various situations, but do not feel discouraged if you cannot complete the quests without a walkthough.  I had a difficult time figuring out the puzzles and quests myself for a good part of the game, but if you focus on the curious characters and where the story is leading to, you will be as hooked as I was, no matter how frusterated you become.

												The Night of the Rabbit has a wonderful story with great artwork. It took me a little over 19 hours to play through the game, and that's with being stumped many times. Many of the things you must do to progress the game you will not think of at first, and so the game can seem really tedious at times. You'll spend hours walking around the map thinking you missed picking up some item, only to find out later that you had the item you just didn't realize you could use it in the way the game wanted you to. I would say you need to be a patient person to play this game. I thoroughly enjoyed this game, even though I was frustrated many many times.			"

												Night of the Rabbit is a very charming point and click that is almost like an interactive children's story book. It has its flaws, but I'd recommend it overall, especially (but not exclusively) to younger people. I think the game's ideal audience might be 12 year olds or so, but the young at heart can also enjoy it.Pros:+ Great artwork. Not only is it good, it really suits the game and makes it look like illustrations in a storybook--the good kind that you'll always have a soft spot in your heart for+ Voice acting is also good, and suits the game well+ Overall, most of the point and click puzzles are pretty good. Not too many are nonsensical or overly frustrating--though the in-game ""hint"" system is awful. You may need to consult a walkthrough a couple of times.+ Story and setting are very creative. This game is not your standard genre cliche. + Story is very good and features some nice twistsCons:- Game can be a little boring. The game is more charming and imaginative than it is exciting or action-packed- Interactions with characters are a bit one-dimensional and at times reminded me of the shallow interactions on a children's TV show. The main story has some depth, but the ""everyday"" interactions are not very good. There is none of the grittiness behind characters that you see in many games.- Pacing of the story is off. The game really drags at spots, and on the other hand huge chunks of story blow past in the ending cutscene. You spend most of the game guessing at what's going on, then everything is revealed all at once.			"

												It's been a while I played this game, but I still remember it very vividly and fondly. It's one of the best adventure games I played. It has the atmosphere of some of the adventure games from 90's. It's well written and poetic. Nice to watch. It reminds me of childhood. The only downside is a very few puzzles that didn't actualy make sense. Apart from that, excelent title.			"

												Night off the rabbit is a very captivating point and click adventure. It has very dynamic charachters, room for sequels, and displays lovely and inviting graphics and scenery. I am very impressed with this game, and enjoyed the extra bits like collecting adorable stickers, and shining dew drops. Night of the rabbit offers enough difficulty to keep you hooked without being too hard. I highly reccomend this game to everyone!			"

												Another good adventure game by Daedalic. I sure am happy with my bundle.Loved the story, the characters and the easter eggs.The game has some flaws of which most are probably to do with me and my machine, but overall it is a great game.Pros:- Interesting story- Great characters- Simple controls- Easter eggs?- No annoying puzzlesCons:- Some minor issues with game performance (probably my fault tbh)- A card game inside the game gets boring fast (but you don't have to play it if you're not hunting for the achievement)			"

												A fantasic adventure. Just like other games by this company, it has a nice twisty plot. Like Whispered world, it is an amazingly built world with a story that has a touch of the darker side constantly lurking it its background. This game will end with you wanting more, as you patiently wait to see if there will be a sequel. I highly recomment this point and click adventure and mystery.			"

												This is quite the amazing story. It's not just a game, but story/art/game all wrapped up in a nice package. It's well layed out with a great storyline that keeps you questioning where it's going to go next. As well as puzzles that always have you coming back to revisit all over. This is very nice as it doesn't seem like the game is too linear and holding your hand throughout it.			"

												I adore this game. The story is not fast paced, and the story takes a while to come together but that is one of the things I liked about the game. The sense of wonder and excitement as I wandered through the beautiful scenery, solved a puzzle or discovered a fragment of information made the game worthwhile for me. The slower pace made me feel like I got to know the characters, which helps in solving the puzzles. The puzzles were never hard, but they were also never boring. The collectibles were also great. The sticker collection was adorable, and I liked that you could play games with the cards you collected. I was sad when the game ended, and I plan to replay it, which I do not normally do. Highly Reccommended.			"

												Probably my favorite Daedalic adventure game and the one I would most hope for a sequel; it was lightly set up for one with a post game stinger cutscene.Point and click adventure game, innocent and nostalgic wizard's apprentice setting with hints at darker more adult elements outside your awareness as a child.I would recommend looking up the achievements beforehand if you care about that sort of thing because a few of them are missable.

												This game is beautifully drawn, and overall lovely to play. I enjoyed all the characters' personalities, and the story was engaging. Some dialogues were long as on these kind of adventure games they always tend to be, but with subtitles on you can skip them if you are a quicker reader than they are talkers ( make sure you don't miss anything important though! ). Also, there are a couple of optional 'mini games' inside which were a fun to discover. I think this game might have ruined other games for me, as I don't remember enjoying anything that much since the Longest Journey came out.. Ugh, but it was worth the wait to find something truly enjoyable. Thumbs up from me!			"

												I don't write many reviews, but this game was so good that I just had to share my enthusiasm with others!  If you have ever felt nostalgic for the stories you might have read (or had read to you) when you were a little kid, this game is exactly what you have always been looking for.  The storyline is whimsical, witty, and humorous and is appropriate for adults and children alike.  You cannot help but be entertained by Jerry and the colorful characters he meets.  The voice acting (in the English version) is particularly well done, especially for Jerry and the Marquis.  To me though, the best part was the music.  The score for this game is truly excellent and if you are wondering if it is worth spending a few extra dollars for the premium version so you can get the music and audio books for the game, the answer is yes, it is worth it!  Even the mini game associated with this game is fun (the Quartets card game).  I have played few games in the last several years as satisfying as this one!			"

												I found this to be a very compelling puzzle game, it reminds me a lot of the point and click adventures of my childhood, except with an adult level of dificulty. The world is stunning and relaxing to be in, and the challenges will keep you enthralled. I really enjoyed the immersive story, and appreciate the extra content provided. The extra audio book stories that you can listen to seperatly help transport you to the middle of mousewood, and would be perfect tp listen to on a rainy night with a cup of hot cocoa. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of point and click adventures, but know that unlike many in its genre this game does not feel cheap. You can tell the love and dedication the creators put into it, to make this world feel real. Being that its a world of anthropomorphic animals, the world is very reminiscent of The Wind in the Willows or the world of Beatrix Potter. So if your looking for a relaxing but compelling adventure game that brings on the throws of childhood nostalgia, try picking this up. =)			"

												-- not good++ good ++ The graphics are amazing!++ The ability to change the time of the day and the puzzles adapting accordingly is a nice feature.++ The various spells are spicing up the puzzles. ++ Calling a mailman frog to take you around the place on bike rides is a-good-frustration-reducing-time-saving feature.-- Some puzzles are not logic or intuitive.-- It's easy to get lost because of the ambiguity of the names given to the areas.-- The puzzles and dialogues are childish.-- Some characters were mentioned then forgotten, they were left out of the story loop.-- The ending is lacking the surprise element, is fairly dull.-- The unoriginal and unnatural feeling of the cards game.6/10, passed my test, so I'd recommend it.

Also there is a plot twist. Good.Cons :● Collectibles are hard to findI strongly reccomend this game if you are interested in Point & Click games.			"

												Outside in the real world it’s grey, moody and depressing. Fear not, because here comes The Night of the Rabbit.The Night of the Rabbit is a colorful point and click game with a dark twist. The game delivers on the artwork and overall visuals, but the story is also very entertaining. As the game progresses it becomes more clear that everything isn’t always what it seems to be at first sight.The soundtrack fits the game with overly sweet songs mixed with more strange and epic ones.Even years later I still enjoy the soundtrack from time to time and it always takes me back to some of the games locations.The atmosphere in Mousewood and the surroundings is relaxing and can easily give you a warm feel at times. Still there is always this sense of ‘something is off’ and it is this sensation that helps to build up the total feel for the game.The puzzles aren’t always very logical and can get frustrating without looking it up, but for me the advantages of the game vastly outweigh this point.The minigame with cards is also very fun to play and you’ll want to go on until you get all the cards!All in all this game is one of my favorite point and click games especially at times when your mood can use a boost. Also, if you have a partner this game is perfectly suited to play together while you hang out on the couch in front of the big screen on a rainy Sunday. Highly recommend it!			"

												Positives: Beautiful hand-drawn art style. Wide variety of Interesting characters.Nice combination of humour, seriousness, and emotional moments.Well-worked, non-linear puzzles.Often difficult and quite absurd puzzle solutions. I list this as a positive as I enjoy these, as long as they don't go too bizarre, which I didn't feel any in this game did. The first point-and-click game I really got into was the first Discworld game, which probably accounts for my enjoyment of absurd puzzles. This could be a negative for some people.Enjoyable Go Fish-like card-based mini-game.Bonus hidden-item collectables throughout the game, unlocking extras such as audio stories based in the game's universe.Charming voice acting. The child who voices the main character does a brilliant job of making it the main character believable as a young boy struggling with being out of his depth but also excited about the adventure he's been set on.Negatives:Editing of the sound files is sloppy at times. Seems to be most noticeable when looking at inventory items.There were some themes introduced in the game which ended up not going anywhere. For example, towards the middle of the game a fairly strong anti-urban-sprawl theme comes in, but then is never really addressed or averted throughout the rest of the game. Similarly with some of the abilities you learn throughout the game - some you learn so late in the game that you don't really then get much use out of them before the game ends. I felt more puzzles could have utilised these abilities.As mentioned in the positives, some of the puzzles are quite difficult/absurd, which may be frustrating for some players.Overall I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys point-and-click adventures, and in particular, comedic, fantasy-based ones. The story is wonderfully developed and the characters all add their own unique flavour into making a very charming, immersive game world to explore.			"
