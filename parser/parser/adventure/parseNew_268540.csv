""I should have fed him in time...""The Whispered World is one of Daedalic Entertaintment's adventure titles, and promises a lot as it starts, yet fails to keep any of those promises throughout the game itself. I wasn't expecting an experience as grand as Memoria, but at least hoping for the kind of quality in story and display of beauty as we encountered in Chains of Satinav. What I encountered, was beautiful potential spent badly on a sad little clown.The storybook opens and a worn-out narrator warns us that this will be the last story that he'll be telling ever. Then, we meet Sadwick: the sad little clown. He is a misanthropic, pessimistic and annoying little boy who runs a circus alongside his brother Ben and his grandfather. One morning, Sadwick jumps down from his bed, shaken and terrified of a nightmare that indicates the world is ending. Oh, wait! According to a messenger of the King that Sadwick will be meeting in the forest, the world IS ending for reasons that we are not aware yet. The messenger Bobby advices Sadwick to seek Shana, a mythical oracle that resides in the forest who can interpret Sadwick's dream. With a quest at hand, Sadwick's journey towards the unknown starts...I'll start with my most basic complaint: the game doesn't work properly! There is an odd clicking bug that starts the minute you run the game, and keeps haunting you until the very end. You have to click on something 5-6 times for the game to acknowledge that you are clicking on it. It is hellishly annoying for a POINT AND CLICK adventure game. The puzzles themselves are obscure and random enough, and you never know whether you're trying the wrong item combination, or just game doesn't register your clicking. On that manner, it is impossible to finish the game without divine persistency and a walkthrough.The background art and the interface music are pretty, as if taken from a German folktale. But characters and the style of art chosen to illustrate them are off putting. Animations are broken half the time, and the lip synch with the audio is non-existent. It takes forever for Sadwick to walk with the given animation. It seems all these issues are commonly known for the ""Special Edition"" and no solution has been offered for now.As a character, our protagonist Sadwick is incredibly annoying and lacks personal depth. His voice is off putting - and drives you insane since we'll be with him only until the end of game. There is no logical correlation between story progression and any kind of visible personal growth either. Nothing justifies his choices, and nothing explains them either. There is also no observable reason to Sadwick's endless vailing or suffocating pessimism to begin with. Sadwick is a character which is impossible to empathize with. He is basically shallow.As for Spot's - Sadwick's victimized caterpillar - transformations and the way that Sadwick treats him, I found it to be disgusting. Poor little thing is literally tortured to even achieve given transformations! He is sliced, pressed and burned numerous times without even a single complain! He is even nailed to a rack as part of a puzzle nearing the end of the game. If I were to be Spot, I'd tell Sadwick: ""♥♥♥♥ you! ♥♥♥♥ you for being a selfish and miserable fool! ♥♥♥♥ you for putting me through all these ordeals! You don't deserve neither my loyalty nor my affection! I'm done with you, Sadwick! Go play the part of the sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on someone else! ♥♥♥♥ you!” Whew, sorry. I gotta get that off my chest.I definitely don't recommend this game, for its broken controls, its annoying protagonist, its sick sense of humor, and definitely for its dramatized yet shallow ending. Sorry, guys and gals. I finished this game through sheer willpower and an obsession for completing a story that I started. I love the next Daedalic adventure just as you do, but this one doesn't worth it.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												I found this to be a very charming point-and-click adventure game.  The focus of the story is on a depressive child clown by the name of Sadwick, who departs from his family circus to avert the end of the world from coming to pass.The story is more of a whimsical one, but the game is not a comedy and does take itself seriously.  You get a nice amount of character growth from Sadwick and the course of the story has you meet new and interesting characters in each scene along the way.  The amount of depth to each character you meet was pleasantly surprising, and at least a few really made for some happy smile-inducing moments and the German voice acting is quite expressive (see my note below) .  The environments are very beautifully drawn and in-game animations are very good too.  There are some cutscenes which have less polish, looking maybe more like a 90's cartoon but overall did not detract from the experience for me.  The music is quite good, even if some of the tracks are re-used a few too many times.Game ran just fine, but doesn't alt-tab too well.  Saving, mouse controls, the GUI are all perfectly fine.  The game has no failstates, and you can hold Spacebar to highlight interactables.  This game does have a fair few number of puzzles that are not easy to intuit the solutions for, so you will likely have to resort to a guide more often than you'd like.  This is par for the course in adventure games, although the par is a bit high in this game.I also wanted to address a few complaints I saw a lot in other people's reviews.Performance : Many users complained of the game failing to launch, launching to a black screen, or crashing.  I never once had any such issue.  I hope others who do are able to resolve theirs.Sadwick's walking speed : Some users complained that Sadwick walks too slow.  In most adventure games you can double-click on screen transitions to automatically trigger them.  You can do that in this game too, so its possible those users did not know.  Sadwick walks at a fine pace otherwise, no scene is especially large bar one and even then the transitions in that area are numerous.Voice acting : I heard that the English dub VA for Sadwick is unbearable and whiny.  Given his personality in the game I could see why this might be, so I used the original German voice acting and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I have no problems with using the German VA.Broken audio : Some users comment that audio seems to cut off abruptly at the end of some spoken lines.  I cannot comment on the English audio, but this is sometimes noticeable in the German audio. I did not find it common enough nor disruptive enough to say it was any significant detriment, although the developers should fix it if so.Controls : Some users complain the game fails to register mouse clicks.  I never had this happen, but you do have to hold down the mouse button to open the small interaction menu.Story : Some people just don't like the premise or character personality, or how the game ends.  That's fine, its just down to taste.  I enjoyed it, others will not.All in all, I would recommend it.  I very much enjoyed myself.  About 10-12 hrs playtime.			"

												A Point & Click Adventure where you can't click! How novel!Seriously, this game has been broken since launch (going on a year) and still has not been fixed and it appears the Developers never plan to fix it. If I hadn't gotten a free upgrade from the Classic version I would have demanded my money back!The only way this game is playable is to download the Source Code for the Open Source Simple DirectMedia Layer, make the change listed at http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/rev/e3a80970cf0b and recompile into a .dll and save it in your game directory. Why the Devs can't do this for those who aren't familiar with modifying third-party code and compiling from source is beyond me. Is it just laziness, apathy, or a simple case of ""Doesn't matter, already got your money""? Apparently  Daedalic Entertainment thinks they are Ubisoft.0/10 in it's current state.			"

												The Whispered World falls into the realm of zany adventure games, complete with a morose, unlovable schlub for a protagonist.  Unfortunately, zany and surreal adventures invariably involve a certain amount of ""try everything on everything"" to progress, and this runs afoul of the crappy interface.Frequently, The Whispered World fails to register a mouse click, so you never know, when trying an object on another, or an object on part of the environment, if it truly did nothing, or if the game simply didn't notice your attempt.  Sometimes it takes four or five clicks to get the game to respond.  After the third time that I gave up on a puzzle, checked a walkthrough, and discovered that the correct solution was, in fact, one of the first things I had tried, except that the game hadn't deigned to notice at the time, I gave the whole thing up as a bad exercise in frustration.If you're masochistic enough to endure this game, make a point of clicking several times when trying anything; hopefully one of the clicks will register.  The art, incidentally, is quite beautiful, it's simply a shame what aggravating hoops you must jump through to see it.(And, yes, my mouse works fine in all other applications, so I feel confident blaming the game engine for this non-responsiveness.)

												I'm sad to say I can't really recommend this game. It is kind of buggy as other reviewers have pointed out but that wasn't my main problem with it. It's just so, so slow. The character walks everywhere at a snail's pace, the controls are awkward, and the puzzles are unintuitive.I wanted to like it, the animations are very nice and charming, but the voice acting is terrible. The main character especially is very annoying when we're supposed to find him a lovable failure. Mostly the game is just boring, and I say that as a person who usually loves point and click adventure games. I got almost to the end when it became so tedious I had to quit. I thought I might go to youtube to watch the end but I found I couldn't even care enough to do that.			"

												The original is great, but the Special Edition has broken audio - every spoken sentence ends a split second before the speaker has finished talking.  Still not fixed...Play the original Whispered World, not this ""Special"" edition.			"

												tl;dr: Some really fantastic artwork and an interesting world with fun secondary characters to explore. That aside, this game misses too many marks to be really good, and becomes almost a chore towards the end, mostly due to the old bane of point & clicks: illogical puzzles and rushed final chapters.It's a mostly melancholic story with great moments of bleak humour, one that promises to be interesting but loses steam along the way. There is some fun writing to be found in it (I do love me some Talking Rocks and any and all quips they feel like making are fine by me), but the story becomes weirdly convoluted in the last chapter. The world building is fascinating nonetheless, and along with the gorgeous art they are clearly the highlights of the experience. As for the english voice over, it has some bad moments but it's mostly alright. The hero's voice may take some getting used to though.For me the major let down is that too many of the puzzles are really unintuitive and illogical, and there is only that much drudgery I'm willing to accept in my play. I don't care if that was fine when Lucas Arts did it, it isn't fine now, especially not if you expect me to traverse multiple screens with a really slow character to try out totally random things that follow no internal logic whatsoever. It gets worse as the chapters progress, and by the last one you'll have too many moments of being hard pressed to figure out what to do next without immense patience or a walkthrough. Any guidance, even subtle indications, would have helped, but they are as lacking as any type of a hint system.On a positive note, if you were worried about bugs the ""Special Edition"" seems to have taken care of most of the previous problems. Just bear in mind that this is an older game so there are limited resolutions offered - expect black bars if you have a wide screen. High DPI displays will also need to disable display scaling to be able to play in fullscreen.So would I suggest it? Probably not. I'm usually a sucker for projects of love even if they end up being lovable trainwrecks, and this game oozes love for its unlikely world-weary child hero and its odd world. But halfway through it just stopped being fun to actually play, there were one too many misses and not enough hits. While I don't regret the time I spent with it, I still can't recommend it and I'd suggest waiting for a steep discount if you decide to try it yourself.			"

												I have such mixed feelings about this game that I'm hard pressed on whether or not to recommend it.To start off with, the artwork is absolutely GORGEOUS and features traditionally animated cutscenes. The music is quite nice as well, though the voice acting is hit and miss. The characters themselves are quite vibrant and full of personality - we follow the journey of our would-be hero Sadwick, a down-on-his-luck circus clown with clinical depression, who discovers that he has been fated to... destroy the world. As you can imagine he rejects this prophesy, determined to instead save his world from crumbling to dust. Initially I found Sadwick's character to be annoying with how whiney he was about everything, but as I followed him and got to know him, I started to relate to his depression more and saw much of myself reflected in him. He really just needs a hug. As for the puzzles, they're fairly difficult and often frustrating and illogical. More than once I had to look up a guide.UNfortunately, despite how gorgeous this game is and how interesting I'd found the story, the direction the ending wound up taking I felt to be such a massive cop-out that I'm actually pretty angry. In retrospect it was pretty obvious, but it was such an extremely lazy and unimaginitive ""plot twist"" that it pretty much destroyed the rest of the game's magic. So, while everything else about the game is good and I would recommend it based off of that, the ending is just SO unsatisfying that I feel extremely conflicted to say yes.If you truly want this game, wait and get it on sale. Don't waste your money paying full price just to be slapped by the ending.			"

												I bought this game a few years ago for 40 or 50€. Boxed version. I played it through as fast as I was able to. It's very atmospheric and the backgrounds look epic. As far as my son will be old enough to enjoy such games, it's one of the very first games we'll play together.I still remember what happened at the very end of the game. Just this moment is worth to invest time and money into this game.			"

												I'd been hoping for the game to eventually get fixed, but by now it seems the devs have given up on trying to establish any solution for the matter. The inventory works fine in the tutorial, but inexplicably, past that point, it refuses to open. The context menu is a massive frustration as well, being very challenging to use (due to related mouse input recognition issues). To be clear, the game is literally unplayable, as I cannot progress past the opening area, due to being unable to access the key in my inventory.Also, as far as what little gameplay I can actually critique:The English voice acting for the main character is painfully poorly done- however, you do have access to several other language settings, and subtitle and vocal language settings are seperate (so you can still get English in the subtitles). If you're opposed to utilizing a non-English language for the game sounds, you may want to take a quick glance at a Let's Play to see if the voice acting bothers you.You can read more on the mouse issue in this thread: https://steamcommunity.com/app/268540/discussions/2/541906348043730288/ "

""This statue ain't moving. Pretty much like everything else in my life.""One of my most favorite genres is point n' click and Daedalics are THE titans of point and clicks. I learn more about the characters if I explore everything. It takes me a while but I'm in no hurry. After all, that's how point and click should be played. No such thing as speed run. Everytime Daedalics tell a different story that makes me want to stay with characters longer. A pity every story has an end. The day will come when you'll have to bid farewell to your fictional friends. This time it's a story about Sadwick the sad clown and Spot the caterpillar - his handsome sidekick and best friend. Sadwick is a lovable character. He's a lovely satirist and a courageous boy. Complains about problems but still tries his best to do everything in his power and can't leave things undone. He's not your casual hero that likes making promises and then break them. He's more like an anti-hero that doesn't care about fame and glory. He just wants to fix the big end-of-the-world problem. The nightmare that he has been having turned out to be a good excuse to start exploring the world. He is very insecure and has anxiety problems so I can relate to him. I wish I were as brave as that kiddo.  Sadwick isn't as stupid and useless as his older brother Ben makes him feel. I've always wanted to punch that guy for bullying Sadwick. I could never forget about the awesome talking rock bros - Ralv and Yngo, that wanted to enslave the world  with a rock hard fist but sadly they couldn't do anything but lie about. Grandpa's underpants are more useful than arrogant Bobby the Chaski. I played it in english and I like Sadwick's voice. Not sure why people think he has an annoying voice. I think it's quite adorable.That game has a deep meaning and I would hate to ruin it with spoilers. I just wonder how many of us would like to preserve the world they've been living in without changing anything or whatsoever and for what price.			"

												The Whispered World is a beautiful game that stirs deep emotion and brings a good few laughs along with it, cleverly using satire without overdoing it and creating a depressed character that is 100% likable. Sadwick is amusing, adorable, and superbly written, displaying characteristics of those with depression accurately which allows people to relate to him easily. I have seen rather a few complaints about the voice acting, which personally I thought was brilliant. At no point did I cringe or find it unnatural, and I found that the tone to Sadwick's voice was perfect for his role and his personality. He has asthma, vertigo, depression and anxiety which he either comments on or is obvious throughout the game, giving a wide range of mental instabilities that people can relate to. The backgrounds and soundtrack are absolutely gorgeous, and the artwork you gain for finishing the game are a pleasure to look at and feel like a very worthy reward.The clicking sometimes doesn't respond and you have to double click or place items in a very specific place, but I found myself wanting to continue the game so much that by a few minutes in I really didn't care about the extra clicking sometimes required and even got used to it. The hotspot indicator is VERY useful in the game and you WILL have to use it in almost every screen, but again I just find the feature useful and it didn't bother me at all.Daedalic are masters at immersive point and click adventures, and this was just the beginning of their incredible games. Their gift for creating magical stories with interesting and likable characters sparkles in this game, and at the reduced price it is now, it's well worth the money.			"

SummaryThe Whispered World is a point & click adventure game made by Daedalic Entertainment. What most likely seemed like a good game on paper (a medieval fantasy setting and a basic mystery to build a story around, decent graphics, nice music and sound effects) turned out to be a sub par game due to its meager story, its lack of interesting characters, its awful voice acting and the fact that too many situations will have you searching for a walkthrough to look up the far-fetched or completely illogical solution.Story, humour and voice actingYou play as Sadwick, a child clown from a small family of travelling circus artists. Sadwick is plagued by ominous nightmares and he wants to find out more about them. So he's off to find an oracle who supposedly lives in the forest where the circus happened to make camp.Sadwick is a whiner. Plain and simple. In every conversation he will talk about how he feels sad and worthless, and complain that nobody likes him. Even after statements that don't call for whining, he does it anyway. For example, when clicking on a statue and he says ""The statue won't move"", he adds ""Pretty much like everything else in my life"". Even after basic statements to tell the player ""I can't do that"" he sometimes adds things like ""I'm too stupid/clumsy/weak/worthless"". This gets old very soon.The story and the dialogue aren't very captivating. Most of the conversations are repetitive and long-winded with little content. It didn't take long before I found myself skipping through most of it and just glimpsing the gist of the conversation from the subtitles that raced past. A second reason to skip through the dialogue is the terrible voice acting. Sadwick's voice is forced and annoying. Most of the other character's voices are annoying, too. The remaining voice acting is mediocre at best.The humour isn't funny at all. A senile grandpa who says 'compost' when he means 'compass'. Hilarious. Your character who misunderstands the messenger when he says 'the whispering stone' and repeats 'the blistering bone?' Side-splitting. If childish wordplay isn't your thing, don't worry. They included gags that require visualizing, too, for example:""That stone looks like a cow's behind""!Not far into the game things seem to take a turn for the better when an interesting and mysterious element is added to the story when some sparking electrical conduits appear out of nowhere in this medieval world, in our protagonist's trailer no less! But Sadwick says, and I quote: ""I've decided to just ignore them"" and that's that. You can't talk to the other characters about them and you can't examine them further. Seriously? This is the equivalent of looking out the window into your backyard, seeing a space ship landing there and thinking to yourself: ""Ah well, I'll close the curtains and have a look what's on TV tonight"".The ending is predictable and actually makes little sense when you think about it. But it's clear the developers didn't give the story a lot of thought so we shouldn't either, I guess.GameplayThe gameplay is a bit strange for a point & click game. A minor gripe is that you have to target stuff with the centre of a large mouse pointer. Even though it doesn't take long to get used to this, it keeps feeling clumsy throughout the whole game. More importantly, they turned The Whispered World into a 'point & hold game': a regular short mouse click only makes your character walk to an object, but to interact with it you need to hold the mouse button down for a second. The whole thing just feels counter-intuitive.You can press SPACE to highlight all the objects you can interact with. I read that a lot of people find this game hard because some of the puzzles are rather far-fetched, so I used this function a lot. I wanted to avoid 'pixel hunting' and getting stuck because I missed some small item in a corner somewhere. Sounds like a plan, right? Well, the first time I got stuck and looked up a walkthrough, it turned out I missed an item anyway. This item was hidden somewhere, in a corner so to speak, and it did not show when pressing SPACE. *Sigh* So use the highlight function, but don't count on it being foolproof.And, by the way, those people were right: at least a dozen of the solutions to problems in this game are far-fetched or just don't make any sense. After a few of those moments I pretty much gave up on playing this game without a walkthrough next to me. Which is a shame, because that takes a lot of the fun out of playing an adventure game.When you execute one of those impossible-to-guess solutions, Sadwick litterally says: ""That's so crazy... I don't even know why I try."" Seriously. No kidding.The developers even created an achievement for using a walkthrough! You get an achievement called 'Walkthrough user' for solving a puzzle without performing any wrong action, which is indeed only possible if you're following a walkthrough to the letter. There's another achievement that requires you to do a whole segment of the game perfectly, without making any error, so that's pretty much the same thing.Graphics and soundThe graphics are decent enough. The decors of this medieval fantasy world aren't breathtaking but they are easy on the eye. What I don't understand is why a 'special edition' release from the year 2014 has no widescreen support. Besides, the game was originally released in 2009 so it wasn't ancient to begin with. But unless you still have a 4:3 monitor, you will see a broad black bar on the left and right side of your screen. This isn't a matter of settings. Take a look at the screen shots on the store page: they have the black bars, too.Often, you hear no music at all. But when there is music playing, it's quite beautiful and atmospheric. I especially liked the music in the second chapter. The sound effects and the ambient sounds are very nice, too.Bugs and crashesThere are a few minor bugs in the game. Sometimes you hear or read a completely different line than intended. A few objects still have their German names. Like I said: minor bugs but signs of sloppiness nevertheless. I also experienced a couple of CTD's (crash to desktop) so save regularly.On Steam's extra featuresThe Whispered World has 7 trading cards. You'll get 4 while running the game.The Steam Achievements are uninspired. First, you have your classic, unmissable story-related achievements. Then there are a few missable achievements. I already talked about the two achievements that reward people who use a step-by-step walkthrough or at least a 100% achievement guide. Well, there is also an achievement for skipping all of the game's minigame puzzles. That's about the equivalent of giving a medal to wartime deserters, isn't it?The other missable achievements usually boil down to 'perform an optional action 10 times'. Each of those 10 times you'll have to sit through an animation or even an entire cutscene, so they're pretty boring achievements that you'll only get when you use an achievements guide.And then there is an achievement called 'Master of Disguise', which you get for clicking a few hundred times on some ingame buttons. Again. They already did the same thing in The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav with its 'Destroyer' and 'Healer' achievements.Steam Achievements can be a great thing when they add optional extra 'quests', challenges and depth to a game. I'm seriously starting to have my doubts about Daedalic Entertainment. Apparently they are convinced that 'click some buttons 500 times' is a challenge that adds more fun to playing a game, and that people should be rewarded for using a walkthrough and for skipping puzzles. I still have a few more games from the 'Daedalic Bundle' to go, so wish me better luck on my next pick...			"

												Beautiful artwork and music - the aesthetic component alone makes this a worthy game. It's breathtaking! The story is fantastic and quite emotional; even though I was able to guess at the ending, it was quite impactful. Many hate Sadwick's voice, but I like it, in a so-irritating-its-funny kind of way: ""Who are you again?"" ""SADwick, your GRANDson."" The world created by the devs is vibrant, creative, and beautifully brought to life. The only drawback to the game is one common to the genre - illogical and obtuse puzzles. So, have a walkthrough handy for occasional use and enjoy a beautifully told and realized story!			"

The gameplay is good, with the many combination (see, speak, touch) items and places you can get/ find some funny dialogs.

												The whispered world, or 101 ways to use grandpa's old pantalons. The only thing I knew beforehand is that there is a twist at the end. But by the time I got there I found myself snooping through the walkthrough, just wishing it to finish sooner. The animations are super slow and the controls unresponsive, so so the whole thing is tedious. Most puzzles work on a mix of perverted logic and animal abuse. But the worst of all is the voice acting. You're going to listen to the sickeningly irritating voice 90% of the time, so it's kind of a big deal. The only language at least tolerable is German. English is horrible, Russian sounds like a cheap pirated recording from the 90s, etc. There were things in the game I liked, but all in all it was not an enjoyable experience.			"

												If you like point and click games I think you should already know that Daedalic Entertainment are the masters of this genre. And The Whispered World: Special Edition doesn't disappoint in the eyes of fans.I have to be honest with you, I've encountered none of the problems reported by the earlier reviewers. I don't know whether they have been patched or not by this time, but my experience in the game leads me to believe that they have been.In this game, we follow the journey of Sadwick, a want-to-be hero with clinical depression, who discovers that he has been fated to destroy the world. As you can imagine, he rejects this prophesy, determined instead to save the world from crumbling to dust. Sadwick is a clown in the fantastical realm of Silentia, where he travels with a circus featuring only his brother, his grandfather, and himself. His life consists only of menial chores, burping the alphabet for audiences, and playing the cannonball in the headlining human cannonball act. His brother despises him and his senile grandfather forgets he exists. So yeah, he's a pretty lonely and depressive character. The game is full of dark jokes like ""This statue ain't moving. Pretty much like everything else in my life."" which is pretty funny and emotional at the same time. You will find yourself asking a lot of times if you should cry of laughter or maybe of sadness. Also, Spot, the caterpillar, is his handsome sidekick and the only friend he has, but they are a great team together. The main character complains about a lot of problems but he tries to do everything in his power to don't leave things undone. He's not your casual hero that likes making promises and breaking them after. He doesn't care about fame and glory. He just wants to fix the big end of the world problem. The nightmares that he has been having turnes out to be a good excuse to start exploring the world in which he lives. So that's how his adventure begins.The world created by the developers is vibrant, creative and beautifully brought to life through the eyes of Sadwick. And while many complain that the ending was awful, the story really got into me and let me tell you that it will have a very emotional impact on you too. Like any Daedalic Entertainment game would do.Pros- The story is fantastic and quite emotional with an great impactful ending.- Absolutely stunning hand-drawn artwork!- Excellent soundtrack that should get you excited for the fantastical adventure that follows.- Over 10 hours of story-driven atmosphere!- Developer commentary on each and every screen in the game you can listen to, that offers great insights into the art direction, story, and puzzle design, with a few puzzle solutions spoiled. Or stories and memories from the development process if you are interested about how the game was done.Cons- No widescreen support even though it's special edition.- Many illogical and obtuse puzzles. A couple of puzzles make no sense until after you’ve figured them out by accident. So don't be ashamed, open a handy walkthrough for occasional use and enjoy the beautifully told and realized story!- Sadwick’s voice takes some time getting used to, and the voices are sometimes interrupted with a second before finishing the sentence.- Some of the dialogue and humor feel awkward.ConclusionSadwick is a lovable character. He's a lovely sarcastic and courageous boy with a bipolar side. Like any kid, he's confused about a lot of things, he's very insecure and has anxiety problems which will let many people relate to him. This game is a nice portal to our childhood and I'm sure you'll find yourself a lot of times in the main character. The story is suitable for just about everyone, so you can play it with your kid if you want to. In the end, how much you enjoy this game will be particularly subjective, depending on what you look for in an adventure game. If you’re willing to tolerate some ludicrous puzzles to enjoy a beautiful world with gorgeous, top notch art and music, you’ll find The Whispered World worthwhile.This review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to both Steamified and Daedalic Entertainment for providing the key for review purposes.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

												This game has simply awful controls.  It makes me miss King's Quest; even the keyboard early versions of 1-4 were better than this junk.   I can't just click on a person to talk to him.  I have to do some kind of special action that MAY open my inventory instead, which takes up half the screen.  Speaking of the inventory, even if I want to interact with items in the world I'd have to move away to get to the said puzzle and by then the inventory box and my hard-fought for item has disappeared. Clicking on ANYTHING requires space bar and to mouse over EXACTLY the center of the hint circle to open eye/talk/take bar, which then one then has to click with your left mouse button.  It takes three actions when it could be just one.    This is a nightmare.  I have no way to get past the first three screens right now and no hints as to how to accomplish that piece of work, except maybe finish up the chore list?  I have the map already but no luck leaving behind the circus-- Ben just laughs at me if I try.  I want to punch him and his smug face looking down on Sadwick, even if Sadwick is irritating himself.  Speaking of which, I can't speed up my @#%$^ slow character and his angsty lazy teen voice is super obnoxious.  In conclusion, this was a waste of $5.00  At least Night of the Rabbit was playble and had decent voice acting even if the puzzles were occasionally ridiculous.  It was playable enough that I purchased this without looking to see if there was a demo.   I'm hoping the other game I bought by this company is more playable than this piece of junk because I just spent $15 on that given the recent Christmas sale.			"

												I've finished Deponia series before this game. Both games are from same developer, Daedalic.Both are fun point and click game and have nice puzzles. But...Can't Daedalic make a good ending?? Both games have nice world settings and stories, but the end of the stories, both Deponia and The Whispered World have disappointing ending and ruined my excitement.This game only supports 4:3 screen, and the biggest resolution is only 1024x768. If fullscreen is checked, there is a black bar in both sides of the screen.I also noticed many bugs : Some dialogs have a sound which doesn’t match the subtitle. The one I remember is when Sadwick arrived at Shana’s house, when talking to notes beside the door, the text showed Sadwick’s Line but the voice was Shana’s. Some clickable objects doesn't get highlighted when pressing Space, and sometimes it highlighted but nothing to click there. Starting at chapter 2, somehow the save game didn't showing thumbnail at all. And the thumbnail suddenly fixed when saving the game in the later part of chapter 4 (the new save game have correct thumbnail).I only recommend it if you like point and click games with puzzles and looking for easy 100% achievements.There is a good guide for 100% achievements, and all the achievements can be unlocked by single play through (unlike deponia series).Other than that, nope. It's not worth the time to see the story. Buy Deponia instead, it has more puzzles, more jokes, and supports widescreen.			"

												There are things to like about this game, but for me this would be a neutral review if it were possible.Back before the special edition was out I tried to play this game a few times. I’d never get past the first chapter because I didn’t want to have to use a guide. I found the main characters voice pretty annoying and I wasn’t really feeling at all connected with the character I would have to stick with for the entirety of the game. Despite that, the concept of the game sounded interesting and at the time I thought it was a well-loved classic of a game. With a closer look, maybe this wasn’t as popular as I initially thought.I started up the special edition, determined this time to finish. I have to say, I think this game would be impossible for anyone to finish without a guide. Some of the puzzles are a little nonsensical and it seems quite easy to miss clues as to what you’re supposed to be doing. There is a level of logic to what to do, but it was spread very thinly at times. I found this game a little frustrating regarding the puzzles. Admittedly at times I am pretty horrible at point and clicks, but I don’t think I have ever had such a hard time with one as I had with this one. I love Daedalic’s games and I definitely love their charm and style, but this one is probably the worst of theirs I have played so far (although, it should be taken into consideration that this was one of their first games and it is pretty old).I noticed in other reviews that people mentioned bugs and crashes. Fortunately for me I had no problems at all with that kind of thing. The game ran perfectly for me, as said above, I just wasn’t very good at it.It has to be said that the art in this game is absolutely amazing. The background scenery really are works of art and they have created a beautiful world here. It was also quite nice that they have added in an icon in the top left that you can press to hear developer commentary. Although spoken in German, it was nice reading it to see the personalities behind Daedalic a little more. You can definitely see where the humour and style comes from.The concept of the game and the story was enjoyable. I’m not sure it was great enough to say that it made up for my frustration just trying to get through the game, but it was still enjoyable. I grew to like the main character a little more and his cute little sidekick Spot. The game in general had an old-timey fantasy film feel about it. Like Labyrinth or The Never Ending Story. I quite liked that as you don’t really see much with that same feel to it these days.All in all it’s an okay game. I found it pretty difficult to get through but I wouldn’t say it was bad. It’s a fairly easy game to 100% as long as you save often to keep checkpoints and if you are a fan of the genre or the developers then you may as well give it a go and see how you get on.I don’t usually say this but for some reason with this game I am interested to know how other people got on with this game. Would you agree that this was a difficult one to get through without a guide or am I really just that bad at point and clicks?TL;DR : It’s okay, but that’s as far as I could say. I would rate this neutrally if it were possible. The art is amazing, the main character took some coming around to, the puzzles are a little nonsensical and it definitely wasn’t my favourite point and click, but it ran perfectly for me despite other reviewers saying they had problems with bugs and crashes.

												For me this Daedalic point-and-click adventure was quit charming and entertaining. The main focus of the story is on a depressive little clown named Sadwick, who lives with his family in a travelling circus. He has to depart from his family to prevent the end of the world....so far so dramatic :DThe story is more fantastical and the game has his funny moment, but its not a comedy. You get a nice amount of interesting characters along your way and Sadwicks character is growing with the story. I can't say how the game is made in another language, but the german voice acting was very pleasant for me. Some of the characters really made me happy smiling during their time. The whole environment is very beautiful drawn and in-game animations are very good too. Only thing to say is that some of the cutscenes have a lesser quality but for me it wasn't disturbing. The soundtrack/music was a good and fits good in the background, but if you hang some time at a point you notice that it was quite repetitive. Also the end of the game was surprising for me but I guess its a matter of taste. For me it was a happy ending and sad at the same time if that makes any sense for you :P I dropped some tears ...also watch the outro, there are really nice drawings that explain a lot The game itself, saving, mouse controls and the GUI worked perfectly fine for me. Only point of criticism it doesn't support tabbing out of the game very well.The game has some puzzles games that are not easy to intuit the solutions for, so you will likely have to have a look to a guide here and there (especially if you want all achievments and not playing the game 2-3 times)To address some points from other reviews:Performance : I never had any problems at launching the game or crashes during the playthrough, but also I don't have a idea why it happens to them :/Audio: as mentioned above I play the german verion and had no noticeable audio cut offs or problems with the dialogs.  I was reading on many YouTube comments and also on Steam that the English voice from Sadwick is beyond endurance and whiny as ♥♥♥♥. The german voice was also quit whiny but reflecting Sadwicks personality perfect and was really fitting to the characterMouse controls : Some users complaining the game fails to register mouse clicks correctly. Most of the time I had no problems but in Chapter 3 I had some problems to put the bucket on the elevator ropeStory : some people don't like the story or the characters at all, but its a matter of taste...I really enjoyed the story and had a lot of fun (see above the part with the ending)All in all, I really recommend ""The Whispered World Special Edition"". I very much enjoyed it and guess the average playtime is 10 to 15 hrs depending on how experienced you are in that kind of games			"

												""We've reached peak adventure game; I'm literally just hitting everything against the next obstacle to see what works.""Play this for the fun characters, a fairly interesting story, and most of the puzzles, which are largely intuitive.Do not play this for the 20% of puzzles that make no sense (several times, your hero critques a correct solution by saying ""well, I don't see why this would work, but okay""),  and DO NOT play it for the ending, which is cliched and disappointing.This is a very marginal ""recommend.""

												This game is pretty and has interesting characters and the story seems promising, but there are too many issues with gameplay. The most annoying is having to click on something a dozen times to get the action menu to open. Also, dialogue trees are ridiculously longwinded and boring. I can't get past the second screen because the thought of exploring all of the clickable objects and dioalogue options with the characters is just too exhausting. Too bad :(			"

												I played this game in January 2015, and encountered none of the problems reported by the earlier reviewers. I don't know whether they have been patched or not, but my experience leads me to believe it has. Also, like many games from Daedalic, if you press space bar any clickable items in the area will be highlighted.Overall, I recommend this game (on sale) to someone who has already played some of Daedalic's other adventure games (Deponia, Memoria, Eye of Satinav) and just wants to scratch that itch. The protaganist of this game is like a depressed, not-as-arrogant version of Rufus from this company's Deponia series. This game is one of their earlier games, and it shows in some decisions. For example, in order to interact with anything, you must first click on the object for 1/2 second, which brings up the icon interaction wheel (eye/hand/mouth) THEN you click the icon, then the action occurs. Every single time. In a point and click game. The voice acting isn't terrible, but it did not motivate me to have the sound on while playing either. There were some interesting visuals and puzzles (spot parkour!).			"

												Usually I’d review a game using three simple criteria: Quality of the Story,  game world and gameplay.  For this particular game I’ll ignore the story and the game world for the simple reason that I personally didn’t like either one. As for the gameplay, I really did try giving this game a fair chance, but some puzzles are seriously beyond unreasonably illogical.  One example would be having to go back to the prison cell after freeing Spot and burn away the hey to uncover one of the valves. There is just no logical reason whatsoever to do that.  Another example would be using Spot with the pearl pressing machine to create the “five spot form”.  In both examples and many other, I found that the game just doesn’t provide enough feedback to direct the player towards the proper solution.  Of course one could claim this is the general purpose of a point&click adventure – to point, click and combine anything with everything until something works. Personally When playing a Point&Click adventure, I prefer it to be more of a nicely flowing interactive story rather than a guessing game.			"

												Nope, screw this game.I wanted to like it. I did like it.  But it black-screens on startup everytime and I have to play around with fullscreen and windowed mode until it finally works.  Crashes all the time for other people (although I didn't experience this myself).Icing on the cake was when I just got stuck.  Not stuck on puzzles, although those are annoying in themselves because of having the stupid pet caterpillar that you just have to guess where you can maybe use him even if it doesn't make sense.Stuck as in I couldn't move. At all.  Couldn't click on and interact with any of the objects in the world and move from where I was.  And for a game with no autosaves, that is just ♥♥♥♥ing annoying.  Forces you to have to restart the entire game because there is nothing you can do about it, and no support from the developers on fixing any of these problems.  And I don't mean exiting and reloading a save.  Completely starting over because loading doesn't unstick you.Screw this game, it is too frustrating dealing with the bugs for a game that has terrible voices and is a mediocre point and click at best.

												Who would expect that a clown would be a hero?Well, The Whispered World Special Edition puts the player in the shoes of Sadwick, a clown. He's not just any clown. He's a clown with no talents. He's scared and uncertain about what to do with his life. The game goes on to talk about his story and how he ""save"" his world.Aside from the story, I like the music and character voices. Sadwick's voice sounds like a person talking with a running nose and has the flu, but it fits with his personality. Furthermore, this is not just a simple point & click game. There are short animation clips that added to the storyline and makes the characters feel real.However, this Special Edition has problems with mouse clicks and animation & video syncing. For example, when trying to click somewhere on the screen, there are instances where the mouse click would not register. Furthermore, some animation clips had voices that did not match the video animations. Besides these few mishaps, The Whispered World Special Edition is a fun and short little game!Rating: 6.2/10 (62%)Achievements: 10/20 (50%)Game Done.			"

Short version: 79%An interesting point ‘n’ click adventure game with a bunch of unique ideas and almost painfully broken controls. Whispered World is probably not the greatest game released by Daedalic Entertainment, but if you like stories which set up everything for the last five minutes, then it’s a must-have.Long version:The Whispered World is an interesting specimen. At first it seems like a usual old-style point ‘n’ click adventure, where the plot is large suppressed by the depressingly pessimistic attitude of the protagonist. On top of that, the story introduces a lot of seemingly unconnected and strange elements at every turn, which usually don’t lead anywhere in particular. Until you get to the very end and realise Whispered World is like movies such as Usual Suspects or Sixth Sense: everything was just a very long setup for the final huge twist.Is it a good twist at least? It’s hard to tell. To some degree it’s predictable and clichéd. On the other hand it is a bittersweet ending that fits the overall tone.The seemingly unconnected aspects of the plot translate into a fairly challenging puzzle system, where the role of items and hotspots are not always (or always not) obvious. This leads to a fair share of trial and error scenarios, especially in the last third the story, where everything gets increasingly surreal.From a technical standpoint, the game has a few problems, like disturbingly choppy animations and sluggish, somewhat unresponsive controls. Many people also suffer from audio sync problems. These shortcomings won’t make it unplayable, but they may result in some unneeded frustration that could have been averted with a little more care.

												Before I begin in earnest, I'll give this caveat: It is absolutely imperative that you turn off the audio for the dialogue in this game. The person they employed to voice the protagonist delivers, bar none, the absolute worst performance I have ever experienced in a game within this or any other genre. It's not just a case of it being weird or unconvincing (though make no mistake - it is both weird and unconvincing) - it's a case of it actually inducing physical pain via headaches. It is whiny, grating, nasal, and draws out every vowel for about twice as long as it should. It is Woody Allen mach 10. It is so unbelievably terrible that it took me four years between buying the game when it first came out and finishing it today, as in my first play session I found Sadwick's voice so utterly loathsome that I uninstalled the game and forgot it even existed until the Special Edition popped up in my library out of leftfield.So, with that said, is the game worth playing? The answer to this question is a heavily qualified 'yes'. The hype that built up around The Whispered World in the lead-up to its release was, in my estimation, completely unmerited, but it's a good enough game.Much has been made of the lack of logic in the game's puzzles, though in my experience only a half dozen or so had a 'How in God's name did they expect me to know that?' solution. While moments like this are infuriating and speak to anachronistic game design, if you're prepared to just consult a walkthrough when you're hopelessly stuck, attribute the momentary catapults into the sky of stupidity to infrequent acid flashbacks on the designer's behalf, and then just carry on resituated on our beloved terra firma, they're not intolerable. In my estimation most of the puzzles are actually amongst the better within the genre, but some may just have a single step which is complete nonsense, or, worse yet, actively go against what Sadwick intimates you should do with an object in his 'hint' dialogue.Divorced from the godawful voice acting, the writing is actually pretty decent and on a few, rare occasions genuinely funny. The plot employs a stock standard three act structure (albeit spread over four): get quest, get delayed, complete quest. It brings nothing new to the table in this respect, but it's serviceable.My primary criticism of The Whispered World is the world itself. The hand drawn art is certainly pretty, if somewhat lacking in vibrancy, but the world itself is just dead. It's quiet, depopulated, and dull. The Asgil, which are meant to be an impossibly fearsome threat to everything good, are two guys. No more. Two guys - the boss and the bumbling underling. A halfway prepared opposition could take these guys out with slingshots and peas. That would be if the world's regular inhabitants who might form this opposition weren't similarly scarce. Most acts introduce no more than three new characters, whom you never really need to speak to more than twice (albeit at some considerable, and arguably unnecessary length). I didn't really care for the story of this depressive clown prophesied to destroy the world, because it was a world I found impossible to become invested in. It's not so much a world as a series of tableauxs, connected with varying degrees of success. My sole motivation to persevere was to find the next puzzle. And as an addendum, I also found the ending to be a self-consciously sentimental attempt to lend this rather small and unambitious story an unearned sense of epic, emotional gravitas. It's not signposted in any way, and really just feels cheap, but I guess your mileage may vary on this.If you're a hardcore adventure game enthusiast, by all means give TWW a shot, but that's really the only audience that would truly enjoy this game, because the state of the genre over the past decade or two has turned us into a rather forgiving lot. I'd advise anyone else to steer well clear.			"

												I really enjoyed that beautiful, intense and sad point and click adventure. I have a lot in common with Sadwick I guess (pessimistic, vertigo, few friends, tend to do what I think right even when I'm told to do the opposite, lack of orientation, etc.) but I still don't understand the way he treates Spot ! Poor happy innocent creature ! Anyway, the music and the drawings create an atmosphere that makes you want to play. At the end of the game, there's some trailer, ""the Whispered World 2"", doesn't seem to be really relate to the first game... But I'm gonna wait for it !			"

												Look, i wanted to like this game but in the end I'd say its about as good as Edna and Harvey. The visuals were good and the story was decent but the voice acting was a bit annoying and all the puzzles were random. This game is extremely hard to complete without a walkthrough. The problem is I didn't like the main character just like I didn't like the main characters in the Edna and Harvey series. When you can't identify with the character, it looses its power. Still, it was an enjoyable enough of a game and I do look forward to its sequel. I still highly reccomend buying the daedalic pack on its 90% of sale. All the games combined are totally worth it. This game was decent but all in all, the Satinav Series is the best one.			"

												It's hard to judge The Whispered World. The gameplay wise it is hit'n'miss. Most of the puzzles are badly designed. Why, you would ask? I've got a feeling that most of them (and their results) were planned before the actual script and the developers shoveled them afterwards, not caring that they make absolutely no God damned sense. Some people mentioned it already, but let me repeat after them. Some actions needed to be taken are plainly illogical and there's no chance I would thought of them before reading a solution. Maybe it comes from the fact, that people responsible for the puzzles needed this action but for the next puzzle which is unbeatable before taking said illogical actions. Eg. aquiring the five balls Spot's form is absurd, but you need this form in order to progress in the birds puzzle. But how do I know I need to have this exact Spot's form to pull it further? I do not know of course, because I didn't know this form exists and what for it would be needed. In order to be aware that there's a possibility of aquiring a new Spot's form I need to know how the bird puzzle is designed to be solved... But I do not know that from obvious viscious circle of this certain situation. The action taken to aquire the five balls Spot is just absurd itself! This machine would have killed everyone and there's no way I would sanely put anything living there. All in all, puzzles (except the minigames which are fine) are subpar, often illogical and irritiating. Other Daedalic games did much better work at this.This brings us to the next hit'n'miss aspect of the game: characters. Most of them are really extraordinary and interesting, like the Rocks or the dwarf responsible for the train. Some quite funny lines happen there as well. But the main protagonist is just a mess. A lously clown, depressed and cynical, a person with an obvious death wish, with a clear friendship towards his pet. He often screams in horror ""Spot, are you all right?!"". But then he throws Spot to the machines that would clearly kill it, in order to aquire its new forms that are illogicaly needed in some puzzles. I mean, how more interesting to the birds are five little Spots than fire Spot? Oh wait, this puzzle's outcome was clearly designed without the thought of integrity with steps needed to progress it. Also, like someone said already, Sadwick is a clumsy fellow, but yet he success in everything he does in the first try. If you design your main character, stick to the core God dammit.The game sometimes has problems with telling us what's our next goal, throwing us to the curse of point'n'clicks: click♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥everything you can, hoping that something moves on.Why do I recommend this game then? It looks the best from all Daedalic games and has the best story of all. It's the only game in years that made me rise my eyebrows at the end. Just play it through for the sake of aesthetics and story. Reading the solution won't make you regret it too much.			"

												I REALLY wanted to like this game, I truly did. Its a Daedalic game, and they're great at point and click adventure games. But the trouble lies in the story and main character. Trying my best no to spoil the game, none of your actions matter  in the end. Even the last action you do didn't have true choice to it. I think multiple endings might've changed my opinion, like the element of choice in Edna  and Harvey 2. Also Sadwick is just... the worst. Like the absolute worst character. His voice is annoying and EVERY SINGLE DAMN COMMENT is a complaint, a lament, or a whine followed by a long winded sigh. I couldn't even enjoy the rest of the voice acting and ended who muting my computer because I hated it so muchTry another Daedalic title, because theres just way better from them out there. The only reason I do not recommend this game is because they have so much better in there library to choose from			"

												I have a hard time with the idea with point-and-click adventures where logic is null and the way of progressing is just testing every item on every point of interest, and to try to add every item in the inventory together until you finally get a match. That's just me, I find that gameplay so tedious. But that may be ok if it's a good story. This one has not, so I'm not even captured by that. To make things worse, the main character is one of the most annoying you've ever encountered. (getting challenged by other Daedalic protagonists though). The result is a slow game with often dissappointing attempts at being funny. Don't like the inventory style either. If you love point-and-click games though, feel free to disregard my review. I encountered no serious bugs.			"

Lovely drawn ""Point & Click Adventure"" about a depressive clown who will destroy the world xDChallenging puzzles, funny characters, good story (feels like a fairytale) and a very unexpected ending.As a bonus there is a developers commentary on each screen (mostly includes puzzle spoilers).The only negative point is the voice-acting of the main character ""Sadwick"". He is so sad that he gets annoying after a while.			"

												I never got around to playing this game after I got it some while ago. That changed with the release of the Special Edition, and I finally got to accompany Sadwick on his adventure to save/destroy the world. Seeing that I never played the regular edition I can not compare the two, but the special edition seems to add very little. Mostly you have the option to listen to commentaries in every scene by the creators of this game. Graphic is supposed to be upgraded and you now get achievements. I don't know if there is anything more than that. Anyhow, nice to get an updated version now before the release of the next game in the series.The game itself is beautifully created in a cartoonish and colorful world, with equally colorful characters. The artwork is magnificent. It is as expected a point & click adventure game of the traditional sort. Familiar to anyone who is familiar with other Daedelic games, and other similar game developers.The biggest plus of this game is its story. It is interesting and engaging all the way through with a finish that rivals most great game finishes. All characters are voiced and there is a narrator as well. The narrator does a good job, but some of the other voice actors leaves a lot to be desired. The voice of the protagonist, Sadwick, sounds like when Adam Sandler speaks childish somewhat crossed with Cartman from South Park. In other words it can be quite annoying at times. It doesn't help when Sadwick is a very depressed character that is pessimistic about just about everything. Now, there is an underlying reason for this, and one seems to get used to the voice eventually. There are other poor efforts of voice acting too, but nothing that gets on your nerves. It's by no means all bad. Some characters are voiced quite well, especially some of the ""evil"" ones.(Note: I have only played the English version and can not comment on voice-overs in other languages)What is probably more annoying is the fact that the voice overs seems to go straight from one into the other with no space/break between them. Badly coreographed in other words. It even has a few lines broken off too early and even completely which is really poor. Hopefully they will come up with a fix for that.I also found the pointer/clicking to be quite unresponsive at times. I had to try another game to check if it was my mouse going bad or if it was in fact the game, and unfortunately/luckily it was the game. The controls was a bit clunky in the first place, but the unresponsiveness certainly didn't help.Achievements is a nice new addition, but also this seemed to be a bit bugged. There was a couple I should have gotten but never got. I'm not an achievement horder, so to me it doesn't matter much, but if this is something that is important to you it doesn't seem to work correctly. Probably an easy fix that they hopefully will deal with quickly enough.Don't let the negativity scare you off though. I still recommend this game for any fan of point & click adventures and anyone who appreciate a great story. The bugs/issues are easily overlooked if you are not to caught up in details. In fact the story itself is worth your money and time to play through this game. It also helps that it is from Daedelic, who is one of the companies who has kept this genre alive through hard times. And they have done so with lots of great titles. They deserve some support from us who appreciate games like this. Throw some money at them ;o).6/10			"

												I've played quite a few Casual Games in my time ranging from Adventure to Hidden Object to Match 3, and I must say, the Whispered World Special Edition, is one of the best I have played in a long time!!WARNING! REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SLIGHT SPOILERS, Nothing major though!!The game starts out with Sadwick, a 12 Year old depressed clown in a Fantasy World known as Silentia. He is asleep in a moving trailer and keeps having the same nightmare. The world is collapsing and there is a Blue Moon that keeps haunting Sadwick. When he wakes up from his nightmare, we are introduced to the action and get to start playing!GAMEPLAY & CONTROLS -This game is a 2D Side Scroller, where you almost exclusively use the mouse to move Sadwick around, talk to characters, pick up and use objects, combine objects, and bunch of other things! You also use ESC to access the Main Menu, Save/Load Screen, etc. and the Spacebar to show ""Hints"" (It just shows you what you can click on in the current scene.) For the most part the game controls quite well, everything is nice and fluid. By holding down the RMB (MB2) for about 1.5 seconds on an active area, a menu pops up where you can interact further with an item (You have an Eye for Looking closer at the item, a Mouth for talking or eating, and a Hand for picking an item up.) This works well as you are able to examine items in a game closely than most other games, and it's sometimes funny (or sad) to hear Sadwick's thoughts. There are a fair share of puzzles, and 4 Mini-Games (I'll get into that on the Difficulty Area) in this game. You'll get an Acheviment every-time you solve a Mini-Game, or you'll get one if you Skip them all!GRAPHICS & ART-STYLE -This game has amazing art and graphics! All of the scenes are hand-drawn and the animations are also hand-done. They look stunning and not something you see a whole lot anymore in games. One of the highest highlights of this game is its fantastic art-style! As far as Graphics go, for a game released in 2009/10 I say its aged pretty well! There are no Graphic Options (Basically what you get is what you get) and there is no Widescreen Mode and the Resolution does max out at a certain point. Somewhat disapointing since this game was released in 2010, however not a deal-breaker and something I am able to overlook. In my person opinion, I think you will not be disapointed by the way this game looks, in fact, I think you will be amazed!STORY -The story in this game is fantastic! It's very emotional at times and has amazing plot twists! Some of the most unexpected things happen during the storyline. There are a total of 4 Chapters in this game! It took me around 6 Hours to do the First Chapter since I was trying to get used to the gamplay, Chapter 2 took me around 3 hours, Chapter 3 around 2 1/2 hours, and Chapter 4 around 3 1/2 hours. Keep in mind I am usually slower at completing games. The story again is another amazing highlight of this game. I don't want to spoil anything though, so I won't go much else into this, but in my Personal Opinion I don't think you will be disapointed with the story. It is so gripping and keeps you on the edge of your seat for most of the adventure!DIFFICULTY -This game starts out pretty simple (Like most games) however it does get pretty challenging. Challenging to the point where I had the YouTube Walkthrough pulled up in case I needed it! I do consider myself an Expert at these types of games, however on some things I couldn't figure out, some made sense once I saw it and other made absolutely made no sense and you would only do it by purely guessing. Also, the Mini-Games are another story! I skipped every single one after attempting each one for about 10 minutes. There are 4 and there really isn't any ""Logic"" behind 3 of them. It's just guess and hope you are right. So I would mark this game down for it's poor puzzle design. Now, I don't want easy puzzles, but I don't want puzzles that are just random and don't have you show any logic to solve them. Other than the Mini-Games, there are random puzzles spread throughout the game and some can be solved by looking around at other areas again and searching through your inventory, and some (for most of you) would probably require you to look up the Walkthrough on YouTube to see how they did it. One downfall of this is the Difficulty, it's pretty brutal, however you will get thorugh it. It doesn't prevent me from reccomending this game! Like stated above, it took me around 16 Hours to complete this game for the first time. I am usually slower at completing games. For the average person I'd say it would take around 10-15 hours depending on your Skill Level.SOUNDTRACK -The Soundtrack for this is AMAZING! Some of the tracks can keep you on edge while playing while others are more mellow and relaxing to listen to. The greatest thing is this game comes with the complete soundtrack free of charge (You can find where your the Game Files are for this game > bonus > soundtrack.) It comes in .mp3 and .flac! It's $6.99 on iTunes and Amazon, and I was considering buying it until I found it in the game files (I wish they told you it came with it) so I'm telling you this now to prevent you from accidently buying it on iTunes or Amazon. Again, the Soundtrack is another reason to buy this game.ACTORS, DIALOGUE, & CHARACTERS -**NOTICE! I played this game using the English Voice Actor and English Subtitles!!**One thing most people criticized on was the Voice Actor for Sadwick in this game. Yes, I will admit it's not the best ever and he does sound whiney and depressed (which he is a ""Depressed Clown"" so I shouldn't be so surprised on that) however I don't think it's THAT bad. I personally think it's okay. If it absolutely bothers you, try using the German voice as I've heard that's better from other reviewers, with the English Subtitles. The Dialogue in this game is pretty good. However some of the language that they use I'm not 100% sure most 12 year olds would understand. Like I've kept saying, he is depressed, so he does hint certain things that would be suicidal at times and sometimes just down-right sad and makes you feel bad for him. Examples: ""Nothing here but a Deep-Dark shaft, much like my life;"" ""Nothing but a deep dark abyss. Don't do it Sadwick, stay away from the edge..."" Sadwick also uses the words ""D*mn"" and ""He*l"" a few times in this game. You will meet other characters throughout this game however usually you will only see them for only that Chapter and then once the chapter is over you won't see them again the rest of the game. There is one exception to that, however that would be spoiling part of the story so I will leave it out.FINAL THOUGHTS -It's an amazing game! I would totally reccomend it if you enjoy Casual or Adventure Games, enjoy 2D Side-Scroller type games, enjoy games with Emotional Stories, or enjoy Difficult Games (Again, don't let the difficulty detour you from buying the game. It's an amazing game and don't let my thoughts about the difficulty persaude you otherwise from buying it simply because of that reason...)I reccomend this game!!			"

												Yes, this is definitely a worthwhile game to play. I've enjoyed playing Daedalic Games all the time, from Rufus's ridiculous antics in Dapeonia to the heart-warming stories of the Treewalkers and Marquis. You'll find so much creativity in Daedalic games, from the description of the Memory Thieves to the beautiful artwork of the Multi-eyed Angler Fish (You'll have to find those things on your own).PROS1. Creative StorylineIt starts out extremely boring at the beginning but the story gets better as you progress. You'll find tons of interesting imaginatives scattered all over the place to keep you interested. Proper storytelling. E.g. Asgil (GILSA) just make one wonder what they look like.2. ArtworkGood quality. I enjoyed the graphics and the way the art comes alive in the animations. E.g. Bruno sleeping at the Circus.3. The Story TwistHeh... Not bad... I understand the meaning of the ""Whispered World"" now. In reflection, I think I won't leak any spoilers.CONS1. Too DifficultIt's nearly impossible to complete. You have to use Daedalic's Gameboomer walkthrough in order to finish it. How does one catch a rat with a sock? Or use a rat to save a pair of pants?2. Ridiculous StuffPicking pantaloons with rats? Oil from milking a cow? No conservation of mass? Some things just niggle at you in the wrong way due to how illogical it is.NEUTRAL1. Alternative EndingI couldn't be bothered to find it as the game was just too long.			"

												Pros: Interesting and compelling plotSimple but mind-bending puzzlesCute petBeautiful sceneryCons:Main characterHonestly, if I were a different person with a different set of chemicals in my brain, i would probably like this game. I love point and click puzzles, and the plot in quite enjoyable, or would be if the main character wasn't so damn depressed. I have enough trouble maintaining emotional stability, if I'm going to be pretending to be someone else, I at least want that someone else to be happy.TL;DR if you are a genuinely positive person, this game will be quirky and fun. If you tend to be more melancholy, the main character will drag you down.			"

												This is the first review I've ever written for a game on Steam and it was one I felt compelled to write.I really loved this game, and all the characters.   I can understand how some people wouldn't like an ending like this, but I loved it, I honestly got a little bit choked up at the end, just for a moment.  lolTo me it felt a little like watching an old 80's movie, for example, The Hobbit or The Dark Crystal, that same sense of wondrous mystery and fantasy is present in The Whispered World.This is the story of a young boy-clown named Sadwick who runs away from his circus to go on a mystical adventure to save the world with his pet caterpillar pal Spot, both characters are cute and funny, Sadwick, our protagonist, being the pessimist and Spot, who doesn't say much, more of an optimist.Some drawbacksSometimes clicking on things to activate them or combine them is difficult, I sat and left clicked sometimes 30-40 clicks before the item would combine, or the cork would go in the hole, for starters.   This seems excessive.   Maybe there is a problem with my mouse but many other simple one clicks worked fine.  Only when trying to combine or activate items, or get Spot to change form, it would be some time spent left clicking clicking clicking.The dialogue while charming gets a bit tedious towards the ending as people keep talking and talking, luckily you can left click through to skip dialogue, which works fine, sometimes accidentally skipping a line of dialogue, a little too easily.   Sadwick's voice gets a little bit annoying but I still like the protagonist, he's a funny, cute little dude and his annoying voice fits the character properly.   Everytime I was asked to talk to someone like Gourney for example, however, now THAT got really annoying, Gourney was one of the worst voices I've ever heard, and like I said towards the end of the game I just couldn't be bothered to listen to much of his dialogue.Some of the puzzles were a little bit strange and ridiculous.  I'll admit I'm not much of a puzzle games sort of guy.  You may end up needing to find a decent walkthrough; although by the end I don't feel this distracted or took away from my enjoyment of the story I was following a walkthrough myself for a good part of the game.And it was fun.    I really enjoyed this and I look forward to checking out other Daedalic games, such as the upcoming SIlence and their other games in Deponia!!			"

												I found this to be quite challenging at times in terms of the puzzle solving and had to refer to online guides throughout the final chapter. Overall, it's quite a strange game; the soundtrack, mise en scene and puzzles themselves were very quirky and I found a lot of the humour to be either overly sophisticated or bizarre. I really didn't like the voice acting for Sadwick, but you can't always get what you want. A nice little twist at the end there (no spoilers here) that I didn't see coming.

												I had bought this game some time ago, but hadn't really given it much time. When the special edition came out, I decided to step ahead and invest time playing this game and I'm glad I did!I really liked the puzzles of this game, since the majority of them were pretty rational and went well with the story. Music and graphics is also a big plus! I also enjoyed the audio parts of the game's writers, which provided cool insight on its development and kept wonderful company throughout the story.If you are a fan of adventure games then this is a must, and if you are just stepping in the genre, the special edition of The Whispered World can be an ideal start.

												The Whispered World is a wondefully drawn game let down by lackluster voice acting, some illogical puzzles and a disappointing ending.This is a point and click adventure in the traditional sense, it doesn't really try to innovate or stray away from the genre in any way. The only thing slightly unusual is that you have a pet creature following you around, which can also transform into different forms. And that regularly comes into play when trying to solve puzzles, thank goodness too because there are a lot of fun interactions made possible by this.So what are the primary components of a traditional style point and click game? Well, that would be the story, the setting, the art, the dialogue, the voice acting and the puzzles. The parts where this game does well would be the art and the dialogue. The story and the setting show much more promise in the beginning, however as things start to unravel so does the strength of the writing.That leaves us with the voice acting and the puzzles. Except for the main protagonist I wouldn't say the voice acting is especially bad, it is merely let down by bad editing. Plenty has been said by others of the main protagonist and his annoying voice acting, perhaps it was even intentional, but it is bad design to make him so when it serves no story purpose. The puzzle design varies greatly, some puzzles are illogical and appear to exist merely to frustrate the player, while others make use of the tools presented to you in an intuitive and satisfying to solve way.There are also some UI issues that plague the game, but as it is a very minimilastic game I can overlook them.All in all, I recommend it to point & click adventure game enthusiast, however not to very many others.6½ / 10			"

												I'm not very good on adventures game and still I could beat it almost without walkthrough. Puzzles are mostly interesting and logical. God, there's even classic chess puzzle which is placed in the game context perfectly. Also, that speechless caterpillar is one of the best adventure game characters, definitely.And the ending of this game is at the same time unexpected and touching, which is not very frequent these days. One of the best adventure games I've ever played.			"

												Really well written point and click. Sound quality in editing is a bit rough around the edges but the overall experience is very satisfying, glad this got a Special Edition re release. Fans of Daedelic games, Edna and Harvey, Deponia Trilogy etc; will be right at home. Very underated adventure game developers ad this is another of their early classics given a bit of a polish of an update..			"

												The review I am linking says everything that is great about this game a lot better than I can:http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/18187Let me just say that the artwork is hand drawn and is gorgeous.  The vibe of the story makes me think that it is something we might have seen from Hayao Miyazaki had he been european and wrote video game stories instead of movies.  The main character's voice starts out kind of annoying, but grows on you quickly and isn't a problem after an hour or so.Absolutely worth playing.  The sequel is in development and looks very interesting.  I would play this before it comes out and check out the trailer for the second one to see if it piques your interest.			"

												(I originally played this offline, so my listed playtime is not accurate.)I fell in love with Daedalic Entertainment after playing the Deponia trilogy. If I had to select Daedalic's masterpiece, however, I think I would select The Whispered World. It has a poignant, introspective storyline, beautiful art, a plaintive soundtrack, and engaging gameplay. The game is not perfect--there are a few places where the plot drags, for example--but overall it is fun and thought-provoking. The puzzles are challenging but fun, and most can be approached very logically. What is truly great about The Whispered World, however, is its mind-blowing ending--really, this game must be played to completion. I can't recommend this game highly enough, especially if you are a fan of point-and-click adventures.Some people find the voice of the main character Sadwick annoying or even unbearable. Personally, I wouldn't call his voice pleasant but I don't find it particularly irritating, and the quality of the acting is quite good. Certainly don't let it stop you from enjoying this beautiful game. On which note, Daedalic is a German company, but they have first-rate translators--one would rarely know that the game is a translation.			"

												Very weird but enjoyable adventure game. For the most part, it plays just like any other point and click game, with the addition of your pet's 5 personas. Basically, over the course of the game your pet can learn to take on different forms which are needed to make progress. It works pretty well and adds to the puzzle variety. Although the beginning of the game is a bit slow and confusing, it's definitely worth playing through it. Using a walkthrough will make it less frustrating, and the awesome characters and dialogue more than make up for it. I especially love the main character and how he sometimes breaks through the 4th wall. Overall a surprisingly enjoyable game that I would recommend to anybody whether you like adventure games or not.			"

												Hard to say if i recommend it or not..Good sides;Chill music, Mysterious/fantasy back/foregrounds. Cute & well-invented companion, Main character is so sad,depressing & everything around him is hopeless in his eyes (Which i find funny/entertaining as thats exactly how you feel for most maincharacters in puzzle games, Great story & nice cutscenes, Lots of humor. pile of achivements & you get 4 tradeing cards (not worth much but hey!).Bad sides;It took me almost 17 hours of nonstop playing to beat haveing to look at a walkthrough constantly as 70-80% of the puzzles made no sense what so ever (Example combineing a frog to a stick) Finding myself stuck all the time. (I play alot of puzzle games but this ranks up with some of the most frustrateing ones). I also ran into a bug and had to load a save that was 2 hours away before the thing i did mess up (altho i did it right acording to the walkthru). So i'd recommend to save often and always have that 1 far-back, Backup save incase something stops working. Yes sometimes in the beginning of the game there is some cut-off sound/text when someones talking. But didin't notice anything for the rest of the game, Theres also a minor spelling issue (sometimes the character might say (in sound) ""I can't reach it!"", Altho the text says ""I can't reach him!"" (example if ur clicking on an rock thats high up somewhere).Eider way.. I guess i would recommend it if its on sale & get it for the great story and all that, But keep a ""guide"" close at hand. You will most scertainly need it.. Unless you enjoy ripping your hair out, Then have ""fun"".			"

												I've got some mixed feelings here. The Whispered World isn't the greatest point-and-click adventure game I've played, but ultimately it's a solid game that handles its story, characters, and themes really well and features acceptable, if challenging, puzzle mechanics.The best element of the game by far is its character development: specifically, the way the game develops its protagonist, Sadwick. To put it simply, Sadwick is utterly unlikeable when you begin the game. Picture a combination of Jeffery Dallas from the Julian Smith videos and Marvin the Depressed Robot from Hitchhiker's Guide--except that his complaining, self-absorbtion, and misery are all treated unironically, and not as a source of humor. He writes bad poetry about his feelings, sobs over his rotten circumstances, and loses his temper at his lovably senile grandfather. But while the game doesn't treat Sadwick's disposition mockingly, it also doesn't take him too seriously. Sadwick isn't an existential hero fighting helplessly against tragic circumstances. He's just an ornery kid with a lousy life who responds the way any self-interested person might. As the game goes on, however, Sadwick slowly and subtly transforms to the point that you are genuinely concerned with his wellbeing and with the success of his quest. Where other characters inertly accept the coming end-of-the-world scenario at the center of the game's story, Sadwick steps up and tries to change things, certain as he is at first that his actions will prove pointless. The further into the game you go, the less gloomy and caustic Sadwick becomes. And as he grows in confidence--or at least determination--he becomes a truly sympathetic character. By the game's end, I loved the little guy. The game's other characters are more of a mixed bag. Some, such as Grandpa, are quite lovable, while others, such as Bobby (the King's messenger) and Loucaux (the main villain) can be rather unlikeable or one-dimensional. The characters from the game's second section are my favorite. The sleep-deprived landowner Ruben and his loud, enthusiastic servant Bando form the perfect odd couple and are also the most objectively interesting characters in the game. One thing that can be said for the game's characters is that they all embody the story's main themes in unique and fascinating ways. Time and again, characters that occupy ""important"" roles in the game's world prove powerless in preventing the world's end, while little Sadwick the clown from the traveling circus does all the work. But the characters in positions of authority are always weak because they choose to be--because the game's main theme is the contrast between activity and stagnation. So Bobby is paralyzed by fear and ultimately turns over his all-important mission to Sadwick. Ruben idly obsesses over his 10,000 silver pearls and can't even enjoy the luxurious life he has made for himself. And the King, who is supposed to save the world, lies dying behind locked doors that only he can open. It's refreshing to see a story that recognizes that perfection is never static. It's not something that is whole and immaculate until it is broken, but rather something that people must actively work to maintain. The Whispered World's story and gameplay unfold in four large sections, in which Sadwick does everything he possibly can to save the world despite a prophecy (known only to him) that he will ultimately be responsible for destroying it. The episodic structure of the game has some real benefits--and some pitfalls. For one thing, it means that you wind up going to many more locations and environments than you might in the typical point-and-click adventure game. Since there's not but so much backtracking, the game stresses progress and discovery and strikes a nice balance between presenting new areas and fully exploring old ones. But since the game doesn't feature an overworld-style main area, you never feel especially grounded as you play the game. That factor, combined with the real sense of urgency in the game's plot, could make you impatient to make progress. And impatience in this game is a real killer, since some of the puzzles are dastardly hard to figure out. For the most part, the game isn't totally unintuitive--solutions usually make sense once you figure them out or look them up--but the game often doesn't provide many context clues to point you toward the proper solution to its puzzles, and certain gameplay scenarios would be near-impossible to figure out without help. I found myself checking a walkthrough almost every thirty or forty minutes, and I only rarely regretted giving up on certain puzzles. The game is darned tricky, in part because there are just so many ways to interact with the game's environments. In addition to trying out items on environmental objects and on other items, as in most point-and-click adventure games, you can also use your pet caterpillar Spot, in any of various forms you discover throughout the game, to interact with things. And some puzzles require you to use the ""mouth"" icon (which is primarily used for speaking with other characters) on other objects or talk with the same characters on multiple separate occasions to open up new paths. Apart from the gameplay and the story, The Whispered World features pretty good visuals. The hand-drawn backgrounds to each area are lovely and intricate, although they tend to carry somewhat of a melancholy mood. And the game's spare and lonesome music only adds to that effect. Character animations, on the other hand, tend to look unpolished and inexact, and somehow the cutscenes are even worse. The quality of the voice acting is so-so, with certain characters who are downright unlistenable, and the game ramrods lines of dialogue into each other, clipping off the first syllable of most lines and making the voices harder to listen to. Dialogue is snappy--Sadwick throws a lot of nice barbs at just about everybody he encounters--but occupies too much of the game. Conversations can go on forever, and you have to go through some of them really thoroughly to advance in the game. I mean it when I say that this game only gets better and better as it goes along. The story is great, and even the requisite big reveals at the end only add to the meaning of the game. The characters are nicely handled, the gameplay is fun when you don't get hung up for too long, and the game ultimately provides a really satisfying experience to anyone enduring enough to soldier through it.

												Controls are actually terrible, which is very difficult to mess up for a point and click. I played 12 minutes of this game trying to get left clicks to work properly, and it usually took 3-4 left clicks to complete an action. That's after you open the menu for looking at, talking to, or grabbing/interacting with items. Also, the voice acting makes me want to rip my ears off. Please. If I have to listen to a main character for even 4+ hours, make them a good voice actor.			"

												An undeniably charming little game, the art style is beautiful as is the soundtrack, the characters are funny and engaging, Sadwick's depressed commentary is dry and at times hilarious and the setting is lovely, especially if you like quirky folklore type fables, I mean - what's not to love about the idea of ""The Tale of Sadwick the Travelling Clown""? There's a lot of meaning behind the story and The Whispered World will definitely give you some food for thought, especially if you see it through to the amazing ending. The gameplay is standard Daedalic Games Point & Click fare - combining objects, environmental puzzles, tiles, pipes, colours. It isn't groundbreaking, but it doesn't need to be - the formula works, and it works well. One thing I will say though, is that some of the puzzles are not for the uninitiated when it comes to P&C games, I definitely struggled in some areas and caved in to the temptation of Google... - I'd say this is much more suited to fans of the genre and not for new faces.Sadly, the game is let down by a myriad of little bugs... Sadwick's voice actor gets rather whiny and fast (though I hear the German voice acting is much better), poor lip synching, rough cut audio, clicking objects doesn't always work, sometimes when you use something out of your inventory it doesn't do anything... I definitely haven't had as many issues as some of the reviews on here have mentioned, but they do exist, I managed to look past them for the most part but they were a tad annoying. Overall, I did enjoy my time with The Whispered World, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it at full price. If you happen to be picking up Daedalic Bundle and it's included (like I did) then definitely play it, or if you can catch it on sale for half price then that wouldn't be too shabby either - either way, if you're a Point & Click fan, you should try and play it at some point. It's far from perfect, but it really isn't as bad as some people would have you believe!			"

												The artwork and animation are rather good, as is the soundtrack. The voice acting is mediocre, but fits the depressed character. The entire tone of the story is melancholic. The main character is a sad, bored clown roped into things beyond his means that he complains about doing the entire time. To make it worse, moving from action to action is slow due to the character's slow pace of movement on screen and being required to wait until he moves the object before you can interact with it. To top it off, there aren't even every many hints or clues as to how one should be solving the levels, and nothing to keep track of objectives or goals required in order to proceed.There are countless better point-and-click adventure games on the market.

The basic act of clicking on things in game stinks.  A qick click fails to result in the item opening.  A long, held click is needed.  Then, once opened a faster click does or does not register.  So, not sure if this is intended, but, together with slow animations, it makes for a tedious, frustrating experience that I do not have the patience to bother with.

												The whispered world is an interesting ""game"". I say game in quotations because it is less of a game and more of an experience. That at points you will get, and at other points is completely unforgiving. Nevertheless You will almost lose your sense of reality playing this and solving all of its puzzles. It is a game about a circus clown who hates his job, and will destroy the world! I think it might be loosely based on Pagliacci https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagliacci .

												I discovered The Whispered World after beating all three Deponia titles and ending up plowing through Daedalic's game catalog. This title struck out and I decided to purchase it due to the abundance of positive reviews. I had a nice time completing The Whispering World, but I expected more. The game is mediocre at best, containing certain pros and cons that end up making for a experience that is only memorable due to it's unexpected ending. Basically, it functions as a normal point&click game, this one being set in a fantasy world full of queer creatures and interesting places to visit and explore.  The art design is a positive aspect of this title, with original scenarios and striking detail existing in them. However, the low resolution at which the game runs can lower the bar for some gamers. The achievements are easily obtainable and take, at maximum two playthroughs to complete them. Negatively, a hint system or something related would be appreciated. Countless times did I get stuck and had to look for a playthrough in order to continue the main quest. Also, the voice acting is of a poor-medium quality. Sadwick himself proves, after hours of hearing him talk, to have an annoying voice, something that can be game breaking for some. TWW does not offer any reason to replay it's main story, besides an achievement or two. The story is not good nor as it is bad. Just don't get your hopes up. The usage of Spot, Sadwick's pet, is original and distinguishes the game from other point&click titles. I did not have any problems running TWW, no crashes nor black screens. Many players report those problems, so beware of that. All and all, I do recommend The Whispering World to the average point&click gamer. It can be an enjoyable title and besides, a sequel is in the works.Recommended achievement guide:

												So I actually enjoyed this game. It's got great aspects for a standard point and click advanture, but just has a bunch of issues in there. I'll probably try the next game from Whispered World, but you need to know these things before you play:1. You won't be able to listen to the english voice acting, it's unbearable. It's an extreme amount better with german audio and english subtitles. Much more enjoyable. That's how I played through this.2. The save screen doesn't show where you are in the game for some reason, you just have to remember what time you saved and where.3. The ending is a gigantic cop-out.Other than that, this game is enjoyable. Here are complaints people may have:-Sadwick walks too slowly. This is avoidable by double clicking the next area, you'll go there instantly. You still have to walk over to places where you want to interact with an area, but traversing areas is very fast.-Autoscroll is wonky in places. This isn't huge, but is annoying.However, the game has:-Beautiful background art-Well done character design and animation-A fitting soundtrack albeit not super memorableAs much as I'd like to recommend this game, you really have to make an effort to enjoy it after the big 3 issues mentioned earlier. Chapter 2 is slow and a bit painful, but the other three are quite good. The ending of chapter 4 (end of the game) is almost impossible to figure out without a walkthrough. The very end of the game is totally out of place and somewhat clichéd. It doesn't fit the game and I didn't feel like it should have been there. Didn't really give closure.The achievements aren't too demanding, but you should check the achievement guide before starting, because some you may have to do a second run to get if you don't do it right.

Product received for free
												I liked it. It's quite a funny game, made me chuckle more than a few times - I think the main character's voice also may have something to do with that. I just have one complaint though: every time you want to interact with something you have to click, hold, wait for the interaction menu to come up and then choose the interaction option. I wasn't very fond of that. And there's an annoying achievement for using Spot's transformation 500 times, which if you don't do often during the game means you'll have to click until your fingers fall off later on.			"

Daedalic Entertainment is the synonym of success. The game has zero bugs. Some puzzles were a bit difficult, but that was good, because it made the game more challening. Yes, I know that most people found the voice acting a bit bad, but I totally disagree - if you think of the ending, you'll understand why I'm saying this (I'm avoiding to make any spoilers here). I think that everything in this game was perfect. Thank you, Daedalic Entertainment - see you soon in your next game release!			"

												I was pretty impressed with this game, of course the best thing about it is the aestethics. It has gorgeous animation and environment which looks like a fully animated feauture. The artistic theme of Fall colors are present from beginning to end and it ties in nicely with the overall tone and story. There are of course a few missteps, for one the main character Sadwick has an english voice that at times can seem a bit hard on the ears not to mention the silliness of it also kind of distracts from the otherwise pretty somber tone. However it's something I quickly got used to. As for the actual gameplay it is pretty standard adventure game fare, if you've played any of the classic Sierra or Lucas Arts point and click adventures from the 90's especially later titles like The Curse Of Monkey Island you know what to expect. For the most part the puzzles are simple enough but then sometimes you run into that one puzzle that just kinda stops you in your steps and you're forced to switch to a strategy of trial and error. Depending on your abilities some puzzles can be pretty hard to figure out. However that aside the soundtrack, artwork and story really is worth the price of admission on their own and this game has ended up being one of my favorite entries in the genre. Even better, with the special edition a lot of the technical game breaking issues have been fixed so if you were put off from buying this game because of the bugs in the original version (which all owners of the original version seem to have received for free since then) rest assured that this game works just fine and makes for an enjoyable experience.

												A little too cartoony for my tastes.  I understand that point and click adventures are really simple games, and don't usually garner a complex story or rich graphics, but this one couldn't hold me.  Maybe good for a child (I'm early 30s).  I still dig point and click for one-time puzzles with a mediocre story behind so I bought this one in bulk.  Definitely not worth $19.99.  I only played an hour's worth and deleted the game.  Mayhaps good for others...			"

												I played this game in the past, but I admit I quite like the extra knowledge from the developers. They sound quite awesome as they also mention Labyrinth, Dark Crystal and other Jim Henson movies as being a major inspiration for this game. If anything, it sounds like the team is awesome.I found the story to this game interesting, but the ending was really quite good too, however I hate the voice actor for Sadwick. I'm of course talking about the english version, but yes it is annoying. I also love how Daedelic make 2D games again and bringing them back in the spotlight. Not to mention that they aren't half-bad either.The creators are really awesome guys. I had the origonal game when I decided to buy their games after Deponia and now I got this one for free which is awesome.			"

Unfortunately, it is not a very intuitive game, and nearly impossible to play without a walk-through. Steam doesn't have a walkthrough in English, so you basically have to have an internet browser open to play this game. Also, the main characters voice is SUPER annoying, and all of the characters whine all the time.			"

												The art is very pretty and the voice acting is good, but I struggle to find much else to recall fondly. There are many items which are outright hidden from the player just by being hard to see on screen. There's a ""highlight objects"" button which remedies this problem but it's silly that this is required instead of being a shortcut as it usually is. Plenty of the puzzles have unsatisfying, barely-logical solutions and it even does a ""keyhole and newspaper"" puzzle completly straight as it weren't an embarresment. The worst part is the ending, which is a big twist which should change the meaning of all the events in the whole game but really just leaves them behind, senseless. It's a pretty rank cliche to boot. I got spoiled for it and I was still cringing at it.			"

No Way to Set Dialogue to progress only at Mouse Click so ya CANT play the game As A Book!Without it You Cannot - sort the pops between the dialogue lines and TRAIN SPEED reading that it is set to :-/- Play the game with the speech off because you are forced to read at a certain speed = RUINED GAME!.....its such a simple fix to turn this game from a 1/10 into probably a huge amount higher :-( looks like something ill really remember...... but if i cant read it like a book (alowing dialogue to progress only with mouse click/hit enter) then this game is staying as a VERY unfortunate 1/10 :-(			"

												The Whispered World is by no means a bad game. In fact it's actually a really good game, with some exceptional faults that destroy the rest of the magic.The game is a delight to view, the hand rendered backgrounds are exceptional and even the pen and line animations are good, if slightly halting at times. The cutscenes suffer a little as they pull completely from the Disney style animation and lack the richer background texture and colour palette.The music is also a delight, and fits the fantastic world well, with soft natural tones that play quietly in the background and aren't a distraction at all. As for the voice acting, it was fairly bad. The narrator (Sadwick's voice) is nasal and annoying, to the point of being so annoying that I simply ended up turning the sound off and played by reading the subtitles. That said albeit it being annoying, the catch is the voice is a perfect one to suit the pessimistic, morose main character.Now coming to the characterisation, Daedalic seem to enjoy taking unlikable unlikely hero's and making them the protagonists (Rufus in Deponia). Sadwick continues this trend, he complains, and generally acts like a complete misanthrope, to the exasperation of not only his circus family, who deny him doing anything as he invariably messes it up  and himself. It's a difficult character to make a protagonist, as games require an active character, willing to undertake quests and action. As an unwilling character Sadwick seems ""forced"" and it makes him most difficult to identify with, however his lifting mood and transformation after a few success, that makes him more of an optimist alleviate this feeling, so it is worth sticking with. Spot serves as the ability extender in this game, and he is appealing not only for his unwavering dog-like faith and devotion to Sadwick, but also because you can't help wondering what creature he actually is that he can be dissected, set on fire and compressed and yet still survive. Spot is probably the games greatest mystery, and moreover his transitions between forms is amusing to watch.The rest of the characters are fairly forgettable, with uninteresting dialogue and generic set-ups that don't add anything particularly new or interesting to the game, mainly serving as clue givers to the puzzle-solving scenarios.The plot itself is short, and self-contained moves along fairly rapidly between puzzles and is otherwise well constructed, except for the dismal plot-twist ending. It is a plot-twist so generic, cliche and overused that it in fact lessens the impact of the game and delimits the otherwise more interesting philosophical underpinning to the game. It is meant to play upon your heart-strings and emotionally manipulate you, and it does achieve this, you will feel emotionally manipulated, butI still found it to be too disappointing, even though I suspected that he would ""wake up and find it all a dream"".The gameplay is itself not bad as far as point and click games go. The major hold up is the frustrating menu system, that slows down interactions, requiring you to click the mouse twice to look, speak or touch and a rather clunky inventory system, that doesn't support mouse scrolling. Walking about is simple enough, however every now and then the click to walk would hang and I found myself only able to click on interactive objects, precipitating a need to exit and re-enter the area. A fairly frustrating little bug.I really would be able to recommend this short adventure game, but there are better titles out there to play. So only pick this up if it's on sale, you're a Daedalic fan and must own all their titles or have played most of the other more highly recommended point n click adventures and are still looking for a fix.

												Two things initially led me to this title. Having just completed the strangely compelling Broken Age, which wistfully plunged me right back into classic adventure gaming, I was now primed for more quality point and clicking. Then I saw the excellent trailer for The Whispered World's upcoming sequel, Silence. I was sold.Some nice in-game animations and elegant background art make this game mostly enjoyable for the eyes. The carefully crafted hand-drawn environments are all of uncompromising high quality, sometimes with an air of Discworldness charm. The overall visual quality is immediately appealing.The game's most disheartening facet is unfortunately reason alone to completely soil the entire experience: Sadwick is an immeasurably insupportable lead character. His unlikeable depressed loser personality shows very few redeeming qualities and, from memory, bears no comparable equivalent in the long history of comically incompetent protagonists. However, this is still nothing compared to his especially unbearable voice. Why the developer chose to ruin an otherwise decent game with such grating performance and amateur voice direction is beyond reason.Uneven dialogue quality often turns into boring overdrawn segments and repeats unnecessarily. An annoying audio glitch cuts off the beginning of every single line, resulting in characters that appear not to take a breath in between sentences. It is not all bad - there are a few interesting characters and situations, but they get lost in the affair's global tediousness.Interactions feel dated: the player pointlessly grabs anything in sight, often without prior insight to its possible future use, and tries to combine items more or less logically to complete puzzles. Sure, that's old school adventuring, but the game does a poor job of guiding the player subtly or making you feel smart when completing objectives. Most glaring is the illogical use of Spot, the hero's inexplicably shape-shifting pet, which feels like a tacked-on solution for puzzles that otherwise make little sense.To top it off the game kept crashing several times towards the end, coupled with very buggy click registrations that gave it a sense of poor technical quality.There is no telling how much I wanted to like The Whispered World. I really did, but that feeling rapidly transformed into an eagerness to get it over with and move on to something better.			"

												The controls and the handling is terrible. The graphics are decent but Sadwick makes me feel miserable due to his ""everything's carp"" tinted glasses. The story is odd and I have lost interest after getting stuck the fifth time already.Not my kind of game - but if you like Point and clicks - sure.			"

												The English voice over of the main character is absolutely appalling! I've heard some bad voice acting over the years but this takes the entire biscuit box!It flips from someone trying to do an Adam Sandler 'Little Nicky' impression to a depressed five year old and back again, over and over! Its like every single sentence was said with no idea of the context!After an hour of this, I’m sure I could actually feel my ear drums trying to escape and hide in my toes! – so for their sake and mine I had to uninstall!

												Well... *sigh* I got through the first part of the game, with a walkthrough during the last couple of puzzles, because let's face it, I have other things to do than play this one game for as long as it would take me to try every object (or my sidekick, Spot) on every other object in the game. Not all of the puzzles are random/weird, but enough of them are that it is frustrating and near impossible (unless you have that much time to spend on one game with a mediocre story and unlikeable main character).I already hit eject on this game, so I'm leaving this review to save you some cash. The character is unlikeable, the story is meh, the voice acting is overdone, but the art is good. That's all that's good. If you like depressing, middle of the road, cliched fantasy, buy it. I can't recommend this game. I feel gross now for playing 7.6 hours of it, and even with a walkthrough to get past the random pzzles, I just don't care enough about the story to see the end or what happens along the way.			"

												I don't recommend this game. Much better adventure games are out there.Other people reported game-breaking bugs and crashes but I seem to be one of the lucky ones who didn't encounter any problems (except one crash-to-desktop during a cutscene near the end of the game, which I had to skip to get through).Pros:* The artwork is pretty good, although the cutscenes less so.* The story itself is not too bad; it's not exactly original, but it all right.Cons:* The English voice acting of the lead character is very depressing and very whiny. Right from the start of the game, I disliked Sadwick. A depressed character is fine, but being whiny and depressed is just too much for me.* The dialogue tries too hard to be funny. At least, that's what I think it's trying to do. Being depressing and funny at the same time? But there's way too much of it to the point where it gets annoying.* Way too much dialogue. There's a lot of redundant lines and ridiculously long conversations. They're supposed to serve as flavour I think, but there's just way too much of it.* A lot of the puzzles are just weird, and many times you're not sure what you're supposed to do next, with hints being presented only after you've randomly tried something that works.* The pet caterpillar is rather original, but the way it gets used can get downright... abusive.

Had to play the normal one. There is no wide screen option. (unbelievable for a 2010 released game) Main character's voice acting is pretty annoying and dumb. Nonsense solutions for some crazy puzzles. Poor story with a lame ending. Third rate animations and cutscenes. Graphic errors and glitchs in the last chapter.If you want to play a good graphic adventure, avoid this game and try old Lucasarts point-and-click adventure games.			"

												I finished this game with a walkthrough but I didn't really enjoy it. The voice acting, especially of the main character, was so irritating that I turned off all game sounds and listened to my own music instead.SPOILERS BELOW.The story was predictable as heck, I guessed the ending as a joke during chapter 1. I was hoping until the very end that I was wrong about it, but no. What a lazy way to end a story. I would have enjoyed it more, had they  somehow tied the characters in Sadwick's dreamworld to the real world, or in any way added meaning to object or events in the dream world. Maybe flashes of Sadwick's life before the coma, maybe an explanation to why he's so pessimistic about everything. Sadwick as a character didn't grow at all, I had to listen to him whine and complain about everything going wrong in his life while trying to interacting with almost any item in the game. Jeez, way to alienate players from your main character.I did like the minigames in the game, especially the chessboard puzzle, and those I did without the walkthrough. I didn't really care enough (or at all to be honest) about the story to try to figure out the bigger puzzles on my own.  "

												Mediocre depressing point and click adventure game. I laughed exactly twice - and one of those was at *after* the credits had rolled.Personally I think that the story could have been more interesting (and very different) if the deus ex machina at the end of the game had been explored throughout the entire game. I kind of don't want to say what that is because the authors clearly wanted it to be a surprise, but the entire game is a metaphore that you only discover once it's finished. I could go back and play it again to see if there were any clues, but honestly - it's not worth my time.Gameplay wise it had an interesting mechanic with the pet catepillar named ""Spot"" being able to transform into different shapes, which is used a number of times throughout the game to solve puzzles. Some of these aren't obvious why Spot was necessary, but most of them make sense - however I felt the way you obtain new abilities after the first one is completely non-obvious and counter-intuitive, seemingly doing things that by all rights should have killed Spot.If you're looking for a good point+click adventure game, I would recommend checking out The Book of Unwritten Tales, The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief, The Longest Journey (not to be confused with Dreamfall: The Longest Journey), Toonstruck (if you can find a copy of it somewhere), The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav and Edna and Harvey: The Breakout. If you've already played all those and are still looking for more adventure games then you might considder this one. I'd certainly play this over Deponia, but that's mostly because I couldn't stand the protagonist in Deponia.			"

												I like point and click games. I like the humor and the adventure. Whispered World might have these qualities - I will never know - but I can't force myself to conquer such a depressive task. The protagonist Sadwick is a tedious fellow. His voice acting is annoying, the character is depressing in his dialogue and posture even though the premise seemed intriquing. I honestly played through the tutorial and quitted. If you're interested in Whispered World I suggest that you look couple of Youtube videos about the main characters and the dialogue and then decide if this is your cup of tea. I have other games of this genre to play through and didn't want to spend the time with this title.			"

												Nice game. It's enchanting and sad but humorous too which is something Daedalic seem to be good at. As other people have mentioned the solutions to some of the puzzles are totally bizarre, you wouldn't get them without a walkthrough or trying absolutely everything. Don't let that put you off though because the majority of the puzzles are completely fine. Another strange thing was that the game was beautifully drawn and animated, great details but the cutscenes were of a much lower quality. And I didn't like the ending but that's just personal preference.All in all this is a lovely game if you like point and click adventures but I wouldn't say it's worth the full price.			"

												Note: Ignore my play-time, I have played the original Steam version for 24 hours.The Whispered World is a beautiful adventure game that makes you fall in love with a depressed clown. I really don't mind the voice acting. It's charming and it fits the main character. I've been playing this game late in the evenings, with not a soul around. I keep coming back for its amazingly touching artstyle and soundtrack. Sure, the puzzles can be a little bit frustrating sometimes. But I've never played any adventure game where they weren't.So many of them are great and original (Maurice's Medium Museum!).I don't want to spoil anything, so let's just say that the ending hit me. Hard. I was already loving my entire playthrough, and I did not expect for the ENTIRE game to suddenly be put into a new context. They could have made the entire game without it and it would still have been great. But that extra layer of depth just made it perfect.  "

The game is, however, flawed with strange bugs. For example, the game will just pop back to the menu screen randomly. You can click ""return to game"" and it will go back to where it crashed, but still a bug. The cut scenes are the weakest part of the game, with terribly cheap-looking animations. Even the director commentary details how they ended up outsourcing the cut scenes to save money.Despite these oddities, the game is funny, the main character Sadwick is lovable and I enjoy following him through the story. His commentary is so fresh, I literally clicked on everything I could just to hear what he would say when he touched, looked, and licked something (yes, one of the optionis a mouth, and you can ""mouth"" every object). The fact that he also has a lovable, strangly malleable pet catepillar is all the more enjoyable.The puzzles are pretty lame (one is even a slider puzzle...) but you can skip them. The real fun comes with the object puzzles and this awesome sequence where you control your pet Spot. The game is a little overly existential with a peculiar ending, but the game is solid and kind of a gem.			"

												The Whispered World game was great all round.There were a few points in the game I didn't like and thought were a bit annoying (some puzzles) but all in all I liked it, got most of the achievements on my first playthrough, and then ran a quick playthrough to get the rest (There's even an achievement you get if you skip all the puzzles lol).Pros:-Good story-Interesting characters (Spot has some nice abilities)-I enjoyed playingCons:-Somewhat complicated controls (with having to always pick the correct one of the three options available)-Some puzzles are basicaly just luck and annoying (well only the sliding shield puzzle actualy, the rest were allright)All in all I would recommend this game for people who like adventure games with a decent storyline.

												Okay so I have to say, there was a moment or two in which the puzzles were solved in a very...odd manner. There were also a couple of instances in which the audio got a bit funky and skipped, and the main characters voice was initially off putting, but it grew on me after a while. However those small issues aside I would say it was fairly well done, I liked the inclusion of spot in some of the puzzles, The length was good at around 8-10 hours, the story was decent and it had two endings. I would recomend trying this game.			"

												For the good: The story is pretty good, and having a downer main character is an interesting change of pace. The art is pretty good too and complements the story.For the bad: There are some spelling mistakes, the achievements are pretty glitchy, and it pretty much suffers from what every point and clicker suffers from: Solutions that are not intuitive.If you like point and click adventures I recommend it, the good outweights the bad.

												It's nice looking, there are some fun puzzles and a good plot but the game has some faults.- The ending badly lets it down. I hate the ending.- The mouse doesn't always click, which gets quite annoying and can make it hard to play.- Some of the puzzles have no logic to them.Sadwick is at first quite an annoying character but he quickly becomes more interesting as his determination to prevent his fate grows. He's randomly cruel to his pet catapiller, who seems to enjoy it, and then there are the pantaloons... "

The Whispered World ReviewThe best point and click in yearsOverviewThe Whispered World is a German point and click game from 2009. There is a sequel, Silence, released in 2016. I don't know what the Special Edition added, but I'm guessing optimization for modern systems and bonus content. The art is amazing, and the story is great. I recommend this game fully.Pros:+ Amazing art style, looks right out of an old book.+ Voice acting may be grating, but it fits the atmosphere of ""old fairy tale"" perfectly.+ Puzzles are point and click staples, like the sliding puzzle, or using logic and items to help a charactergo from Point A to Point B.+ Story is captivating with a plot twist.+ Music is great.Cons:- Interface isn't intuitive, you have to hold down the mouse to pick what youwant to do with an object or person, look, talk or pick up, when only 1 option worksfor the most part. Will get used to it, but tedious if you have played other point and click games.- Dev commentary is German with English subtitles.- I experienced no issues, but reports of poor optimization.- The protagonist is cruel to his pet for no reason. I don't care, but it makes him look like anasshat.Score:8.8/10 "

												Classic Daedalic P&C-adventure. Actually, I think it's their best work, speaking of the world, characters, story, charm, drawings etc. The puzzles are ok, but the rest is super awesome.			"

												Sadly there are utterly gamebreaking bugs in the game.A hairnet not spawning in your save = You have to replay from start again.I've not felt like playing further since due to it.And yes, I double checked to see if it would be there if I made a new game - and it was.So sometimes, an item will not spawn and will prevent you from progressing completely and you'll have to start over....I spent 4+ hours in this normal version, taking in the story and whatnot, put the game away for a LONG time due to IRL stuff and then came back to it - special edition this time....and to meet this type of game breaking bug is really not making me want to try get as far again.It has a lovely soundtrack, some quirky characters and lovely artstyle, it's a shame the technical stuff seems to have gone bonkers.

												In general, I really like this game. It's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥at times to figure out the different solutions, but it all is solvable, given a bit of thinking and a few hours of try and error.Where it gets to me is the part where the solution is a random sliding puzzle. I have no problem with try and error, but a sliding game that's just sliding tiles around for hours on end... That for me was a real game-killer. Every other puzzle was fashioned in a way that you could get it done either with a bit of leg work or exploring a bit more to look for the stuff you missed. But this sliding♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. After looking at the same plate for just 5 minutes, I was allready tired of trying to solve that part. And it's randomized as well, so every game presents a unique solution to this.I like puzzles, but I don't fancy spending my spare time sliding around tiles, possibly for hours and hours..On that basis alone, it kind of ruined the rest of the otherwise brilliant game for me.

												Played this game to prepare for Silence (the sequel) and never have thought that it will make me cry. Absolutely great story. I recommend it A LOT, even though the puzzles are not the best in the genre. Play for the story.			"

												Another fantastic point and click adventure game from Daedalic.  The voice acting is great(if you can get past the main character's obnoxious one), and the world(and art) is simply whimsical.  The story was really neat and unexpected.			"

												This game seems like to failed for adjusting the degree of leveling. I think adventure game is very improtant of it, but is is totally failed. When you play this game you'll feel something strange and unnatural. I have to find guide posts. (how can i say it, the youtube video that shows playing)However, My thought, I'll never play again which out of this production, was changed when I saw it's ending. I have a little interesing about the next game, silence, but just little. This game is absolutely STORY RICH but remember it can be little annoying.			"

												I am a big Deadalic fan and would love to play this game. Elas, bought it, installed it, but it doesn't work. For a point and click game, not being able to click on things is a bit of a deal breaker. I tried to find a fix online for this major bug, but the only thing I found were other people with the same problem and no solution. So to make a long story short. If you want a fantastic game, buy any of the other deadalic games, but not this one. This one is a total rip off.			"

												Five World Review: A not-so-fun adventure.Favorite Thing: Probably Spot. He was a neat sidekick.Least Favorite Thing: Sadwick. I don't like him. Plus the videos, the 80s (70s?) style animation is retro in a bad way.Completion Date: 2017-03-31Playtime: ~ 6h (Consulted a walkthrough quite a few times)Enjoyment: 5/10 I was looking forward to it ending.Recommendation: Not really. I wanted to play Silence so I'm hoping there's enough of a tie-in to justify playing this one.			"

												TL;DR at the bottom.The Whispered World is an interesting game. FIRST THINGS FIRST:I played this game completely in German with English subtitles. This is because the game is originally in German, so German voice acting is stellar. The English dub has strange audio clipping and is much worse. It also makes the Protagonist almost unbearable to listen to. To anyone interested in playing this game, I would HIGHLY ADVISE PLAYING IT IN GERMAN (with English subs if you don’t speak German). Secondly, I didn’t have any problems with clicking or graphics. The game worked for me from the get-go.THE ACTUAL REVIEW:The Whispered World is a decent point and click with only a small handful of “What the heck am I supposed to do?” moments. The art style is amazing and really feels like you’re inside of an artist’s drawing book. The characters are interesting and the dialogue is often very funny. The music is PHENOMENAL. It puts you straight into the world. The story is interesting and easy to follow, nothing too convoluted. I would all-in-all recommend this game, despite its few flaws.TL;DR: I liked it. Play it in German with English subs. "

												Just finished this charming point-and-click adventure & I loved it!! I finished it in 2 nights and just under 12 hours, and did not have any issues clicking with the cursor to start my adventure. That bug seems to be fixed. :)What I loved:- The art style is gorgeous, and I loved the retro style animated cutscenes! I see that for some players this was a drawback, but not for me!! It gives the whole game a nostalgic storybook fantasy feel, which is a huge plus in my opinion. The music is also lovely, and suits the game perfectly!- I played this game with the English audio, and aside from some odd clipping in some early dialogue, I thought it was great! I see that many players are complaining that Sadwick's voice is annoying, & they suggest playing it with the German audio & English subtitles. I personally didn't find his voice irritating at all, and found all of the game's English voice work to be very quirky and reminiscent of all my favorite vintage cartoon shows. I think it is important to understand the spirit of the game (which seems to be a kind of homage to all of my favorite dated fantasy things) in order to appreciate the English audio's charm. But it is wonderful that the German language audio is an option, of course. :)- The puzzles are pretty challenging! I am usually complaining that puzzles in adventure games are a bit too easy, but this is not so in The Whispered World! The puzzle solutions are often not obvious at all, & *most* of the time I enjoyed the challenge. (will explain further below.)- The world is very quirky & charming, with lots of oddball characters who have lots of personality & provide some very strange tasks to complete! The Neverending Story/Labyrinth vibe is STRONG in this game, so if you like puzzle point-and-click adventure games and also loved those movies then you will probably love the Whispered World! :)- The story & characters were compelling. Not that I expected anything less from a Daedalic adventure, but still! :D  I was in a rush to get through the puzzles so I could see what happened next!- The ending. I did not expect the ending AT ALL. It was a pleasant surprise, and unexpectedly moving. I totally cried because I am a big softie.- I really loved the game's sense of humor as well. I laughed a lot playing this game.There is one aspect of The Whispered World however that was very irritating to me, and that is....SADWICK WALKS VERY SLOWLY!! Yes, you can double click to skip to the next area, but only as long as you can see the exit node, and many canvases were very big!! So before I could skip to the next location I would still have to wait for Sadwick to sloooowly plod along. This is especially frustrating when dealing with a challenging puzzle that has objectives all over the place. I ended up having to consult a guide a few times, which I *hate* doing, just to save me time walking from point A to point B over and over again trying to work a puzzle out so I could get on to enjoying the story!Overall though, I really enjoyed playing this game, & I absolutely recommend it! I'm playing its sequel 'Silence' next, & I can't wait!			"
