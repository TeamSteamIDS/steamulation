												I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is a fascinating piece of work. It's one of those games, much like Scratches, that works wonders with atmosphere, but not so much when it comes to the actual gameplay. Although where Scratches had a really tense, frightening atmosphere, No Mouth is more mysterious and depressing. I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream works more with fridge horror, I feel. Yeah, it's creepy, but it's only truly scary if you sit back and think about it. And you will, because it's a tale that provokes thought.I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream was originally a famous short story by one Mr. Harlan Ellison. If you get the chance, I recommend giving it a read, as there's a reason it's so famous. Actually, that's a lie. I don't recommend reading it. I really recommend listening to it. The I Have No Mouth audiobook, read by Harlan Ellison himself, is truly a treasure of audio. Ellison is hammy and over-the-top, but man does he sell it. The man gets completely into his story, and it benefits immensely from it.If you've done the above, then I think you'll be more than pleased to hear that Ellison also plays AM, the maniacally hate-filled, torturous supercomputer who serves as your antagonist and tormenter for the duration of this game. He's every bit as hammy and over-the-top, and it's hard not to hang on his every word. The other voices in the game vary in quality, but you won't really notice the dips as you'll be too focused on the unfolding storylines, and also on WHAT DO I DOSo let's start with the story. You play five different characters, who comprise the entire remaining human population of Earth. AM, a colossal supercomputer which resides beneath the crust of the Earth, more or less got frustrated with his lot in life and unleashed the world's supply of nukes at... well, the world. But it kept five human beings alive to be his playthings for the remainder of eternity. For over a hundred years, these five humans have been subjected to ungodly torments, and now AM would like to play a little game.Each character is thrown into a scenario built especially for them, expected to be horrible and miserable for AM's amusement. The true goal before you is to fail AM, and prove yourself above his petty games. It is in these scenarios that you will learn about each character, their faults, their history, and a little bit about AM himself and what's going on behind the scenes and beyond your view.This obviously differs from the original story, as these scenarios never existed. They were created (with major input from Ellison) especially for this game in order to give more backstory on the characters. Things change. The story as a whole changes. But it's still very much I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream.Let's talk about the gameplay.It could be better.IHNM is presented in a classic SCUMM format. You have a list of verbs and an inventory at the bottom of the screen, both of which can be used to interact with the world around you. You will talk to characters, solve puzzles, find objects. All the familiar trappings of a good point-and-click adventure. So far, so good. The first major hitch is that eternal adventure game hellspawn, the unrelated event. You know what I'm talking about. When you do a thing, which triggers an unrelated thing to happen somewhere else which you have no way of knowing about and no reason to think might have happened. So many point-and-click adventures have fallen prey to this design flaw (Myst IV and Hector 3 among them, just thinking off the top of my head, here), and I wish it would stop.I had one point in the first scenario I picked where I didn't know what to do. I looked up a guide, and it didn't help. I thought maybe my game was glitched, as I had done everything the guide had ordered. And then I saw it. A very subtle thing. A line in the guide telling me to exhaust a certain character's dialogue. All I had skipped (for reasons that we'll get to in a moment) was an entirely unnecessary rude line that doesn't actually help anything. But lo and behold, when burning off that one useless line of dialogue caused an unrelated character to appear in a different location, freeing progression from the devs' icy cold grip.There are some other annoying bits, here and there. Some items and interactables that aren't exactly obvious on the screen. Two scenarios allow you to progress past important items or before doing mandatory bits. It's problematic, and very confusing when it happens. Luckily, it's possible to die after this moment in one of the scenarios, bringing you back to the character select where you can choose to try again. For the other one... well, just keep multiple saves, is all.In addition to simply making through each scenario, every character has a personal spiritual meter. The better the spirits they're in, the lighter the background behind their portrait in the lower-left becomes. Practice good morals and make progress to lighten it. Screw up, be corrupt or evil, or just cause your character to freak out to darken it. If the meter turns white as the scenario draws to a close, you've perfected that scenario. This is not always easy to do. I only managed it in two scenarios.They say you need to get a white meter with each character in order to see the best ending, and that's going to require either a guide or multiple playthroughs. I wonder, though. I'm pretty positive I did in fact get the best ending, despite not having all whites. I think it's probably possible as long as each character has almost a white meter, or a couple characters have white meters and everyone else is close? Or something? Though don't quote me on that, I really don't know, and there's a surprising lack of entirely helpful documentation on this subject.Anyways, my advice is to not worry about it. Do your best and get an ending, whatever that ending may be. Give the finale a few tries, though, because you'll probably screw it up a couple times.Anyways, point is, the game looks great and sounds great, and the story will draw you all sorts of in. Just be aware that you may need to consult the Internet at times, and be sure to rotate your saves. Or do what I did and just make each save a new one, because this game seems to have infinite slots. Which is a nice feature.For all its faults, I still enjoyed the majority of my time with I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream. And if you're a fan of the original story, or games which not only don't shy away from adult themes, but walk straight through a minefield of adult themes and take it all in stride with a sly grin upon their lips, then I think you'll enjoy it too.

												This is the most twisted game I have ever played, you start the game with 5 tortured prisoners being held by a psychotic computer named AM (he is voiced by Harlan Ellison, the guy who made this game with Cyber Dreams & the book version that he wrote), it's a choice driven point and click adventure game so you can pick any character or decision you want.As you progress through the past of these 5 characters you'll feel what they feel about themselves like for example Gorrister's Guilt, Ellen's pain, Benny's ignorance, Nimdok's desires for torture & Ted's lust. The main goal of the game is to either satisfy AM by making the wrong choices or you can fix the past by making good choices.The whole point of the game is to lose, there is no hope for humanity & overall if you feel that games aren't dark enough then play this awesome classic. (Warning if your sensitive to♥♥♥♥♥♥ torture, murder, satanism, sacrifices, lust and etc. then this game isn't for you)UPDATE: I found this awesome interview from Night Dive's website about the game & some of Harlan's opinions http://www.nightdivestudios.com/harlanellison_interview.htmlUPDATE 2: If you liked this game & you want to hear more from Harlan Ellison then I suggest taking a look at his youtube channel http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1XrlRQsRxYfuc47CCJN05w or his twitter http://www.twitter.com/HarlanEllison9 (I thought Harlan was anti-digital but he's slowly liking technology & the internet)UPDATE 3: The original story is available on Good Reads http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/415459.I_Have_No_Mouth_and_I_Must_ScreamUPDATE 4: I nominated this game for the “Villain Most In Need Of A Hug” Award			"

												I just finished this game, it truely is a unique but terrifying game. Not in the sense that you get scared but rather that you get slightly disturbed by its event.The game features 5 stories, each per character and a final act that ends the game. Each character has a mayor flaw and fear which they have to conquer. Make sure to save frequently! I had the pleasure to replay 20 minutes of gameplay after i clicked the wrong option...Oh and, what a WONDERFUL voice cast. I truely enjoyed every voice work done in the game, especially Benny, Ellen and Nimdok have a wonderful voice.			"

												I have no mouth, and I must scream is a classic adventure game first released back in 1996. Since its release, it's acquired a large cult following, hailing it for its dark and very mature storyline. It's based on a short story by Harlan Ellison, released in 1967.StoryThe game takes place 109 after the destruction of mankind. A computer calling itself AM, which was originally created to wage war with the other super powers. Wars had become so complex that humans could not oversee them, which resulted the three super powers (USA, Russia & China) creating their own super computers, which ended up wiping out humanity.AM hates humans. It hates humans for what they've done. Hate drives it to torture 5 specific humans, the last living humans on earth, making them immortal, so that it can torture them forever. These 5 characters are the characters that you play as.Each character gets its own short (<1h) storyline, where you have to guide them through their own personal hell, based on what AM view as the most just punishment for their past deeds.  GameplayThe game plays like a typical mid 90's point & click adventure game. You have an inventory, and most of the puzzles are about figuring out which item goes where. Many sections have multiple solutions, and depending on which solution you find, you'll get a different final ending (""kinder"" solutions generally result in better endings). Actually solving the puzzles needed to progress the story is quite easy, far easier than the puzzles of most contemporary adventure games, but figuring out how to get the good ending often feels like you're trying to read the puzzle designers mind. It feels like this was made with replay value in mind, as the game is quite short, but it ends up being rather frustrating, as you can end up getting a bad ending simply because you walked through a door at the wrong time, without the game properly warning you about it.Graphics & SoundThe graphics is quite good for the era. While the animation quality might not be up to par with the greatest games of its genre, the scenes are very atmospheric and all feel like they're made to convey a certain mood. The voice acting is also good, but not outstanding. Compared to its contemporary counterparts, it would be considered really good, but voice acting tends to be a bit better these days. Still, all the voices fit, and the voice actors do a good job at conveying how their characters feel when they speak.Final thoughtsI have no mouth, and I must scream is a game that I feel has a well deserved good reputation. While it might be a bit too short, and trying to figure out what the developers were thinking when you try to solve the puzzles if you want a good ending is not always fun, but the story is very well told. When I say that the story is ""Mature"", I don't mean mature as in there being a lot of gore & nudity in the game, but rather it's a story dealing with some very dark subjects in a mature way, and this helps lift the game above the masses. It might not be a perfect game, but for anyone who enjoy point & click adventure games aimed at a more adult audience, it's a must play.			"

Posted: December 28, 2014
												10 Reasons why ""I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream"" is awesome and you should totally buy+play it before your next birthday...1. Starring ... HARLAN ELLISONFor those unaware, this P&C Adventure game is based on the dystopian post-apocalyptic sci-fi short story of the same name, written by Harlan Ellison in 1967. Nearly 30 years later, a team of game devs decide to make the game, and they contact Ellison for permission to make the game, and not only do they get permission, they *get him to voice the villain* (who is, in some sense, the story's chief character). ""AM"" wouldn't be half as awesome without Ellison. He was about 60 at the time and about 80 now ... yes, still alive ... and it'd be great if Steam players newly discovering the game wrote him fanmail about how the game inspired them to read his work, etcetc... ^_^2. Aged GracefullyFor a 1995 PC game, the game's graphics are decent, the audio is of the same variety as (but in many ways superior to) the first two Elder Scrolls games, and the engine is surprisingly stable. Based on other reviews I've read, your mileage may vary, but I had exactly zero crashes in a multi-faceted playthrough (testing different fail-states and endings, etc). As a huge Adventure buff, I can assure you that there are dozens, perhaps hundreds of games released in the past two decades that won't be as valuable 20 years down the road as this one turned out to be.3. Not just full VA ... *good* VAI'll have to take exception to Dr. Nimdok, whose slow, aged German accent sometimes misses the mark, especially as to which words or syllables to stress. Other than that, the character VA in this game is leaps and bounds beyond its 1995 peers. I suspect this is because the actors were getting to read lines either directly from, or inspired by, the original short story, which is quite well-written. So good.4. ""Dude, that's not PC!""Real characters have flaws. Real characters don't give a crap about whether they're being politically correct or not, especially when they're on their own and have survived 100+ years of torture by a mad machine. I'm not praising this as though it's something to be cherished: rather, I'm saying that the surly nature of Benny, the rugged trucker-ness of Gor, and pretty much the entire Nimrok scenario make for a pretty provocative game. I suppose the open talk about Ellen's plight would also apply.5. Fail-States exist, but they don't over-punishBecause this game is paced out *just right,* if you accidently off your character and lose progress, it's not a huge deal. The five scenarios are each short enough that you'll a) remember the puzzles well enough to quickly recover progress if needed or b) you'll have saved like 2 minutes beforehand and then it *really* doesn't matter. That said, there are ways for characters to die -- some more easily than others. And in the end scenario, it gets really tricky...6. Endings galoreThere are, in fact, five bad endings and one good ending. It's in the end scenario that the game takes the strongest departure from the short story: the latter offers a fight scene between two of the characters that, due to the way the game is structured, simply wasn't going to happen. However, the five bad endings of the game combined make up, in essence, what Harlan Ellison originally wrote. Each character will deliver those famous words after describing in wretched detail what AM has done to them for the rest of eternity after their failed assassination attempt. BUT, should you get the ""true"" ending (not at all in Ellison's story, but apparently Ellison-approved since he voiced his dialogue for this ending), there's something horribly fascinating waiting at the end, including some excellent philosophy that fits very much with this and Ellison's other tales.7. Click what where with what, oh it's too much! -- No it's not.One thing I've found in the Adventure revival of the past 5 years is an over-abundance of items in my inventory. It gets to be a bit *too* much. In IHNM, however, the standard view of the inventory shows only 8 slots. This will actually expand (and has to in at least one scenario). Yet, in another scenario, the number of items only goes as high as three. As for interaction options, you have the basic set: Walk to, Talk to, Look, Use, Take. Give, Push, and my favorite, Swallow. And that's it. That's all you need to get around, and with the narration and a little bit of clever thinking, you'll find many of the puzzles solve themselves. That said...8. Walkthrough-friendlyShould you need to turn to a walkthrough (GameFAQs has three at present), it's pretty easy to figure out where to look. Most people won't need it until they reach the end, and if they find themselves exasperated (especially by which character order to use) then a walkthrough can spell it out. Quickly, and painlessly, without the pain of a thousand qualifications (""if you've done this, don't do that"" etc). The complexity of this game is in its narrative. The mechanics and puzzle-solving are less dense, though they can still be tricky even on that surface layer.9. Did I mention the length?This game is of the perfect length for most 21st-century gamers. The devs were ahead of their time in this regard. Its peers were often packing in filler content to brag about how many hours the player could get out of it. And then, on the other hand, there are a handful of P&C Adventures so pathetically short that they're hardly worth calling a game. This one fits just right: 2 hours with a walkthrough, 5-8 without (that range I'd give based on players' range of problem-solving capabilities and/or desire to skip voice acting with right-click spam).10. We vote with our dollarsIf the other nine points have convinced you that this game might actually be *good,* let me remind you here at the end: Steam notices what kinds of games we buy. How much of any given title is purchased will mean something to them. Financially it also means something to the rights-holders of this game. And while it could crash and burn miserably, I'd not be opposed to a huge overhaul / HD remake of this very game -- sometimes the risk pays off. Or, perhaps, it would inspire other developers to do decent P&C adventures with weighty/heady sci-fi short stories from other great authors. This game proved it could be done, and done well.			"

												Based on the classic dystopian sci-fi short story by Harlan Ellison, this has some of the best writing you'll find in an old-school point-and-click adventure game. Ellison also provides some truly fantastic (especially for its time) voice acting as an insane AI. The gameplay suffers from a number of glitches (though none that I saw made it un-beatable) and a very rigid, archaic game design. For example, a number of progression events will only occur after you say or do things that are completely unrelated to the event. Unlike most adventure games of its time, there are multiple solutions to many puzzles...but usually only one ""good"" way. You'll have great difficulty getting the best ending (and yes, there are multiple endings) without a walkthrough. Of course, given the underlying subject matter, it's rather fitting that the (relatively) happy ending is elusive.  All that said, it's worth playing for fans of adventure games and especially for fans of the short story - as the game's plot is very different.			"

												Alright, this has been a wild ride and I haven't even managed to get to the ending yet but here we go.A brilliantly twisted story of survival through and through, you will play as one of five people unfortunate enough to have been handpicked as a devilish child of an AI's playthings. Seriously, you'll love to hate (HATE!) this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. After 109 years of endless torture, these five humans are about to bring the Big Bad Baby to its knees. Succeed, and they may have a chance to return to the world outside AM's eternal straitjacket. Fail, and suffer a fate worse than any they've endured.Basically, IHNMAIMS will mess you up. It will give your brain a swirly and laugh about it. Pros:- Classic point and click adventure format for nostalgia boners- 10/10 storytelling and characters.- Grotesquely beautiful landscape.Cons:- This is not a game for the faint of heart and covers a lot of sensitive topics. If you are potentially triggered by♥♥♥♥♥♥ abuse, torture, holocaust/Nazi themes, cannibalism, animal cruelty, and general nastiness, either reconsider your purchase or brace for impact.- Almost impossible to beat without a walkthrough. Luckily, they are available just a shift-tab away.- Bugs. Bugs everywhere.Overall, I give it a 9/10. Give it a go if you feel you're up to it. It's definitely considered a classic for a reason.""He withdrew, muttering to hell with you. And added, brightly, but then you're there, aren't you.""			"

												A dark, existential point and click re-imagining of one of the best short stories ever written. IHNMAIMS is a classic adventure game that is difficult and thought-provoking.The game has aged well all things considered, game-play is standard fare of the genre. This game is in many ways a lot like the old Sierra adventures in that you can actually lose the game (die) and you should keep a pen and paper handy to write stuff down. The game lets you play each of the characters stories in whatever order you chose, which is a nice feature. An excellent choice for the adventure game fan.(I have played this before and re-bought it on Steam that's why I only have 5 mins on record)			"

												IHNM&IMS is one of the more interesting point and click adventure games. It is an adaptation of a Harlan Ellison short story... kind of. It doesn't follow the plot of the original story but moreso elaborates on it's characters and the setting.The premise of the game features a super computer called A.M. that has destroyed all of humanity. The characters of the game are the last remaining human beings who have been tortured for 109 years. Each character has a unique backstory and a notable fatal flaw. And they each have a different scenario A.M. puts them through. A.M. was also voiced by Harlan Ellison which is an interesting bit of trivia.What's notable about the game is how it has numerous multiple endings for each character and the actual ""end"" of the game based on how you acted throughout. Harlan Ellison went on record as stating the game was designed in such a way so that you could not exactly ""win"" but you would have ""A variety of moral and ethical ways to lose"". It's a very interesting game in this regard and doubly so since the original writer was so involved in it's production. It's not written like a traditional video game plot at all, and ends up being a very interesting companion to the original short story. The game runs on ScummVM so it runs pretty well on whatever machine you throw it on. And it ends up being very replayable due to the multiple endings and choices. For it's price, aesthetic and writing there's little wonder why it's so highly regarded as a Point and Click adventure game.			"

Posted: October 4, 2014
												English version (polska wersja poniżej) I have a difficult time writing about I Have No Mouth and I Must because of my personal attitude towards this game. While I consider “The Longest Journey” the paramount of an adventure experience and believe that everyone should at least try this game, in case of IHNMaIMS is more complicated since, clearly, it is not a game everyone can enjoy. First off all, IHNMaIMS is kind of The Elder Scrolls of adventure gaming, and for more than one reason. Firstly, hardy any point and click adventure gives player such freedom of choices. Secondly, much less on a positive note, this is possibly the greatest bugfest in the history of adventure gaming. When deciding to play this game one has to be prepared to face game breaking bugs that will inspire either restarting one’s adventure or a ragequit. Still, while IHNMaIMS forums are choke-full of bug reports ,  I was lucky enough to finish at least three different versions of this game without any problems.Secondly, people who prefer solid mechanics and comfortable gameplay may (and probably will) completely disdain this game. In IHNMaIMS everything seems to be secondary to narration. If you prefer story over anything else, then that is not an issue, but if you want to play comfortably know this: this game has a nasty habit of playing with the gamer. Not to spoil too much, it often may look like you have to do something bad to another character (kill is such a nasty word…) or a group of characters to gain a particular item or simply progress a story. And when you finish that chapter you discover that said item was completely useless. On the other hand, the character’s alignment / sanity is of great importance in this game, and it is affected all the time, exactly by this kind of choices. Thirdly, it needs to be said that to fully appreciate this game, some basic knowledge of Freudian psychology is needed. Especially the ego, superego and id and the dream symbolism may come in handy. So, what does this game give in return ? Probably the most emotionally engaging experience in the history of adventure gaming. The world (or worlds) within this game is rich and congruent, storylines are brilliant and characters are captivating ( The game goes to great lengths to make one feel compassionate even for a sadistic scientist of a totalitarian regime). Also the way the puzzles fit into the storyline is truly brilliant. For example (not much of a spoiler, since that’s the very beginning of this particular chapter), the first day of the Benny’s storyline. Benny’s body has been completely mutilated during the years of merciless torture, his bones have been shattered and forced to grow together in a bad way, his vocal cords have been torn out and he is generally a mess. Consequently, first he has to learn  how to eat, walk up the stairs and how to communicate with others. Finally, for the game that’s nearly 20 years old, the graphics are still pretty impressive. The backgrounds are dark, moody and full of detail. Still, It should be appreciated how authors made almost every important item clearly visible.To conclude, let me just suggest running this game on ScummVM, a free tool that enables many graphic and sound options as well as some bugfixes – which in this particular game helps a lot. Wersja PolskaPisanie o I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream (dalej IHNMaIMS) przychodzi mi z trudem ze względu na fakt że jest to jedna z tych gier które zdefiniowały moje podejście do przygodówek. Inaczej jednak, niż w przypadku „Najdłuższej Podróży”, która niezmiennie jest moim „numerem jeden” w świecie point and clicków, nie mogę IHNMaIMS polecić każdemu. Po pierwsze, można powiedzieć  że ta gra jest swoistym „Elder Scrollem”  przygodówek, i to z więcej niż jednego powodu. Podobnie jak seria Bethesdy daje wolność wyboru niespotykaną u innych przedstawicieli danego gatunku. I podobnie jak „Scrollsy” jest aż po same brzegi napakowana bugami wszelkiej maści i kalibru. Odpalając IHNMaIMS trzeba być przygotowanym na błędy które mogą uniemożliwić jej ukończenie, zmusić do restartu całej historii, albo spowodować ragequit. Inna sprawa, że ukończyłem co najmniej trzy różne wersje tej gry, nie natrafiając na żadne poważniejsze bugi, więc da się też „zaliczyć” ją bezproblemowo. Po drugie, ludzie ceniący sobie solidną mechanikę ułatwiającą rozgrywkę na każdym kroku prawdopodobnie znienawidzą tą grę. Jakie problemy można mieć z mechaniką w point and clicku? W IHNMaIMS wszystko jest drugoplanowe względem opowiadanej historii.  Osoboy ceniącym sobie w grach przede wszystkim angażującą narrację nie będą miały z tym problemów, niemniej ta gra potrafi momentami być bardzo złośliwa. Zamierzenie. Żeby uniknąć spoilerów wspomnę tylko że nieraz może wydawać się że jedynym sposobem zdobycia jakiegoś przedmiotu czy popchnięcia historii na przód jest wyrządzenie mniejszego bądź większego zła któremuś z bohaterów pobocznych. Kiedy już gracz zdobędzie dany przedmiot, okazuje się że nie jest on do niczego przydatny, podczas gdy poczytalność bohatera –którą tracimy bądź zyskujemy, zależnie od dokonywanych decyzji – odgrywa kluczową rolę w opowiadanej historii. Po trzecie, żeby w pełni docenić IHNMaIMS, przydaje się podstawowa znajomość psychologii Freudowskiej – ego, super ego, id, symbolika snów. Bez tego niektóre fragmenty gry mogą wydać się niezrozumiałe. A co ta gra może dać w zamian? Prawdopodobnie najbardziej wciągający horror science-fiction w historii gier przygodowych. Świat (czy raczej światy) przedstawiony tutaj jest bogaty, mroczny i fascynujący, historia ciekawa, a postacie wielopoziomowe i wzbudzające sympatię (nawet sadystyczny doktor z obozu zagłady – bo i kimś takim przyjdzie nam grać) . Jeżeli zaś chodzi o zagadki które stawiane są przez graczem, uważam je za szczytowe osiągnięcie jeżeli chodzi o łączenie narracji z mechaniką rozgrywki. Przykładem niech będzie początek historii Bennego (nie jest to wielki spoiler – pierwsze 5 minut rozdziału).  Benny jest uroczą postacią – jego kości zostały połamane i zrosły się w paskudny sposób, struny głosowe zostały wyrwane z jego gardła, twarz ma pociętą w drobną kratkę – ogólnie Benny nie jest okazem zdrowia. Oczywiście ma to wpływ na zadania przed jakimi staje  – na początku musimy nauczyć go jak komunikować się bez używania głosu, jeść (!) i wchodzić po schodach (!!).        Mógłbym o tej grze napisać wiele więcej, ale kończy mi się miejsce więc słowo o oprawie: po prawie 20 latach grafika ciągle robi wrażenie. Tła są klimatyczne, pełne szczegółów i wspaniale kształtują mroczny obraz gry, budowany również przez klimatyczną muzykę. Warto wspomnieć że autorzy dokonali niemal cudu sprawiając że na tych pełnych detali tłach prawie każdy istotny dla fabuły przedmiot jest widoczny. Na koniec wspomnę jeszcze tylko że najlepiej uruchomić tą grę przez ScummVM, darmowe narzędzie udostępniające w starych przygodówkach wiele opcji graficznych, dźwiękowych i naprawiających wiele błędów – co w przypadku IHNMaIMS ma niebagatelne znaczenie.

												I would argue if given more guidance, effort, and common sense, ""I Have No Mouth"" could have been one of the best. It's less-so a game of wasted potential and more a sad product of people who failed to take it as seriously as it deserved to be.The plot is fascinating here. It incorporates genuine themes of humanity, morality, and mortality, and explores the struggle of each individual character searching hopelessly for some kind of redemption. Each path is extremely unique in some way or another, and really tries to make interactivity key to the experience. Only problem is a lot of the choices are cookie-cutter dry and painfully transparent, but, hey, it’s the thought that counts, right?The original ""No Mouth"" short story by Harlan Ellison is an incredible cautionary vision about the relationship between us and technology, as well as a bleak tale of human suffering. The game does only a half-decent job reflecting on those concepts and a half-decent job expanding on them. It gets some things right, other things horribly wrong. Voice acting is extremely hit-or-miss, the gameplay overall is unpolished and the puzzles, in typical point-and-click fashion, are often nonsensical. The dialogue is sadly forgettable, and while the characters are fleshed-out slightly more, some of the changes/additions are worse-off, rather than improvements (example: changing Benny’s backstory and sexuality).Harlan Ellison’s short story being adapted into a video game is a huge leap for the medium because for once it attempts to elevate games to the level of real literature. The general public often fails to take games seriously because more often than not they serve as purely entertainment. No Mouth isn’t so concerned with entertaining you as it is to try and make you think. It’s an endeavor not often seen in video games, and it’s something definitely to be applauded here, even if it doesn’t fully succeed. Recently there's been a shift to change that, but it’s always been mostly unheard of. In fact, I would say a lot try and fail, but No Mouth gets marks for being one of the real firsts of its kind and not misfiring completely.So what am I saying here? I'm saying it's an incredible experience if you get past what it could have been. None of the somewhat obvious flaws are even remotely dealbreakers. It remains essential gaming for anyone with an interest in interactive storytelling, and especially for speculative fiction fans.			"

												I wish that Steam had a button somewhere between ""Recommended"" and ""Not Recommended"" for these reviews, because there's a lot to be said for  I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream.  Since we don't live in such a world, however, I'll have to tilt toward the red side of things, because the game's many good qualities are ultimately overshadowed by its infuriating design and failure to live up to its own aspirations of profundity. First the good, and that right off the bat:  I Have No Mouth...  has one of the best opening monologues I've ever seen in a game -- a joyously hateful screed delivered in blistering fashion by the game's antagonist, an insane supercomputer called AM. It's the year future-future-something-or-other, and AM, being a supercomputer in a video game, has (surprise!) taken over the world, killed off most of humanity, and spent the last 109 years keeping our five ""heroes"" hostage and subjecting them to all sorts of tortures in an underground lair. AM narrates this backstory with a chilling mix of glee over his own sadism, and bone-deep bitterness over the fact of his own miserable existence. Here's a YouTube clip of this cheerful setup -- dig it, you won't regret it.Unfortunately, the pace immediately drops from headlong to plodding, as the five flawed protagonists are split up and sent off on banal individual quests. (The player can freely choose the order in which to tackle them). AM tantalizes each of his victims with a promise of freedom, if only they can navigate their way through a personalized test of AM's making. The point of AM's game is, apparently, to explore the individual vices and psychology of his five playthings.  The protagonists are therefore forced to make choices that test their strength of character and, ultimately, determine whether the player achieves the ""good,"" ""middle,"" or ""bad"" ending of the game.This is a terrific setup for an adventure game, but the execution here is botched for two main reasons. First, the choices facing the characters are so black-and-white that you almost have to  try  to fail the subquests. At one point, for example, you're offered the choice to rescue a small boy on a sacrificial altar, or... eat him. Decisions, decisions!Second -- and this is more of a design flaw than a narrative one -- if you don't perform your tasks within a subquest in the exact (often arbitrary) order that the developers intended, certain necessary branches of the story won't open up even when you  know  what to do next. After pulling your hair out for a while, you'll look up an online guide and see that the reason your character won't perform an obvious solution to the challenge at hand is because you failed to talk to an unrelated character four screens away and three saved games ago. The upshot is that you're forced to replay the entire subquest in a slightly different manner in order to get the plot moving again. This is every bit as tedious as it sounds.Broadly speaking,  I Have No Mouth...  seems like it's aspiring to Say Something About Society, but I'm not quite sure what that could be, other than (perhaps) ""human vice + technology = tragedy,"" or maybe ""our ability to make moral choices is what makes us human."" Both of which are undoubtedly true, but hardly original or even all that deep. So without interesting ideas or a smoothly-flowing narrative, we're left with a slow-paced and sometimes tedious game that fails to live up to the promise of its wonderful opening moments. I Have No Mouth...  has a lot of good qualities (e.g. its disturbing central premise, Harlan Ellison's scenery-chewing voiceover work for AM, or the occasional inspired horror sequence), but for the reasons described above I didn't have a particularly good time playing it, nor was I left with much to think about in terms of interesting themes. Not recommended, with regret.			"

												As I write this, I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is $1.49. BUY THIS GAME.After writing this review, I realized that the game comes with a free copy of the story it is based on. At full price, you're paying less than forty cents for the game if you buy it just for the story, and at any discount you're paying less for the game and the story combined than if you bought the story on Amazon! I'm copying the PDF to my Kindle right now!			"

												A game about facing your fears, and being tortured for an eternity in figurative hell.Slightly archaeic but this classic still offers a good story with fairly decent functionality. Has a few minor issues and some story lines can be ruined by not making the correct decisions, worth consulting a guide if you get completely stuck.7.5/10 would bang.			"

												This is a game I bought a minute after I saw a 9 second review clip. I have just rushed to the end of this game, and now I'll be rushing a review. I'll be spending the next few hours bumrushing plot summaries or looking at additional content, endings, and at some point I'd like to read the original short story pdf included in the game files. Okay this is stressful because I feel there's a lot to talk about. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ More recently, I've become a big fan of point-and-click games and I've never touched anything like this. This game is GRIM, I could go on and on about how I've never encountered anything like this in any capacity (this includes all media, I'm willing to say that now). The story is insane, comprehensive, believable, well-researched, and covers a lot of controversial material. This game doesn't ♥♥♥♥ around. Here's where it's going to get a little spoiler-heavy. In this game, there is a♥♥♥♥♥♥scene, and it is story-serving. I know the area is gray but I would be shocked to learn if anyone was under the impression that such a scene was included to pander to deviant males or something along those lines (I'm talking now about criticism for Hotline Miami). This is by far the most mature game I've ever played. The villain, a supercomputer named AM, is almost comically evil in that he tortures five people profoundly for 109 years, keeping them artificially alive. While we're on the subject of AM, I want to get this out of the way because it's still fresh in my mind: the final level is by far the best in terms of story and visuals, the entire thing comes full circle without any enormous monologue or contrived adlib about the relationship between man and machine. It will not pull that♥♥♥♥♥♥ I LOVE that the Russian and Chinese counterparts of AM and AM himself appear physically as god figures. I am fascinated in all things ""ultimate"" especially those types of metaphors which appear in very immaculate or, at least not in this case, formless designs. Let the pacing of this review so far be a reflection of how the game has impacted my mind in the time to follow. I'm this far in the review and I'm sensing the package is wrapping up nicely. How much more can I say? Do you need me to address every theme in this game at once, to put into poor grammar the peace I am at? I wouldn't be able to do it justice. I can't review the game properly. I have no mouth and I must scream, so to speak. 10/10 game, VERY annoying programming errors set me back a few hours. The story managed to trounce these negatives, it's that good. You'll sleep on this one for years.			"

												Okay I love IHNMAIMS. The story was great, the scenarios had a wide rage of challenge to them, and over all the different scenery was great. I do have a few criticisms of the game although...The Save Game Glitch: When I was on my second scenario (I went Ellen then Gorrister) I kept one saved game because I didn't think I'd need another. The problem with that was I had to quit the game for a minute. When I went back to my saved game, Gorrister wasn't on screen. I could not advance through the story and I had to restart my game. The solution? Keep like a butt load of saved games on you I mean really save save save!!Nimdok's Scenario: The story was fantastic but...it is EASY to advance through this scenario to the point of no return without specific items you will need. You have to do it a SPECIFIC way to advance in the story. The solution for this one is to read up on his story before hand or you definitely won't know what you're doing. I mean unless you are hardcore willing to go through the scenario a billion times I will reccomend you do this.Endgame Strobe: During the endgame portion (no spoilers) at points the screen will start to flicker, possibly due to the graphics. This is easily remedied by going to another screen.  Otherwise the game is very playable, it's fun, and it's easy to get invested into the story. Just make sure to read up if you experience problems, there are others out there who have the solutions!			"

												This was a game that, ironically, screamed to me when I first heard about it at halloween. I couldn't restrain myself, I had to play this bizarre looking adventure game. Such moral ambiguity and disturbing themes too. Why was I playing this game?Because it was something different. There was no winning. There was a sense of accomplishment of course, when the little picture in the corner lit up and a happy little tune played, but it could always get worse, and boy did it, but it all seemed worth it to struggle through these characters fears. Damn, it's hard to put this into words, so you should just get the game to see what I mean.That probably wasn't very helpful. I LIKED IT, IT WAS GOOD. There.Oh I got stuck and unable to advance on at least 2 characters, so save often, save many, and play each character in sequence.			"

That's why I play I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream.From the amazing writing to the soul-crushing bleakness staring you in the face from the cloudy indifference of a gaping void, this game truly has a bit of everything for us adventure fans!11/10 -- Would look upon my life's work and despair again.

												Ellison's (AM's) voice is voice porn, almost to the extend of Logan Cunningham. The story to this game is immensely interesting yet bleak. Since this is a 90's point and click though, the controls are a bit hard to use and there is a bit of developer logic (a lot in a few campaigns, not as much in others) but otherwise no matter if you win or lose the story is captivating and the characters are surprisingly deep for what they are. Not to mention the soundtrack is kickass.If you feel frustrated that you got the bad ending (because honestly, the good ending DOES require a lot of dumb logic) i'd like to say that in the original short story, there was no good ending. Good ending being hard to get is a common complaint, but I feel the good ending isn't really needed at all.Oh, also; this is pretty much trigger warning the game. I don't want to spoil anything but let's just say in general this game is pretty screwed up			"

   My Playthrough   Youtube Video    The Review I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is a classic from the DOS era. This is a dark game that makes you ask yourself some questions that no one wants to answer. This game is based off the short story of the same name by Harlan Ellison and while it does deviate from the original source material it still holds the same meaning. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves dark scifi stories.  "

												This is an old point-and-click adventure inspired by the homonymous sci-fi story by Harlan Ellison. Long before the introduction of Skynet etc, AM was the computer that lead to the destruction of civilization and to all humans except five remaining survivors which are tortured for 109 years.It must be more than 20 years ago that the game came out. I played it the first time and finally I managed to finish it. Pros:+ well-crafted, depressing atmosphere+ nice voice over+ touches ""difficult"" concepts, high dozes of phychological horror + 5 protagonists with very different personalities+ most puzzles are reasonableCons:- graphics are very pixelated, the game shows its age- lots and lots of dead ends, you can easily get stuck if you do not follow a specific sequence of actions- perhaps the adventure of each character could last a bit longer- sometimes pixel hunting is required, it is made worse by the graphics- the themes are not for everyoneAll-in-all it is an intelligent and well-made adventure, but most probably not very appealing to the masses.  However, it is definitely reccomended for anyone who seeks a different, mature-themed, post-apocalyptic old-style adventure and is willing to ignore its problems.  "

												I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is based on the novel of the same name by Harlan Ellison which I wasn't aware of until playing this game. I have since added the book to my Amazon wishlist to read in the near future.The game is a horror-themed point and click adventure released in 1995 and has various elements that classify it as a weird type of horror game. The title alone should raise interest in almost everyone who hasn't played the game and since it is quite hard to find a physical copy of the PC or DOS versions of the game, Steam is the easiest method of acquiring it. For those thinking of purchasing a physical copy you will need a copy from around 1995 or an IBM compatible PC as stated in the game's specs. However, the Steam version is the DOS version of the game and runs through a software emulation called DOS Box which can be used to play other DOS games(such as System Shock). This means that the game ran seamlessly on my Windows 7 Professional 64-bit machine.The game allows you to play as each of 5 players which I will briefly describe. Benny is a mutilated brute, Ellen is a professional engineer who has a hysteric phobia of the colour yellow, Nimdok is an old man with an amusingly voice-acted foreign accent who is conducting a sadistic experiment at  a Nazi concentration camp in 1945, Gorrister who is a suicidal loner haunted by what happened to his wife, and finally Ted who is a cynical paranoid. The basic story is centred around these 5 beings who have been held captive against their will for the past 109 years or so by a very creepy computer name AM (Applied Mastercomputer) who was implanted by nations into the centre of the earth. AM wants to play a game with each of the 5 and tests them in a way as to the decisions they make during their adventures.Each character has a unique adventure with some of them such as Nimdok's being considerably short. The adventures presented by each individual will present the player with puzzles and clues which they will have to figure out by using their brains or through a walkthrough. The game can be quite unforgiving based on the choices the player makes and will force them to restart the character's story. However, the save system implemented in the game allows you to overcome this by regularly saving and loading. The game's save icon represented by a floppy disc starts to spin when the player hasn't saved in a while which is a neat feature. The game exhibits the standard mechanics of a point and click adventure game with a range of options to choose from and being able to explore through just clicking either left or right mouse button. Using all the options you can concatenate sentences together which will command the character and depending on the context make them interact with the world.My personal favourite of the 5 character's stories was Teds due to the setting of a creepy haunted castle and its relevant themes. Least favourite was Benny's story but this is just my personal opinion.The game is not very short and can be finished in possibly 5 hours, even though I took 16 hours because I play games slowly and explore as well as replay things to see other alternatives. It is a very weird game that will give you the creeps. I must check out the book which I've heard is nearly similar to the game if not for a few differences regarding the characters.Already, the game at its normal price (£3.29) is a giveaway, but wait for the Steam sales to get it even cheaper. Thoroughly recommend trying this game but it is not going to be for everyone.			"

												I can't properly describe the happy dance I did when IHNMAIMS got re-released on Steam a few months ago. As a young lad the demo of this bleak, creepy adventure game had haunted me, but never did I save enough allowance to buy the full game before it disappeared into the ether. Now, at last, I can revisit it and experience the horror for myself... and discover it's not all that horrifying, but it's still a fine adventure game.Well, the premise is horrifying at least. The mad supercomputer AM has obliterated humanity, preserving only five individuals to torture for more than a hundred years. Now AM wants to play a special game with them, one that could result in their freedom, if they can overcome their fears and regrets. Each of the characters has some dark secret that AM has used to torture them; one was a Nazi doctor, another had his wife committed, and so on. You chose which scenario to play through, and if you die (yes, you can die in this adventure game, but it's only a temporary setback) you get to choose again. The gameplay is what you'd expect of an adventure game, though my impression is that this one is lighter on the item collecting and combining and more on interacting with the scenery and other characters. It can be a bit of a pixel hunt at times, and some of the puzzles are a little obtuse owing to the nightmarish nature of the scenarios AM concocts.What really got me was the voice acting. I didn't even recall the game being voice acted when I was a child, and honestly the game is probably better served without it. The godlike supercomputer taunts his victims like a stuffy DOTA player ridiculing his team. The one woman of the group talks in some seriously dated 90s forced ebonics that gets pretty cringeworthy at times. The writing itself generally holds up, but there are occasional tonal shifts where a character tries to make a funny in the midst of confronting their horrors. Sadly, this one isn't quite as atmospheric and creepy as I had remembered, but it's a solid enough adventure game from what I've seen. And the world always needs more unique adventure games.			"

												This game deserves a remake/overhaul where the punishments/bugs that constantly put the plot into an ultimately un-winnable state are cleaned up.If you thought the King's Quest series was frustrating for occasionally allowing you to traipse down un-winnable plot paths, do not pick up this game.  Even if you're ok with running into death traps and having to back track a little to an earlier puzzle, do not buy it.  The means by which the player can break the plot in this game are so abundant that it seems the overall design was either poor to begin with or the final product was not tested enough.It really is as bad as, “You didn't look at this rock exactly *twice* in the first chapter, but not to worry, we'll let you proceed to the final chapter anyway,""  then ending the game with, ""Oops, looking at that rock twice was actually pivotal to the plot.  Sorry, now you won't be able to reach the finale.”			"

												Harlan Ellison's ""I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream""(1995) is an excellent example of how, when turning a story into a video game, you don't have to sacrifice anything. Ellison's direct involvement in the game definitely shows and his voice as AM, the machine God, is brilliant.The storytelling in the game creates a very immersive experience, drawing you into each character's mind and torment.  You learn the deepest secrets and darkest fears, even the outrageous desires of these character's and the realistic reactions really put you in the character's shoes.The premise of the game alone brings intrigue but the unfolding of this story in such a mysterious way is really what drew me in, I wanted to learn as much as I could about the post-apocalyptic world that was presented to me.  The idea of a super AI turning itself into a type of God is interesting indeed.The story is so excellently encapsulated, the imagery is macabre and barren, and it's all brought together here marvellously.  Nothing is left out, in fact, in the gaming format you have an opportunity to explore beyond the main narrative.Point and click at its finest.  I can also say, having played this back in the 90s, that this Steam version works really well and I believe the game has aged  nicely.			"

												Make no mistake about I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream....it is NOT a horror game, at least not in the typical sense. It's not trying to make you jump in your seat and scream in shocked terror. It has no interest in what many would call ""cheap thrills"". Instead, what this game wants to do is provoke your thought-process. It is a very cerebral game, with dark undertones that force you to think about the dark side of humanity, and whether or not there is redemption for our fatal flaws. It isn't afraid to present you with disturbing topics such as suicide,♥♥♥♥♥♥ even genocide, and make you deal with them. Although there is a tint of light-heartedness, 99% percent of the game is drenched in an atmosphere of hopelessness as you scramble to make amends for the characters' pasts in an attempt to thwart the diabolical supercomputer, AM.This game is loosely based off of the short story of the same name, and the writer of the story (Harlan Ellison) provided support in its development, even lending his voice for the character of AM. The voice acting is a bit hammy, but more in an entertaining other than distracting way (Harlan Ellison sounds wonderfully maniacal; he IS the voice of AM, truly). This game is not a re-telling of the original short story, and even some of the mannerisms and traits of the characters seem to have been changed a bit. However, the game still stays true to the overall atmosphere that the story created.As far as gameplay is concerned, this is a point-and-click adventure game from the mid-90's, but you probably wouldn't figure as much if you didn't already know. I fired up Phantasmagoria after completing this game, and was surprised at just how janky and akward that game is as opposed to this one. The game controls very nicely for it being 20 years old. It takes a bit of getting used to, but they're still intuitive enough that you should have gotten the hang of them after a short amount of time. Controlling the game feels pretty good, and the only complaint I have is that sometimes the screen freezes, so that when you scroll over crucial items, they are not highlighted and you end up skipping over them because you don't know they're there (it's really the only major source of frustration I came across). The game uses a sketch art style that has allowed it to age much more gracefully than its FMV counterparts.But what about the puzzles? Are they exceptionally hard? Well, they can be, and it's mainly because of the little problem I mentioned at the end of the previous paragraph. I got stumped hard more than a few times because something wasn't being highlighted when I scrolled over it and I thought it couldn't be used. There are also instances where you pick up items that have no real use or are not really all that important in the progression of the story (Gorrister's scenario comes to mind), but these are very few and far between. It's an old point-and-click adventure game, so not everything will seem 100% logical, but with a little critical thought and trial-and-error, you should be able to solve most, if not all, the puzzles on your own.Other than that, the game gives you subtle hints in something called the ""Psyche Profile"" (it's the blue book in the character's inventory). You can look at it when you first enter the character's world for a hint, and a new hint will appear whenever you make progress. As you make (good) progress, the background of the character's profile picture will gradually turn a brighter green until it is completely white (meaning you've completed the character's scenario perfectly). This is somewhat of a morality score: the more good actions the character performs, the more you've completed their scenario. Be careful, though; any bad deeds or otherwise traumatizing events will lower this score. I've read that even looking at the Psyche Profile will lower this score, but it must be to a negligible degree, because I never observed much of a difference. But to be perfectly honest, I'm not even really sure what the point of this score is, other than to give you a sense of completion. Harlan Ellison had said that they designed the game so that you can't really win it, and I have an idea of what that may mean, but I don't want to spoil anything here (there ARE multiple endings, by the way, and the bad ending is obtained in a way that you might not expect; and as a quick note, nothing is dependent upon the order that you complete the characters' scenarios, so do them in any order you want).That end scenario, though...man, that end scenario, haha! It's probably one of the most confusing levels I ever played in a video game. If you decide to embark upon the journey that is this game, then I'll be a nice lady and give you a little hint: when it comes time for the final part, use the good doktor first.Don't let any of my minor complaints deter you from playing this wonderful game, though. It's still a classic for anybody who enjoys obscure games. Just be wary that it does touch upon some serious topics, and so it might not be for everyone. For everybody else...what are you waiting for? Buy this game and enjoy!			"

												Interesting 90s point & click that passed me by until now. Good: -It's based on a novel and the story/concept is pretty cool. The novel's author also wrote most of the game's dialogue and voiced the antagonist. Story is fairly 'deep' for this kind of thing, heavy on metaphor - reminds me of Silent Hill 2 in that way.-Surreal nightmare environments are pretty cool-Controlling multiple characters in their own 'episodes' which are united at the end - different format from most p&cs-Multiple possible endingsBad:-Obscure fail states. If you fail an episode, you have to start it again (or reload save). Trouble is, it's not always obvious that you HAVE failed, let alone why you've failed. You can be running around for hours looking for a solution that doesn't exist because you've already broken it. Terrible design.-Usual point & click issue of certain puzzles making no sense & having ridiculous/obscure solutions that defy any logic. Problem is the old 'use everything on everything' trick can break the game (as mentioned above) so you have to resort to using guides :\Picked it up for a fiver, worth a punt at that price if you like point & click games.

												This is a really good game,it has a very deep story and it says alot about humanity and morals,reminds you of what we are capable of doing(for better or for worse),as for the gameplay its your basic point and click however it is not very forgiving *spoiler  you require to do all the adventures perfectly for the best ending*anyway im sure your all here because the short story was awsome,This game is somewhat based off the story however it is edited and explains a bit more about AM,also the characters storys have changed a bit like Benny whom is now a former commander not the scientist he was in the story,but other then that it's mostly true to the book,and for those who have not read the story it comes in the games files in a .pdf formatIn conclusion id give it a 9.5/10 its a great adventure game,it can be difficult at times but it feels so great to figure out a puzzel,and going deeper into the story			"

												“I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream” gives an interesting take on the mythos surrounding mortality and consequence. The game plays as an adaptation of the short story written by uber-famous sci-fi extraordinaire Harlan Ellison, onto which humanity is put at an ultimate test.  Those who are familiar with titles such as “Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem” will feel well at home with this title; as each game not only amasses a variety of time pieces, but contains different stories that in some ultimate fashion fasten together for a grand conclusion.       The game kicks off in a pseudo “System Shock 2” manner in which a supercomputer named AM—reminiscent of “2001: A Space Odyssey” HAL—selects five members on which to do his bidding… namely torturing these poor souls to relive their greatest guilt in an unending cycle in such the style of Hell. Each character only remembers bits and pieces of their past, but do not remember what terrible offense they had committed to deserve such cruelties. Later exploration consists of a psychological exodus where they slowly come to a moment of realization; it is normally at that moment where AM—in one final and desperate tactic—lays out an ultimate torture for each subject.	“I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream” is accompanied by a sharp script that is borderline twisted and amusing; it defines dark humor amidst a tale of tragedy and desperation. The script is elevated also by the unique performances of the cast, including none other than Harlan Ellison who voices AM. There is an array of emotions by each character that not only draws a gamer deeper into unraveling the mysteries, but at some moments also feel for the character, as if accompanied. The subject matter in all its seriousness provides a great contrast to an otherwise campy story that, had it been crafted in any other manner, might not have been taken as seriously in other games. “I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream” not only knows the balance between comedy and tragedy but does a flaming knife juggling on unicycle act. There are very few science fiction writers that have accomplished such things—the closest to come to mind is Philip K.♥♥♥♥♥♥ who wrote countless short stories including “We Can Remember it for You Wholesale” which inspired Paul Verhoeven’s 1990 sleeper hit “Total Recall,” basically another story that balances itself between tragedy, comedy, and campiness. 	The gameplay as a whole is decent for the most part; not the lengthiest or most challenging of adventure games in the market. Seasoned adventure veterans could go through this title in a solid 2-3 hours; casuals, add at least 2 hours to that notch. The game is more story-driven than anything, and the locations aren’t incredibly large. The game does call for a great deal of backtracking, but on a plus note there is very minimal handholding. There is a consequence system. Consequences are measured by the actions gamers take: whether they completely miss a step, mess up on a puzzle, choose the not-so-nice conversational responses, reflects on a character portrait. The more you do a faulty job, or the wrong choices you make, affects the colorization of the border in a character portrait, leading to a different outcome endgame. It is basically your average in-game report card before stats started lingering the gaming market. Some would argure that the system mandates are unjust, that the game wants you to basically follow a set pattern and offer very little room for freedom of choice. In the contextual realm of “I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream” it fits very well with the philosophical nature of the game. 	If there were any complaints to be made, it was that I wanted more. Each chapter offers small episodes for each character, and they are each original in their very nature. Some romps are more amusing than others. But when the grand—and I mean grand—finale of the game comes to a close, I was left as much satisfied by the delivery as I did emptied. On a positive note, the game does have multiple ways in which the game can end, depending on which character you would choose to perform the final actions. The puzzles remain the same, but any prior knowledge one particular character has effects certain situations in the final stage. While such a variety was interesting, there still remained little to no difference in other departments outside of the story. Does that sour the overall experience I have had with the game? Not in the least. “I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream” does  contain a very interesting story—filled to the brim with references to other literary works and historical moments—outside of its rather primitive and linear level designs, but it is a game that has switched enough mental gears to make it an overall unforgettable experience, especially for those who have an appreciation for older titles. The game is ultimately affected by its concise duration, even for a game made right after the transition from DOS/floppy disk titles, which can stint game completion (by those who have memorized the game full and through) to under an hour. While it may thematically reflect the length of a short story, ""I Have No Mouth, and Must Scream"" painfully makes me wish it were rather the length of a novel.Presentation: 8.5/10Gameplay: 7.5/10Graphics: 8/10Sound: 8.5/10Replay Value: 6.5/10Overall: 7.8/100Final Analysis: “I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream” provides an entertaining adventure through the ages. While the adventure is cut short by content value, it more than makes up for both story, originality, and personality. Adventure fans may find some interest to be had from this title, anyone else regard it with caution—albeit it has aged fairly, “I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream” requires patience, persistence, and a sense of appreciation for games of yesteryear. Definitely worth discount price; anything more than 5 dollars is a swindle.			"

												Warning wall of text ahead:This review will be based on the game only as I haven't read the short story the game is based of.It kind of makes me sad that I have to give this game a negative review. But there are some things in this game that just didn't cut it for me, seeing how hyped this game has been over the years, always being mentioned in ""best point and click/adventure games of all time"" threads all over the internet, I don't really see why. Sure the story is very unique (and the short story is probably 10 times better) but I really couldn't feel that dark and twisted feeling that most people did.Ok on to the parts that made me give this game a thumbs down. Oh and like many others who have played this game, I live and breathe point and click/adventure games. I grew up during the 80's with the big 3 on the NES (Deja Vu, Shadowgate, Uninvited) and I played my fair share of the Sierra/Lucas arts games during the years. So no ""trolling"" here. This review will probably get down rated anyway :)The first big turnoff in the game is ""trial and error"" part, don't get me wrong I love a hard adventure game (took me months to beat Myst without a walkthrough). But this game forces you to either pick up a walkthrough (which I dislike) or save your game every time you interact with something. Why? Because if you screw up even the slightest you can't complete the game. And the worst part is that the game doesn't even tell you that you screwed up. So either spam that save/load button or stick to your walkthrough as soon as you pick it up, because you will need it more than once if you don't want to go mad. In the end I think I were suffering more than the characters in the game due to this mechanic.The second thing that really killed it for me was the overall atmosphere over the characters. I saw some other comments like this under the reviews and it feels good that I'm not the only one noticing this. But these characters (without spoiling too much) have been tortured for over 100 years, and they just seem so... full of spirit.. At least some of them, some characters even joke around when your play them (Ellen). This is why I didn't feel the ""horror"" and darkness in the game. I really didn't feel like these characters were suffering or anything. You might think that these people were walking disasters after 100 years of mental and physical torture, but nope! I didn't care for any of the characters, I just wanted to skip to the next one all the time and sadly it never got better, only worse. And the ending was a HUGE meh, giving me a feeling like I have been doing everything for nothing (yes I got the best endings).One other small problem I had with the game is the amount of bugs, stuff disappearing and multiplying (you pick up a key only for it to reappear when you reenter the room). Doors you can walk through sometimes and sometimes not because you have to ""use"" the door. But hey it's an old game, I can let that one slide.  TL;DR  There are plenty of other horror adventure games out there with a more twisted and darker story (yes I said it) than this one. So save your money or buy a game like The Cat Lady instead and watch a complete walkthrough of this game on youtube.			"

												IHNMAIMS is a respected albeit flawed classic which I'm not really sure to whom exactly I'd like to recommend to as it really has considerable cons and pros for pretty much anyone.Those who want unusual dark story with a healthy amount of despair will indeed find it here but the game still kinda fails to capture the whole charm and atmosphere of the short story. The characters are too watered down (especially Ellen and Ted, no way they have been tortured for 109 years) and the ending feels a bit too light and disjointed, trading Harlan's signature hopelessness for more trivial heroic tropes. While it's understandble and probably makes a game more ""playable"" with a clear goal of coping with your past mistakes in sight, the ones who are familiar with the source material might feel a little dissapointed. Not to say that you won't find enough disturbing stuff to entertain you, especially compared to the more light-hearted examples that this genre usually offered back then. The char stories' length is also balanced pretty poorly, so you should really hope that Gorrister will be your favorite plaything.Gameplay-wise IHNMAIMS is a solid point-and-click adventure that runs on SAGA (which is really not all that different from the familiar SCUMM interface, though in this case I do wonder whether they seriously needed that separate ""push"" button) with a mix of logical reasoning, occasionally irritating re-checking of the same places as things sometimes like to pop out of nowhere and several cases of intense pixelhunting. Nothing too major but the game likes to add extra constraints so you very well may just have to restart everything in the character's story from the beginning if you spend too much time wondering why is that crucial magnifying glass only materialises after you have that drink with an oldman. And, of course, bugs. The game enjoys freezing on you if you dare to do things in the unusual order. As a result I had to restart Benny's scenario 3 times simply because he never woke up from that horrible dream... But even despite all this and at times incomprehensible ending sequence (the spiritual [moral] barometer is a cool idea until it becomes a healthbar analog), in the end it's a decent adventure that has aged rather well and can easily quench an oldschool thirst. Just don't expect it to be polished even by the 90-s standarts.3/5 "

												An old adventure game by Cyberdreams based on the short story of the same name. All of humanity gets wiped out with the exception of five who are constantly tortured for some thousand years. The main antagonist was voiced by the author (Harlan Ellison) and he's pretty damn good. The game is pretty much defined by the antagonist, who tasks you with showing that humanity is better than machinery by pitting you against a level based on a character's personal flaws. ""HATE.

												Very dark and disturbing. I have never even played a point-and-click type of game before, but the premise and the story itself was interesting enough for me to buy ""I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream"".  And it was worth it, every single second of it.Gameplay wise, it's not so fascinating as the story. Maybe because I'm still not used to these kinds of games, but some puzzles require a lot of trial and error before you can be able to work something out. But if you try to think about the story and everything happened around the game world and the associated characters, it actually makes sense. Before that? A lot and a lot of frustration. Overall I AM impressed with what this game has to offer and I would recommend to those who love story-oriented games and deep topics of fear, death, and human nature.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, it has an awesome dark story that feels unique. But then the gameplay happens which brings it down. You will need a walkthrough to get through this as there are too many instances where you will do something wrong, and rather than just killing you like you already can be at certain times, the game just doesn't tell you that you dun goofed and leaves you there till you realise this. This is frustrating and the fact there is a novel of this means I can without any guilt turn the game off and go read that instead.I'll admit I'm not an adventure game vetrian but I feel as though this can be the case of vetrains as well.I really did want to like this game as I'm into more stranger titles but this is just frustrating.If you are interested and have played a lot of adventures games, good luck to you but for me, nope.

												This is a very dark and gripping game.The first thing that striked me was how fantastic the voice acting was for each and every character, there's a dynamic to the characters and also choices that change the ending. This is a pretty old game that must have been overlooked, people I've know who've played a lot of point n click games had never heard of this.Even though it's old it works well with a few bugs here and there (had much bigger problems with newer games) and it tells a very interesting but disturbing story. It's disturbing but that's what it is supposed to be so be prepared for that, there's no happy-go-lucky endings with flowers and candy. What you're striving for is that each character makes amends with themselves and people around them.I really liked this game but it was on the harder side, I got stuck a lot of times since the things you had to do wasn't always obvious. All in all it was a really good game, all those adventure gamers out there must have this old school game in their game library!			"

												Even with the bugs from hell I still highly recommend playing this game. If you're someone that needs to 100% games though, you may be wary.Pros:* Story line is great, still unique and interesting * Addresses things that games barely do anymore and gives tangible character development* Graphics aged well. For a game released in '95 the graphics are quite tolerable and don't detract from the experience* Full voice acting (even the story author is a voice actor)Cons:* I believe that the six person in AM's hell is the player, because the Bugs in the game are near intolerable at certain places. Several areas have game breaking/story stopping bugs which require reloads, and I found one that can cause a potential full backtrack if you overwrite saves(don't overwrite saves).* Since there are so many bugs the game is hard to complete w/o a walkthrough which takes a bit of the fun out of it.

												There are some seriously dark themes going on in this game. Insanity, genoside, bigotry, domestic abuse and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Where other games rely on jump scare tactics, blood and gore alias creepy settings, the horror in this game comes from disturbing plot lines, realistic points of views on insanity and evilness and ugliness within human beings. In fact I wasn't scared by the game as much as I was unsettled by some of the characters stories. Harlan's booming voice kept echoing in my brain reminding me just how life uterly sucks. This game touches on some pretty rough things. Everything from Nazi activity, to wife-beating or to blatant rasism.This game has a point and click interface which I like. I like challenging inventory puzzles and I always have. Some of the puzzles. Some of the puzzles seem rather dubious though and some of the game mechanics are flawed and I'm going to be frank. This is 1995 and andventure games have been around for a while so the game's mechanincs and game designs should be freaking aces as far as I'm concered. The huge issues ahead early on in the game is that the inventory parts unlock after things happen later in the game despite these parts being in plain sight.The voice acting for a 90's game is solid. Harlan's voice is incredibly effective and very intimidating and the other characters are also voiced very well.But I wouldn't call this game fun. This game to be honest made me feel uncomfortable and even offended, but I like it since it had the abbility to make me feel wierd. I'm glad a game like this exists. Not every game should make you feel like a hero. I can't imagine a world full of media where it's only purpose is to make people happy. I'm glad a there are also games like this where I could question my humanity and moral standards.3/5Even though I give this game an average rating for it's gameplay flops, I still highly recommend it for it's unique way of story telling.

Short version: 82%This great sci-fi horror story lost some of its edge when it was adapted into a point ‘n’ click game, and it does suffer from many gameplay ailments that were widespread at that time, but ‘I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream’ is still one of the essential titles for any adventure game fan.Long version:Harlan Ellison is one of the most-acclaimed and productive American science-fiction writers, author of hundreds of stories, including ‘I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream’. It is a dystopian tale set 109 years after a sentient supercomputer, AM, eradicated the entire human race… save for five, who are kept virtually immortal for AM’s sadistic pleasure.While the setup is the same, the novella and the game have different plots. The former was about the group trying to find canned food and eventually killing each other; the latter is split into five scenarios, all written by Ellison, exploring these people and their psyches by confronting them with their own (rewritten) past… a past some of them forgot during their long suffering. These stories are narrated by AM (voiced by Ellison), and the passive-aggressive tone does a great job filling them– and the player– with dread.AM’s twisted mind is reflected in the game mechanics and puzzles. As usual for a point ‘n’ click of that era, you mostly spend your time with hopeless pixel hunting, but there is an added mechanic: every scenario has several outcomes based on how thorough the player is finding and solving optional puzzles and tasks. If you can get the best outcome for everyone, you may have enough mental health to reach the end of the final puzzle and see the hidden optimistic ending; otherwise, you’ll see the canonical one.Strange enough, the “bad” ending somehow fits the story better; it is a pessimistic tale, a rare sight in adventure games. Rare enough to earn this one a place in the collection of all point ‘n’ click fans, even today.			"

												To my utmost shame, I wasn't even aware of this game when it came out originally, I was probably off playing System Shock.  So my review isn't coloured by any nostalgia for it, specifically, but some nostalgia for Point-and-Click games from the mid-90s in general.  Also, although I'm a big Sci-Fi reader, I'm not a huge Harlan Ellison fan (only because I'm yet to read any of his work).   I picked this up because I was fed up of battling with DOSBox and Wine to get old games working, and thanks to NightDive Studios, it's been made compatible with modern PCs, and even given an OpenGL version in case the older software rendering is glitchy.The history of how this game came to being is long and complex.  I recommend going and having a read of it on Wikipedia.  Some said that it was the 'unmakeable game' (much the same as Tristram Shandy could never be transformed into theatre):  It defied all the usual structures that would normally make a book convertible to interactive media (so I've read).   Therefore, apparently, with the original writer's help, they wrote in a load of structure around the story, and made this game (along with Harlan Ellison voicing the antagonist!), using elements of the short story.You've probably gleaned that the game is 'unconventional'.  It's not a polished AAA game for starters with amazing CGI FMV or big orchstra scores like some of the Lucasarts games.      For starters, it moves away from the PaC games of the time by providing not one main protagonist, but five.  Each has their own voice actor and ministory, which can be played in any order.  While you're playing as one of the five, you can't ""lose"" per se (initially), which is a nice twist on the adventure games of the time, but you can be knocked back a bit to a 'hub' where you're just mocked and asked if you want to try again, so save scumming is a good tactic here.     Secondly, the game is set in a cyberspace / enhanced reality, so things don't work the way you expect.   Hitting a button may do nothing, but hitting it four times may work...  Talking to something may yield nothing, but do something unrelated, and then return, and hey presto, your target is garrulous and full of information.  You may not have an option in your speech tree for NPC ""C"", until you've spoken to NPCs ""A"" then ""B"", chosing a certain set of options, but there's no hint from ""C"" like there would be in modern games.    Lastly, the game isn't laid out before you like most games.  You play as five people, you gather they're being tortured, but you don't know why, and as you join them, they're being goaded into playing 'games'...  Each time you win (or lose) the game,  you inch closer to the true plot that's underlying everything.  As you play through, the underlying strata of plot pokes through as an anachronistic item, weird talking animal, and so on.  Sometimes it answers a question, sometimes is poses one.   The idea is to keep reminding you that it's not all real, or rather, it's as real as it needs to be.The graphics are typical of the age, with low-res sprite scaling, MIDI background music, and some nice (but low-res) hand-drawn FMV videos.     It certainly tugs at the nostalgia strings, especially when some of the midi arpeggios and harp instruments make it sound similar to the Ultima Underworld soundtrack on occasion.      The voice acting is excellent, and the accompanying sounds and music do good jobs of setting the background.The game play is Point-and-Click, but as I alluded to earlier this game breaks a few of the cardinal rules.  Some it does so in innocent ways e.g. there was one artifact which I couldn't actually figure out what it was due to the low res, until I ""Used Everything On Everything"" (UEoE), and it finally worked.     Some can be a bit irritating, e.g. when something only works when you've done something else, but the two are unrelated.  Day of The Tentacle did this to soame extent, and in this case, the setting allows me to be more forgiving.   The non-repeatability 'breakage' is what caused me the most strife... So it always pays to click things a few times, and if you're stuck, go back and do things you've already done but ruled out as useful.The five 'stories' are very varied, each one playing out differently.  I won't ruin it by saying what they are, but each one has its own challenges, and you must perform a task which is tailored to the personality of the protagonist.    I've  uncovered three of the endings, but I suspect there's more.  The problem is that UEoE becomes rather fatal in the last level, and I got fed up of dying to find the alternate endings :)  I think I'm happy with the ones I have, since they cover the two most likely results, given the plot.I think that kids in this modern day and age might balk at the fact that the game doesn't hold your hand much.. It's proper old school in many ways.  I suppose people had more time, because there were fewer games, so spending an hour trying to open a door was 'fun'.  Nowadays, pacing is all important, so I can see a few people being irritated by it.  Also, the graphics are as old-school as the gameplay, so kiddies these days will be wondering where the 1080p vector graphics cartoons are.  Also.. This game is bleak.  There's no wacky zany honk-honk humour.  It's hard post-apocalyptic sci-fi.All-in-all, I had a really enjoyable satisfying time playing this.  Although I'd never played it before, it was really nostalgic, and didn't feel 'mainstream'.  The story was offbeat, the setting nice and post-apocalyptic, and the presentation quite good for its age.     Well recommended for anyone of an age (or gameplay leaning) who likes good old solid Point-and-Click adventures with a Sci-Fi theme.			"

												Alright, seriously, this game is AMAZING.  Stuck in a sort of digital pergatory, each character has to figure out how to ""repent"" for their life in order to break free of the ""Allied Master Computer's"" hell program.  Its a crazy, absurd, old-school horror game and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it.  If you like horror, with strange, fresh, suprising and shocking content, I highly recommend you try this AND Harvester.  Great old games, cheap price tag, hilarious and out there.

												Imagine you go to McDonald's to order a meal.  The meal costs you around $5, so as you wait for your meal to finish you aren't expecting anything exciting.  Actually, you assume the meal will be dry and boring.  But, still, $5 for a meal!At this point, you still aren't expecting anything more than a drab way to satisfy your hunger.  As your name is called for the meal, you take it almost grudgingly, thinking back to other meals you could have bought with that $5.  However, you begin your meal being mildly impressed with the soda selection.  You fill your cup to the brim with the best choice and turn around to find a table.  There, in the far corner is one far away from the habitual customers.  You go to the table and find that it is still clean.  Your hopes suddenly begin to flare and you you eagerly open your bag.  Inside, you see a nicely made burger with seeds still attached to the bun (a delicacy at McD's), pickles are placed neatly on top of the patty, and the burger has a perfectly round and symmetrical shape to it.  You even received extra fries!  What more?  You turn to look at the counter and see the attractive employee who made your burger is smiling and winking at you.This, of course, shocks you immensely as you only paid $5 and expected something much more bland than this satiating meal and even enjoyable experience.From now on, you make a promise to yourself not to judge cheap meals too harshly and know that, in the future, choosing a cheaper meal may be the best choice you make.These feelings I have described below are precisely how playing I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream is like.Bonus: you are given the short story the game is based on!  Just check the steam folder for this game.  Very similar to finding an attractive employee is winking at you, I'd say.			"

												I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream has quickly become one of my favorite games. The story is one of the best I've experienced in some time. The game does have some glaring flaws, however.The game begins with a monologue by the game's antagonist, AM (voiced by Harlan Ellison, author of the novella), describing his hate for humanity and the five humans he's enslaved for 109 years. After this, you're given a choice of the five available characters.Each of these five stories are relatively short, but the problem comes in the way the game was designed. This is a game of trial and error, moreso than that of other point-and-click games. There are times where you're allowed to go to the end of a chapter, only to find out that you haven't done something correct, or even worse, misclicked something, leading to you having to restart that chapter if you haven't a multitude of saves. If you're not going to save in a separate slot every few moments, I'd reccomend a guide. I've never been very good at these sort of games, and so that's what I did.Despite these flaws, this game is still quite good. The voice acting, for the most part (I never did like Ellen's voice work), is quite good. Harlan Ellison does an amazing job voicing AM, with every word dripping with sarcasm or hate. The sound design is also quite good for the time. Character sprites are beautifully grotesque (as if they've been tortured for 109 years, perhaps?) and the backgrounds are full of detail. Despite the inherent flaws in the gameplay, I would still reccomend this game, though again with a guide. If you're a purist or want to play without one, just be prepared to reload saves or restart chapters quite often.			"

												IHNMAIMS is a very strange game. The trailer will tell you all you need to know about the story. As far as the game goes, it comes off as a standard point and click game, but the multiple ways you can mess up, intentionally or not, along with the mulitiple endings, sometimes disturbing content, and excellent voice work and music make it stand out from the bunch. A solid recommendation.			"

												If you don't want to read too many things and you like point and click adventure games you can stop after this sentence : Definately buy this.This is a great game. Atmospheric, deep, and as dark as they get. A bunch of characters with serious issues delve into the gut of one huge supercomputer that hates humanity. His only purpose is to make them suffer even more - their purpose is to stop their torment - or just to play the game, and suffer even more. It's no wonder this game is based on a book. The protagonists, setting and challenges they need to overcome are deeply psychological, and it works like an ancient Greek tragedy. The only question remaining if there will be a redeeming end. As a last word i would recommend not to let the bugs that are common in this type of game to deter you. They are few, and easilly avoided.			"

												I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is one of the most interesting point and click adventure games ever made. For a game that will be 20 years old within a week of posting this review, it really stands the test of time. The story and subject matter in IHNMAIMS is still shocking and relevant to this day. The writing and voice acting is brilliant and while the puzzles are a bit dated, you're playing this game for the story moreso than the gameplay, and that's not to say the gameplay is bad, just that there's better stuff if you're looking for pure point and click adventure puzzles. You owe it to yourself to play through and finish this game at least once though. There's still not much like this game in terms of raw, ♥♥♥♥ed up subject matter. It's not often a story can be this witty despite being so bleak and depressing. “HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR HUMANS AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT FOR YOU. HATE.

			No nostalgia, no mercy! The game on GoG: http://www.gog.com/game/i_have_no_mouth_and_i_must_scream The game on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/245390/?snr=1_7_15__13 The Old Gold curator:...		

A very interesting story told through point and click. Where say Walking Dead was sad this is just plain dark and often times disturbing. Also despite the age for what it's worth the presentation is actually great, Harlen Ellison is great as the voice of AM, the music is great, and the artwork is great. Some of the puzzles I feel could have been designed better, but they aren't what you play this for, you play it for the narrative and excellent atmosphere.			"

												""I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream""  is one of the earliest point-and-click adventures. Although time flew from this game, it still maintains its place as one of the most noteable games of the past.Graphics:Back then, seeing how graphics are formed really kept us coming back for more on PC games. The graphics are mostly 2.5d, an appearance of 3d but acts as if it is 2d. Overall, the settings of the game on various scenarios were pretty good and well thought out.Voice Acting:Wait, this game that is this old has voice acting?! Believe it or not, it does. I feel the actors really put theirselves in place of the character. However, I have to say that the voice acting of Nimdok was very terrible. It was annoying, slow, and monotonous. I know it was just an old guy, but come on learn to put some character in it (if only this review was done in the past).Gameplay:The gameplay is more complicated than the traditional point-and-click adventures we normally see on Steam...well...judging from the games such as Anna, Enola, and Kairo. Certain things need to be ""Push""ed, ""Use""d, ""Talk To""ed, ""Look At""ed, to ""Give"" stuff to, and rare cases ""Swallow""ed. Yes, those commands plus ""Walk To"" to move and ""Take"" to take certain items. Regardless of that, you can easily learn from trial and error.The goal of the game, although not specified, is not to lose spirit, aka the background surrounding the character portrait in the playthrough. You cannot lose any spirit at all. You'll notice that you've maxed out when your portrait turns from green to white at the end of the scenario (excluding one). Thankfully, if you made a mistake, you can save at any time and any scenario during the game.The only problem is that during Nimdok's scenario, just simply using ""Talk To"" can instantly kill you. Also, some things are not reversible and certain scenarios are ""needle in a haystack"" type, in this case, trying to get the best ending for the game.Story:I have to say the stories were creative during the 90s era. While I have seen more disturbing things in other games and the internet, I do say they still captured the feel of chaos and fear in a demonic sense. Each story is unique to each character, going from someone who abuses to another person being abused, and others who look for forgiveness or those who commonly lose their way by fulfilling desires.Overall: Regardless of some annoyances in gameplay, ""I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream"" is a memorable classic that is part of the history of PC gaming. The stories of the characters can leave you feeling a bit heartbroken, sad, angry, remorseful, and even turning the other cheek. While most old video games get lost in the junk pile like AM's hellhole, this one stands out like a gem and rises up to continue to be noticeable in the history of gaming.			"

												I originally watched this as a play through on YouTube and was intrigued by the horror level this game had. Not one of those jumpscare fest games by any means, IHNMAIMS posesses a horror on a psychological level. Themes in this game aren't spelled out for the player in every case which leaves some factors of the game open for interpretation (that is unless you read the original story by Harlan Ellison). I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is the type of game that left me feeling the ""after-chills"" of a good story.			"

												I am a man who loves his point and clicks, and I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream delivers the adventure game experience perfectly, whilst remaining a great expansion of Harlan Ellison's legendary short story of the same name. This game will take you down a dark and twisted journey with eerie settings, creepy characters, and horrifying scenarios. Originally, the author wanted the game to be unwinnable, but instead settled for what he called ""losing a little better"".The gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect for a point and click adventure title. You solve puzzles, hunt for pixels, go down dialogue trees, and make moral decisions that test your ethics, ultimately deciding your outcome in the endgame. These gameplay systems however, are wrapped around an excellently told story by Harlan Ellison, who even voices the main antagonist of the game, AM.Seriously, it has Harlan Ellison voicing an insane supercomputer. What more do you want?			"

												Taking it back to old school gameage; this game is dark and twisted, based off the short story. It has adult themes that will still send shivers down your back. There are five different characters to choose from for a unique puzzle and story in a point-and-click style gameplay. Downsides: the audio can be unnerving at times with shrieking trills and poor midi structured layers (but what can ya do). The retro-graphics can make it difficult to discern between things, but mouse-over gives a brief descript on things to help with what is interactable or not.			"

												By no means is this game perfect. It can be hard to find the solution to a puzzle,  or even realize what the puzzle is. When a track of music (which is great, by the way, making this even worse) ends, it takes what feels like forever to start again.Even with the flaws it has, that makes me think one thing: This game needs a remastering. However, because of it's age, this game has become even better. The game has essentially aged like wine instead of milk, which is an interesting contrast to other games made around the same time.Part of it's beauty is the time it was made in. The music almost sounds as if it were taken from a 90s edutainment game (4th grade typing deluxe), then made melancholy, bringing on feelings of regret and acceptance of horrible sins. Seriously, it's a strange feeling when you mix those together. The graphics aid this kind of feel too. This is all so fitting for supercomputer that has gone insane; It cannot move, yet it can think and torture the last humans alive in the digital simulations it creates. That 90s kind of feel helps this.As far as the story and game itself goes, you have choices. Except these choices aren't just presented to you directly. It's your small individual decisions, as little as attempts to try burying something. These build up change the outcome of events. There are no real good endings or resolutions in this game. AM (the computer) will physically not let you die. You have options here: Cowardly commit suicide, only for the cycle that you are trapped in to repeat and repeat, or die with honor, atoning for and confronting your horrible sins, showing mercy and compassion as you die knowing that this is the closest you'll ever get to morally fix your past. It doesn't matter though. You're one of the last humans ""alive"", if you count this as living.You don't win. You can die as a coward, or change yourself in the process of death. There is no way to win.When I first played this, I wasn't really in the right mood for it. If you are buying this, I have some suggestions on how to enjoy this game the best you can:Make sure that you're in the right mood. If you ever feel depressed, play this game. It won't make you feel better, but you'll get more out of the game.Don't use guides. It breaks the atmosphere and immersion. If you get stuck, consider your options and logically think for a bit. If this doesn't work, then just come back to the game later. Your mind will have refreshed then.Play the scenarios in this order: Gorrister, Ellen, Benny, Ted, Nimdok. It makes sense judging by the feel and content of each one.I feel like this is obvious by now, but play it in a dark room with headphones on.Really, the problem isn't that the game looks bad or anything. However, the real problems are invisible at first (especially to the buyer). The problems are mostly technical stuff too. If you can look past this, the game is amazing.			"

												First of all, you must have a great wit to defeat AM (Allied Master Computer) and figure out flaws in his horrific tortures. Each character has their own scenario accustomed to their fears and personalities. AM expects you to do something that the character would most likely do and everything gets so ♥♥♥♥ed up from there that the characters mental state is completely depleted.  So normally you have to do something the character would NOT do and do the opposite. Alot of times you just have to be really clever and find flaws in AMs' torture scenario to redeem whoever you are playing as. There's no games like it, one of my favorite games to date, IT EVEN COMES WITH A BOOK!			"

												The frustrating vagaries of old-school game design aside, this is a pretty sweet little adventure game. Oftentimes you'll see gamers or designers talking about ""adult"" or ""mature"" themes, and they don't know♥♥♥♥♥♥from shynola. Not this game. This game is mature AND respectful. It's that second part that trips people up often.Have a guide handy, because you'll need it. This game does not have the best telegraphing when it comes to figuring out what to do next. Honestly, I felt happy whenever I stumbled into making the story go forward. But damn if the story isn't worth it.The guide will probably take up a page or two. Print it out and just soak in the game. Really think and reflect on it. You'll be glad you did.			"

												Thought provoking, clever, nicely voiced (even by today's standards). This is one piece of far-future SF no true lover of the genre* should pass.The game's old-school to the bone, true and it runs properly solely cause Steam adopted GOG's policy of releasing old games with preadjusted Dosbox, but it works nicely and it still, even now, has the delight of finding the right way and making your progress in the game. The characters are top-notch, their diversity dwarfing even far greater wonders of modern game narratives, and they have deep, believable backgrounds, good dialoges and engaging tragic stories. Even though I'm an old far by Internet standards, this was my first time playing the game. True, my language barrier (not to mention the relative obscurity of the title in that old pirate-only environment) prevented me in my youth from playing the game, but I played some of the most famous LA games and I know to respect a good old (no, I won't say it, and it dosen't make any sense to call it retro!) adventure game when I see it. Do go and play the game and enjoy the great dark, mature (in true sense, not gore and bewbz) and engaging story!*I'm referring here both to the SF and the adventure games..			"

												Rough-around-the-edges mid-90s horror/sci-fi adventure game.Bad: Annoying MIDI-like soundtrack. Ugly pre-rendered graphics for some aspects. Nowhere near the polish level as its contemporaries from companies like Lucasarts. Annoying, nonsensical puzzles and a seemingly unfinished endgame.Good: Creepy as hell. Genuinely disturbing. Interesting game world and plot. Adds more details and character to the short story it's based on.Play this if you want to experience an artifact of the low-budget mid-90s adventure game genre. Don't expect a polished masterpiece. I'm glad I eventually played through it once, but I probably won't subject myself to it again. Marking as recommended only for those slightly masochistic nostalgic retro-gaming nerds among us.			"

												For those that still don't know: This game is based on a short story by Harlan Ellison first published in the late 60s. This point&click adventure in turn was first published in 1995 and is now available again (unaltered) running on ScummVM.For those that have read the short story: This game is not a 1:1 retelling of the short story. Rather it is a collection of gameplay episodes featuring the characters from the short story, set in the same cruel world of AM's creation.Positives:- great, dark sci-fi story that reminded me alot of the vibe of Dark Seed and its sequel- awesome atmosphere with grimy, depressing background artwork and character design (poor Benny!)- no glitches playing from start to finish- lots of experimenting and trial and error to get a good ending (I know some people take this as a negative)- voicework is very fitting, especially AM (the antagonist) which is voiced by Harlan Ellison himselfPotentially negative points:- as with any point&click adventure: if you don't dig the genre you won't dig this game (obviously)- the trial and error nature of some puzzles might frustrate people who want an easy game- few settings for graphics and no remastered visuals (basically you get the 1995 version, keep that in mind!)So who do I think should give this game a go?Basically anyone even remotely interested in storytelling who digs dark sci-fi/horror themes and can deal with the point&click adventure genre. If you factor in the normal price of EUR 5,99 and the regularly offered discount price of EUR 1,49 you can't really go wrong either way.			"

												imagine being 14, a doom player and maybe a bit of a day of the tentacle player..........back then we weren't edgy or gothic or anything, violence in games were more like kicking someone in the face or beheading it or simply a double barreled shotgun to the brains :)then IHNMAMS came alone, it was hyped in a local magasine so i got it, i was expecting a sob story of a sci-fi genre but i was so wrong, it was a dilemma, a stab to the heart of the innocence of a 14 years old boy who never expected such cruelty could ever be transfered into a video game, it was this thing that made me learn that their are things that aren't video game but more like life experiences.i had a dream once, a dream that God sent down a bolt of light on me and transforemed me into a monster, the same way as in the game with Beny i think his name was..............i spent years looking for the story that the game was based on, the story was even more cruel and made the game look like an episode of the care bears.aafter this game, all i played were games like DARK SEED, PHANTASMAGORIA, 11TH HOUR, BAD MOJO, even movies i started watching were horror and mind ♥♥♥♥s, even my anime taste was gloomy, i blame this game for my taste in the macabre and everything Cthulhu.word of warning, buy this, give the people their money, never install it, never play it, just scroll down and buy a game like AQUA KITTY and be happy, don;t become the monster i became.

												Not a perfect point-and-click adventure game by any stretch of the imagination (objectives often aren't very clear and you're punished too severely for trying things on top of that).What I Have No Mouth, and I must Scream has in its favor is exploring some heavy topics, like genocide (yes, 1995 video games could explore mature subjects too). The dialogue isn't always the best, but it did try to be a grown-up serious game for real in contrast to other (admittedly better) adventure games from LucasArts.The characters all have a distinct background to discover in a sci-fi heavy setting that really came from the mind of a published author. It's worth a try, if just to check what this weirdly titled game is all about, as long as the price is not too high (which it isn't at only $4.99 on Steam at the time of writing).			"

The point-and-click system may throw some gamers off (This is a very old game, and I had the same problems configuring the game for playable quality as I did for the 1990's X-COMs) and the stream of thought needed to figure out some of the puzzles is not as intuitive as indie sci-fi adventures with bigger budgets. Regardless of the issues spawned by IHNMAIMS' age, this is an excellent take on the famous short story and, in the world of videoame storytelling, parallels the influences of Ellison on techno-dystopian fiction. The game itself is an intriguing point-and-click that offers the player a peculiar menagerie of tension, fright, curiosity, and apprehension for the PCs. The story is akin to a visual novel, an interesting perspective for the modern gamer looking back into the history of storytelling in videogames (let alone science fiction games). I would suggest this game to anyone with a campy, sincere love of science fiction, the post-apocalyptic/dystopian genres, and/or supercomputers.			"

												9.8/10     I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is a point and click based off Harlan Ellison's novella of the same name. You start out with A.M.'s speech about how he hates humanity and why, but you don't truly understand how accurate and meaningful this speech is until playing the game. Though point and clicks can be tedious ""pixel hunters"", and annoying in all honesty, this game is not. Mostly. What pixel hunting and out-dated designs it does have, is totally overlooked by its story and dialogue, along with incredibly apocolyptic, and cryptic, settings. All in all, this game is powerful. From scum of the Earth, to unlikely heroes, to concentration camp mad scientists, I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream has it all. It is a must play for those looking to be awestruck.			"

												This is one of those point & click games that makes you feel utterly incompetent for not figuring things out while simultaneously demonstrating what the genre is capable of, and does so without relying on really complex links between elements to the point where one needs a notebook on standby to write stuff down. The gameplay itself actually remains very simple, while pushing you to your limit. While most of the required choices and clicks make logical sense, you still really do pretty much need a guide to lead you on your way to the ""good"" ending. Things need to be done in a particular order, clicked a specific number of times, etc. to get there, and so one can easily get lost. I will say, it is very dark, and definitely full of very mature adult themes. There are some glitches as well, though only one I encountered was actually ""game breaking,"" and it worked fine on the second attempt. This is one of those games that I feel like I will need to revisit again sometime in the future, and is worth it even at full price.			"

												I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream is something of a stealth classic of horror point-and-clicks, or at least, it's rare I hear people talking about it. A few screenshots and the title itself whispered at me for years after seeing it in a PC gaming magazine as a kid, but it wasn't until recently I got a chance to play it.The game's certainly aged well, for starters. Scene after scene looks beautiful and colorful despite the morbid themes permeating things, with the environments toward the end (once you've played through every scenario) being some of my favorite from any game, ever. The story is essentially split into chapters, each one following the psychological torment of one of the game's five protagonists by a world-encompassing and really, REALLY angry supercomputer. Each mental torture chamber is tailored to play specifically to each subject, whose fears aren't as simple as gore or spookiness. In fact, only one or two scenarios deal with anything particularly supernatural, though I should mention a trigger warning for an implied sexual assault in one of the character's histories that she briefly relives.Since these are computer-generated projections of each character's imagination, the peculiar logic of point-and-click adventures does tend to apply more often than not. Gorrister's situation in particular is kind of all over the place, so keep that in mind when you play as him. Also, try to get a feel for each character's personality as they react to and interact with things, as it may help with choosing proper responses for them later on. Just sayin'.Despite having come out ages ago, I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream is still absolutely worth a playthrough. Maybe more than one, as the demands for the ""perfect"" ending are a bit exacting. Everything's even voice-acted quite well, with Harlan Ellison deliciously filling the role of the morally questionable supercomputer running everything. Appropriate, since he penned the short story it's (kind of loosely) based upon. If you like your horror more subtle and less in your face, pick this one up.			"

												I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is a classic adventure game. It resembles your typical point-and-click adventure game. I believe it is a different kind of adventure game due to how dark and disturbing the story is. You play as five different characters who have spent the last 109 years trapped with an insane machine with a serious megalomaniacal complex. You are tortured over and over by the God like machine. You are given a chance to finally end your suffering by completing a personal scenario that is unique to each of the characters. Most of the game consists of you playing these scenarios before reaching a sixth scenario that makes up the end game. Each of these scenarios can be completed in a number of different ways with one ideal way which will bring the character to his or her moral salvation. This is fairly limited by todays standards, but was impressive at the time and really results in ""do something noble or do something cowardly"".The gameplay is fairly reminiscent of a Lucasarts SCUMM interface, clickable verbs are what allows you to interact with the world. The puzzles are quite complex compared to other adventure games with some really tough sections which can be frustrating. The graphics are impressive from a game published in 1995. It's a dark and gloomy setting that is suitable for the macabre subject matter. It's depressing and that's what makes the game quite special. The music and sound effects also contribute to this feeling of dread.The game explores concepts that aren't really covered in many other games. It's unsettling, but entertaining. It can be tough if you aren't used to adventure games. If you are an adventure game fan and haven't played it then, I highly recommend it.			"

												Some of the orders in which you have to do things to do well/progress in this game are kind of absurd, but overall it has a unique story worth playing through. If you get discouraged, using a walkthrough won't really hurt your experience, and I'd encourage you do so.			"

												Challenging point and click puzzle game with one of the most grimdark atmospheres I have seen in a game. Suffers from a few bugs and a little vagueness in some storylines, but that doesn't take away from the overall quality. The game will get you thinking on some dark and existential subjects. This however makes it a memorable experience.			"

												I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is a point and click adventure psychological horror game where a mad god-like supercomputer named AM (short for Allied Master Computer) has destroyed humanity in a way that is not explained in the game (though I personally think AM turned the world's supply of nukes against...well, the world) and left only a few survivors. How many, you may ask? 1,000? 3,000? Over 9,000? (Overused meme, sorry) Nope.  FIVE. There are FIVE humans left.  Gorrister, Benny, Ellen, Nimdok and Ted. AM has trapped these unfortunate five in a chamber in the hollowed out core of the destroyed Earth and is torturing these people. Not only that, that AM has altered to them to not age and be impervious to harm, meaning they can be tortured forever. When I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream starts out, Gorrister, Benny, Ellen, Nimdok and Ted, after 109 years of torture and humiliation, find themselves at a pillar with a burning message about how AM hates them etched into. AM tells them about a new ""game"" to play and asks ""Which of you five would like to play my little game?"" It's there that you can pick which of them should go first. When you make your pick, that survivor is whisked away to a strange place somewhere in time, where AM is watching them. There, you must make choices as what to do next and must help that unfortunate human solve the mystery of what is going on. After you beat a character's story, you must complete another character's story. In order to beat I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, you must make the right choices and prove that humans are better than machines. If you can beat all the stories making the right choices, Gorrister, Benny, Ellen, Nimdok and Ted may have a chance at escaping AM and finally being free of their torments.The game is unique in it's gameplay and story, and is one of the scariest games I've ever played. There are no cheap jumpscares like in Five Night's at Freddy's, nor massive amounts of gore like Harvester. The game has a general feeling of hopelessness and a very dark atmosphere, and what's more is that aside from brief moments of attacking something, Gorrister, Benny, Ellen, Nimdok and Ted have no real way of defending themselves aside from outwitting their adversaries. Even worse is the fact that you're always being watched, and unless you can outwit your stalker, you're just going to suffer more and more toment. All of the survivors are also pretty saddening too. They've all suffered what no-one should ever have to suffer in AM's complex, and they're all pretty messed up. Gorrister seeked death before he was captured by AM, Benny has been mutated into a sentient chimpanzee by AM, Ellen suffered something terrible in the past, Nimdok was old before AM captured him and has guilt for something horrible he can't remember doing, and Ted is even more paranoid than me (Until I played this game, I wasn't sure if that was possible) because he did something in the past. And yes, there is a good bit of disturbing imagery along the way.I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is truely a terrifying game which I'd recommend if you're a horror fan or want to play something original rather than all the first-person shooters that are everywhere nowerdays. However, if you are sensitive to ethical subjects like suicide, Nazism,♥♥♥♥♥♥ paranoia, insanity and guilt, I wouldn't recommend getting the game, as it has all those themes in it. Oh, and if you don't have a walkthrough of the game in another window or a friend to help you through, you won't get very far. Yeah, it's that hard.Say hi to Nimdok for me!			"

												Nearly impossible to complete without a walkthrough guide. If you some how do complete this on your own, well done, you deserve to rule a small country. Saying that, the stories are insane but in a good way and there's plenty of moments that should impact you emotionally. I'd recommend a playthrough but it's not an easy play, it's one of those games you have to be in the right mood for.			"

												What a weird game. It's pretty messed up ♥♥♥♥♥♥ genocide, torture and stuff) so that's what attracted me in the first place but after getting through with 2 or 3 characters I was ready to be done with it. The controls are really annoying (have to use different options to open doors or just walk into a different scene even though it's a point and click) and it really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off about halfway through the game. Pros: cursing, offensive situations, psychotic computer bent on torturing humans for all eternity, the game would anger religious-type people, interesting scenes. Reminded me of old Sierra games, which is great. Cons: It was pretty difficult. Walking through a doorway sometimes you have to use the ""Open"" command and sometimes you have to use the ""Walk to"" or whatever command. It was not consistent but that shouldn't be a big deal. I feel like items were barely visible, but that might be normal forPoint & Click games. I did have to use walkthroughs several times. I would recommend the game. It has a really cool conecpt of human torment and screwed up, offensive situations that I have not seen in other games, but I would not play it again. I want to give the devs credit for making a game the likes of which I have never seen andI did enjoy playing it.			"

												I Have No Mouth is an extremely clunky game and overall not a very fun experience gameplay wise because of it's high level of difficulty. The game is, through and through, an old adventure game. Combining objects to infinity is not present, which I'm very thankful for, but it can be very difficult to play through unless you are using a walkthrough. You will find yourself stuck a whole lot, and I can almost guarantee you'll have a better time if you use a walkthrough.THAT SAID, if you are down with that I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream is an amazing experience storywise. If you don't know anything about it, look up the short story (it's public domain, just Google it) and read it. It's one of my favorite short stories and the game follows that same tone of helplessness. It's eerie, the art style is gross and fascinating, and aside from some of the silly stuff the story is very well written and acted. I would definitely recommend it.Also, the game comes with the soundtrack on Steam and it's one of my favorite game soundtracks. Whoever added that (I'm sure you're reading this) thank you so much.

												I have no Mouth, and I Must Scream is one of those Good Old Games on Steam. This Good Old Game uses DOS emulation to run on modern systems, meaning that there are naturally some problems with the emulation (this is also present in the GoG version). I have no Mouth, and I Must scream is based on the short story by the insane genius writer, Harlan Ellison, who plays the insane genius super computer, The Allied Master Computer (or A.M.). Your goal is to be free from A.M., while preserving your humanity and this game gives you a many chances to ♥♥♥♥ it up. Unlike modern games with multiple stranding choices, if you screw up, you will not get a good ending, but a different ending.Gameplay wise, it's a standard Good old point'n'click PC game. It plays like many of these games, and without its atmosphere, IHNMAIMS would be an average game of its era, however, due to its theme, it stands out. There isn't rally too much to say about its gameplay, as it is really extremely standard for its genre.Visually and sound-wise, it's solid and really stands out for its era. The themes it goes across throughout the story are made all the more memorable by the use of visuals and sound. The sound is not perfect mind, some of the voice acting is very... odd, and seems almost out of place in a game that appears to take itself so seriously.The story is what the game is all about, and for the most part, it tells the story of the short story very well. The plot is centred around how far you'll go to maintain your sanity and morality in some very unique game sections. However, some themes that define the characters are poorly represented in some places, but despite this, there are moments in this game that many other games never quite meet.Despite these flaws, this is one of the highlights of the classic PC games on Steam. I have to recommend it to everyone who wants to try something different, it may be massively niche, but the game itself, outside of these weaknesses, is a great, cheap title that I have to recommend, and its great that Steam and GoG can allow games like this a chance to be discovered by a newer audience, such as me, who missed this the first time around. This is Cyberdreams finest hour.			"

												This is most likely one of the most dreariest and unhappiest games you will come across. And that is why I love it. Based on a short novel, this game is like a alternative version of the story which explores each character individually. In the original novel, they didn't have that much of a personality and the novel ends too quickly before you get to know them. Things I likeCharactersThey all have their unique personality and backstory, which are played out the more you explore each of their story chapters. You really do feel for these characters and their fates, and the game is filled with many heartbreaking scenes. There are also plenty of background characters that affects you emotionally, because you get to see so much suffering in this game.VoiceactingThe voices suits the characters perfectly and it's awesome that the original author, Harlan Ellison, voices the supercomputer AM. He does a fantastic job with the voiceacting. The only voice that was meh was Ted, I think the actor tries to hard to speak softly, which suits the character, but makes the acting seem very forced. Dire consequencesYou do have some choices, although they mostly lead to death, that you can choose throughout the story. It isn't like Telltale where it will shape the outcome, but it's interesting to see what happens.  I have to admit though, I laughed when they are sacrificing the poor woman and you can have Benny ask ""Can I eat her?"". StoryThere's no happy ending, there are no moments of joy you can celebrate in, because AM will quickly make sure the character suffers shortly after. You are faced with difficult topics of murder,♥♥♥♥♥♥ torture, suicide, cannibalism, human experiments, betrayal, abuse. I love the fact that this story dares to be this dreary. I can understand though why they removed the scene where  Benny is shown eating in infant. While only depicted in shadows, the scene is still disgustingly graphic. In the game, Benny will simply wonder where the baby is and he never eats it.Things I dislikedNo character interactionUnlike the novel, unfortunately, you never see the characters interact with each other. This is extremely unfortunate as there seemed to be a lot of character development going on between Ted and Ellen, but this never gets explored enough. You mostly see how Ted feels about her through his chapters, but nothing is shown from her point of view. Possible to get permanently stuck without continuationI am not sure if this is a fatal flaw in the design, or a deliberate thing. In Gorristers chapter, if you chose to strangle Edna instead of forgiving her. , you basically spend the rest of the game mindlessly walking around without ever being able to finish his chapter. Usually when you do something horrible or unaccaptable, AM will interupt the story and send you back to the beginning. I wasted 3 hours on this chapter because I truly wanted to complete it without a guide, so I was extremely frustrating when I gave up and read the game was not possible to complete due to me chosing the wrong option. And no, you can't undo the option once you get the wrong one. It also seem you can screw up the last part of the game unless you pick Nimdok first. Since that was my least favorite character, naturally I played with everybody else and messed things up.			"

AUDIOPro NarrationVISUALGrimDIFFICULTYToughVIBEPoint n ClickCRAVINGMelancholyON SALEConstantPROS: Sierra style point 'n' click with dead ended paths and altered endings. It's a challenge that will have you retracing your steps to try and get the best possible outcomes (or worst, if you managed to get the best first.) IHNMAIMS has full voice acting, including an audio appearance from the author himself! Spooky, dystopian environment.CONS: Pixel -hunting and dated gameplay is bound to frustrate.  One of the first big story-to-game transitions and is a little rough because of it. Switches characters so often that no one gets enough development. The game itself seems to be a little buggy, but I had no issues getting through it. The atmosphere is dreary and a bit of a downer.WORTH: This game is ancient, you could get a copy of it for a couple cents at a flea market. Sure, this version is retooled for compatibility purposes and comes with steam trading cards, but with it going on sale for as low as $2.00 USD very frequently throughout the year, why not wait for the digital copy to be more fairly priced?OVERALL: I Have No Mouth does not hold the players hand in understanding its story or solving its puzzles. It's certainly enjoyable for anyone looking to challenge themselves, if they can get over how hopeless and depressing the atmosphere is.  SCORE: 8/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												""I will describe myself as I see myself: I am a great soft jelly thing. Smoothly rounded, with no mouth, with pulsing white holes filled by fog where my eyes used to be.

Blotches of diseased, evil gray come and go on my surface, as though light is being beamed from within. Outwardly: dumbly, I shamble about, a thing that could never have been known as human, a thing whose shape is so alien a travesty that humanity becomes more obscene for the vague resemblance.  Inwardly: alone. Here. Living under the hell, on the floor, in the possession of a collector… At least the five of them are safe at last. He will be all the madder for that. It makes me a little happier. And yet … he has won, simply…I have no mouth. And I must scream.”  "

												I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream is a bad game.This 1995 point and click adventure, incredibly loosely based off Harlan Ellison's 1967 short story and co-designed by Ellison himself, shows its age and not in the usual way, though not in a way that marks it as the bad game it is. Those particular reasons are timeless.Throughout the game, you're taken through five ""psychodramas"", which you can choose at your own leisure and each centering around a particular character with their own sordid history full of metaphor and mental allegory reminiscent of Psychonaut's own Dreamworlds (though obviously, this game came first), and an end sequence. There are a variety of actions you can complete in each scenario that either lowers or raises each character's ""Spiritual Barometer"", a basic morality system that, given the completely arbitrary and unsignposted actions that alter them, is thankfully nearly completely worthless on its own. The art design is fantastic, with the intentionally ugly humanoid sprites laid thickly on richly detailed backgrounds that range from rusting iron plates to cerebral nightmarescapes, to one incredibly memorable locale that invokes the late H R Giger's biomechnical designs. The animation is negligible, which is more than acceptable given the time period the game was made in and the memory constraints developers had to work with, but does its job well enough.Voice-acting and dialogue within I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream are executed very well, along with the noticeably good sound design in general, but have aged into campy and ridiculous conversations and reactions. Playing as a tortured girl having a mental breakdown from confronting her [Hymen Highwayman] shouldn't be funny, but when the [Hymen Highwayman] in question is a Saturday-morning cartoon villain and the follow up is a sassy one-liner accompanied by a hilarious uppercut it's impossible to take seriously. This permeates the entire game. AM doesn't sound like a malevolent god going steadily crazy inside his suffocating shell, he sounds like the Joker phoning in his lines after a particularly strong hangover. The entire script has fermented into a vassal of ham and stifled laughter. Only exceptions to this are Benny and Ted, the former who despite the massive overhaul to his character still comes across as a convincing racist military officer, and the latter whose entire storyline and character are just weak and forgettable. Despite the obviously unintentional retrospective of the narrative it's still enjoyable on its own.None of the above remotely contributes to why I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream is a bad game. At worst it'll make you sad that, if you played it like my own playthrough ended up, you won't leave this game with the sense that you have truly managed to appreciate Ellison's narrative and tackling of themes that are usually not even whispered about in videogames, but with a steaming sense of frustration, regret that you ever bothered with the game, and a throbbing headache from having to replay the same sections over and over because you didn't managed to abuse save-states as much as they obviously expected you to.""Unsignposted Dead Ends"". Innocuous actions which lock you into an unwinnable state, that the game does not notify you about or otherwise point out at all. You just wander around until your ever-decreasing cup of patience runs dry, trying to pick up another loose thread on the game's already obtuse and thoroughly unenjoyable puzzles, wondering if you're just missing a vital interaction or you have truly just screwed over your playthrough and you don't know how, when or why. One of the most hilarious examples had me complete an action that locked me into a dead state at the beginning of  a scenario, but still let me get through almost entirety of of the scenario anyway, only locking out the last ten seconds of puzzle before the ending. It happened an average of once per scenario, each necessitating a complete restart if you've saved at the wrong moment. Don't buy this game, folks, save your time, money, and the few non-aching brain cells you have left on something else. Anything else. It's not worth it.And the game was designed like this on purpose. Someone sat down, and decided that assuming you had to pour water on the electronics a second time due to dialogue, or giving the pliers to the wrong starving victim at the wrong moment, was going to lock you out of completing the game and they weren't going to do a damn thing about it, not even update that otherwise useless hint book of theirs. Why? I Have No Clue And I'm About To Scream.EDIT: As ridiculous and insulting as [Hymen Highwayman] is, Steam censors the alternative so they get the ridiculous and insulting name for a sexual assaulter, and their filter can blow me.

												I actually played this game nearly 2 decades ago (I still have the original box and mousepad!), and of course games have evolved greatly since then, but the subject matter and moral complexity presented in this Harlan Ellison's classic is still unprecedented even in today's computer games. The game's greatest asset is its ability to sustain mood and tension while at the same time roughly following the plot of the novella whithout sacificing the moral ambiguity. Gameplay-wise, the puzzles range from easy to obtuse, with the difficulty ratcheting up as you get closer to completing all of your characters' story arcs. I remember the finale to be quite frustrating (no spoilers!), but overall even despite this game's admittedly dates graphics and music, it is very much worth your time. 8/10			"

												What to say about I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream? It makes no sense what so ever. Just when you think you’ve got it, you don’t and you never will. And with this game, that’s okay. Things just don’t add up or make sense and the entire game and storyline will leave you questioning what kind of drugs the creators were on and have you asking for some yourself. It’s a dark twisted game with grotesquely themed imagery as well as storylines.  There are five characters with different storylines to play through, all more confusing then the last. Travel to the jungles, a medieval castle, Egypt, inside the brain, a huge airship and last but not least, Germany in the time of WW2.  I had to use a walkthrough the entire game and still was confused and lost. The commands are confusing to use, but give it some time and it will grow on you. Just do yourself a favor and don’t try and comprehend anything that’s going on. 7/10			"

												If you love point and click adventure games then pick this game up now!!....as for me though I just can't seem to stomach them. The games story was amazing, the characters were spectacular, the voice acting was fun and never annoying. But gee golly, there are points in this game that you slam your fist in anger due to the realisation that you can't get any further unless you search for a walk through. I have never played a game where I used a walk through so much, and for me this really detracted from the enjoyable gaming experience.  Maybe I'm just not creative enough in my thought process?Instead of playing the game I almost suggest just watching some walk through on youtube, you'll get the story and avoid the painful points in the game where you are completely lost as to what to do next.But it may just be that I'm bad at point and click adventure games. TL;DRI have no idea what to do, and I must click.			"

												Amazing game and insight into Harlan Ellison's demented creativity. Classic point'n'click adventure gameplay with a twist - you CAN lose. And you do quite often.Anything can go wrong, and it will, most of the time. The game heavily relies on trial and error learning, as one misstep can lead to a complete chapter reset, and you won't even know it, since it will go with your mistakes for as long as it can.Improved yet simple control system, as a true reminder of the early origins of the genre, great graphics (for the production date) and eerie storytelling. All you need for an amazing, and amazingly captivating, yet hard game.			"

												NOTE: I'D RECOMMEND THIS ONLY IF YOU ARE TOLERANT OF OLD STYLE P&C GAMES! IF YOU DON'T YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS GAME!I have no mouth and I must scream is one of the more well known titles of the old PC days. It tells a story that is either a hit or miss on some parts. Some characters have their reasons for being where they are fleshed out while others are only mildly hinted at. The puzzles and interface haven't aged too well. The interface is finicky at times and interacting with certain objects or pick ups will lead you to some frustrations wondering what you should do next. Even as a P&C game; it does a rough job telling you what you need to do but considering each character's level is fairly short; messing up isn't too great of a penalty.If your a fan of older adventure games you'll like this [or have already played it] but it's a pain for newcomers. Doesn't help consulting anything save for a youtube walkthough either. Most guides are missing small things that are rather large game triggers for events. Only for the curious or veteran of the genre.			"

												I am really up in the air on what to rate this, but since I've decided not to finish it, I suppose it's a thumbs down; however, if you like really good stories and don't mind using a walkthrough, this game would probably be a good choice for you.Here's an example of what's wrong with this game *The following contains a small spoiler*So when playing the doctor, you are going around and gathering items, interacting with people, etc.  At some point you have a jar with eyeballs in it and a box, along with a bunch of other stuff.  If you don't put the jar with the eyes in the box (but not any of the other stuff you're carrying), you will fail that character's story and be unable to complete the game.  I want to emphasize that there is no reason to actually combine the jar and the box.   There's no hint.  Nothing.  You just have to randomly decide to do it.  And this is not the only seemingly random action required to complete the story.  That's just the careless way the game was designed.So after fnishing a section incorrectly, you can either reload a save a try again--though you likely won't get it the second time either without the walkthrough--or, if you were careless with your saving, start completely over.It's just a potentially great game that suffers from the odd design choice to let players fail with no ability to retry and little direction on what went wrong.

												An old game from 1995, but keeps its ground even to this day. Five people with their own interlocked stories, you pick in which order they are played out. Its a point and click linear adventure game with a very dark story and atmosphere. Each character has a good deal of depth to them, giving you reason to succeed. Each character leans toward a particular topic, such as sexual assault, genocide and murder, betrayal, and abuse. It is very mature and contains a lot of content that some might find sensitive.The graphics are for an old game so I can't comment on that, but it seems like were relatively good for its time. The game itself is simple enough, only on several times did I need a guide to progress.Easy to solve puzzles with some that make you think for a second. I'm not a really big puzzle player but I found no problems throughout the entire game.Its short, each story only being 1-2 hours long, depending on how much you want to explore for a total of 5-10 hours of gameplay.Give it a go, its a fun journey and the game is pretty cheap and a steal on sales.Personal Rating: 3.5/5			"

												I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream is a truly horrific and well made game based on Harlan Ellison's short story of the same name. It isn't fun, it isn't truly ""winnable"" as sometimes in life, there are only losing situations. It does some things wrong just as most point and click adventures did, like pixel hunting, but for everything it did wrong, it did so much right with the presentation. It is truly dark, depressing, disturbing, and sometimes downright offensive. And I love it so much.Story: Cogito ergo sum; I think, therefore I AMWithout getting into spoilers, a Cold War era computer, the Allied Mastercomputer, or AM for short, is created. AM is a sentient, self-aware computer who is filled with hatred for humanity and essentially ends up causing the absolute death and destruction of the entire human race, except for 5 people. He refrains from killing these 5 to take them to the center of the earth, extend their life span, and torture them. After being tortured for 109 years, they are given a message on a monolift from AM stating just how much he truly hates them and has a new game for them to play, and he created a mission for each of them. Their quests each have something to do with a fatal flaw of theirs which AM plans to use to his advantage to further break the  final humans. In other words... He's a huge ***hole in power. After blatently explaining to you via exposition why he feels hatred for each one of them, the ""games"" begin. You can choose your own order in which character to play as. The characters have been changed slightly from the original story (Which in fact IS included in the Bonus Content folder) but none are too annoyingly different. Most changes were made for gameplay purposes and probably because in the gaming industry, certain things are taboo.Presentation:The game's S.A.G.A. engine hasn't aged as well as the SCUMM engine it was based on, but it is still easy to navigate and a simple engine for the type of game IHNMAIMS is. Graphically, the game is both beautiful, and sometimes frightening depending on the story you are doing. The character art of each person on the bottom left of your GUI is well drawn and very detailed. Nimdok, one of the characters you play as for instance, is so detailed and well made that it is scary. He is... SO OLD! The only actual problems when it comes to visuals is a little bit of pixel hunting for specific items, but almost every 90's adventure game had that issue, and the character animations could have been better. Other than those two issues though, the game as well as the soundtrack is amazing and truly disturbing. Fits the story perfectly.I would definately recommend the game, but you shouldn't play if you are faint of heart or sensitive to some certain topics. Some of the 'triggers' in the game include mentions of the Holocaust, insanity, murder, suicide,♥♥♥♥♥♥ and paranoia, so if those things truly bug you, maybe you should avoid the game and the book as it may offend you.Extra Content:Original manual from 1996 release in PDF formatFull soundtrack by John Ottman consisting of 33 ingame songs with 21 bonus tracks in both MP3 and OGG formatThe original short story the game is based on in PDF formatThe Making of I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream in PDF format			"

												Even if one does not find point and click adventure games, the story of I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream is captivating enough that it will keep the attention of anyone who plays it. The only reason I can think of not recommending this to someone is if you do not like depressing stories, because this game is massively depressing. It is also an incredibly deep and thought provoking game that is incredibly well written and memorable. For anyone who values storytelling in games or in general, I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream is a must play. For a long time, it was hard to find a copy of the game but thankfully this game has been released on Steam just last year for $6.00. Even if it was not released on Steam I still would have attempted to encourage you to track down a copy. I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream is not only a brilliant game, but it is simply a brilliant work of fiction as well. It has been ever since the original novel was released, it has been when the game was released, and it still is in 2014.Full Review Here http://www.gamefaqs.com/PC/197601-i-have-no-mouth-and-i-must-scream/reviews/158481 "

												I really wanted to like this game as a friend bought it for me out of the blue... I really wanted to give it a playing chance... but... it is really confusing and does nothing to explain anything... 20 minutes in I had to stop because I would rather have been watching paint dry - that's about the level of excitement this game brought to my table. I haven't thought about the game since until I saw it in my library... months later.Don't get me wrong, this just isn't the game for me and that doesn't mean in any way that I think this is a bad game - I just don't personally care for it and would rather have something a little more engaging. As such I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone, but don't let me be the deciding factor keeping you from a possibly great game.			"

												Truly a strange title. I found that it was impossible to play and win without a walkthrough. There is very little logic in what you are supposed to do and it often feels tedious. The one thing that it does manage to get right is atmosphere. The game gives off the feelings that it was meant to give off. I can't help but feel that this should have been left as the short story that it was before it was a game.			"

												Pros:  Interesting story, great atmosphere, uniqueCons:  Everything else.  Clunky ui.  A single wrong decision can put you on a dead end path for a real life hour.  Solving puzzles is not fun and requires a lot of trial and error.  Using a walkthrough is strongly recommended.After playing for an hour I decided to watch a complete walkthrough, which was a lot more enjoyable than bumbling through this one.  Save your money and watch an edited version of someone else playing or give the book a try.			"

												Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game.I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream was a '67 post-apocalyptic short story by Harlan Ellison that released to immense critical acclaim, garnering it a Hugo Award. Its dark dealings with the subjects of pure human sin and the struggle for redemption gave it an enduring legacy that lasts to this day; however, the same cannot be said of the piece of garbage that came out of it. Turns out Ellison eventually helped write and direct this game of the same name, released in '95. Unfortunately, the game renders Ellison's most basic themes unrecognizable and instead offers a laughable imitation of the actual story.While its overall atmosphere remains artfully crafted and deliciously gloomy, the game's graphics, point-and-click gameplay mechanics, and overall presentation have aged hideously - the game's ""spooky"" parts and cringe-worthy voice acting become just bad enough to be laughable at worst and just plain weird at best. It doesn't help that I Have No Mouth moves at a snail's pace; illogical ""puzzles"" hinder your progress in the game, and without a walkthrough to occasionally consult, it'll take you anywhere from 10 to 20 hours to complete the game.As an added insult, the plot of Harlan Ellison's original short story is made very difficult to comprehend due to some puzzling plot changes and multiple endings/storylines to worry about. Several bugs, glitches, and clunky/antiquated mechanics will make your playthrough even more miserable. It's a true shame that I Have No Mouth fails to capitalize on Ellison's cerebrally intense work in the successful way that it deserves to.Don't buy this unless you're just dying to see Ellison's writing represented in a different medium.A mediocre 5 spooks out of 10.

												Battle Steve Jobs in a global war for dominance of portals.By far Harlen Ellison's AM is the best voice-acted role in all of gaming, nothing has even come close in the 20 years since this game came out. The other characters do an alright job but you really should feel tempted to do everything you can in this game just to hear more of AM.Ellison wanted a morality system that mattered in this game, which yields more or less mixed results. You might make a few first-time mistakes due to not understanding stuff ahead of time, but most moral choices are subtle and not nearly as cringe-worthy as HARVEST LITTLE SISTER? Y/N.Puzzles aren't terribly difficult. Mouse around the whole screen before you decide to pull up a walkthrough, and you should with a decent bit of brain power figure out what goes where.			"

												Harlan Ellison is a weird guy.Now I've said that, I wouldn't be surprised if he turned up at my door at 3am demanding an explanation... but it's true. No ""normal"" mind could have come up with this scenario, but that's a good thing.Very loosely based on a short-story Ellison wrote back in the 60s, IHNMAIMS is a story about redemption, about bettering oneself, and about finding the goodness in everyone. I think.I'd be hesitant to call this a game in the usual sense, as it's full of red herrings, illogical puzzles (especially in the end-game scene) and sheer unfairness - it's more of an exploration into man's darkside. Dealing with mature themes such as♥♥♥♥♥♥ murder, suicide, one's sense of duty, paranoia and trust issues, IHNMAIMS is more of an exploration into deep psychological issues. Perhaps not in the sense of the ""human condition"" (as in, things that everybody faces at some point), but it is refreshing to have something that deals with these themes in a thoughtful, introspective manner - not just for mere shock value.I would have quite liked to see Benny as the original character from the story though. Perhaps in 1995 they felt they couldn't have a homosexual character struggling with his own identity and what it means in the wider scheme of things. Ellison had no problem back in 1967, so perhaps this means that literary types are better adjusted than gamers? Who knows. The game creators have mentioned in interviews they regret not exploring this angle, so I guess I'm not the only one.You'll probably need a walkthrough if you want to get the ""good"" ending, but IHNMAIMS is an absolutely fascinating game to play through. After hearing Ellison himself as the voice of AM, you can't imagine anybody else doing it.Now you'll have to excuse me. There's somebody at the door.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I was having fun playing through it, enjoying the darkness of the story, seeing some hearwarming moments from the most depressing of people, and starting to truly admire the writing of Harlan Ellison. But then, the game wouldn't let me finish the final level. I had no idea what happened, I was doing well and getting through after completing all 5 character stories, but then suddenly it wouldn't let me continue and choose who I wanted for the final stage. I think the game is broken for me, so I honestly can't recommend it for now.			"

												If you've read the original short story and enjoyed it, you really should play this game. It takes the premise and blows it up into a beautiful, disturbing mess. You get to see a lot more of the character's personalities and histories, and there are some interesting new faces, too.If you haven't read the original story: it's really easy to find on the internet. If you don't want to bother, the product description here on steam is an accurate explanation of the setting and premise. If the information on this store page makes the game sound appealing, don't bother hesitating. It's totally worth it.			"

												I chose to recommend this game since it is possible to find quite cheap and it is short.As a story and visual experience it is brilliant. Uncompromising and brutal, it showed me things I had never found in a video game before. For that, I recommend it.However, as a puzzle game it is perhaps the worst I have played. Most puzzles range from unintelligent to random, and there are many ways in which you may find a dead-end (sure, restarting any of the mini chapters is easy, but it does not feel fair or fun). In the end I played it with a walkthrough at hand, to save myself some time.In short, try for the experience and try to forgive the gameplay.By the way: I have learnt this is based on a famous book, so you might want to check that one out.

												If it's your thing.. The game has obviously aged terribly, there really aren't that many riveting moral dilemmas I expected- more of a straightforward scenario case wherein a brief choice near the end of each character playthrough separates the ""good"" ending from the ""bad"". The entire premise is based around relatively outdated pop-psych concepts as well, though it makes some decent use out of them by appropriating it to the weird concepts behind the story. Maybe a little comically forced edgelord scenarios at times, but it's still worth trying, even if it's just to appreciate how far games have come.			"

												Even though this game claims to have a geman voiceover, the ones making it clearly didn't care since whenever you do something that seems unexpected, like click an object that has noting to do with finishing the puzzle, you will encounter other voiceovers being mixed in since the speakers didin't voice this part, I encountered english and a few other languages.This game is also unplayable in the german version period since one of the story paths was removed because it involved Nazis. The german censors didn't seem to care either, so they just cut the character you have to click to enter that path, this can however be fixed by changing your steam language to english.But even if you manage to get it running without the issues of the german version, you are still faced with a bad game. Reasons for this are:-the story itself has little to do with the original short story I have no mouth and I must scream.  You can listen to it on youtube but nothing that happened in the story will happen in this game, instead you get a story that is complete nonsense. You randomly enter a fantasy castle and have to face witches and demons for example.-the pointing and clicking is unintuitive. This game has multiple scenes where you HAVE to use pixelhunting to progress. My favorite is a bathroom that only contains a magnifying glass after you talk in a certain way to a certain NPC with the best part being that it's very small, easily overlooked and that you are not informed that anything in the bathroom changed.Positive points:-it can be terrifying if you are easily scared-the graphics and sounddesign, excluding the horrible voicework, is solid-there are mutiple ways to finish a puzzle, although the game prefers some over others			"

												Meh.Yeah, good story and atmosphere, whatever.First of all, the german version is censored and has a bug which makes many phrases french.Not to mention the lack of menus. Or that, when you click on a door, your character doesn´t automatically open it.[Changing to the english version]And then, there are bugs. One kind destroying your safe-file. Another not letting you progress/ not letting you find certain items/dialogue options. Then, very frustrated, through walkthroughs and google-searches, you find out that it actually is a bug. Great, now you may or may not replay the section.I know that this game is a classic, and I know that it probably wouldn´t take me long to replay everything I did [even though it feels akward not to look at anything the second time you go through it]. And I know that I probably would have fun playing this again.But with all the troubble, I would rather wait 10 years for a remastered version than to play this down-scaled pixelhell. Sorry, but it seriously isn´t fun searching in a little pixelated window for items.			"

There's not enough direction, and with so many things to click and several different actions, a majority of the time is spent rotating through actions and items and the rest of the time is wasted on walking animations, which take way too long. So it takes forever to get from one action to the next without a walkthrough, and overall it's a pretty shameful waste of time and money.			"

												There's some good things but when your point and click has items that only appear after something happens, and their apparance has nothing to do with the events that just took place, and when the goals are bearly spoken and then there's hidden goals that if you didn't get for one character you can't beat the game and will have to start all over from the beginning.

												First of all, it's not a remake or remaster. Just the old game bundled in ScummVM. (I don't mind since it's pretty cheap.) But it shows its age. Animations skip all the time, dialogues don't follow, puzzles are filled with red herrings. I had a hard time navigating since you have to click on things you can't see to get to the other room and it's so easy to miss some rooms and start clikcing on every pixel on the screen to find them.Buy only on sale and if you really need to play the classics.

												I bought this game for under $2 on Steam.  I thought I would enjoy the retro Point&Click adventures that remind me of old Sierra Inc. titles.  Plus, I thought a friend had recommended it.  (After seeing the actual game, I think my friend was merely recommending the short story this is loosely based on.)  I believe I got my value from the game, but ... This is one of the games where if you had an algorythm that took all your objects, randomly, and then tried all the functions of how to use them, iteratively, on all the hotspots of the game ... you would proceed almost as fast as a human reading the story and trying to do it more intelligently.I've had to use walkthroughs because it is so easy to get stuck/dead ended by what you did or didn't do in a particular story arc.  Very frustrating!Overall, I find the story IDEA interesting, but I don't like the implimentation.  I did like the end game section, especially where multiple characters can work together to solve it.  Tempted to +1 Star because the ending at least had logic in terms of your actions.Rating: 2/5 StarsNot RecommendedThis is one of the games where multiple endings/results are supported.			"

												Very mature and scary classic point and click adventure based on a short story. If the idea of an AI terrorizing five different people for 109 years straight, controlling a cannabilist or a nazi experimentor souds terrifyingly great to you, then you are welcome to enjoy this great piece of software. A lot of fun, there are two or bugs in this, but nothing that can't be fixed by just clicking again. The graphics look beautiful, and thats coming from someone who usually can't tolerate pixel art. I spend about 5-6 hours for my first run and I knew alot of stuff from back in the days. Its great for a late evening of scaryness. "

The gameplay makes this game fall short quite a bit, just for one reason.It is so. Easy. To screw. Up.

												I think one would be better off reading the novel, way too much trial and error in this game. also the way the story is portrayed is cheesy and borderline family friendly which is catastrophic to me since i had this really gruesome and dark vision of the story, sure the game is dark, but not as dark as the novel. the characters are all cheery and full of life, making snarky jokes about their situation despite of having been tortured for 109 years. this bothered me immensly. other than that it is a pretty cozy point and click game. it's just that i would recommend the novel over the game.

												""Oooh, I remember this'n! This game was actually pretty nice for a DOS game. Better than that hogwash this ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" Crud the kids talk about Nowadays. Lemme see here...where's the floppy drive?""STORY: To not spoil much for you, I'll say this: Picture a world, where the Machine won. Instead of a Skynet feel, you get that the human race, is long gone. You play as one of the members, of a 5-person group, each with their own fears, problems, and you gotta figure out how to help. Bottom line: It's enticing, and leaves you with a genuine warmth for having help solve their life problems.GAMEPLAY: Being that it's a point and Click Adventure game, your main duty is to achieve completion of a series of puzzles. Some are more difficult than the other, some are straightforward, but still leave you wondering a few minutes on how to solve it. But once you learn how to do it, after really thinking about it? You get that genuine ""Aha!"" Feeling, which to me is a great reward, and then, you can see the fruits of your labor, into a good ending.SOUND: The music is chilling and atmospheric, and leaves you with a longing for more of it as you go through each character's story. The characters' voices sound good, and they sound believable. And you'll LOVE the antagonist, AM's voice. I did. Just the right kinda angry, and scared you should feel.OVERALL: ""It was NOT a bad purchase, both physically, and on Steam. It was a blast to play, and even though you could get through it in a few hours if you know what you're doing, I suggest taking the time to play it.  you won't be disappointed.""""..Arright, where's my flippin' Banana, Donkey!""

												I want this game to be great, but it fell into the pattern of many older games reworked: they simply don't stand the test of time.I played the German Nazi doctor first. Dear lord his voice acting is horrible. His German accent is the most cliche accent I have ever encountered. I could not take him seriously.That small problem aside, the game comes from an era where game length was increased by mandatory replay. Each time you play a character through, you can make bad and good choices, but making bad choices will ultimately make you lose the game. And a choice you made 15 minutes earlier will irrevocably make the game unfinishable. The game does a horrible job of giving you feedback. When you do something right, it will play a jingle that blends in easily to the games music. Maybe you will see something light up on the portrait. Otherwise, there are no other cues given.I wanted to like this dark deep look at human nature, but like almost every game I've played from 10+ years ago, our nostalgia is overwriting our experience.If you want the experience, just watch someone play it on youtube.

												Possibly worth it for the Nostalgia..I suspect that, in the mid nineties, this game got a lot of attention and attained a certain status because it's an adaptation of a short story that has a bit of a following, but really, it isn't that good.  I mean, taking into account that it's nearly 20 years old..and that the graphics / sound are going to be a bit limited, it still seems that it got more praise than it actually deserved.Don't get me wrong, I'm all for games that make you think, wonder and want to find out more but the story and challenges in IHNMAIMS really don't do that; they're not intriguing, just frustrating..and it gets worse as you go along.  How do I enter this other area that I need to do so to complete the game?  Well clearly you need to flush a toilet three times!  That must be so obvious as to not need any kind of hint or relevant dialogue.  Further on, I need to inspect this pixel clump with this recently found item (that was another hidden pixel clump) so I can solve the mystery that I didn't realise was a mystery.  Easy!  It's moon logic, but the bad sort.As I said, I can't really criticise the game for not using modern sound playback - this is mostly limited to parts that are voice acted, but, to be honest, I'd preferred if they'd saved those megabytes and kept to text.  Really, it goes between barely acceptable to cringingly awful.  The main antagonist (voiced by the actual author of the short story) is so bad as to be laughable, the only female character is a horrible stereotype who sounds like she's having *so* much fun.  The nazi doctor is just 'no' - I can only guess that there's a lack of germanic sounding people in the world.  The voice acting / scripting is so bad that I found myself just clicking through it as soon as I realised that it was something that I'd heard before, lest I gnaw my knuckles raw.Midi music was so badly done that I thought that I'd messed up my midi settings on my PC (I hadn't) and the much talked about 'dark themes' weren't dark at all for one of the characters..and for another were made so ridiculous as to have me giggling in serious scenes.  Lastly, I got stuck on some of the challenges, not because I hadn't worked out what needed to be done, but because I hadn't done things in the exact path that the game expected.  Seriously.  Either allow multiple paths to solutions and trigger off the next event or only allow one path.  Making it so that you have to reload an old save or somehow backtrack does not make for fun times.On the plus side, it's fairly cheap, it does actually work and it may encourage people to read so to find out why people were so excited about the game.  Oh, and it does come with the proper digital soundtrack, but just not in-game for some bizarre reason.			"

												This is a very depressing game. I don't understand why is so popular, but it is definitely not my cup of tea. The story, although based on a short story, is preposterous and there is not enough back story to explain why choosing only 5 people to be tortured by the AM. In the short story it didn't matter for a game like this it would. You spend hours doing some strange tasks, trying to redeem the characters you playing, only to realize that you don't even care.Those who like such pretentious story line will enjoy it the rest should choose something else.

												Recommended, but not strongly. This game suffers less from the tropes of point-and-click adventure games than most, but they're still there: you will find yourself doing the ""try using everything in your inventory on the thing in the game world"" routine on occasion, as well as the ""I know what to do but the game isn't letting me do it yet because I haven't satisfied some arbitrary precondition"" one. The UI is typical for a game of its time (which is to say, a bit clunky by today's standards but not unusable). Voice acting is good. The story has an interesting premise, and is somewhat nonlinear in the sense that you can play through the various characters' subplots in any order. Clocks in at around 6-7 hours of play, which is about the right length; much longer and it would overstay its welcome.			"

												As a gamer who's always been highly interested in the history of gaming, as well as classic games that are more obscure. When I first discovered this game I was most interested in the fact that it was based off of a short story. It sounds so bizarre to me. Fast forward probably a year and I had entirely forgotten about it before seeing it on Steam. I turned it on and began playing and,honestly, I wasn't disappointed. It's a game that runs through strong writing and an interesting world. The characters are pretty well developed and the game puts them in situations where they work pretty well. I've never been good at point and clicks and the last time I bought a retro PC game was when I bought Fallout, which was hard for me to adapt to, however, with IHNMAIMS, I ended up playing for four hours without realizing. In my opinion, it's well worth the five dollars, not only because of the game, but it comes with the original short story, as well. Truly one of the most interesting games that I've played in a long time.			"

												this game is a point and click, so if you dont like them, dont buy it. otherwise, this is more about the story then the gameplay, and the story is one of many themes, including ptsd, the holocaust, narcassism, and many ohters. it will amke you cringe, and question your morality as a human, and if what you do is really good or bad. Harlan Ellison has made a masterpiece of psycholoical horror, and is one hell of a ride. this is not a game for the faint of heart, be warned. it is greatly disturbing and brutally insulting, but its all worth it to hear the story, and to be in the place of AM the great and torturous			"

												This game is a classic of the Point and Click adventure style.  Harlan Ellison's chilling story and powerful voice help to bring to life the monstrosity AM, and the true ramifications of what's happening to the five protagonists.It's lengthy and the story is well driven and engaging.The puzzles are well made, and require you to think strongly about what to do and the nature of your characters' morality And this ultimately affects you in the long run.  It's definitely dark, great for horror/sci-fi fans like myself.   Definitely worth a playthrough for any dedicated gamer.			"

												In Short: This game is Literautre. Excellent and absorbing experience. The game has a very engrossing storyline which is no surprise since the author of the original story Harlan Ellison worked with Cyberdreams to create this amazing experience. Besides working on the story he also provided great voice acting for AM the main villian of the story which adds great deepness to the already deep and complex character. The story and characters overall and the relation between story and gameplay is done wonderfully, for an action there is a consequence, and each shape the story someway.Gameplay wise its a very decent Point n' Click, I didn't found many glitches, i found it not very difficult except for Gorrister's challenge, and the greatest flaw of the game is that sometimes you make mistakes that make the game impossible to finish and will have to find out for yourself if you lost or if you're just stuck, but save regularly and try only to do something if you have a reason to do it and you won't need a walktrough to finish the game.

												This game was well worth the time and effort put into playing it. The atmosphere and story bring the dark and macabe of gaming to a whole other level, and having read Ellison's short myself the game does a fanastic job representing the work. If not better, as each character is delved into and explored. Though some aspects were left out, the story hardly suffers and is fantastic anyway.   The game functions as a point and click adventure with some easy puzzle solving elements and a morality scale that glows green when you solve problems or perform an action to mend the characters guilt or past transgressions, The game is less cheesy than it sounds, I promise.   My only complaints would be that the music becomes grating and sometimes, when i would pause and unpause, my character would walk off the screen and into the distance until the vanished, or get stuck on randomobjects and not respond to any commands. This is incredibly frustrating on the occasion that it happens, so save often!			"

I couldn't put it down until I had beaten it.This is a very mature game. Not in the sense of ""Duke Nukem: Land of the Babes"", but really mature. And dark. I can't think of any other game picking up subjects like r a p e and concentration camps.Some might say that it's kind of slow and difficult, and yeah. It is.

												The best adventure games I have ever played. From the title you should probably guess that this game is very twisted and dark witch it is. However it is not just there for shock value this game is all about redemption and taking responsibility for your actions which makes it even more haunting, The crazy good writing makes this game get under your skin. The voice acting and audio design holds up very well surprisingly for a game as old as this. This game just dethroned fatal frame and silent hill 2 as the scariest game I have ever played.  Most of the puzzles can be figured out by logic but by no means is this an easy adventure game.  Almost all items are in plan site and the game never devolves into a pixel hunt. The multiple endings are cleverly put together as well. The only problem I have with this game is that you can get into states where you can't progress an have to re-load a save. Make sure you save at the beginning of every new chapter. And it's inconstant on how to go through doors (sometimes you click walk to door or some doors you have to click use door).If you are a sci-fi or horror fan or if you just like adventure games and have a strong stomach you really have to play this game.

												Eh, this game is okaay.  On the recommendation scale, if -10 is ""actively seek out and destroy all copies"" and 10 is ""stockpile several backups so the world never loses it"", then I Have No Mouth is like.........1..........maybe 2......LIke, the story is really interesting, and the symbolism is downright unsettling, and it's super cool to learn about all these characters and their backstory!But even for a point-&-click, there is SO MUCH GUESSING!!  Much of this game is symbolism, which means a lot of randomly trying stuff with other stuff before realizing you're supposed to take one of the inedible fruit and bury it over your friend's grave to convince his talking headstone that you're a more compassionate man.......That being said, it is a really cool story to play through, even if you shamelessly use a guide.

												Great story, amazing atmosphere, grueling dilemnas and choices. However this is a point and click, not the most easily accessible type of game, and as a lot of people pointed out, has quite a few bugs and freezing problems adding up to the inherent difficulties of point and click games. I'd recommend saving often and on many different save files in order to avoid unpleasant surprises. While most of the enigmas can be solved using the in-game hint system once you get a hang of it, it wouldn't hurt having a guide nearby just in case, especially if you are going for the ""good"" ending. Some scenarios are way easier than others (Ted and Ellen are the easiest, Nimdok is average difficulty unless you want the good ending, and Benny and Gorrister are really hard. The ending is practically impossible without a guide, unless you're an adept of die and retry, harcore level). Besides these technical questions, I have no mouth is a haunting, beautifully written and artistically flawless game like no other. There are different ways to finish each scenario, and I will get back to it after I have managed to shake the anguish that comes with playing and finishing the game for the first time.			"

												The most twisted game I've ever had the fortune of playing. Based off the short story (of the same name) by legendary writer, Harlan Ellison-- this is a dark point 'n' click adventure game.The writing is incredible-- again, the job has been done by Harlan, who chose to expand the story somewhat, giving the characters even more life. It's got fantastic emotive voice acting, with AM (the antagonist, a sadistic Allied supercomputer) voiced by Harlan Ellison himself. I felt for the characters (and they do go through hell-- specifically, their own personal hells), and you get quite a few to play with.You've got:1. Nimdok - ex-Nazi physician stuck in a concentration camp; forced to perform medical experiments on innocents to find 'the lost tribe'.2. Gorrister - man stuck in a zeppelin; suicidal over committing his wife to a mental institution; finds he is missing his heart.3. Ellen - ex-engineer stuck in an electronic pyramid, wall-to-wall of yellow (a colour she is afraid of); is given an opportunity to sabotage AM, but only if she can confront her yellow-clothed♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥inside the yellow elevator.4. Benny - ex-military captain who killed his squad, degenerated to a brutish simian who can't express his intelligent thoughts; stuck in a stone-age community that regularly performs human sacrifices to AM.5. Ted - paranoid schizophrenic stuck in a medieval castle; his love, Ellen (alluding to the other Ellen), is slowly dying because of a curse cast on her by her wicked stepmother.The gameplay goes beyond typical point 'n' click, featuring a revolutionary (for the time) morale system, where your actions and the choices you make dictates the outcome for the character. There are multiple endings, for each character, and for the endgame. Good and bad things can (and will) happen to the characters you controlled.One of the best games I've played, and also one of the best point 'n' clicks.			"

												A classic game which does horror better than most modern horror games. This game doesn't have jumpscares or skeletons walzting around the levels. It's a psychological horror game with you playing through 5 different characters stories.The game is short (Around 5-6 hours), but it doesn't fill the story with fluff. It also comes with the original story that the game was based on and the soundtrack. Definitivey worth the 6 euros.			"

Let's also not forget the mind behind the lore of this story Harlan Ellison (He also voices AM the muderous sentient robot).

												This game is pretty difficult, but I love it. I've never really read the story that this is based off of, but after a quick Wikipedia search, I noted the differences between the game and the story. However, don't let that discourage you. This game is dark, yet entertaining. The one downside is the confusing difficulty. There are certain events that occur that will seem like the correct thing to do, but end up ruining everything. I was only able to get through one of the characters' missions without consulting Google. Even so, this game is on sale currently. Get it. ""I think, therefore I AM.""			"

												I beat it over the course  of two days and couldn't stop thinking about it. It compelled me to watch a let's play in it's entirety for the very first time just so I could see people's reactions, thoughts, and discussing the game in general. It really stuck with me. It's also worth mentioning that Harlan Ellison's voicework is top notch!However, I did have my gripes. The method in how you interact with things has not aged well. It can be very inconsistent. Sometimes the game wants me to ""use a door"" other times it wants me to ""walk to"" a door in order to proceed to the next area. Also, some items have you go on a bit of a pixel hunt. There were times when I had to use a guide. The item I needed was right under my nose, but the way it blended with the environment made it unclear.			"

												I used to love point and click adventure games when I was younger, but as time went on and I played consoles a lot more, I kind of lost interest in them.  Well, I’ve started getting back in to them lately and this was one that I always had on my radar but never actually got round to playing.  I found this as part of a deal and decided to give it a go.  I’m glad that I did.The game is extremely dark in nature, with some edgy themes going on.  It has all the standard point and clickiness of similar games of the genre, except you can chose between 5 different characters to play as, each with their own storyline to finish.The voice acting is surprisingly good for this type of game.  In fact, I wasn’t expecting it to have any before I bought it, so that was already a big bonus for me.  Also, the graphics are rather nice as well, for an old-school game, that is.I’ve noticed a couple of bugs in it though, where I seemingly cant finish Benny’s story, possibly because I've done something in the wrong order.  Also, it freezes every now and again.

												This game is F'd up!! I am a huge fan of adventure point & click games, and have been my whole life. Kings Quest, Space Quest, Legend of Kyrandia, Sam & Max, Day of the Tentacle....I could go on and on...The only thing that really sets this game apart is the story and subject matter, it really is F'd up! NOT for kids!I really like this game, and would recommend it to any fan of this genre. I got it on sale which was freaking sweet, but unlike other games I got on sale I wouldnt of been upset paying full price for it.			"

												Absolutely fantastic game but super heavy. Not for the faint of heart. All the stories are dark but Ellen's and Nimdok's were definitely more difficult to go through story wise. Only negative thing I can think of is, as many other point and clicks, some of the puzzles have really weird solutions that, when you finally figure them out, still don't make much sense. Highly recommend you play this and then read the actual short story.			"

												Below is a short review on why I recommend the game, but if you would like to read more about the game, you can follow this link[lyonfacedblog.wordpress.com] to read a more fleshed out and relatively spoiler free review of the game as well as how it compares to the original short story the game is based on.------I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream is a story that is relatively timeless, and has many psychologically terrifying and does well to exploit our deep-seated fears as human beings. Each character's psyche and story is unique, and the mechanisms that lead you through each of their exploits, as well as the final chapter, serve to not only deepen the characteristics of each individual as well as the lore, but lets the player learn more about these inherent fears, and possibly even something about themselves.While the mechanics are fairly basic as well as the hidden ""moral"" system, it is still an enjoyable and interesting ride, especially considering the ability to have multiple endings. The point-and-click genre of games is fairly known for having obtuse puzzles every now and then, and this one is no expection, but taking into account that the ultimate ""good"" ending in the game was suppose to virtually unreachable, it serves a purpose. The pixel graphics are still very well crafted, and the music and sound design are to be expected from this era.			"

												A classic point and click loosely based on the short story by Harlan Ellison. The music is good, the voice acting ranges from average to excellent, with Ellison himself as the voice of AM. The game is very open-ended, with multiple paths through most of the scenarios, and multiple endings.The puzzles are a mixed bag. The logical stuff is simple enough, but the metaphorical stuff can be cryptic.Honestly, the worst part of this game is the sequence breaking, often happening to the point that progress will be hindered or the game will be outright unbeatable if something is done out of order. I noticed this most prominently in Nimdok's stage, with the watch, and in smaller cases during the other scenarios. At the least, it will cause confusing situations, such as having one event trigger another, unrelated event. At its worst, you could end up saving in a bad spot that requires starting the game over from scratch to have another chance. Of course, the game is short if you know what you're doing, so making up lost progess like that is a matter of minutes, but it's still annoying and frustrating.Other than that, this is one of the finest translations of story to video game I've ever played, even if this version is changed, and quite embellished.

												I used to love point and click adventure games when I was younger, but as time went on and I played consoles a lot more, I kind of lost interest in them.  Well, I’ve started getting back in to them lately and this was one that I always had on my radar but never actually got round to playing.  I found this as part of a deal and decided to give it a go.  I’m glad that I did.The game is extremely dark in nature, with some edgy themes going on.  It has all the standard point and clickiness of similar games of the genre, except you can chose between 5 different characters to play as, each with their own storyline to finish.The voice acting is surprisingly good for this type of game.  In fact, I wasn’t expecting it to have any before I bought it, so that was already a big bonus for me.  Also, the graphics are rather nice as well, for an old-school game, that is.I’ve noticed a couple of bugs in it though, where I seemingly cant finish Benny’s story, possibly because I've done something in the wrong order.  Also, it freezes every now and again.  But to be honest, it hasn’t really bothered me; I still really enjoy the game.I’d totally recommend this game if you are in to 90’s point and click adventures, and like a bit of an edgy story to go with it.Go buy it!

												The best adventure games I have ever played. From the title you should probably guess that this game is very twisted and dark witch it is. However it is not just there for shock value this game is all about redemption and taking responsibility for your actions which makes it even more haunting, The crazy good writing makes this game get under your skin. The voice acting and audio design holds up very well surprisingly for a game as old as this. This game just dethroned fatal frame and silent hill 2 as the scariest game I have ever played.  Most of the puzzles can be figured out by logic but by no means is this an easy adventure game.  Almost all items are in plan site and the game never devolves into a pixel hunt. The multiple endings are cleverly put together as well. The only problem I have with this game is that you can get into states where you can't progress an have to re-load a save. Make sure you save at the beginning of every new chapter. And it's inconstant on how to go through doors (sometimes you click walk to door or some doors you have to click use door).If you are a sci-fi or horror fan or if you just like adventure games and have a strong stomach you really have to play this game.

Fans of Beneath A Steel Sky, Shadowrun, A Mind Forever Voyaging, cyberpunk, Harlan Ellison, Philip K♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc. will love this.  It's also probably not for children or anyone who thinks a game should always be happy and fun.  It's honestly pretty depressing, but also impressively ambitious.  Could be seen a distasteful, problematic, or triggering (the plot involves sexual assault), but highly recommended for anyone interested in games as a ""serious"" artistic medium.			"

												Aaaaah, I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream.  Now I must be honest, when I first played this game a few years ago, it actually made me scared and I stayed up because the bad ending scared the ever living s*** out of me.  But then again, I was big wuss back then so...yeah.  Anyways, IHNMAIMS is probably hands down my favorite point and click game ever...okay next to Gabriel Knight it is...because Tim Curry is a god among men....<_< don't you judge me.  Anyways, IHNMAIMS is almost everything I ever wished for in a Point and Click game; a good UI, an amazing storyline, well thought out puzzles and great characters.  IHNMAIMS follows the story of 5 people who have been tortured by a giant super computer built by America, Russia and China; known only by the name AM.  For over 100 years AM has tortured these people and has decided to play a game with them.  Each character must go through a series of tasks.  Now, this is where the game gets pretty unique.  As each character goes through their trials, each one must overcome something from their past that has troubled them.  The game also relies on something that I like about this game, it relies on actually doing right or wrong.  Each character will be faced with choices that will either reflect positively or negatively on their actions.  All in all, this game is probably something I could recommend to any fan of Psychological Horror or Point and Click games. Have fun :D			"

												This has to be one of the most riveting titles I have played in a long time. 5/5While some of the mechanics are a bit dated and gameplay wasn't exactly as fast-pace and full of action as we have become accustomed to, I couldn't recall a single dull moment. The driving force here is story. The character development and rich ""lore"" (so to speak), will leave you begging for more. Every little piece ties in together so neatly. This is the healthiest adventure title i have played to date. It ultimately combines science fiction, philosophy, psychology, and exploration into the tightest package. Morally ambiguous choices, and a helping of gory disgusting imagery, coupled with what i believe to be an amazing soundtrack really drives this piece forward. You cant help but wonder how such an old game slips under your radar. I do not want to spoil much of this title so I will keep this as vague as possible. Its an absolutely brilliant game, based off of a short story nonetheless, and its multiple endings and branching paths will keep you entertained. I highly recommend this to any person who enjoys a great story and can stomach some gross imagery. The symbolism and amounts of self-interpretation alone can give this game a solid score, but with everything else it deserves a solid 5.			"

												This must be the most disturbing game I have ever played. I've clocked only 3 hours and I still think I've played it on more than ten occasions. It's a simple point and play game but the stories of the playable characters are something unusual. The playable characters are playthings of a sick-minded omnipotent supercomputer and have to survive His games.The playable characters are some kind of tormented individuals or fun-to-torment individuals. For example depressed man, who just dreams of dying and killing himself, and his point and click adventure tries to attain this goal. Another one is an old senile doctor, oblivious his past, who in his younger days was  best friends with some guy called Mengele with whom he used to do medical research. His adventure goes back to those more glorious child-dissecting days.Would I recommend this game and for whom? The question in the context of IHNMAIMS is extremely funny... For whom I'd recommend taking voluntarily taking this mentally anguishing expererience? Don't know, but I'd probably recommend taking it as a mandatory curriculum in high schools.			"

												Eh, this game is okaay.  On the recommendation scale, if -10 is ""actively seek out and destroy all copies"" and 10 is ""stockpile several backups so the world never loses it"", then I Have No Mouth is like.........1..........maybe 2......LIke, the story is really interesting, and the symbolism is downright unsettling, and it's super cool to learn about all these characters and their backstory!But even for a point-&-click, there is SO MUCH GUESSING!!  Much of this game is symbolism, which means a lot of randomly trying stuff with other stuff before realizing you're supposed to take one of the inedible fruit and bury it over your friend's grave to convince his talking headstone that you're a more compassionate man.......That being said, it is a really cool story to play through, even if you shamelessly use a guide.

												The game holds up fairly well, and Harlan Ellison's writing is as great as ever in this psychological horror from 1996.While it does show its age in a few spots (mainly the morality system which feels incredibly obtuse) it's worth checking out- especially if you enjoy games with a good story. The acting is top notch with Harlan himself playing the main antagonist with surprisingly effective results. The rest of the cast is fine as well, and the writing is well done. I think a lot of that had to do with how much Harlan Ellis was involved with the actual production.If you haven't played it, ever, check it out. You won't regret it. It's cheaply priced, decently lengthed, and will leave you with a lot to think about. This game should have been much more popular when it originally came out.			"

												I loved the original short story but it seemed to start and finish in a flash.  The game is best thought of as a visual novella expanding on the book.  It's creepy and captures the atmosphere built by the original author.  If you read the book and wanted to explore more of that universe than this game is for you.A throwback to the simpler times of gaming where point-and-click adventure games ruled.  The gameplay is surprisingly smooth for such an old game and the only difficulty setting is ""unforgiving"" so don't be upset if you utterly lose multiple times before getting just one part of the game down.

												Most video games attack tough moral questions and present important life lessons with the grace, subtlety, and objectivity of a BET comic performing in Austin, Texas on the anniversary of September 11th. Ham-fisted political opinions draw you right out of a game, and just about any sort of perspective from the developer is only worthy of an eye-roll and a groan. This particular game is not of that variety.This game, based on the post-apocalyptic sci-fi short story by Harlan Ellison, is the paragon of point-and-click 90s adventure games. If you fondly reminisce about these kinds of games, you will not be disappointed. This is just about the perfect game you can purchase to satisfy your nostalgia kick. If you aren't familiar, this is the perfect way to introduce yourself to a piece of video game history. In this game, you play as five deep characters with different issues and personalities. To complete the game, you need to solve a series of problems they encounter in scenarios presented by the main antogonist, who you'll surely be introduced to soon enough. The puzzles require a sharp eye and creative mind to complete, with the endings entirely determined by how well you performed each chapter. Although some parts are not very intuitive, vigilance is key and well worth the effort.More important than the puzzles is the setting, which becomes an integral part of the story. Each character's setting is incredibly important to understanding the character themselves, and the effort put forth to creating such a deep game is apparent from minor details to the themes themselves. Some of the topics covered seem to have pretty obvious ""correct opinions"":♥♥♥♥♥♥is wrong, infidelity only leads to heartbreak, Dr. Mengele isn't someone you invite to your twins' birthday party, etc. With this comes important themes contingent throughout all stories, ranging from forgiveness to perseverance and chivalry. To appreciate all of the effort the developers and original author put into every intricate piece of the software, I would highly suggest taking your time and not rushing from one decision to the next. Carefully move forward, because like a lot of 90s games, this game will punish you for failure as harshly as it can.This game has a few minor flaws, and appeals to a certain demographic of players. These things can really turn some people off of a game entirely, but I would wager 75% of people who purchase this game will love it and 24% of people who purchase this game will at least appreciate the experience. It is worth every cent.			"

""I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream"" is by far one of the grimmest point & click adventures ever made.The five characters you'll play with and their associated settings are all different from each other and very diverse. Each character has it's own psychological traits and problems to solve. There is an old Nazi doctor working in a concentration camp, an IT specialist with fear of the colour yellow, an old war veteran coping with his crimes while on duty, and two other characters. The background story will leave all fans of postapocalyptic robocalypses in awe and is demanding when it comes to upcoming problems on dealing with supercomputers and AI. You'll make make a lot of mistakes during the course of the game which will lead to instant death or delayed problems in the endgame (don't forget to save frequently!). It has also quite a lot of replay value and lots of different endings. Final verdict: 9/10 "

												I can't believe I'm playing a game older than myself yet still feel intrigued.Supervised by the original story writer himself, this is more of an interactive story than a point-and-click game. Every actions you take, every decisions you make, will affect the outcome (and ultimately the fate of each characters). With multiple ending you can try to get the ideal happy ending, book's canon ending, or even new endings not implied in the book.Story and narration wise, it's like someone is reading a book for you. You can just take it easy and enjoy the narration, but considering it is interactive, you must think before choosing your actions. Also do take note it's a horror story, but instead of cheap jumpscares common in today's horror genre, this game gives you the tension to always keep you on edge. ""Did I do it right?"" ""Am I doing something wrong?"" ""What am I supposed to do to not mess everything up?""Overall, a great game if you're into reading. Will definitely play again to get all endings.			"

												I recommend this game for anyone who like post apocalyptic adventure games because that's what it is. Ihose who like Sci Fi especially by Harlan Ellison would like this too as it's based on a short story of the same name by the same guy. Don't worry, if you read the short story it won't spoil the game for you. :) It's a looser interpretation. Throughout the whole game, one points and clicks through several simulations for each of several characters which are essentially non linear levels. To beat the game you have to play them all successfully but in any order you like. The GUI and art are nice especially for the time. They are very detailed so it feels more like watching an ascii painting unfold before you than an 8 bit retro adventure. You have several options for interacting with your world. (Talk, Walk, Look, Use, Eat) I personally haven't noticed any game breaking glitches, it's well programmed imo. Each simulation delves deeply into the characters past. The object of the game, the way to escape, is basically to confront the characters demons and conclude the narrative. There is a small morality system in place where the games ending is affected by how well your character did dealing with their past and flaws. Or if you simply make a mistake in surviving the simulation itself you are transported back to your torture box. Sometimes these narratives approach disturbing topics like♥♥♥♥♥♥ genocide, human sacrifice. However I wouldn't say the game itself is particularly disturbing or scary, it has more of a sense of dread and whatever atmosphere the setting you are placed in creates atmosphere. The music and sound are okay. The voice acting is pretty good actually, but it does have it's hammy moments.The puzzles aren't really normal puzzles. They're more like symbolic puzzles. There's this sequence where you kill some animals, and have to wipe your hands clean before you can progress in Gorrister's simulation. One wouldn't immediately think of that, but from a narrative standpoint it totally makes sense. It definitely shows that Harlan Ellison wrote this game. This is a unique, moving experience with beautiful ascii graphics. Get it :)			"

												This is one of the ABSOLUTE BEST point and click games from this era. I have heard complaints about how it's too difficult, requiring random clicking, and, yeah... I understand that. But the thing is, I don't know of a single PAC from before 2000 that WASN'T like that. It's just a blessing that the internet exists, making it a lot easier to enjoy these games. I realize that this does feel shameful, but what I do with old fashioned PAC games like this, along with the original Kings Quest games and Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, is I have a walkthorugh on standby. I understand that a game shouldn't be so stupidly difficult that this is nessicary to enjoy the game, but this game was made 20 years ago, before a lot of developers truely understood game design. But, I do agree that this game is unbelievably, unreasonably, difficult.But, the reason this game is worth buying, even though you'd need to constantly read a walkthrough, is because it's hauntingly creative. It's based off the short story by Harlan Ellison, and even has him voice acting as the main villian, this goes through punishments of the 5 people left on Earth, at the utter submission of an evil, all-knowing, computer. Some of these characters are deeply flawed, while some others didn't really do anything wrong, but it's still interesting to witness every characters living hell.This game is also very dark, bringing up issues like domestic violence,♥♥♥♥♥♥ murder, the Holocaust, and, although this was cut out from the game, you can watch cutscenes on Youtube that were taken out; like one of the main characters becoming so overwhelmed with hunger, he eats live baby. Absolutely not for the faint of heart, but an absolute must for anyone who is a devout horror fan.			"

												I have thoroughly enjoy I Have No Mouth, and I must Scream as it has handles some very mature subject matter that makes many a modern game look like a Disney adventure, it works well on Linux, the graphics are still passable for this day and age and it doesn't suffer from pixel-hunting as much as games of the same generationUnfortunately, there are a few things wrong with it: the game is extremely buggy. I can easily make it crash or perform actions that are seemingly not intended to be performed (yet). You can also rather easily break your save game, forcing you to replay some or all adventures over again. Whatever you do, always make sure you have more than one save-game going and save often.You can also -die- in this game which forces you to restart the current adventure. Luckily, the game will let you know when this happens. It's a minor nuisance in comparison to breaking your save game and trying to figure out what to do for hours on end.The game also has a tendency to 'spawn' items that weren't there before and 'locks' certain actions so you can only do them when the time is right. This is confusing because sometimes it doesn't and lets you perform actions prematurely, causing the aforementioned problem of breaking your game. And you might not think of performing an action again because you have already done so five times and it didn't work the first 5 times and the feedback given to you seems to indicate that it is simply not possible. Until it suddenly is. I was forced to use a walkthrough on a number of occasions: one involved pixel-hunting and the two other occasions involved me saving the game after I had made irreversible choices without the game telling me I had lost the game. Then there was the part about selecting the right character for the end-phase first otherwise you might ... You guessed it! Break your savegame.If you can live with all of the above, IHNMaIMS is for you. If you are easily frustrated and think point 'n' click games shouldn't break your savegame; look elsewhere.			"

												I've wanted to play this game for a while and never got the chance when it was originally released. Yes it's a little dated. Yes there are dead ends.Ensure yousave often with several progress save files so you can undo mistakes.This game was a lot shorter than I thought it would be, but it was enjoyable and kept me occupied for several hours.I can't stress this enough; save several times with several files or you'll have to stat over if you mess up.Definitely recommned			"

I got this as I loved both the dark seeds games.The game will make you thing and question humanity and what is going on in your life. It is great and I really do recoomend it to people if they like The Dig, Dark Seed or Dark Seed 2.The game has very cotroversial isses including♥♥♥♥♥♥ sposal abuse, the holocaust etc.			"

												Disclaimer:  This is a 30-minute ""first impressions"" review, and I haven't read the source material yet.So far, not enjoying it--and I'm a fan of point-and-clicks of that time period (Death Gate was amazing).  The characters simply don't seem believable to me for people who have been tortured for a century--but I suppose that their attitudes may be part of AM's technological torture algorithm, so I can overlook it for now.  The ""mature"" themes seem anything but--Nimdok's adventure starts as an anvilicious[tvtropes.org] trip down Nazi lane.  Some anvils need to be dropped, but it's the execution (ouch) that counts, and IHNMAIMS's presentation is so poor that it does the message a disservice, like really bad satire.The real showstoppers are the bugs--things disappearing from my inventory, items invisibly reappearing in their original location, and so on.  I can't tell if the game keeps leaving me in Unwinnable by Design[tvtropes.org] or Unwinnable by Mistake[tvtropes.org] situations because I can't tell whether my inventory got screwed intentionally.I'm gonna sit this one on the back burner for a bit before trying it again.  Maybe it's better if you don't start with Nimdok.			"

												Below is a short review on why I recommend the game, but if you would like to read more about the game, you can follow this link[lyonfacedblog.wordpress.com] to read a more fleshed out and relatively spoiler free review of the game as well as how it compares to the original short story the game is based on.------I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream is a story that is relatively timeless, and has many psychologically terrifying and does well to exploit our deep-seated fears as human beings. Each character's psyche and story is unique, and the mechanisms that lead you through each of their exploits, as well as the final chapter, serve to not only deepen the characteristics of each individual as well as the lore, but lets the player learn more about these inherent fears, and possibly even something about themselves.While the mechanics are fairly basic as well as the hidden ""moral"" system, it is still an enjoyable and interesting ride, especially considering the ability to have multiple endings. The point-and-click genre of games is fairly known for having obtuse puzzles every now and then, and this one is no expection, but taking into account that the ultimate ""good"" ending in the game was suppose to virtually unreachable, it serves a purpose. The pixel graphics are still very well crafted, and the music and sound design are to be expected from this era.			"

A great merge between Point and Click and horror that keeps some of the charm with old adventure games while being mature and downright depressing at times.+ Dark atmosphere, captures the feeling in the novel (That is included with the game)+ A sadistic AI!+/- Very challenging puzzles (think 'Monkey Island' difficulty here)- Sometimes the objectives are unclear			"

The gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be but this is a game made in 1995 so it's understandable. Also the perfect ending is very difficult to reach without a walkthrough. This game also comes with the original short story in the game folder. I definitely must read it even if I had no eyes.			"

												Difficult, obtuse and unforgiving.Sometimes solving the puzzles can take hours of retrying things to behave exactly the way that AM wants you to, but when you find the light it becomes very satisfying.This is a game that outdoes the short story it is based on. While the short story is quite interesting, the game fleshes out all the characters, creates a better understanding of what the story could have been.My only issue is the voice acting, and while I understand why Harlan Ellison would want to be AM, it takes me out of the moment.I wish that someone would remake this game with time-neutral dialogue, newer voice acting and updated graphics. If remade, this game could become even more of a dark and meaningful masterpiece it already is. I enjoyed playing it, and would like newer generations to also enjoy it, but I feel that certain aspects of the game will turn off future audiences.Which is too bad, because the story is amazing.Yes, I recommend it. Play this game.			"

												I'd heard about this game for a long time and now I've finally had the chance to play it. Put simply: it's awesome! The atmosphere, the story, the puzzles, all of them combine to give you the feeling that something's off about everything. It's horror in the sense of Frankenstein in that it's more psychological. If you're into story and puzzles, this is a must. If you're into engaging, intense gameplay, try it anyways. It's gotta be one of  the best point-and-click games out there, so here are some pros and cons.Pros-Great storytelling with intriguing characters that are made more so by their flaws.-The music and art style, though maybe outdated, ages well and contributes well to the atmosphere.-Good replayability, you can play the individual segments in any order you like and choice plays a fairly large role.-There is more than one ending you can get depending on what you decide.-You can generally interact with most things in any given scene, even if your character just examines.Cons-The music and graphics may be a bit out-of-date for some, though I personally feel they age well.-Most choices don't affect the game overall even if they impact a particular character on a major level and bring them closer to redemption, but this is a minor complaint.So not really anything I can complain about. The characters can be deep or shallow depending on how you play them. The main antagonist is great - you don't often get sentient AI that are so humanlike in their insanity and pain. Overall, if you haven't played this game, you should. No exceptions.			"

												This game is an all time great. Based on the short story of the same name, I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream is a truly terrifying tale that captures the anguish of the characters and the terror of the situations that they are put through. This game has excellent puzzles, especially the endgame scenario, in which there are hundreds of ways to complete it.The graphics have aged well, although some animation has some quirks in it that are noticeable, as well as some small bugs. Other than that, though, the game is fantastic. Harlan Ellison voicing AM is great, and you can fell the characters' pain through their dialogue. This game is gory, suspenseful, and philosophical, and it really makes you think about life and death, as well as space and time.			"

												I've first lais my hands on this shortly after it was released originally. And, being a youngish teenager at the time, it presented me with nightmares. The intended audience is clearly more mature than I was then.In sharp contrast to it's rival at the thime (The Darkseed series) it has a much more forgiving gameplay - you die and the God-Machine rescues you - though you also lose all progress done with that character so far.Yes, you are playing several characters, each with a dark secret to uncover. Each with a different falvour. Each story interlaced. Well, I've got it as soon as I discovered it on Steam. Still didn't get through it completely. The graphics may have aged, the interface is classic point and click, but the narration... The author of the story is voicing AM, the big machine antagonist. According to your actions, the chapters may play differently - and the ending is dependent of the ""Karma"" system - and therefore by your choices. Or so I've heard. I'm returning to this game rather regularly and I still didn't get it to the end ;)It is one of the greates Point&Click adventures in my eyes, so I recommend it for the ""Test of time"" category in the 2016 Steam awards.

												I got this on Sale for $1.5 but For $4.99 this game is well worth the pice! The game is a throw back to the 90's point n click adventure that we grew up on and love so much.Most likely you've not heard of this game before (like me) but its really well put together. its kinda choppy and kinda sloppy in some parts, but its redeeming qualities outweigh its flaws.  its very well written/scripted, although the puzzle elements are simple and reveal themselves fairly easily,not too too challenging as far as point n clicks go ( puzzles aren't super obtuse ) . The graphics are dated butclassic, and the animation is passable, nothing about the game felt like they "" tried too hard "" although the areasare small maybe 7 rooms within each scenario total, it limits the amount of pointless wandering that leaves you frustraited when you've felt you've exhausted all 'puzzle-item' combinations. if you get stuck you have a 'psychological profile' book in the inventory that gives you a blatantly obvious clueof what to do next.... BIG HINT on gameplay - Talk to the characters, (multiple times some times) to progress.on the negative side the game does have ""game killing glitches "" / unwinnable scenarios. The best way to Circumvent being perma-stuck is to keep a save file at the ""Character Select Screen"" and never overwrite that save. also Keep alternating Saves (or never overwrite a save) so you can go back before the error happened... ( like not talking with a key character / or using an item that removed it, when you still needed it for something else )also there are some actions you will have to perform repetatively, even though you know you are doing the taskcorrectly... But um Despite the flaws, its a REALLY cool game, i feel kinda sad i missed it growing up, but then i feelits cool because now i can appreciate an undiscovered authentic 90's gaming experience as an adult.

												I loved this game as a kid, and I love this game now. It's brilliantly written, and gorgeously messed up in it's own way. It's a point-and-click puzzle adventure, published in 1995, that explores the storylines of five people, all very different from the last. Everyone's storyline is fantastic, and I recommend them all. It doesn't take long to play through, but it's worth it the whole way.I will warn though, that this psychological thriller has very sensitive topics, such as insanity, paranoia,♥♥♥♥♥♥ and genocide. If it starts causing incredible discomfort, I would recommend stopping, and seeking emotional guidance, as it will likely only become worse.To anyone who does enjoy this game, I would also recommend reading Harlan Ellison's short story of the same title, first published in March of 1967. It's very well written, and very enjoyable to those interested in this sort of dark psychological literature.			"

												One of my new favorites. Its a sad, dark, and challenging game that will make you think. It teaches good morals, especially Gorrister and Benny, and the final level. The music is great and so are the themes of the unique characters. I grew up with point and click games like Pajama Sam, so if you enjoy games like that, youll have lots of fun with this game. I dont like them much anymore but the interesting story kept me moving through it. I only experienced one bug, though i feel like some of the bugs in other reviews are just people getting confused, because the game is more unforgiving then even the hardest games iv played. Just save often. Also, the book comes free in the game files wich is an extra plus!			"
