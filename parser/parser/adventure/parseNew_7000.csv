												At the tender age of 9 years old, Lara Croft and her mother Amelia, survive a plane crash in the Himalayan mountains. Taking refuge in an old monastery, young Lara, already with an adventurous heart, discovers a stone dais with an ancient sword in it. This triggers an event that leads to her mother disappearance, and is the premise to Tomb Raider Legend.This was the first Tomb Raider developed by Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Interactive switched the development of the next Tomb Raider game away from Core Design (the studio was shut down a little while after this decision) after the poorly received Angel of Darkness failed in the eyes of most Tomb Raider fans, and professional critics.Tomb Raider Legend was/is an excellent Tomb Raider game, with the perfect balance between puzzle solving and combat, and an intricate story that mixes myth and marries it with real exotic locations to explore. Graphics wise, this is a game from 2006, but it holds very well to this day. The textures are well detailed and the particle system and animations are particularly impressive. The music in the game is on par with other Tomb Raider titles, which means that it's very good as well. Orchestrated music that kicks in at the right time to give an extra dose of suspense never gets old, and it's classic Tomb Raider in that regard. New mechanics were also introduced this time around. Lara now has the ability to slow down time versus human enemies, but you can only use it when at a real close range by double pressing the jump button. When it's active time slows down and your aiming is more precise and you can target and damage more than one enemy if you are fast enough. A flashlight was also introduced and you can manually turn it on or off, and it is essencial in dark areas. You can carry only 3 medkits at any given time, and you can choose to use them whenever the situation calls for it. The amount of weapons you can carry is limited to only 2, your dual pistols and an extra slot for whichever weapon you want to carry. For the first time in a Tomb Raider game, you can pick up weapons from your fallen enemies, and there is some variation to them, from a shotgun, to an SMG, a rifle and a grenade launcher, plus a surprise weapon close to the end of the game. Another franchise first is the abbility to carry grenades. The binoculars are also very important, specially for helping you out with puzzle solving, with the ability to enter RAD mode and identify movable objects, destructable structures and mechanisms. The characters and voice acting in the game are top notch. The script is well written and very well executed by the voice actors. They do a great job with emotions, the way the lines are delivered and acted make you feel in empathy with the characters, either it's a dramatic moment, or a cheerful one. Lara is not alone in this adventure, as her companions Zip and Allister always provide insight and advice through her intercom. These characters are not particularly deep, but they serve their purpose well and without getting in the way. Lara however is not the only true ""deep"" character in the game, as some characters have real motivations as well (can't really say much more without spoiling it to anyone) that make perfect sense in terms of story.The puzzles in the game are logical and challenging for the most part, without ever becoming frustrating. The combat is fun, but the controls are a little clunky, and the enemy A.I apart from boss fights is just way too easy and not all that great. There is some texture distortion on this particular PC version, but it is rare and does not detract from the experience. I have read that some people have had some issues with this game under modern Operating Systems, but having played the game on Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit, I never encountered any issues or crashes of any sort. It runs like a charm on my OS. Also worthy of mention, and in my opinion a negative aspect of this version is the lack of the Steam overlay, meaning you will not be able to shift+tab to access the steam community while playing, your only option is to alt+tab, and doing so never caused the game to crash for me. There is a workaround to this issue, so I am told, but I did not try it out, and therefore can't really say anything on that aspect.Tomb Raider Legend is an amazing Tomb Raider game. While not perfect, it is well worth playing. For it's current price, it's a steal (even more so when it goes on sale, it can go as low as 1,50$) and well worth it. The game is a little short compared to other Raider games, but it is a fun and thrilling ride from start to finish.8/10The Good   Graphics still hold out well todayLifelike animation, truly great music and sound effectsVoice acting and story are top notchSome extra stuff to unlock which adds replayabilityGood selection of guns, fun and logical puzzles, exotic and mystical locations to exploreChallenging Boss fightsMotorcycle sections are funThe Bad Some texture distortionCombat is a little clunkyEnemy A.I is not very smartNo Steam overlay without a fix			"

												From all the Tomb Raider games, this one is my personal most favourite! I have played the game before I had Steam account, when I got Steam account and I even have the game in Box DVD version.I love everything.Really.This is the first Tomb Raider that I play it with such a joy and happiness.The model of Lara Croft is gorgeous! Many years after the release, she looks amazing! When you enter water and come outside, she will be wet and will dry in time, but the effect is awesome! Her outfits are cute and they fit her body perfectly!She is really a strong woman, because of her skills and great mind! This is how real women should look like. She is deadly and if you are a bad person, she will put you in the right place.The level design of the game is awesome!From jungle terrain, to village in the desert to the snowly mountains and underground caves- there is much variety.Some of the puzzels could be challenging to you, if you are new to the game, but overall, they are not hard, and they are enjoyable so you will have fun with them!Climb, run, jump, shoot- you will do everything! Nothing is more badass than riding a motor-bike on top of skyscrapers. The sounds and the music is in very high level. Your ears and brain will like them very much.The environment is awesome and you can interact with it to achieve your goals.There are hidden and not so hidden artefacts in the game and collectables for you to find and collect.I would gladly play this game many more times in the future!

												Tomb Raider Legend was the return of the TR series after Eidos had successfully torpedoed it into the garbage can during the PS2 Generation. It's the first game in the series by Crystal Dynamics, and the big difference between it and the originals is the style of platforming. It no longer uses tank controls and the grid/tile based movement that the originals did, but rather goes for more like a Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (and it's sequels) style of platforming. It's the only game of the Crystal series that they were able to go with a bit more of a lighthearted tone, so it leans heavily into the James Bond style globetrotting adventure, with the headset banter from your assistants. The levels are pretty good, with the standouts being Japan and England. The downsides are the combat sequences that are too frequent for a TR game, and some overlong motorcycle sequences that are in there to break up the pace. The majority of the game though is still based around puzzle solving and platforming which is what I wanted from a TR game.			"

												Probably the most loved of all Tomb Raider games. Her popularity declined after Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness, but Legend for sure brang her back to the top. With 5 million copies within the first year, this is one of the best Tomb Raider games, revolutionary and a great come back for the iconic Lara Croft.			"

												I think the game looks better with next gen content off. You can go in and delete the keyboard mappings and leave controller mappings to fix tutorial text. No achievements or steam overlay. A variety of costumes are available for unlock during stage replaying. It's a nice throwback to ye old days. Wish more good old console games got Steam ports.			"

Legend has it that the fabled Tomb Raider series was doomed to a life of purgatory, after the unfortunate creation of a buggy, rushed but well-meaning mess of a game called ""The Angel of Darkness"", and the franchise was to remain stagnant for many eons. Alas, a hero named ""Crystal Dynamics"" emerged, and a mere 3 years after Core Design's unsightly and depressing demise, brought Lara Croft back to life. The name of their triumphant return? The short, but incredibly sweet, Tomb Raider: Legend.Oh, how I love this game. It got me into the Tomb Raider series way back when it was released in 2006. I'd dabbled in the older entries on the PlayStation but could never beat them (until recently that is. Check out my reviews for them! No shameful self-promotion here!), but Legend piqued my interest in the series and alas, $20 later, I have the entire series on Steam. And what a brilliant way to start again. Tomb Raider: Legend is precisely what Lara Croft needed: a beautiful, seamless and user-friendly transition to the (then) next generation of gaming. The majority of Tomb Raider's lore is retconned, but the essentials are all here. We still (of course) have Lara Croft, and man, has she recieved a facelift. And a boob job. And a butt job. I'm gay and even I can't stop staring at her. She's still the kickass, no-nonsense, incredibly acrobatic, academic and elegant explorer who we've come to know and love. And the same applies to the gameplay; you still raid tombs, you still discover hidden treasures while globetrotting, and shoot the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of bad guys and angry cats. All in a beautiful new engine.Man, this game is pretty. It just looks phenomenal. It has a unique, semi-cartoonish style in terms of character models, but the environments are bursting with detail and realism, and the use of effects like bloom and motion blurs are used just enough not to take away from the experience. Textures are crisp, ragdolls are hilariously bouncy, animations are smoother than jelly, and the detail is immaculate. The first time Lara emerged from water, actually visably wet and her clothes drenched, I was in awe.It sounds amazing, too. The effort that went into the soundtrack is very admirable. Troels Brun Folmann has crafted a dynamic, unique to each level musical score which only adds to the already excellent atmosphere. Voice acting is also great, a tad unbelievable but very cinematic. Keeley Hawes brings a regal and more mature tone to Lara which I was very glad to hear.Plot-wise, it's good! I mean, nothing really new or special here. It's the typical ""artifact in multiple pieces go around the world to collect them and then something happens when they're all together then boss battle"". But there are some lovely villains, there's traitors, there's emotion, there's consistency, and there's enough to keep you interested in what's going on. I don't think as much effort was put in here as in The Angel of Darkness, but it works and it wraps up nicely, hinting at a sequel without resorting to an irritating cliffhanger. That said, the research that Crystal Dynamics did into ancient lore, such as that of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, do give the story a lot more depth.The gameplay itself? Stellar. It feels so incredibly natural when Lara is rope-swinging, vaulting, shimmying, dodging, shooting, pole-climbing, swimming, and even riding a Ducati™ (yes, there's product placement) motorcycle. The levels are incredibly varied, and I don't miss the older blocky engine one iota. Movement and combat is far less restrictive, control is pitch-perfect, and the addition of Lara's grappling hook adds a lot more than one would think to the game. It's very smooth and well done. There's also tons of unlockables, which I absolutely LOVE. What happened to unlockables?! There's (many) costumes, weapon upgrades, art, models, cheats and a video to unlock, and all this encourages replayability.Which brings me to the few negative points I have about this game. My main gripe is the length: there are only eight levels in Tomb Raider: Legend (nine, if you count Lara's Mansion, which makes a welcome return), and even with the added collectibles and time trials for each level, the game is over quickly, especially for people who don't care about 100% completion. The fact that it's quite easy (regardless of the difficulty setting) also adds to this; the game is constantly providing you with tutorials, even in the sixth level of the game, and you can utilise Lara's magical binoculars to help you solve puzzles (none of which are remotely complex).The game is also buggy from time to time, mostly in the visual department. I noticed this especially in Kazakhstan, during a motorcycle section in which areas of the map were simply missing or transparent. Turning on ""Next-Generation Content"" in the video settings adds dynamic lighting and better textures, but kills the framerate (sometimes regardless of your gaming setup) and throws even more glitches into the mix, including misaligned ropes and distorted faces, and even crashing the game on some levels.One final thing: Lara's new sidekicks bug me, a lot. They just don't shut the hell up. ""Watch out Lara!"" ""Wow Lara, that was great!"" ""Whoa, I don't like the look of this!"". Even Lara herself gets audibly annoyed with them. It's totally nitpicking on my part but I feel it's a valid criticism. Just shut the hell up Zip and Alister! She doesn't need your help!Do I recommend this game? Absolutely. Legend was the start of something new, a rebirth that Tomb Raider so desperately needed. After Legend came onto the scene, the equally awesome Anniversary, Underworld, Guardian of Light and the 2013 re-imagining followed suit. What an excellent way to get us exploring again!4/5			"

												This is a bit of a lengthy review, but I would reccomend that you read it before purchasing the game.Tomb Raider legend was the first tomb raider game to be developed by new studio crystal dynamics. After Tomb Raider: The Angel of darkness, Core Design was banned from creating Tomb Raider games, and eidos wanted to continue the series. Most people hated the Tomb Raider franchise when this game was released, and the franchise still exists today, meaning this game is worth playing.Graphics - 7/10For a game released in 2006, it has decent graphics. Even though technology was advanced, the developers wanted to make the pc port have the same capabilities as the Playstation 2. Comepared to modern day games, the graphics may look poor, but they were really good for the time. If you have a more powerful PC, there is an option called ""Next-Gen Effects"" which upscales the textures, graphics, and object models to the same capabilities as an XBOX360. It is easy to see the difference when compared with the playstation 2. The water effects, foliage, and wildlife looks great along with walls floors, and celings. Lighting effects are decent, but nothing special, but the game renders at a smooth 40fps on my slow laptop.Gameplay - 8/10While Angel of Darkness consisted of slow animations and clunky controls, along with somewhat unplayable mechanics, Legend has certainly saved the franchise. In Legend, the Action-Adventure experience is fast paced, and animations are smooth and fluid. The player explores a vast range of environments, from the rooftops of Tokyo, Mountains of Nepal, and Peruvian Towns, and each has a certain colour scheme. More realism has been added; limit inventory space alows a maximum of 3 health packs, and up to 2 weapons. However, this has not made gameplay any worse. Gear is not upgraded throughout the game, and there is no skill system. The controls are a huge improvement compared to previous titles, but the water controls can be somewhat irritating. Combat is really easy, and the AI is not very intelligent. There are some powerful combination moves to kill enemies, which I would spoil, but are very satisfying. Platforming is done really well with a huge combination of moves. These include : vine climbing, pole swinging, flips and rolls. You will have a fun time manouvering around the environment. The biggest NEGATIVE about gameplay is that it is really easy and linear. I reccomend playing on the ""Hard"" difficulty at all times. The Gameplay is very linear, which I like, but some may not enjoy. Another NEGATIVE is that the game is incredibly short. It will give the player an average 5-6 hours of gameplay. Puzzles arecleverly designed, and use physics and objects in the environment, rather that flipping lots of switches. Boss fights are fun and satisfying, and require a strategy, even if they are somewhat easy. Overall, the gameplay is very fun and enjoyable.PC Port - 6/10The PC port is done very simply, but very well. The Player can adjust display options easily, via the in-game menu. There are many expected graphics settings, like  resolution, ect.... Graphics can also be adjusted externally , bur running "" Tomb Raider Legend: Setup"" from the steam launcher. One big defect is the fact that there is no windowed mode, but you can download 3rd party software for this.Extras - 8/10The game comes with a wide variety of extras/unlockables. These include Outfits, Character Profiles, Concept Arts ect... . However, it would have been nice to add achievements to the PC version of the game.Overall, this is a fantastic game, pulled together at the last minute. It is satisfying and fun, and reccomended if you are a Tomb Raider Fan, or a Newbie to the Series.I enjoyed playing this very much, especially now that Lara is a more likeable character.Satsit123 "

Introduction : Lara Croft's search for a South American relic changed course dramatically when she meets a dangerous figure from her past, and she finds herself in a race to recover one of history's most famous artifacts.(+)Graphics :  Graphics are like %100 better than any other Tomb Raider games released before TR:L .(+)Soundtrack :  Tracks are also amazing . It's not distracting or ear bleeding like many other action games out there .(+)Cinematics :  So much action going on over here with the cinematics . You can honestly see that Crystal Dynamics did some pretty fantastic job over here . (+)Story :  I don't want to give any spoilers here but the story is absolutely amazing . You'll be diving right into it the moment you start the first episode .(~)Content :  The content is a little too short , considering you didn't try to finish it %100 . Still , I think 7 - 8 hours is normal for such a game .(-)Controls :  Uggh .. Let's first acknowledge the fact that the controls in this game are far FAR better than any other TR games before this one . But they are still squishy . There were times that i spent 20 minutes finding my way to next area , or climbing that darn rope because Tomb Raider suddenly went blind when jumping off a cliff -.- . I guess you can say it's still pretty good considering the controls in earlier ones .(+)Gameplay :  The gameplay is pretty cool . I like how the auto-aim works which saves a lot of time . I also like how you can unlock new outfits by either collecting collectibles , or just simply finishing levels .Tomb Raider Legend is a reboot , and the game first Tomb Raider game not made by Core Design , So everything has been improved significantly . My opinion on this game is that it's definitely worth your money and time . You'll love this game if you're in to this kinda games .8/10 -   Triskelion Turbella Reviews   "

												Quick review:Short Verdict: Not the best, but a nice, relatively short TR game. Fans of the series will probably enjoy playing it. But there are better games of this genre. By the way, I had played it before, on my PS2, and I still enjoyed it again now.Pros: Nice level atmosphere, graphics and BGM Good puzzle levels The platforming part is enjoyable Great story Voice acting and characters are well done and developed Finding secrets and doing TTs add to the gameCons: Weak action/shooting It's TR, so be prepared to get frustrated because Lara decided she didn't want to grab on to something and fell to her death A bit short (100% in 6.5h of gameplay for me, no TTs) Next Generation caused the game to crash sometimes (solved with some tweaks, still used NG)Bought on / for: GreenMan Gaming for US$ 1.40. Yeah, it's worth it, even though it's old.			"

												I think I've finished this game 3 times before buying from Steam, years ago. I remember how fun to play this game.Scenes were beautiful, story was fascinating, always talking buddies were funny, a trip to Ghana suddenly becomes more exciting etc. You know what? After all these years, I still feel the same.Also using that motorcycle in the game was really healhty. It would help your career as a boxer by making you punch your screen, or you could work out by throwing your keyboard out of window, or simply practice speech by swearing a lot. You know what? After all these years, I still feel the same.Anyway, I highly recommend this game, because it's one of my favourites. If you like jumping, climbing and trying to find your way with little puzzles, like old fashion Tomb Raiders, this is your game. You won't regret it.			"

												When this game was released in 2006, I bought it just because of the box art. I hadn't had any experience playing Tomb Raider before the purchase. The box and the information on it were simply too appealing to miss, combined with a positive review in the local games magazine. What I discovered after installation blew me away. Amazing locales, greatly variable and adaptive soundtrack (some tracks are among my all-time favourites) and first-class animation that I hadn't seen before in a game. It didn't matter much to me that the level design and puzzles were all too linear and quite easy because I was fully immersed in this first next-gen Lara Croft rendition and didn't realize at that time that I'm playing ""just"" a fancy acrobatics simulator. But the developers tried hard to capture the feeling of world exploration in a limited level space mainly by the incredible vistas. As for the gameplay it's puzzle-heavy, with a terrible combat system (and some frustrating motorbike sections), but thankfully that doesn't take up much gameplay time. The boss fights are the most annoying thing about this game and they occur at the end of each level. Stylized collectibles are a plus. Gold collectibles are particularly difficult to obtain and will require you to tamper a bit with the puzzles. At the time of release the game wasn't optimized well, especially the surprisingly ugly next-gen mode, that changes the feeling of the game completely, though for the worse turn. I recommend playing with it turned off. The controls and camera are a bit wonky, but you can get used to it. A bonus Croft Manor level is nice but otherwise the game doesn't come with much replay value. 8/10			"

												Remember awful controls, and horrible gameplay?  Remember how Tomb Raider was all about breasts and butts, and had little substance?  The awful jumping puzzles and all? I started the game with all that in my head, and I was like ""ok I'll give this a couple hours"" About 7 hours later, I put down my controller and was pleasantly surprised.  Ok that's not entirely true either.  I had a major problem and almost gave up on this game as ""unplayable"" because the ""next gen features"" whatever they are, create a crash during a level.  I stopped playing without an intention of returning, but then I found out that turning off next gen features will allow you to skip that crash.  However outside of that crash I did have trouble putting the game down.  I had a really good time with the game.  It's not a near perfect tour de force as the ""Tomb Raider"" reboot was, but it isn't as big a train wreck as I remembered the series being.  I honestly think people played the original set of tomb raiders, and rarely tried the rest of the series, because up until Tomb Raider, I really don't remember many people saying positive things about this series. Now while this is a very good (even great) game, there's one thing that should be mentioned.  There are a few driving sections that are... to put it bluntly, awful.  Everything about these sections feel off.  The controls are straight out of 2000 or earlier  (Press up to go forward on a motorcycle).  The enemies, and collisions hurt too much, the shooting is weak, one of them is heavily timed, the other doesn't appear to be (or at least isn't as strict).  The challenge is high for all the wrong reasons, and overall they are one of the only areas I can say I hated.   The only good news about them is there's two or three of them and that's it.  Besides those driving sections, the game is an incredible exploration game.  What is especially great in my mind is there were a few puzzles I felt stumped at, where I literally didn't have a clue how to progress at first, and I had to use trial and error.   It's rare for a game to really stump me and this game had a perfect blend, where I felt stumped, but I was able to puzzle it out.  I often felt I knew what was and wasn't possible, and had a clue how to solve the puzzle, but at the same time the solution wasn't laid out for me, and that was refreshing. The story of the game is that Lara is chasing after a specific artifact, it's an artifact that has a link to her past, and the disappearance of her mother, I don't want to give away what it is or the story, but it's a solid tale that kept my attention, even as it went a little too heavily into the mysticism.   There's a few people who assist Lara, who don't get a ton of development (apparently their back story is in the prequel, Tomb Raider Anniversary) but are always there to drop a hint or a timely quip over the coms, as this is a solo affair. If you can get over the 2006 graphics (which has aged, but still feels acceptable), the awful bike levels (few, but noticibly bad) and don't mind a little cheesiness in the dialog, this is an easy recommendation.  It's a 7 dollar game, that's easily worth that price, or more.  It has a memorable story, and fantastic level design.   It also contains great locations, and gameplay.   Overall I think Tomb Raider: Legends should have got the same level of attention that the newest Tomb Raider has.  The newer game is definitely better, delivering a more fleshed out character and story, and a better game, but at the same time, you can still go back and play Legend before or after it and enjoy it, for the excellent adventure it offers.

												Tomb Raider Legends.Well, it is quite an really handsome game. The grafics are really nice, you get many moments to just catch some off them (if you turn on the Next Generation Graphics). But the game is kinda short and the Ending is, neverthenless, really frustrating. It feels like there should be explained more about it.  I don´t want to spoiled to much at this point.+:a. Finally Lara get some sidekicksBy having the sidekicks, which constantly talkes to her, Lara can show more personality as in the Tomb Raider CLassic Seriesb. Pretty easy inventoryWell, Lara get her pistols and she can pick up any other weapon. Thats it. It makes the Game pretty easy and not much complicated. This give the game an really decent gameflow.c. Nice battlesystemThe new battlesystem of TRL allows you to make some awesome moves, which are helpful, (I played om the highest difficulty) and makes the game a little bit more strategic (as TR can be :)Downside:Well, every single battle (95% of them) are against other people. There are no nostalgic enemys or fantasy enemys like in the Tomb Raider Classics, and this is actually a sad thing for me. Also, the game lacks sometimes with bugs. There are really rare, but if they appear, it sucks. Not many of them, but they are there.Also, I don´t like all those secrets. which are really everywhere. To much secrets. Really. I mean, sure, it is awesome to collect some of them to reveal awesome stuff like Artworks etc. but 15 Secrets in on single level? Nah. Fazit:Well. Tomb Raider Legend is a good game. I will play it again, for sure, but it does not give me the kicks to play it over and over. For TR-Fans, Play it, to see a bit of Lara´s History before SquareEnix decices to make a Reboot. Buy it.

												A pretty good game.This was my first ""original series"" Tomb Raider game that I finished fully, and I had a pretty good time with it. The story was pretty interesting and the gameplay was much better then I had expected. There were a couple of problems I had with the gun mechanics, but I guess this was 2006 and much of what we have today they didn't have back then.In a nutshell, I had lots of fun with this. All it needed was a little more depth and it would've been as good as the reboot. 7.5/10			"

												Tomb Raider Legend- Its a beautiful game with a really immersive story and dialogues. Most of the things about it are great, the tombs,puzzles,world interaction but the combat system is awful. There is a small number of animal enemies and the shooting process feels like a task. The weapons are dull and usual and the human enemies have a terrible AI.9/10			"

												Tomb Raider Legend is a story-driven platformer that is fun to play, but a near-game-breaking bug and some awkward mechanics  belittle the overall positive experience.Installed size on hard drive: 7.3 GBThe story is decent, if a little disconnected. Lara is searching for an artifact that killed her mother years ago. A great excuse to send Lara to a variety of diverse locations, from a sleepy South American town to the frozen mountains of Nepal. Zip and Alistair provide some snarky commentary as she proceeds through the levels – some of it almost breaking the fourth wall. It helps keep the proceedings light-hearted and fun, even if what is happening is quite serious. Lara herself is keen, quick-witted, whip-smart, and always ready with a snappy come-back. TR: Legend was actress Keeley Hawes first time voicing Lara, and she does an absolutely fantastic job.The platforming is well-executed and slick, with timed movements (move quickly before the platforms collapse) and required momentum (remember to HOLD the spacebar to jump in some places, or Lara won't jump far enough). Gun-play just feels odd; lock on to a target, use the arrow or WASD keys to switch the lockon from target to target. While doing this, Lara can run, jump and dodge. There is a free-aim mode, but once engaged Lara cannot move at all, so the lockon mode will be the one used most often. I rebound the keys to what I wanted, so there is that. There are no waypoints; not really an issue in a game this linear. The climbing puzzles are generally well done; remember to use Lara's binoculars first to scan an area for hints before trying to solve a puzzle. Some bosses can only be defeated with the help of the environment, so if a boss seems like it is taking no damage, start looking around for switches and levers (and things to grapple). Nothing is handed to you in this game, though once you figure out a puzzle or boss, it will be solved or defeated in a matter of seconds.Now for the issues, and there are more of them than there should be. Lock-on would sometimes result in strange camera movements, and the camera doesn't immediately auto-rotate to the forward direction when riding a motorbike. The platforming direction controls aren't always intuitive. A similar issue plagues the QTEs; the onscreen arrows don't always indicate the correct direction, resulting in multiple fails until finding the right button-press. Disable Next Generation Content in the graphics settings; TR: Legend looks better with it, but this will eliminate nearly all crashes. And there is the near-game-breaking bug in the Nepal temple level. A cutscene, then Lara needs to run to a door, hit it (I won't say with what, because spoilers), the door will open, triggering another cutscene and a platforming section. But hitting the door doesn't always make it open, meaning progression through the game is blocked. Just keep re-loading a save until the game works the way it is supposed to (it took me seven tries the last time I played it). Ridiculous, but there it is.The saving grace through all of this Lara Croft herself. Unlike more recent versions of Lara, this one has no lack of confidence. You never hear Lara telling herself, “I can do this.” She already knows she can, and can worry about other things. I still highly recommend Tomb Raider: Legend despite the game's issues, because there is nothing truly game breaking, and this remains one of my favorite “older” versions of Lara. If story-driven platforming and puzzling is your preference, or you just want more Lara Croft, absolutely get this one.			"

												This game is better than the previous release of Tomb Raider. For a game released in 2006, it has decent graphics. The controls are much more steady, but the game feels like short. Not enough levels in my opinion. Not enough guns, considering there is only around 3-4 types of guns. Sometimes in the game a bit lag or bugs(but that's not long time), whatever i try to change option setting sometimes in game still a bit lag.Overall, the gameplay is very fun and recommended it's a pretty good action adventure+puzzle game!	9/10 because Steam overlay not working			"

												Now, this is what I call a perfect game (almost). After my disappointment with TR 4, this comes like a fresh air with a slight perfumes of roses!The graphics and environment are great, the gameplay is great and the controller 360 works like a charm with it in Windows 8.1 64bit. I have been playing for about 4 hours and when I saved it says ""Bolivia 1%"" :O Really?! All that is 1%?! Ok, I'm not that fast with actions, and I took my time to memorize the different movements and get familiar with all the controlls, but still! Maybe it will get faster with time because I read the average gameplay time is about 12 hours!Anyway, I know if a game is great for me, when I no longer think of the controller, graphics or anything else except how I get out of here! (gameplay). Legend is a great game and what makes it so great is sexy Lara, oops! I mean it is the balanced gameplay, not so easy and not so difficult. It just feels right in everything. Maybe the fighting is not that great, but it just needs a fast aiming (with the mouse is easier, but it is ok with the controller really, not bad). Now if only they make an enhanced versions of TR4!). For this silly price? Are you kidding? This game definitely from the best value for money games (if not the best ever!). Wow! This good feeling during the play time and after it is only comes with such quality games :D			"

												Such a great game. This migh not be as great as it is for the old Tomb Raider players, because this game was the first version made by Crystal Dynamic with major of changes in the Tomb Raider game. However, in Tomb Raider: Legend you will be able to see more moves of lara, more weapons and also an awesome grafic of the natur. And the soundtrack is still amazing just like the old Tomb Raider game's sountracks. I would strongly recommend you all to buy and try it. You will need to use your brain well to finish this game. But don't worry. It's not all about maze. You will see more action and bike riding too.			"

												A game I not long ago discovered that’s become one of my favourite platforming games due to it’s very fluid, flowing action which comes complete with a captivating story and a terribly charming main character; had the game been longer and a little less linear it would have been perfect in my opinion! :PIf you’re looking to purchase Tomb Raider: Legend, this has got to be the definitive platform for owning it on, or at least the one I wish I'd played it on originall!. Providing you have the PC for running it, it's much smoother, graphically beautiful, and ambient than any of the console versions! The only negatives are that it doesn't run particularly well along side Steam, failing to run the overlay without forcing Steam to recognise Tomb Raider: Legend as a non-steam game (may not apply to all users, but from what I gather it affects most unfortunately), and if you decide to use a plug in controller like myself, you'll find yourself getting very confused when the game instructs you to press keyboard keys to perform certain actions and quicktime events, but hey, guessing games are fun, right?

												Oh man I remember this game when it was a demo and I was playing the xbox 360 for the first time. Anyways as you might have guessed, this is possibly one of my worst ported games. The controls are a bit shoddy and it was really meant to be played with a game controller (except for the part where the tourets are sensitive as Sh*t). The checkpoint system isn't very forgiving in scenes with the motorcycle, but otherwise they are just where they need to be. Prepare for a magical adventure that has Lara heading deep into uknown terrirtory and also digging up a bit of her mysterious past when she was a child. I won't give much more away, but let me tell you that this game is worth the 10 hours it has. 7/10			"

												To compare this game to the original 6 Tomb Raider games would be quite unfair. They were puzzle games first, adventure games second, this one is an adventure game first and barely a puzzle game at all. That's not to say it's not as good as the first ones. Just different. And to be honest, I think we all needed a bit of change after the absolute disaster that was The Angel Of Darkness.A bit about difficulty in this one, I don't recommend you go for the hardest difficulty because it's not balanced very well. I generally go for the hardest difficulty when I play games because I always think ""The bigger the challenge, the more fun I'll have!"". That's not really the case here because there was a motorcycle sequence in the Kazakhstan chapter that was absolutely impossible to get past on the hardest difficulty. I think you need to upgrade your pistols all the way in order to progress past that section by collecting enough collectibles and I just didn't want to do that. So I actually ended up restarting the game from the beginning. I managed to blow through it on the easiest difficulty back to where I was in about an hour and a half, so it wasn't the biggest deal in the world. Still, I shouldn't have to do things like that.Also, the game is very glitchy. I made sure to not enable next generation content because I heard that causes problems but even with it off I got stuck on objects more times than I'd care to mention, fell out of the game world and into the void once, enemies would get stuck and not move, including a boss and if you're not facing the ladder directly you run the risk of climbing at the wrong angle, causing problems when you want to jump off. Not to mention that the boss dialogue had no  chill. Every boss has like 3 or 4 lines recorded that they'll say every now and then in a boss fight but something happened that caused them to just say the lines over and over and over again with no pause. The game was surprisingly buggy.When I fired up the first Tomb Raider game I was expecting an action adventure game in the same vein as the Uncharted series and what I got was a full fledged puzzle game with a tiny bit of adventure sprinkled in. I used to resent it for that but as I went through the original 6 games I began to love it. Some times it made me feel outright stupid but I think we can all benefit from feeling stupid while playing video games every now and then.Now with Tomb Raider: Legend I got what I originally thought I was going to get back then. I was disappointed in the original for its lack of adventure but loved it for its challenging puzzles, I was disappointed in this one for its lack of challenging puzzles but loved it for its adventure. Maybe some day we will have the best of both worlds... But it is not this day!			"

Story/Presentation: 6 I'll be honest, I was sort of expecting quite a lot from this game. I know it came out before the Anniversary edition, but seeing as it was popular enough to Make the Anniversary game, I was hoping this would top it up well. But it's not bad, regardless. The graphics are actually really lovely. It looks good, but nothing Too special in my taste. Plus, I felt like the game didn't look finished. There were areas where the characters would move around inside a car and their hair or arm would move through the solid of the vehicle. It was odd to look at, and even the animation was very awkward, and I'm pointing it out because from the time it came out. Reason why the score is actually lower is because of it's story. Incredibly bland, super cheesy, and nothing too awe-strucking. Gameplay: 8But I will admit, what made this game it's credit was it's gameplay. The controlers are really easy to manuever, Lara's really fun to move and play arond with, and the physics within work well. It's got pretty good puzzles, awesome boss battles, and I liked the chasing scenes a lot for some reason. It's a little bit too easy, but still got me entertained in game. Just not with the cutscenes.Overall: 7What really bummed me getting this game on Steam is that it doesn't support it's Overlay, nor could I have taken any screenshots, but that's my personal opinion, and I think TR:Underworld is the same. But beside that, it's a pretty good action/puzzle game, much like Anniversary, but don't expect much with the story. I'll still recommend it because it's really really fun!			"

												TR:L reimagined and revamped the Tomb Raider experience, adding more streamlined levels with lots of action and a more ""Prince of Persia -like experience"" (Quote: Gametrailers Review). Nowadays people tend to regard the Uncharted series as the non-plus-ultra of 3rd person action adventure games, but where would Nathan Drake be without his spiritual successor Lara Croft and especially this game. Naughty Dog may have refined the formula, but Crystal Dynamics enhanced what Core Design began :)			"

												I bought this Game a while back on a Huge Tomb Raider Sale here on Steam and I am glad I got it.First of all let me start saying that I had problems with the Game crashing and there was a rather simple fix for it. If you happen to play this Game with the Next Generation Setting on you will encounter texture glitches and crashes. However simply just turn this Option off (if you encounter an area where your game is crashing) and turn it back on after the next Checkpoint.Now before we start what does the Game come with? It comes with the Singleplayer Campaign & Croft Manor. Once the Singleplayer is finished you can unlock Cheates to just mess around the Game. (Remember its not really cheating if its given to you by the developers).You can explore Croft Manor at any Time you want, so if you want to take a break of the Story and just collect treasure you can pay Croft Manor a visit. However keep in Mind that you will have to finish Croft Manor in one go (or at least it seemed like it) as it is like a treasure hunt only.I personally did not like Croft Manor nor did I finish it as I am not a fan off running around collecting treasures spread all across the mansion. I prefered the Croft Manor of TR Anniversary alot more.First of all Compared to the Xbox 360 Version this Game is absolutley beautiful looking thanks to the Next Generation Setting. (which also comes with its downsides, see top of review). And unlike TR Anniversary's Pc Port this one had hardly any Glitches or Bugs whatsoever when it comes to moving Lara around.Now I haven't played any of the Original Tomb Raider Games back from the 90's. Since I grew up starting with this Tomb Raider Trioligy ( The Trioligy includes Anniversary, Underworld & Legend). Which is why I can't compare it to those Games.However if you are new-ish to the Tomb Raider Series this Trioligy is a great one to get into. It is a 'classic' Tomb Raider Game with mainly Exploring Tombs and solving Puzzles, unlike TR Anniversary this one actually has great Aim Assist and a little bit more shooting.Now let me just drop in here quickly that I do believe that you should play the newest 2 Tomb Raiders ( from 2013 & 2015 ) first to fully understand the story. Although I thought they have not been connected it seems they sort of are. Maybe not graphic wise, as the newest 2 Tomb Raider Games of course are waay more advanced when it comes to the graphics, but story wise they are, even if just a little bit. I don't think I would off understand as well as I did, if I would off finished this before playing the other 2.I personally didn't find the Puzzles hard as this was my second playthrough (first one was years back on console). However if you have difficulties you can always look at a Guide here on Steam or online to help you out.There was only one thing that got me stuck and thinking for a while which was the last boss fight, but it was actually rather simple once I figured it out so dont worry and just keep trying!Tomb Raider Legend is the key in the Legend Trioligy which makes it a very important piece with an amazingly told Story that lets you wonder with many questions!All in all the Tomb Raider Series has one of the best Stories to this Day and I am glad to see all of them existing on PC. I am also very Happy that these old-ish once are sort of connected to the Revamped once that just came out a couple of years ago. It really gives you this connected feeling.I do recommend Tomb Raider to any Puzzle & Adventure Fan. Otherwise I also do recommend it to anybody that is in for a great Story, as I honestly think it is one of the best ones here on Steam & Gaming History.I also do Recommend Tomb Raider Legend for its full price as the Campaign on Normal Mode will take you up to 12 Hours + 1-4 Hours of Croft Manor. But of course its never a Mistake to get it on Sale!			"

												Tomb Raider: Legend was one of the first TR games I played and therefore has significant nostalgic value in my book.1. The storyline is quite short, it takes about 5.5 hours to get through the game on medium difficulty. I'd rate the story itself a 6/10. Visiting a few tombs for sword pieces to kill a monster isn't the strongest storyline I've seen in a game, but overall fun to follow along.2. Graphics are fine for a 10 year-old game, nothing extraordinary for 2006 but not bad either.3. The game has a few bugs where you'd get stuck in between movable objects or invisible walls, not game-breaking at all but they are there. You can always re-load the previous checkpoint to get unstuck if you can't manage it by wiggling yourself free.4. I'd say it is an enjoyable game which can be bought for just a few bucks during Steam Sale, a must have for any TR fan.			"

												This was pioneering stuff for Tomb Raider back in the day. Like most gaming series', it was an oppurtunity to bring themselves into the future of modern gaming with the new Playstation and Xbox models.You really get a sense of what Tomb Raider was always trying to achieve with their previous games. Picturesque landscapes of coastal Thailand and immersive underwater cities once worshiped by the Maya - the rich atmosphere and culture emanates from the vast variety of terrain in an otherwise relatively short game.Indulging in ancient Norse mythology, you go head-to-head with all sorts of creatures, striking each one down with Thor's own hammer as you find yourself following in her fathers footsteps in some parts.Once again, the culture and variety of landscapes included is vast. Bolivia, Peru, Khazakstan, Japan, Ghana, Napal and of course, England are are places you journey through.I remember playing through these games and being in complete awe of Lara and the life of an adventurer. Before we had internet, I wrote down my findings and experiences during her expeditions as if it was a diary of events.Playing Tomb Raider is more than just running around in skin-tight swimsuits or shorts and vests, it's an investment into the life of an adventure and travel.If that interests you, then go ahead and buy this game - you won't regret it.

												Part 1:I remember a long time ago, after i played Angel Of Darkness and was heavily sad with the bankrupicy of Core Design. Damn, those were rougue times. Luckily, Crystal Dynamics came to save the day and brought us Tomb Raider: Legend.I was a bit anxyous, to be honest. Tomb Raider changing hands into another developer, will they bring us the same essence again?As screenshots from the game were showed and when it appeared on the E3 of 2006, i was ready to say YES!When i played the demo, i desperately needed to play the full version. And so i did. Back theses days, i bought my PS2. Witch got me not only Tomb Raider Legend, but also Anniversary some time later (Witch i will talk in other review). I played it with no clues of secrets or other things, din't even bothered reading the manual. IT WAS FUN. I mean, really fun. I remember, one of my first things that i've done after i first finished the story mode: Going out of my house and buying me a gamer magazine (Woah, those were the times...) to be able to finish it 100%. And so i did. I was so happy when i did.First thing: The graphics. Even on PS2, they were beutiful. They are even better on PC. The ambients are pretty detailed and the immersion is great. I loved the art design of this game. It made me remember Tomb Raider 3. Moutains, temples and militar base. The snow part was my favorite, specially because of the change of gameplay.Gameplay: Lara is like 450% more flexible than on Tomb Raider 6 and can do even more moves than the other 6 games. But it had a reason for it. As you go though stages, you will see that not you can climb, but also, run on walls (Like Prince Of Persia). I actually liked this featured and i think that it could've been more explored.  Besides that, you can roll and do a lot of acrobatic moves with it. As i said, Lara is way more flexible than in other games. It feel MUCH MORE pleasurable to play with her. Other changes to gameplay are: Quick time events. There are two types of them. One is the common one, where you have to push a certain button to not fail and die. Since there's always a checkpoint before these events, it will not give you any trouble. The second one is what i call ""Quick Action And Reaction"". When a ""Lara's icon"" appears on the bottom right of the screen, you will have a limited time to get to safety. You will have to run and jump, and react real quick to anything that is happening. An example: In the end of the first stage of the game, a chopper will come and start to blow up the bridge that you're on. You have to get to the other side if you want to make it alive. But the chopper's shoots will always vary. Sometimes they will hit a little bit forward, so you have to keep attention where you are stepping or else you will fall to death. I also had no problems with this event. I actually found it pretty cool, if you ask me. I preffer then more than common quick time events (I would love so much if Castlevania: Lord Of Shadows was more like that). The reason is because i think it's more skill based than ""pressing the right button"" based. Am i right?Okay, next on the list of gameplay is vehicles. Sometimes, Lara will ride a vehicle. I personaly had no problem with them. Expect for two things. I swear to god, the physics of this game in these parts are rather strange sometimes. What i'm trying to say is: Don't hit walls many times. Seriously, don't. And the other thing is: Gunplay while driving. It's quite obvious that you can't fire both weapons, right? Okay, so what do you expect? Enemies with less life, right? WRONG! Enemies will take 7-9 shoots to die. I mean, SERIOUSLY. Couldn't they low it a bit, so it din't got THAT repetitive? Here's a tip: Try always to fire explosive barrels and explode their bikes, it's MUCH FASTER.Also, this is another things. Explosive barrels are back. And with them another ""interactive destructables"". What i mean is: To either explorer a barrel (That's marked with a ""!"") or an ""interactive destructable"" (Also marked with ""!""), you have to press the action button (On PC: ""E"", can't remember right now witch one it is on Gamepad). And Lara will shoot into these places and take out more enemies (Or take ou heavy enemies with less challenge). You also can use manual aim on them (Tough i din't used manual aim in the ENTIRE game, so). These are cool. And thanks to them, some destruction is possible in this game. And, again, that could've been MUCH MORE explored. Damn, this game had a lot of potential. And may be the game where the devs took out most of the ideas and put on Tomb Raider 2013.Sound: I really liked the sound of the game. I really loved the song from intro, menu, ending, mission ending and the Tokyo mission theme. It's a memorable soundtrack and does it job. Lara's voice is quite good and i think it combines with her new visual in this game. Zip is back and...Tough he is not annoying, i preffered SOOOOOO MUCH his voice from Tomb Raider 5. He sounded so much cool there, what happened? If i can say one character that annoys the ♥♥♥♥ out of me is Allister. JESUS ♥♥♥♥ING CHRIST. SHUT UP ALREADY! AND I MEAN IT THIS TIME!  THANK GOD YOU WILL DIE ON UNDERWORLD, YOU BIG PILE OF ♥♥♥♥ .The Story...Oh boy. I think i will need to put these into parts. I will begin. With the failure of making a trilogy of the Angel Of Darkness, Crystal Dynamics tried to make their own trilogy (Witch was never a Trilogy BTW). At least they started it right. They tried to erase TRAOD from canon (Since we don't know anything that happened after the ending of it) and create their own story. Not only for the exploration part of the game (Myths, artifacts, etc), but also for Lara. That's right, this was the first game since Tomb Raider 4 (Witch only did a bit of this on the first two levels of it) that tried to explore Lara's past. As you can remember, nothing was ever said about Lara's dad and mother. The only thing you know is that they aren't showed and Lara is rich as hell. That's it. And that's where the devs tried to explored, creating a whole new story of it, introducing new characters like Amanda and Anaya. Anaya is just friends with Lara, and doesn't have much impact on plot. She just helped her to locate some things and was rescued by Lara later on the game. Amanda is the big fish in the new characters here. She's now the main antagonist. And i really mean it. She was best friends with Lara, since an accident happened and Lara had to leave her. More of this is revealed during a part of the game. And now, she's back, with hew own plan to gain infinity powers and become immortal (Well, that excalated quickly). And Lara has to defeat her by collecting all the parts of...Excalibur....I know what you're thinking right now: ""LOL, that was the best they could do?!"". It has a connection. Not only Excalibur is the only thing capable of hurting Amanda, but also, Lara's mother disappeareance had something to do with her getting to another known as ""Avalon"". Now, with this, you know what mythology this game is about, right? Okay. Through it doesn't really happen a lot on plot (I mean, only things about Lara's past are revealed and there's the fight with Amanda and a little recounter with Lara's mother), it isn't bad. Each piece will be somewhere in the world, and that's will be a new mission. So location variety is back and this time, at least, it's good. Remember when i said i like the Tokyo mission soundtrack? It was also one of my favorite stages. I liked how they got a closed space and transformed it into a open exploration space. I just really think that the enemy of this mission in particular isn't that memorable. I can't even remember his name if you ask me.But that's the most of the story.Now, we are going to talk about two major things in this game that completes theirselves: Exploration and unlockables.

												Pros+Levels look great+Puzzles are challenging and make good use of the player's skills+Platforming is fun (when Lara decides to actually use her hands)Cons-Checkpoints are sparse -Resetting a puzzle can be nedlessly tedious-Combat is boring, bike sections are about as amusing as watching grass grow.-Some jumps have to be pixel perfect, which compounds with the sparse checkpoints. I will watch Lara miss a jump she SHOULD have made only to be put back at the beginning of a section.It has its faults, but this is a Tomb Raider game where you actually raid tobms. Square Enix should stop focusing on reboots and instead make games like this.			"

												This was pioneering stuff for Tomb Raider back in the day. Like most gaming series', it was an oppurtunity to bring themselves into the future of modern gaming with the new Playstation and Xbox models.You really get a sense of what Tomb Raider was always trying to achieve with their previous games. Picturesque landscapes of coastal Thailand and immersive underwater cities once worshiped by the Maya - the rich atmosphere and culture emanates from the vast variety of terrain in an otherwise relatively short game.Indulging in ancient Norse mythology, you go head-to-head with all sorts of creatures, striking each one down with Thor's own hammer as you find yourself following in her fathers footsteps in some parts.Once again, the culture and variety of landscapes included is vast. Bolivia, Peru, Khazakstan, Japan, Ghana, Napal and of course, England are are places you journey through.I remember playing through these games and being in complete awe of Lara and the life of an adventurer. Before we had internet, I wrote down my findings and experiences during her expeditions as if it was a diary of events.Playing Tomb Raider is more than just running around in skin-tight swimsuits or shorts and vests, it's an investment into the life of an adventure and travel.If that interests you, then go ahead and buy this game - you won't regret it.

												Awesome game. Loved the storyline and graphics as well as all the opprotunities for exploration in the myriad different areas. Pros:- Intuitive puzzles- Lara's witty one-liners- Varied locations- Immersive music- Lara's boobs are good sized (ie compared to them in TR reboot)Cons:- Lousy camera angles. This issue haunts virtually every TR games to this point, and Legends is no exception.- Trial and error platforming, primarily due to the above- Zip and Alister can be annoying- Relatively short duration per location- Final boss fight consists of more button-mashing than strategy.

												Tomb Raider Legend is another great Tomb Raider game! I personally liked some of the classics and Rise of the TR better, but this is a great game overall but it does have some weaknesses. One of it's major weaknesses is the length of the game. It's only 8 levels. Yes you read this right, 8. The levels are somewhat long but you probably won't get anymore than 10 hours of game-play out of it if you are playing it for the first time. However to get all of the Rewards and time trials really ups that time and can take a long time to achieve. My first time through this probably added an additional 10 hours to game-play just trying to find all the Rewards and completing the Time Trials. It has a wealth of collectibles, like most Tomb Raider games, and has a fairly streamline arsenal of weapons compared to AOD and some other Tomb Raider games. All in all though, this game has great graphics and great level design. The story is very gripping and at some times can keep you on the edge of your seat. Vehicles are once again present in Tomb Raider, however you only get to ride a Motorbike and a Fork-Lift. You get the Motorbike three times. Two of them are simply just trying to get to the next area of the game and those areas are very linear. Meaning, you have no control over where you want to go. You always have to go forward which takes away looking at the scenery (and in one of the levels it's very nice.) So not one of my favorite sections in the game but it's alright. The other time we use it, we have full control over the vehicle, but we only ride it for about 30 seconds just to make a jump over a ledge, quite disappointing. However, something new in the Tomb Raider series are Outfits. You can now change Lara's outfit before starting a level and in Croft Manor which is a nice feature. Speaking of, there is a Croft Manor level and let me tell you I love this version! I personally like the design of the classic manor better, but unlike the classics where you have maybe one puzzle and it's just Lara running around with Winston following her, this version actually has tasks that you have to accomplish to obtain objects and rewards. You start out with nothing, but in the end you'll get your Pistols, Grapple, Binoculars, and a few other things and you'll most likely find a wealth of rewards along the way. There is no Time Trial sadly and there is no way to restart the manor unless you start a new save which is sort-of disappointing since I'd like redo levels at times. Also, you can't go outside which I find an odd section that they took out. Overall Tomb Raider Legend is good. I personally prefer other Tomb Raider games, but, this isn't a bad game at all! Some of the levels are very memorable and I think it offers great replay value. I recommend this game if you like the Tomb Raider series and if you like Third Person Shooters and Puzzle games!			"

												Review by xTzharkz.Tomb Raider: Legend. I loved it! After playing Tomb Raider IV this felt like heaven. Smooth gameplay nice voice acting, great story. Great game!Okay lets go more into details now.The story was built up nicely. Kept me intrested + the ending, made me want to know what next game is going to offer, if it is going to contiue the story. But I don't want to spoil anything so I leave it like that. Gameplay was smooth, it did have few glitches but other movement worked great. I do not recommend to play on Hardest difficulty tho - which I did. In my head the harder the difficulty is the more fun I will have - due to challenges, but I ended up getting stuck, cuz I was not able to kill the enemies - little health packs - getting lot of damage. It was not that I was bad it but it was built up really poorly. Luckily after 2 hours of trying I manage to do it. So yeah better play either on easy or normal. It won't make the game any better when playing on hard. Trust me.The puzzles in this game were not that hard. But I think the challenges this game offers pretty much fills the cap. What I mean are time trials, secrects. Also you can run around in house and look for secrets. How cool is that!?Graphics were perfect! They had improved ones as well in the settings but I think the original ones were better. Lara Croft looked beautiful, sounded great and had awesome moves. Later on can change also outfits that will get unlocked by finishing the collections and trials. Biker outift... So sexy.Anyway. I recommend the game! Go try it out. I think it was worth it. xTzharkz [Eric]			"

												Pretty much one of my favorite Tomb Raider games. Have if for both console and pc . It was sort of a fun and ""lighter"" part of the series. Puzzle solving is the best part of the game in my honest opinion. Combat is a lot shaky but nothing too overbearing. All in all good game and a good price for a classic.

												The 'next-gen' graphical overhall on this game is the same rushed finish that they put on the Xbox 360 version, and is pretty poorly optimised - to the point where you notice significantly more framerate drops compared to either of it's sequels.That being said, the game looks fantastic with the PC's enhancements to the PS2-esque graphics, which in my opinion look better and they cut the realism down and replace it with a more traditional Tomb Raider art-style.Other than that one criticism, this game is genuinely one of my favourite Tomb Raider games. As a fan since day 1 on the Saturn, this game blew me away on release (since this was the first 'reimagining' for the series) and continues to put a smile on my face everytime I play it.If you see this in a flash sale or equivalent, be sure to pick it up. You will not be disappointed!			"

												I got into the Tomb Raider series through the newest reboot of the series, and I absolutely fell in love. I love the whole idea of the adventurer archaeologist, and Lara as a protagonist is just a perfect fit, in my opinion. Legend is an awesome game, though it was a bit short, anywhere between 3-6 hours, depending on if you take your time to get the trophies and search every nook and cranny. I would give Tomb Raider: Legend an 8/10, because it falls short in length and some awkward gameplay moments with the camera and controls.			"

												This seventh installment in the popular Tomb Raider series was actually quite good on XBOX 360. However, the PC version is pretty good. Make sure you use an xbox controller  and play with the settings to get the shooting functioning like the X360 version. On a positive note, Legend is far from being an eyesore. The PC version features higher resolutions and a nice ""Next-Gen"" mode that resembles the 360 version. The gameplay is stuff you expect in a Tomb Raider game; pushing crates, pulling levers, dodging boulders, etc. Also, Lara's mansion makes a comeback and so that's a huge plus. Storyline can be rather cheesy at times, especially compared to the superior origin story of the recent reboot. And cutscenes/ flybys/ constant chatter can distract the player from enjoying the atmosphere. The game is also pretty short and ends on a cliffhanger. Plently of unlockables and decent replay value. Fun boss fights and great music. A bit on the easy side even on Hard. However, some of the bosses on Hard mode can be a frustrating challenge. The collectable secrets/unlockables and time trials give this game some good replay value. In a nutshell, it's everything you love about Tomb Raider, but it's a bit more streamlined for a casual audience. Puzzles are simplistic and quick. More arcade and action elements in this one. In a way, Legend reminds me of TR2.  Especially, the Nepal level. If you played TR2 and play this level you'll understand why. Legend is my favorite out of the L-A-U trilogy. Due to being more simple, Legend feels less frustrating than Anniversary. And it still feels more polished than Underworld. In other words, Legend is short, but sweet.			"

												Tomb Raider: legend is the first reboot in the series after the disaster from Core Design's sixth entry of the Tomb Raider series, Angel of Darkness, which almost ruin the franchise till Crystal Dynamics gave the series a reboot with Tomb Raider Legend.Now on to the game itself. The story is a nice refreashing look (not mention a good story to remember about), The puzzle are interesting (too easy if you ask me) The gun combat, it works but its just annoying at times as there is too many of them compare to the puzzle. If you decide to play with a controller, just to give you the heads up, the controller is a little touchy compare to playing it on a keyboard and mouse it will reconize the controller and respond to it, but the pop-up tourtial won't. the pop-up won't disrupt the flow of the game at all.

												I just finished this game: it was unexpectedly very short.The game is at times very fun, and at times very frustrating. It is fun to explore new places, jump over cliffs, solving puzzles, fight with fodders, fall from cliffs, ride the bicicle. It is not fun to fight against bosses. Except the first and maybe the second one, it was completely unclear to me how to defeat all other bosses. Even when I had a good intuition of how I should do it, I was still missing out some extra clicks or timing requirements that were needed in order to defeat them. e.g. in one fighting sequence, you can defeat the boss only if you hit a target above your head hidden outside the camera view.Both the camera and the auto-targeting system, suck.

												Legend is a great game to get you pysched for the new Tomb Raider. In comparison to Anniversary (which was built on the same engine), Legend I feel has more of a problem with camera angles and jumping to your death. I still enjoyed Legend though for its story and combat while it maintained the puzzles and exploration aspects that are signature to the Tomb Raider franchise.			"

												Note: I've actually played for couple of hours, they don't show there because I had to add the game as an external game to have Steam overlay and controller working in-game.Compared to the rest of the series it's all run and gun with practically endless arsenal supply, most of the secrets are a joke and the game is totally linear. There is little sense of exploration. The motorcycle driving part(s) (I don't know if there are more than one, 1 was enough for me) are completely pointless as you can hardly call holding the shoot button gameplay. I consider myself a TR fan and I really wanted to play this for the plot but it's just too much of a different game compared to Anniversary or the original series. At least I'm saving this one for the last.			"

												This is now an Old Game.  I played it when it came out and quit after a gamebreaking bug.  I have now replayed it and completed it.  The games tomb levels and general climbing swinging and jumping puzzles are excellent.  The bronze,silver,and gold cross collecting gives an extra challenge if wanted.  But the combat, oooh.   It stinks.  Terrible.  Almost to the point of ruining the game.The boss fights are crappy.  One of the bosses glitched on a ledge.  I walked up to him and plugged away until he was dead.  Weak sauce. The quicktime events suck but aren't so arduous as to destroy the game.  Standard pre 2010 stuff. The story is suprisingly good with relevant cinematics.   Lara's character is well fleshed out, so to speak. What is worth my time?  Yes, but then I haven't played the current generation Tomb Raiderses.   This is a short game as well so not a big committment if you don't like it.  Cheap as dirt these days as well. Some random irritants - occasional game breaking glitches and bugs.

												Good platforming title that would be a very good platforming title if it wasn't for horrible camera controls. The camera always auto-centers itself behind Lara after a few seconds... so those used to modern cameras are going to have a bad time. The camera also tends to mess up in certain areas, and isn't very easy to control. You get used to it, but I could see how it could be a dealbreaker to some. So in the end: fun platforming, GODAWFUL CAMERA, decent shooting mechanics, lame story (but with good voiceacting).			"

												Tomb Raider: Legend has the sole honour of being a game that I've bought three times now, on three different platforms, and 100%'d three different times. I've yet to regret it.Legend remains largely unchanged from it's original incarnation on the sixth generation, a fact which contributes to just what a fantastically optimized port it is. Honestly, stunning. 1 Ghz compatible? Other developers could take notes. Ran suberbly on my 1.8 Ghz toaster of a laptop, though for obvious reason it did mean having to forgo the visual changes added as the game was ported to seventh generation consoles - which range from relatively minor lighting adjustment to complete foliage overhauls. It's menu-toggled.There were more than a few glitches - ranging from moderately amusing (floating rocks in Nepal) to moderately annoying (Lara refusing to grab ropes, plummeting to her death as she phases through them), and the game isn't lying when it says Partial Controller Support, but on the whole the experience was seamless.Tomb Raider has you control Lara Croft in her quest for some contrived MacGuffin, spurred on by some event in the past and important because they say so, damn it. It's not the most compelling plot, and lacks the spectacle or involvement you'd get from an Indiana Jones or Librarian film.That the antagonists; Rutland, Amanda, and Takamoto, are barely given any screentime to banter with Lara before being unceremoniously killed off doesn't help. Of more note are the support characters, Alistair and Zip, and Lara herself, all of whom give wonderfully entertaining performances. In one case their brilliant spurious dialogue alone manages to elevate an otherwise okay level to one of the best in the game.Variety-wise, the levels are all incredibly distinct from one another, while the enemies are unfortunately not as much. The platforming mechanics are serviceable, and for the most part responsive, but incredibly underused; the best platforming level remains Croft Manor, a completely optional area. Likewise, the combat mechanics with the various kicks, bullet-time triggers, and grapples are all well and good, but almost completely unused in combat. It's a sad waste of potential.Of note are the bosses, that take advantage of the mechanics to some degree instead of pretending that the game is something it's not. They're not particularly memorable, but none are less than on par.It's a short game, incredibly short - if you haven't got a head for puzzles expect a good 7 hours, otherwise expect something closer to 5. Perhaps preferable to overstaying its welcome, but completely understaying it isn't fantastic either. The one billion unlockables they've managed to fit into the game help to counteract that - from concept art to outfits (hearkens to a day when they weren't just DLC, ey?) to model viewers and cheat codes, there's plenty there to play with.Best puzzles are all saved for completely optional content - that is, grabbing the gold tokens. These legitimately involving puzzles (unless it's Nepal in which case it's hidden under some unremarkable ledge. Gorramn Nepal), which often require breaking previous puzzles, are all infinitely gratifying, and would be more so if the game didn't expect you to have a near-psychic amount of knowledge as to where they are before you even begin messing around to get to them.Seriously, don't be ashamed to look up a hintbook or something to get even a vague idea of where they are. It's ridiculous. With all this fairly good, there's some inexcusable bad. The QTEs are bad. The ""developer hints""; the frustratingly slow camera cuts to completely obvious platforming sections in completely linear levels that every sixth generation platformer had, are bad. The physics puzzles that expect you ignore how physics work - in one case assuming that a 90 pound girl like Lara can send deliriously heavy metal cubes rocketing into the sky with the help of a medieval see-saw - are bad.But overall, Legend's saving grace is that it's extremely easy to play. Everything from the writing, to the combat to the puzzles is designed solely for you to enjoy it and have fun. If you're up for a completely undemanding fun ride, to be completed with rocketing ease and satisfaction, then Tomb Raider: Legend is a game to look into.			"

												The engine created for this game was later used for Tomb Raider: Anniversary, so it shares some of the same control and camera issues as that game. Otherwise, this is another great Tomb Raider game. I believe this one had more locations and outfits for Lara than Anniversary, and the story is very good. It was released in 2006 and shows its age a little bit, but it has a ""Next Generation Content"" setting that makes things look better. Although, that did cause some crashes on my machine, so you might have to turn if off for certain levels.I used this game as a test to see how well my computer would do in the living room.  I brought my computer downstairs and hooked it up to the big screen and sound system.  I connected an XBox 360 controller and played the game in full 1080p.  It worked really well.  So, I can confidently do that again for future games I might prefer to play in the living room, but that are superior or cheaper on the PC.			"

												It's okay. It's a good enough game to get your Tomb Raider fix on, but it is nothing too special. Platforming and exploring the variety of zones was fun, but the combat left a lot to be desired. Most of it simply wasn't enjoyable. The combat largely consisted of just shooting some generic soldiers to death, nicking their stuff, and killing more soldiers with it. There was a farily significant focus on the combat and action, most of which wasn't enjoyable to me. But, if you happen to like that stuff then this game has plently of it for you to enjoy.			"

												Legend is the first Tomb Raider title to be developed by Crystal Dynamics after the series stagnated at the hands of the series creator Core Design. Core's last contribution to the TR legacy, Angel of Darkness, is widely considered to be the worst in the series and CD did a respectable job at getting things back into order in the wake of its mediocrity. It's probably the oldest of the games that you can jump into without having to wear nostalgia goggles or be in the right mindset for dealing with some antiquated game design and glaring technical limitations (to be fair, though, the original was somewhat ahead of its time back when it was the new hotness).The core Tomb Raider mechanics are all here, just freshened up a bit compared to previous iterations. There's no slowly pivoting tank controls to contend with and there is a more cohesive feel to level traversal overall compared to prior games. You'll still run into annoying camera shenanigans at times when you're trying to line up a jump or tell Lara which direction to jump in while hanging off a ledge. Most people can probably expect to get roughly six hours of gameplay by going through the story and gathering collectables they find along the way (but not necessarily trying to seek every one out), maybe throw in an extra thirty minutes to an hour if you complete the Croft Manor side content as well. Combat is limited to fighting generic soldiers and mercenaries as well as the occasional animal while supernatural elements are confined to cutscenes, quick time events and boss battles—a bit lame overall, but luckily combat has never been the focus of this series, it's just there to break up the exploration and puzzle solving.I remember when this game first came out it ran like absolute garbage on pretty much all hardware available at the time if you turned on the “next-gen” features—looking at it now, it's hard to see why. A case of unoptimized code for a console generation that was still in its infancy, I suppose. Pretty much any reasonably modern hardware should be able to brute force past the game engines deficiencies, though. I did run into some odd rendering issues with certain 2D elements, but they were merely a mild distraction and didn't prevent me from playing the game. Once you get half way through the game, however, it does have a tendency to be rather unstable at spots when using the “next-gen” content and you may find yourself having to disable it to get past certain areas without crashing to desktop.All-in-all it's a pretty enjoyable game, a few caveats aside, if you're looking for some adventure, light action and puzzle solving. Certainly worth a play if you've never been through it before and it's on sale for dirt cheap.			"

												Pretty good game until you get on a motorcycle, I'm sure if you have the paitence to put up with the horribly desgined motorcycle segments you can have fun with the entire game, but not me.It tells you how to switch targets but that key doesn't work on motorcycles, you have to get every health pack along the way without missing one or else you die because there's no way to actually avoid the damage on a motorcycle, you also cannot turn your camera which makes finding the target impossible until they're in front of you, which makes killing every enemy very hard. Enemies will continue to ride with you throughout the map until they die, which combined with the horrible controls and few healthpacks you're allowed to carry leads to a lot of deaths.Motorcycle checkpoints are only at the start of each section, these sections tend to be very long and very hard to get through, after my seventh failed attempt to get through it I gave up.If you pick up this game I really hope you have the paitence to get through the mototrcycle segments.

This issue haunts virtually every TR games to this point, and Legends is no exception.- Trial and error platforming, primarily due to the above- Zip and Alister can be annoying- Relatively short duration per location- Final boss fight consists of more button-mashing than strategy.All in all, this is a good entry point for anyone who hasn't played TR games before.

												Tomb Raider: Legend is the second of two games I bought last year in order to play through this seminal franchise of 90's era gaming before the 2013 ""reboot"" came along and destroyed the franchise forever.  The first game - TR: Anniversary - was quite fun and enjoyable.  TR:L however, was one of those experiences where I was fighting to stick around long enough to finish the game.What TR:L does right is capture the essence of Lara Croft as a character and the platforming Tomb Raider does best.  Lara in this game is perfectly portrayed as the confident and over-sexed adventurer we all know her as.  Additionally, by this game's 2006 release, they had expanded the game locales from the eponymous tombs to skyscapers and military bases, to name two.  Inserting Lara into these locales worked well, without too much juxtaposition of having an archaeologist run around modern sites.The gameplay - particularly the platforming - is spot-on. It's a simple yet effective set of moves for Lara, you rarely feel that the controls are at fault when things turn to tears.  This game is the classic example of sticking with what works, even in the face of more complex and more advanced modern gameplay.  You grab stuff, you swing from things, and you jump around.  Simple.  It works.But the problems with this game lie deep.  Principally, I began to speculate as I got further into this game that it was developed independently by two different development teams: a platforming team and a combat team.  The so-called platforming team did this game justice, as previously mentioned. This combat team however, is where things fall apart.  Combat in Tomb Raider has never been my favorite thing.  I still think that a pure platforming and environmental puzzle version of Tomb Raider would be the best game in the franchise.  The combat really shows its inadequacies in the boss encounters. Just like in Anniversary, they are disjointed from the rest of the game.  You will spend lots of time alone navigating a puzzle or whatever at your own pace, then all of a sudden a boss appears and the game throws arbitrary time constraints at you and asks the player to control Lara in ways that are not at all consistent or even to be used again within the rest of the game.  In fact, the last boss was so infuriating I didn't even bother to try to beat it again after I was thoroughly trounced by it.  By that point after almost 2 full games of this I had had enough.  This disjointed back and forth between platforming and combat is in my opinion what makes these Tomb Raider games only good games and not great.Secondly, the in-game radio between Lara and her intel people got completely out of hand. Lara would get frequent mission updates and story narrative from this two-way radio communication. I get that using that game mechanic is a great way produce a narrative in the game without having it be forced in through cut-scenes or whatever. Some games have even mastered it, think Cortana in Halo: Combat Evolved. But here in TR:L it was just too much, too frequently and in my opinion not all that important to the story.  That sense of isolation in these expansive tombs is what was sorely missing in this title. Being able to solve a puzzle at your own pace with only your thoughts to guide you is the essence of good single-player puzzle platforming in my opinion. So my two game Tomb Raider project ends here. TR:L wasn't horrible, but I would've been mad as hell if I paid fifty bucks for it on release in 2006. If you put a gun to my head and said I could only ever play one of these two titles - Anniversary or Legend - I would immediately say Anniversary is the way to go. Legend just has too many flaws to make the run through it worthwhile.			"

												It doesn't show but I've played for more than thirty minutes; I used a shortcut to take screenshots cause I'm sad.Argh! I want to recommend it but after falling in love with Tomb Raider: Anniversary playing this first game in the trilogy made by Crystal Dynamics is disappointing. The main frustrations are very poor camera angles, the driving sections and just shooting way too many dudes, all thankfully excluded in its sequel improving it throughly and making myself gain much more respect for it and the team that worked on that game. The story wasn't exciting to me; the lore of this series is insane to be honest and that's why I enjoy it but I just didn't feel like playing for that due to what I've mentioned above. Whilst playing I developed a lot more love for Anniversary and have my fingers crossed the sequel to that: Underworld will be an even bigger improvement; I'll play that soon, plus the new series and will try the originals since I am pretty much a fanboy now.Do you remember that Simpsons Halloween special where Bart has a evil twin that lives in the attic? Well that's this game.			"

												If you are new to tomb raider series or want to play this series for the first time just play this one forget the rest. The only true tomb raider is this one which is truely a legend. why?Because it is not affected by COD system ( no health pack + health regen ) and also it has boss fight at the end of each level which makes it more like metal gear solid games.Full of thinking and brain challenge and puzzles, the story is awesome however it continues in Anniversary and ends in underworld but if you want my advise do NOT ever touch those because they are worthless. the only and only Tomb raider which worths playing is Legend which is truely a LEGEND!what i love the most about this game is the sound tracks			"

With the controls out of the way, the puzzle solving elements are a lot of fun especially when interspersed with the occasional action.			"

The ledges and poles you have to climb and jump on don't tell you right in your face to press said  button to reach the area, which is what I like in my puzzle platformers.In addition to the fun puzzles to solve they're not as time consuming as the previous games, which was probably the only bits in its prequels I disliked.

												While in my opinion this is the weakest of the Crystal Dynamics' Tomb Raider games, it is still one of the best game in the whole series and I would really suggest it to anyone who wants to play through all of them. Puzzles are pretty easy compared to the original series and the game is more linear overall but the whole thing feels finished and smooth, all of the locations are nice even in 2016. Combat did not age so well but I would not say it is horrible, that motorcycle though... well you can cope with it, trust me. "

												The ""Next Generation Content"" is mostly broken with missing and corrupt textures throughout the game, particularly in Japan, Ghana and especially Kazakhstan, the most badly affected, where the game will certainly crash on any modern P.C. This game will also crash in other places at random.You could get around these crashes by turning off the ""next generation content"" (from the Xbox 360) but that makes me wonder why they thought the next generation content was fit to be included in such a broken state.Everything else is intact, although the controller support is a bit sketchy. For example in the objects menu, you can only use the arrow keys to rotate each object. For some reason this part of the menu interface doesn't support controllers.Overall, a classic game marred by some broken features on P.C.			"

												I remember liking this game on the ps2 when I was a kid so I decided to buy the game on steam to replay it. After playing hundreds of games since that time this game now is just so painfully average. The plot is so cliché and mediocre. Apart from Lara who is great in this game, everyone else is either generic, boring, annoying and cliché like the story.  The main reason why this game is so average is because the gameplay doesn’t do anything to separate itself in a unique way from other games in the same genre. The shooting is as basic as it can get. The platforming, puzzles and boss fights are also just very basic and uninteresting to play through. There are some fun moments in the level design and visiting some locations like Ghana was cool but it wasn’t enough to save this game. 5/10 (Average)			"

												I have heard many good things about this game over the years, so I was pretty excited to finally try it (having rediscovered my enthusiasm for the series with a replay of each game recently). Those good things I've heard have been wrong, unfortunately.The camera angles are the worst offender of the game, and ruin the entire experience. The camera wants to move at all times, because (downpoint #2) this game is more concerned with being an interactive film than an actual game. The controls might have actually worked alright as well if it weren't for the heavy reliance on the camera to be exactly where it needs to be at any given time. As it turned out, this issue plagued the overall gameplay even further when jumping from one place to another.I could speak to many other problems I came across, but none of them come close to the ones I've mentioned above. The game is lightyears better than Angel of Darkness, but there aren't many games out there that aren't. So, in summation, this is not the return to form I had hoped it would be, and while I will probably stick it out to the end (as I've also heard it's rather short), it does not make me look forward to playing the next two entries.5/10			"

												Cannot recommend. You easily can get stuck in a way where you have to restart from your last manual save - which may have been a long long time ago. Being stuck with no way forward or backwards without having to redo >4h of gameplay, this game seems broken to me. Very Old School... Graphics, being ported from the console game, were outdated in 2006 - now they are only borderline acceptable. As ist the genral disease with this game series, the controls are controller based, and imperfectly ported to the PC - though that is much worse in the 2013 Tomb Raider and ROTTR. Because of the lack of the ""Tomb Raider"" Vision in later sequels the riddles are much more challenging, while the rest of the game seems for todays standards primitive and unimaginative. What is really horrible game design is that - due to the way saves are implemented - you can get stuck in a way where you have to restart from your last manual save - which may have been a long long time ago.

												Tomb Raider Legend. A game I bought at release when it came out and finished 4 hours later wondering ""is that it?""Contrary to the previous games, TR Legend is a straight up action shooter with sporadic puzzles. Most of the more challenging puzzles are strictly optional and the ones you are required to complete have little thinking involved.Although at the same time I can't blame Eidos for severely dumbing down Tomb Raider. Considering at the time everyone believed the franchise was dead due to Tomb Raider The Angel of Darkness. I can blame them though for making it linear, ""cinematic"", full of QTE's and short. The plot is absolute garbage, filled with extremely flimsy characters. Lara is a very unlikeable character who's entire motivation throughout the story is her mommy issues. All the player's sidekicks are annoying and serve to waste the player's time with needless exposition. I found myself sympathising significantly more with the villains of Legend than I did the protagonists, at least they had some personality.It really did mark a huge shift in this series from it's puzzle platforming roots, into it's big budget linear cover shooter successors. Thankfully Crystal Dynamics did redeem themselves with Anniversary but took another nosedive with Underworld and TR2013.			"

												The game is fun, but it has a tendency to occasionally crash the computer or cause a blue screen. I've tried everything people have suggested - update my drivers, turn off AA, turn on Vsync, etc, but there appears to be no fix that I can find to this issue, and looking it up on google has provided no real results on how to fix it.The platforming in the game for the most part is pretty great, and like Anniversary, it's what you're here for. The combat on the other hand is weak - it's not fun at all, but it takes up a decent portion of the game. There are also two motorcycle sections which again, are pretty weak. The puzzles are pretty basic, there were a few that I got stuck on, but not for very long. To get the golden relics however is a much more challenging task, and if you want a difficult puzzle, then they're right up your alley.However, due to the issues mentioned above, I wouldn't recommend the game. Anniversary had the same issue as well, and if I were to buy it, I'm sure Underworld would also have the same issue. If you don't care about the potential for your computer to blue screen or crash, then I still would recommend Tomb Raider: Anniversary over this one, that is a much better game overall.			"

												Tomb Raider has finally returned after years of dormancy after the Angel of Darkness killed off the IP. Thankfully, this game brings Lara back to light and attempts to reconnect her with her Tomb Raiding roots with a brand new engine and great graphics. Lara Croft herself has also recieved a makeover, looking similar to Angelina Jolie unfortunetly. The gameplay has been refined to accomodate the new engine and it feels very fresh. Lara now navigates a more realistic world that finally doesn't look like it was made in minecraft. The combat now features a reticule lockon that helps show players who they are aiming at and features some cool new combat moves like jumping off of enemies and kicking them around. Lara also has a grappling hook which is used quite a lot in the game. The only problem i have with this game is that it feels more like an action game than a tomb raider game. There's no more animals to shoot at aside from like... two panthers. There's very few traps. There's epic music constantly playing like you're in some adventure movie, and worst of all is your new partners in crime. That's right... you have people yelling in your ear now telling you exactly what to do. They tell you obvious hints, they comment about everything you do, they won't shut up! It takes away from what made the original games so great, the silence of exploring a cave alone in the dark with animals jumping out and killing you.			"

												I'm not completely sure whether or not to recommend this game, because of the flaws it has, several of which are actually quite frustrating. But on the other hand I did finish it, so while they annoyed me, I still did enjoy the game and kept playing, so from that point of view, the good parts outweighed the issues.This is the first Tomb Raider game I've played, so I don't have any ""Tomb Raider Standards"" set in place. Keep that in mind.So, before we get into what the issues are, let's look at the basics. Tomb Raider: Legend is an action platformer, with some mild puzzles in it. When I say mild puzzles, it's because while there's quite a few puzzles scattered around, they're really simple to do, and you're often told how to do them just to make matters worse. It's like, you come to place you can't reach and the game just outright goes ""Hm, if only I could find something to stand on to get up there""; before you even give it a try yourself. You have a pair of binoculars that can go into a special mode, where you can focus on certain highlighted objects (the important ones) and know whether they can be pushed, are mechanisms, are fragile, or such. You hardly need to though, because it doesn't take an expert to guess that a box can be pushed and moved around. The game even sometimes tell you that ""Hey, I bet I can push this"". So yea, very mild puzzling.The action parts are mainly gun combat and twice in the game, a stage where you're on a motorcycle. Seems pretty standard, and the motorcycle would add some variety to the gameplay. That's what you'd think, right ?We'll get more into that later.Thirdly, and most importantly, is the platforming. Platforming is pretty much the core of the game. With ledges to grab on to, a grappling hook to fly around with, ropes to climb and jump from, and such. It's pretty fun once you get a hang of it, and it's probably the main attraction, alongside exploring tombs and other interesting locations, and sometimes dodging traps while you're at it.The controls though, can be a little weird at times. I highly suggest rebinding the keys if playing with a keyboard, because you do not want to play with default controls. They're so weirdly configured, it's like they were chosen by a randomizer, even going as far as using ""k"" as the grenade button. Yea, ""k"". Rebind them first chance you get, trust me. It makes it more enjoyable, when you know you're able to actually do things.That all being said, let's look at the issues mentioned earlier. First issue, is sadly, the platforming. Not all of it, most of it is pretty solid. The ropes more specifically, are what we're looking at here. Oh god, the ropes. I have died so many times because Lara refused to grab onto the rope I jumped at. Sometimes they work, other times they just don't feel like it and you'll phase through them. Doesn't help the game uses a checkpoint based save system, so if you go through a bunch of stuff, and then fail at a rope, you'll have to do it all again. The checkpoints are fairly generous though, so it's not that big of a deal. Personally, it only affected me once or twice, but man, having to redo the same part over and over, just because Lara refuses to use the rope, is infuriating.Next up is the camera. Being that this a 3D platforming game, there's bound to be issues with the camera. It's just a rule, seemingly. You control the camera with your mouse, and for the most part, that works just fine believe it or not. It's quite responsive and you can look at what you want. Unfortunately, sometimes the camera just decides to turn 180 on you, and if you don't notice then whoops, down that platform you go.On the bright side, the game does have an auto-grab feature with ledges, where you for the most part will catch on, so it won't kill you... Much... Just annoy you a little.Thirdly is the aforementioned motorcycle stages. Oh boy, where do I begin with these? These parts are so, so boring. The terrain is basically the same bits that just keeps looping for seemingly forever (most noticable in the second one) and they just keep going and going. Sometimes, once you reach certain ""key points"", something new will appear and you'll think ""oh thank you, is it finally over?"" But alas, no, it keeps going after it for a while too. You'll also be fighting a bunch of badguys on motorcycles of their own here, but you just spam your gun at them till they flail all over the ground and leave you be.Really, these stages really dragged down the overall enjoyment of the game for me, just because they were so boring, repetitive, and just kept on going and going. Worst part about them, they're really stingy about checkpoints, so if you screw up (you're bound to out of boredom) you'll have to redo it. FUN!The camera also sometimes messes up here, and it's really slow at turning, so if it does, you're in trouble.Thankfully, there's only two of them, and only one of them really drags on. The first one isn't as bad, but it's not really good either.And finally, the grappling hook. Yup, there's issues with this thing too. Not really too many, just one. The fact that if you, while on it, touch ANY wall, you'll instantly detach. That there, is something I do not understand, and it WILL get you killed if you think you're on it, but touch the floor (yup) and detach and keep moving forward. Goodbye life, hello spike pit.In order to move up and down on it, you press up (w) and the use key (e by default). If you do this quick enough, you wont crash into the floor you just stood on, but that's really dumb that you have to do that. If you use it while swinging from stuff, it's perfectly fine.Just, don't touch any walls. Ever. It's very shy.The last thing to discuss is the gunplay and combat. It's pretty bland. The AI isn't amazing; they just shoot at you, throw a grenade now and then, and maybe hide behind cover. Sometimes they move around, other times they just stare at you from the open. The way it works, is that you enter a ""lock on"" mode (g by default), where the game will lock you onto a target (closest target) and then you just press the trigger, or hold it down. It'll auto swap to another target if the current one dies and you hover over a new one (or if you aim too far away). It's pretty simple, pretty generic and pretty easy.You can free aim if you want, but you're unable to move while doing so, for whatever reason. Good thing is though, you can move around and roll around in combat, without losing the lock on, so even tho it's pretty easy, you can still look like a badass while shooting people and rolling around all over the place. The shooting isn't the game's strongpoint, by any means.The boss battles are also pretty straight forward.There is hidden stuff to collect scattered around the levels, and getting to it can actually be quite fun. There's also a time trial mode, where you'll race the levels, to see how fast you can beat them. So there is replayability, if you're into those kinds of things.So overall, it's an okay platformer, with some generic shooting in it, a couple of issues and some boring looping stages. It's still fun tho, if you like platformers. Just, don't expect to need to think too deeply over puzzles.I'd recommend it if you got the money to spare and want an overall pretty enjoyable platforming experience, with some tomb exploration, trap dodging and item gathering. Else, you probably wont be missing out on much by skipping it. There's also a story in there, but I wouldn't say it's something writing home about. I personally got it for sale and had my fun with it, so that might be a factor to consider.It does have some nice scenic views for you to look at, so if that's something you're into, that's another plus for you.

												Never was really a fan of the tomb raider series, but that's because of the gameplay. The combat is irrelevant and ridiculous, the bullets go every where like your having a panic attack everytime you shoot. Then, while trying to jump from 1 rope to the other, you get to the last rope (if your're lucky), the 10th time mind you, and you take your time lining up and getting the height right, and...........no, you fall to your death again, and again, and again, and again........which is only one example of many scenarios just like that. I like the puzzles, but the checkpoint system paired with the utterly useless game mechanic that make it so easy to consistently fail no matter how meticulous you are, is the main reason I dislike the whole series. Sometimes, you just want to get on with it instead of falling yet again as you jump to something and just go right through it, but you can't restart at that chockepoint, you have to do some other sequences over and over just to get back to the parts where the game falls apart.It's really hit or miss, so that's why I think you see people that never had a problem with it, although I'm skeptical about that, and people that hate it because of the unpredictability of whether something is going to work or not based on a pixel or two difference in position. I have better things to do with my time, like take out the garbage than play a game that forces you to fail consistantly and repeatedly just to move on to another annoying quirky sequence. If the system was a little more forgiving (as in you actually grab the rope/ledge you just landed on or went straight through) then the game could be enjoyed for what it is good at, exploring tombs and ruins and figuring out puzzles.After a while, well a very short while, it's difficult to find a reason to play any tomb raider game instead of something else that's infinitely less annoying.

												I'm a big fan of Tomb Raider, and I loved Legend on the 360, but the port of this is so bad. It crashes constantly, and there are all sorts of visual errors. The game itself is good, but who cares if it won't run properly? I spent half my time trouble shooting, and regardless of my efforts the game was prone to crashing. Whether I disabled Data Execution Prevention, or next gen effects, it didn't matter. The thing still was unstable as hell.			"

												There are 2 Tom Raider games you can skip playing: Angel of Darkness and  Legend. Legend is 40% forced, tedious shootouts, 20% even more tedious bossfights and racing levels and 10% stupid QTE. What remains are small areas to explore with embarrisingly easy puzzles, that only take so much time to solve because of the terrible camera positioning. Not to mention the in-level copy and paste architecture. Do yourself a favour and just watch the cutscenes on Youtube if you want the story and save yourself the time. This is not worth your time. Underworld is ten times better.			"

												Even though the price is low, don't waste your money here. Tomb Raider: Legend is a fantastic game, but during the King Arthur mission (when Lara is making her way back to Zip and Allistair to save them, fighting goons along the way) the game encounters a fatal error, without fail (every time it is played). Since the game loads from the checkpoint, I literally have 2-3 secs gameplay, max. Then it just crashes to desktop.I've looked up and tried pretty much everything, including the DEP solution, but nothing works. I've installed a CD copy a friend had in another folder on the same hard drive to ensure it wasn't just the hard drive, but that copy of the game works just fine, confirming that the issue is indeed with Steam. Yes, I have updated my graphics drivers, yes, there is nothing wrong with my RAM, etc.By all means, purchase the game, just don't buy it from Steam. As I understand, they don't give refunds either (not that the $7 refund would make a difference at this point). Just for reference, here are system specs;Intel Core i7-3630@2.4GHz16BG Corsair Vengeance, @1600MHz RAMNvidia GeForce GTX 660M1TB WD Caviar HDD, 7200RPM			"

												The characters were stupid with a 90s grudge feel, and the starting and stopping for boring cut scenes is always annoying.The many of he puzzles were a game of hide and seek, for explain in one lvl you needed three bolders, and the last one was behind you from where you came from, hidden to the side and you needed to pull down a structure to get it. Wasn't really a puzzle, but it seems developers weren't interested in making puzzles and this repeats alot.Enemies were pointless. I played it on medium, and you could just run up to enemies and shoot them in the face one by one without ever dying because you took such little damage and they rarely hit you.The controls were frustrating as hell made worse that even by the noughties they were still not adapting PC games for controllers.The game was also very buggy. Does not seem to like windows 10.			"

												I am not recommending purely to be the devil's advocate. The graphics are still OK by 2015 standards and gameplay is fine and consistent with the newer Tomb Raider titles. My first gripe, as with many people are the awful controls that let you down often. Especially the final battle it is so hard getting Lara to do anything. Another gripe is the nature of some of the puzzles. A good puzzle is where you know what needs to be achieved and need to go about finding a way to get there. Some of the puzzles in Legend are not really puzzles in this way. You sometimes have no idea what you are trying to achieve and only have a few interactable elements to play with. You basically just work things together until something happens. On saying this, this game is certainly worth a few bucks and provides several hours of fun.			"

												I heard so much good about this game... But I was so disappointed by what I got.I had high expectations for this game. It was made to sound like the best Tomb Raider game. If this really is the best, I'm never revisiting any of the games any more. There were two problems that kept me from really enjoying it:1. Third person perspective. The camera angles at times made the game difficult to play as you can't really see very well, as Lara Croft is in the way. Third person was never my thing, but this game is worse about it than most third person titles I've played. Sometimes I need to turn the camera around, and what I end up seeing is a weird blotted screen where Croft's skin sticks out in little polygon shapes. Like how am I supposed to see with this? I can't see a thing because it keeps getting STUCK!2. SO MANY BUGS! In fact, there's a bug that won't even let me beat the second level. It's literally not even possible. I have consulted walkthrough after walkthrough thinking maybe I did it wrong. Nope. I didn't. I can hook the  column with the ball on top of it day long and pull all the way out. It won't even budge. Also, Stretchy hair (I had this over half of the time, and it added to the aforementioned problems with the games perspective). Even Bugthesda can't rival the bugs here. Crystal Dynamics apparently can't debug a game. Sure this only had two really bad bugs, but when one of them prevents you from actually beating the game, it is beyond miserable. They were also both LESS THAN AN HOUR APART!Honestly, this game wasn't even good to start with. The plotline is hard to follow and poorly explained. Sure I'm at the beginning, but not even being able to comprehend the plotline is inexcusable. Also, the graphics were pretty bad even for the time. MGS2 had better graphics than this. It was released 5 years earlier. Not good. What about the character lineup? Not much to say here, as the characters in general are pretty poorly developed, even for 2 hours in. I would rant, but it would have loads of spoilers. The game's puzzles were debateably too easy, and the shooting sections felt really awkward and misdone, and that didn’t help at all.I'm not writing this to trash the game. I enjoyed the parts I could, but the bugs and the camera angles always got in the way. I can't believe this released for blockbuster prices 10 years ago, because I only payed $1.74 to play it, and I have to say it wasn't worth it. I only got a buggy game that could be played up to what's supposedly the easiest puzzle in the game . I can't believe that so many led me to waste my time. Not Bubsy bad, but still miserable. "

												Really enjoyed this when I played it the first time (bought it as a DVD-ROM) and bought the Steam copy so I could finally go fully digital with my collection.It could well be that I had forgotten the game (or that Underworld was a much better game), but I found this edition a bit clunky. Also hilarious bugs with Lara's ever expanding ponytail which seems to have a real life of its own.The story is ok. Some of the locations are beautiful and immersive but not nearly as good as Anniversary. I also found some of the controls were counter intuitive (although not half as bad as Last Revelation) and some sections did suffer from situations being resolved through an underused ability (although, again, not half as bad as the shambles which was Chronicles). Boss battles are ridiculous and dull - Japan's is mindnumbing as you hide behind a rock and slowly chip away at the Boss' health.All in all not a bad little game, but definitely not as good as Anniversary or Underworld. Buy if you're a fan and if it's discounted.			"

												I cant even begin to explain how bad this pc port is, it's just badfirst: most of the controls are wierd and hard to maneuversecond:most of the default keys dont work and cant change them.third: some parts are undoable if you dont have a controller, like i would try to use the binnoculars for the 3 crate puzzle, cant use the binnoculars, when i try to place the crate on the see-saw i cant because the controls are wierd as ♥♥♥♥.Just don't buy it if you dont have a controller, if you get the game in the bundle, thats great, just dont buy the game a la carte.

												5.5/10Actual playtime: About 15 hours*This AAA game seemingly has it all - great graphics (at least for the time), nice voice acting, music, action & combat, a large variety of exotic locations. The problem is, it just doesn't add up. I found the puzzles to be tacked on, and didn't care about the characters or the story. I just waited for it to finish and played an hour or so here and there throughout the course of a few months. It was grueling and I don't know why I insisted to finish the game.* Note that the milestone-based saving system is terrible, so I just left the game minimized throughout much of this period (even went abroad a few time during). this is the reason for the insanely high ""hrs on record"". I estimate that I played this game for about 9 or 10 hours. I wish I could get this time back.			"

												Re-reviewA pale shadow compared to the greatness of Tomb Raider 1/2.Firstly, the sense of isolation is gone. She always having chatty convos with side characters with removes the forboding sense, and they almost always say obviose cliche lines. They are boring. Secondly, for some reason, they keep putting QTE's in these games, under the bizzare impression gamers like them. Many sequences in Tomb Raider 1/2 that would require player input to escape, and now movies with arrow keys popping up. In short, it's garbage. Thirdly, the game is very linear now with an obviose path. You won't be stopping to explore, or backtracking or using your brain like Tomb Raider 1/2, the secrets usually when hidden in those games are now usually 2 feet of the beaten path in a corner. In short, crap. The game also has crap vehical sequences. These existed in Tomb Raider 2, and handled poorly, but you had freedom to move around the enviroment and get off as you please. Now you go in a linear straight line while baddies line up to be shot. It's crap. Before, you selected one of multiple weapons, now you just hold two weapons at a time picking them up as you go through contrived battle sequences. Danger is basically non existent as you get checkpoint, checkpoint, checkpoint, checkpoint, checkpoint, are you ok? Checkpoint. Everything now requires a cutscene. Walking into a new area? Cutscene. About to face a mob? Cutscene. About to face a boss? Cutscene. Pulls a lever? Cutscene. A platforming section? Cutscene. The player isn't allow to take things in for themselves anymore, all highly controlled. The good? Well, it controls better. It looks nice for an decade old game and Lara as a character is stil as cool as ever. This is a very dissapointing game that while doesn't totally ruin the francise, is heavily dumbed down removing much of the magic of the first two games. Pick it up during a sale, but don't expect much if you enjoyed the originals, Crystal Dynamics do not hold a candle to Core Design.			"

												Even for 2006 this game is just a piece of rubbish. Although it has some interesting levels in terms of puzzles, it feels like I am playing sorta woman version of Rambo plus GTA stiched together and if that was not bad enough then the awful physics and camera are just what tip the balance of what could have been a nice game. Graphics are alright, I am not that crazy about graphics anyway plus at that time that was just normal type of graphics. But oh my God the moronic levels with the bikes... Playing on hardest difficulty I was astonished to find I could not change the difficulty level which almost made me break my keyboard especially when trying to beat the Kazakhstan train chase level... It was just an awful combination of incredibly lame physics, really, extremely poor camera rotation, strong enemies that could take me down in 2 shots, stupid game mechanics which were so buggy (almost all the time I could not change the target I was trying to shoot which resulted in Lara trying to shoot at some bike behind a SUV or other obstacle 50 feet away instead of the guy who is just in front). And on top of that, the level was so ANNOYINGLY long... I had to be shot down like 50 times before I passed the FIRST part only to find out I had to shoot my way through swarms of bikers and SUV drivers all over again. Puzzles are okay, graphics are just about right, but that moronic GTA-like Rambo style part is what really really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. That is why I do NOT recommend this game. Try Aniversary, or Underworld if your PC can't handle the newest TRs out there. But if you skip Legend, you won't be missing much.			"

												The game play can get a little monotonous after you see a lot of clones of the same monsters over and over. Some of the puzzles are fun, but a couple of them expect you to die over and over in order to figure them out. It doesn't take very long to re-spawn and take another crack at them but its still annoying seeing a loading screen four times to complete one puzzle that has a special stipulation or asks you to complete it very quickly. If you get this game cheaply like I did then I recommend it, otherwise not.			"

												First played this game when I was six. After I found it on Steam, I decided to buy it and it's really nostalgic. I never realised how bad the graphics were back then but dispite that, it's still a really fun game. the controls and shooting mechanics are quite different than I'm used to but it's no big deal. Ps, don't play it if you have terrible common sense. I once spent an hour trying to figure out how to get through a gate.			"

												It makes me very sad to see Lara given a group of men to work with. Since when did she need anyone to hold her hand? still, at least they were assistants back at the manor rather than adventuring buddies.The game was as much fun as every Tomb Raider game is, really. A nice little platformer with the odd fight thrown in. They tossed in a few quicktime events as well, which is sad. I always find it more fun to do the cool things yourself rather than watch a cut scene and occasionally press a button during it. The story was very predictable too. But even with predictability holding it back, it was enough to hold my attention.While it was fun, and quite enjoyable, I don't think it holds any replay value. The story's been told, after all. Tomb Raider, for me, has always been on the same level in my mind as Indiana Jones, though. Light, fun fluff. In spite of the negatives, it was fun			"

												TR: Legend is probably my favourite TR game, and to be honest I don't know why. TRU has better graphics and ruin design, TRA has probably better controls. The story itself has a big drawback, because it leaves a big open ending. I think what makes TRL so special are the characters. Lara very often talks to her helpers, Zip and Alister, through the earplug and every time they speak it's a lot of fun. I had a lot of laugh when they comment something ironicaly or scream when Lara makes another of her live-threatening stunts. All in all, I can definitely recommend this game to someone that wants a lot of fun and puzzles.			"

												An amazing game for fans of the Tomb Raider series. Though it has it's hiccups here and there with the camera angels and the physics, but it makes up for that in story and gameplay. The graphics and the puzzles will test you. Though the game isn't really that long, took me around 11 hours to beat it, it's still great to go back and try to find all the hidden stuff in the levels. Also it doesn't require a powerful computer to get 60 fps. I have Intel Core2 Duo 2.2Ghz and 64MB Vram. I run this great as long as I lower some of the settings a bit. I'd recommend this game to anybody. Buy it!!!			"

												This game is not only a breakthrough, but also the one of the easiest games I ever played.In Tomb Raider Legend, we are once again reunited with our beloved friend and heroine Lara Croft who has been 'looking for certain artifacts for some time'.Unlike in the previous Tomb Raider Games (Tomb Raider I through Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness) in Tomb Raider Legend, we see a HUGE update in graphics with Lara looking spectacular.And she is not alone either! Joining her on her quest for the thrill of discovery and adventure are a few of her good friends, one of them already being familiar to us.The combat system is new and improved, although the one disappointment of this game is not being able to carry more than two different weapons at a time (Your standard pistols a secondary weapon).On the flip side however, this adds to the realism of Lara's world as in the real world, people would be limited as to the number of weapons he or she could carry around. In addition to this, there are plenty of rewards to be had, including upgrades, lots of outfits, and other such rewards.Another annoyance is the way the game runs (Or fails to run) sometimes, resulting in help needed if the game crashes. I am usually able to keep it up and running, although I have had problems with it running in the past.The game is rather short and straightforward and unlike in some earlier Tomb Raider Games, you are not able to return to the exact same location after having finished it with the exception of one location.Overall, this game has a few challenges here and there, and a lot of the dialogue is witty with some of it being dramatic and a little melancholy. However, I must say, this is by far the easiest Tomb Raider Game I ever played.Try the demo and see if you like it and then if you like it, buy the full version!			"

												This is an awesome game! This is the ultimate original tomb raider experience, it is not as hard as underworld and you know what you are meant to be doing. The game itself is fluent and has fast animations unlike the older tomb raider games especially Tomb Raider the angle of Darkness. Lara is also intutive, she is acts tough and is much friendler than the previous Tomb Raider games. Overall I feel that this is a great game and certainly a must buy if you are getting into the older tomb raider games!			"

												Being one of my favourite games Tomb Raider Legend never ceased to amaze me, the game features the long avaited return from The Angel Of Darkness the action packed heroine and one and only Lara Croft. The game never fails to keep your attention with it's puzzling way and gripping story. Lara can be customised with many different types and varieties of clothing all of which are higly detailed considering the date in which the game was realsed in. Armed with her dual pistols, wisdom, cunning ways and many accessories she has the task of stopping countless mercinaries and even mythical beings. This game is definitely worth your money.			"

												Really good game, length of game is good, not very short or long. Depends how you play really. I didn't run across any problems at all. I ran this game on full 1920x1080p HD resolution even with Next Generation Content ""On"" along with other graphics options.TIP: If you have a high-end machine, you won't have any problems running full textured detail. If you have a standard system, then turn off the Next Gen Content for much better fps, even turn off Antialiasing, also turn off V-Sync since it does hinder some performance.It's a good game, not one of the best, but it's a good game worth playing! :) Goodluck			"

												About 4 years ago i had played my first tomb raider. That game was Angel of Darkness. It left a bad taste in my mouth and i never really went back to it. After playing Angel Of Darkness, i wanted to avoid playing tomb raider because it kinda gave it a bad reputation from my point of view. but browsing through the steam store, i noticed that this game was on sale, it was very cheap. so i gave it a shot. i wasn't expecting much after playing Angel of Darkness. And holy crap, was i suprised. This game is fun. like... really fun. I never really thought about playing it untill now. i should of played this a long time ago.Rating: 9/10			"

												After playing Tomb Raider: Anniversary, this part of the Tomb Raider Saga fails to succeed it's sequel, although it is clearly a large improvement over the infamous Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness.Even though the game features different locations all over the world it also lacks the actual feeling of being an actual 'tomb raider'; the levels are very often urban oder industrial structures, for example a devastated soviet laboratory in the ice desert of Kazahkstan or a yakuza penthouse in Tokio. Furthermore the leveldesign is not as challenging as it is in other titles of the series. The puzzles are too easy and the focus on combat is too big. The playtime for a walkthroug with about 5 hours for a skilled player is devinately pretty low.It's not a bad game, you can really see how the developers tried to bring a new refreshed version of a Tomb Raider game and in this point they did a good job, it's still a fun game. But for me, there is plenty of possibilitys to improve. I would still recommend it because if you can overlook the fact, that this game does not try to bring you the original Tomb Raider feeling but instead it tries to bring you a new expierience, you will have a good time. Even though it's not great.			"

												Tomb Raider game that made me fall in love with Lara all over again. Despite the incredible reboot few years later, this is still my favorite Tomb Raider game to date. -You get to experience varied locations from exotic South America and Africa to cold Kazahstan and urban Japan. This game has all the locations you would want a TR game to cover. - Keeley Hawes brings Lara to life with her beautiful voice, great acting and posh English accent to fall in love with. With all the respect to all LC actresses, Keeley Hawes is still the best of them all. - (Without spoiling it) The story is actually interesting and well put together.- Great soundtrack, that matches each location.

												Perfect would sum up this game in all factors, tomb raider has always been my favourite series of games though i didnt get into them originally; but instead through underworld. I didn't exactly finish underworld at that time and searched through the games for one that looked interesting; and i found legend. Legend is a very short though action thriller packed adventure where Lara Croft has to find the pieces of the excalibur to find the truth of her mothers dissapearance as a child prior to the story, if you are looking for a game with great replayability you are well on your way. Play this now, you won't regret it.			"

												Personally this game was a mixed bag for me, although if you get it cheap like I did, I don't feel too bad about it. I don't feel that this game is for TR fans only. If you like jumping puzzles and navigating traps, this game will leave you satisfied. Plot wasn't too bad as I didn't lose interest mid-way but nothing spectacular. Graphics are actually surprisingly good, especially with regards to character modelling. It also allowed controler use, which in some case works better for this game imo. However, there are quite a few flaws with this game. One of the biggest flaws of this game is the movement.  Add to that another issue, the camera. For a game about tombs, you would expect a bit more from the camera when you run into corners or objects. Unfortunately, the camera can bug out and can give you views as close as inside Laura's head, or zoom out to behind a random pillar that happen to be inline with the camera, only for you to find out that you are stuck on some other object. Movement is supposed to be relative to where the camera is facing, however it frequently shifts to be relative to where Laura is facing especially when you turn the camera while she is moving. This really becomes an issue in fights, be it with minions or bosses, when you need to figure out where they are.These two combined create quite an infuriating experience for specific parts of the game:  jumping from ropes/pipes: I had to swap back to mouse and keyboard because Laura kept jumping whereever she faced, and missed if she was slightly off. For some reason this issue went away with mouse and keyboard, which was a pain because the UI is significantly better suited for a controller. driving: The camera goes haywire in those stages. It's relatively slow to turn but you need to turn to lock-on to enemies. gun fights: Running around a cluttered area and having objects pan into view front of you is quite frequent. Dodging grenades can be an issue as well, due to scripted rolling movements that add about a second to the movement. This could mean getting hit by the grenade, getting caught in a 2 second scripted movement of her getting up and riddled with bullets. If you roll towards the camera, you can also inadvertantly get caught into a ""corner"", and then need to turn her the right way to get out. boss fights (particularly the last one): Largely the same issue as gunfights, but only for the last boss. This one has a clutter battlemap and a lot of dodging required, meaning your view goes haywire with pillars panning into view and getting knocked into corners by its attacks (its attacks are AOE which can knock you into the air). Scripted rolling movement when you have about a second to dodge can bite you a lot and scripted movement of Laura recovering allow you to get hit multiple times without a way to dodge. Also, you die when you fall off the platform, so you need to be incredibly cautious about where Laura is facing when you initiate a dodge. For some reason, she can sometimes fail to grapple the edge when you maunally walk or roll off by accident (for this level only) While I commended the graphics earlier, the are some graphical and texturing glitches in the game. The level in Kazakhstan has portions where I can see through the Earth. There are also issues where you can simply jump through objects if you jumped at the wrong spot and angle. Also, there are cases where enabling ""Next Generation Content"" can crash the game randomly, so if it does crash, try playing with that option first.This review is a bit of a rant, however I did enjoy this game for the most part except for the last 3 boss fights. Puzzles were fun and the game does look nice. It's really the two aforementioned issues that plague the game, at specific areas. If you can get this game cheap, I do recommend it and give it a playthrough.			"

												If you like your Tomb Raider, old school, with lots of falling to your death and shooting exotic wildlife in the face, this is for you. It's a bit short but it's not expensive. Plays nice with an Xbox360 controller. I recommend turing off the ""Next Gen"" features. If you look in the discussion threads, you can find a patch but even then, it's too glitchy.Brace yourself for inconsistent collisions. You can shoot through some fences, but not other, identical fences. The shooting was never Tomb Raider's strong point but for a 2006 game, it feels a little like a Dreamcast game like Dynamite Cop. That's not necessarity a bad thing.The story is pretty lousy. I kind of zoned out, to be honest. There are some quicktime action sequences which are rather pointless. There are serious bugs all over the place so you may have to refer to a walkthrough here and there.But even with all it's flaws, if feel just a little bit like Tomb Raider 2 and that's enough for me to recommend it.

												Having played the most recent Tomb Raider reboot, I had low expectations for its aged predecessor. Quite honestly, I was suprised, if you can get past the dated graphics, which I very rarely have a  problem with, TR Legend is an addicting, solid game that willl keep you engaged throughout its lengthy story. The story takes you across a number of very interesting environments, to name a few, you have to navigate frozen rivers, climb through a Japanese city, and slide down dunes in the desert. It never sticks to one single mechanic or setting for too long, before it becomes boring, you are whisked away to another section of the earth, which is usually coupled with a new gadget, type of puzzle, or platforming element that expands on the game. Minor complaints include a generally jerky camera, which will sometimes force you to complete jumps you really can't see, and some puzzles which can require you to run to google to find the answers (I had to do that once, I'm afraid). Occasional boss fights can be frustrating, but are rewarding when you finally expose their weakness and kill them. Combat isn't anything to recomend, it involves locking onto a character and circle strafing constantly while occasionally jumping to throw them off, but the developers were aware of this and made the platforming and puzzle solving the highlight of the game. Fortunately, these two features are executed perfectly, and make this game a must-buy even with its differences from the reboot. If you find it on sale, which I did for less than 2 dollars, you have virtually no execuse. Do it.			"

The graphics are ahead of it's time really smoothe and clean. The puzzles and bosses can you♥♥♥♥♥♥you off.... which I love because the older games were actually difficult. Games nowadays are great in their own way seems as if they hold your hand to much. Anyways I'm getting off subject this is classic Tomb Raider puzzles/adventure/ difficult and beautifal graphics. I have it on max settings and its just as purdy as some games coming out presently. Bottom Line is get this if your a Tomb Raider fan.			"

												It makes me very sad to see Lara given a group of men to work with. Since when did she need anyone to hold her hand? still, at least they were assistants back at the manor rather than adventuring buddies.The game was as much fun as every Tomb Raider game is, really. A nice little platformer with the odd fight thrown in. They tossed in a few quicktime events as well, which is sad. I always find it more fun to do the cool things yourself rather than watch a cut scene and occasionally press a button during it. The story was very predictable too. But even with predictability holding it back, it was enough to hold my attention.While it was fun, and quite enjoyable, I don't think it holds any replay value. The story's been told, after all. Tomb Raider, for me, has always been on the same level in my mind as Indiana Jones, though. Light, fun fluff. In spite of the negatives, it was fun			"

												An amazing game for fans of the Tomb Raider series. Though it has it's hiccups here and there with the camera angels and the physics, but it makes up for that in story and gameplay. The graphics and the puzzles will test you. Though the game isn't really that long, took me around 11 hours to beat it, it's still great to go back and try to find all the hidden stuff in the levels. Also it doesn't require a powerful computer to get 60 fps. I have Intel Core2 Duo 2.2Ghz and 64MB Vram. I run this great as long as I lower some of the settings a bit. I'd recommend this game to anybody. Buy it!!!			"

												This game brings all what's known from Tomb Raider games; yes, forget all the ""go this way"", ""you will need to find this item"", ""this is the only way to complete something"" popular indicators in all games nowadays; this game has the old school mechanics about going into tombs finding keys to open and discover ancient stuff while going through the story. Also if you are one of those who like collecting stuff, there are a lot of hidden collectibles throughout the whole game, most of them unlock stuff, like new outfits for Lara, artwork, etc. In addition, you have the shooting part of it and if you played the previous games you know this is not the strong side of it; but hey! you can always have a blast shooting enemies, wild animals, etc. Among other things the Croft Manor is available and begs to be explore (hint: there is stuff to find in there too). The voice acting and cut scenes could be better, but then again we are talking about a game from 2006.If you enjoyed the previous games, this one will not be a disappointment at all; having that said, what are you waiting for? join Lara Croft in her incredible quest!...

												This game is not only a breakthrough, but also the one of the easiest games I ever played.In Tomb Raider Legend, we are once again reunited with our beloved friend and heroine Lara Croft who has been 'looking for certain artifacts for some time'.Unlike in the previous Tomb Raider Games (Tomb Raider I through Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness) in Tomb Raider Legend, we see a HUGE update in graphics with Lara looking spectacular.And she is not alone either! Joining her on her quest for the thrill of discovery and adventure are a few of her good friends, one of them already being familiar to us.The combat system is new and improved, although the one disappointment of this game is not being able to carry more than two different weapons at a time (Your standard pistols a secondary weapon).On the flip side however, this adds to the realism of Lara's world as in the real world, people would be limited as to the number of weapons he or she could carry around. In addition to this, there are plenty of rewards to be had, including upgrades, lots of outfits, and other such rewards.Another annoyance is the way the game runs (Or fails to run) sometimes, resulting in help needed if the game crashes. I am usually able to keep it up and running, although I have had problems with it running in the past.The game is rather short and straightforward and unlike in some earlier Tomb Raider Games, you are not able to return to the exact same location after having finished it with the exception of one location.Overall, this game has a few challenges here and there, and a lot of the dialogue is witty with some of it being dramatic and a little melancholy. However, I must say, this is by far the easiest Tomb Raider Game I ever played.Try the demo and see if you like it and then if you like it, buy the full version!			"

												Having played the most recent Tomb Raider reboot, I had low expectations for its aged predecessor. Quite honestly, I was suprised, if you can get past the dated graphics, which I very rarely have a  problem with, TR Legend is an addicting, solid game that willl keep you engaged throughout its lengthy story. The story takes you across a number of very interesting environments, to name a few, you have to navigate frozen rivers, climb through a Japanese city, and slide down dunes in the desert. It never sticks to one single mechanic or setting for too long, before it becomes boring, you are whisked away to another section of the earth, which is usually coupled with a new gadget, type of puzzle, or platforming element that expands on the game. Minor complaints include a generally jerky camera, which will sometimes force you to complete jumps you really can't see, and some puzzles which can require you to run to google to find the answers (I had to do that once, I'm afraid). Occasional boss fights can be frustrating, but are rewarding when you finally expose their weakness and kill them. Combat isn't anything to recomend, it involves locking onto a character and circle strafing constantly while occasionally jumping to throw them off, but the developers were aware of this and made the platforming and puzzle solving the highlight of the game. Fortunately, these two features are executed perfectly, and make this game a must-buy even with its differences from the reboot. If you find it on sale, which I did for less than 2 dollars, you have virtually no execuse. Do it.			"

												Tomb Raider Legend has an interesting storyline (although I don't really think it matters any more since the series has been rebooted again). The game offers a wide range of environments to explore, with each level taking place at a different country, and the game-play seems to vary depending on the level, as some level focus more on attacking enemies, while other level focus on traditional tomb raiding and action adventure. Since this entry was supposed to be the reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise, a lot of changes were made. Some are good and some are not very good. Legend is just very different from Core Design's classic Tomb Raider games overall.However, I have to warn you that this game is very, very SHORT. [Light Spoiler] It contains only 7 major levels and the Croft Manor. In fact,  I think it is the same length as Tomb Raider Chronicles or maybe even shorter. Furthermore, TR Legend only presents the first halves of the Tomb Raider Trilogy story as the second halves of the story is told in Underworld.  To make up for this, this game does contain a lot of bonus contents and secrets. My advice is that if you are new to the series because of Tomb Raider (2013), and you are interested in a game with interesting story , you should play it. If not, you should probably wait for it to be on sale again.			"

												This game was decent but not great unfortunately. This one focused a bit too heavily on combat. While the combat is decent the rest is rather lacking. The scenery is stunning enough but the controls are a bit clonky and like all the old tomb raider games, the camera angles are horrific. Sadly the puzzles are also lacking as their are very few of them. The bosses are annoying as most of them tend to rely on strange physics though this does make them challenging, it doesn't make them fun. The story is not very interesting and you could easily skip it in the series and not miss anything. I know I'm playing the games in reverse but I don't have much of a desire to play really old graphic games with even worse gameplay. Still, worth playing if you bought the whole pack and want to see the series after loving the new Tomb Raider Game. This one, is barely worth your time.			"

												Like Tomb Raider: Anniversary this is one is kinda hard to recommend but I'm only doing so because I found enough enjoyment and challenge out of the game to do so.Controls are FAR better than the old school Tomb Raider games and movement feels much quicker. The core game play is largely still the same however - risky platforming, a few puzzles, and the dual pistols. Combat was fairly worse in my opinion however and for a tomb raider game there is A LOT of it. The core issues with the combat comes from a few factors: (1) Only one extra weapon to use than pistols, which you pick up from humans. Just use assault rifle ALL THE TIME. SMG isn't as strong or accurate and the shotguns range is pathetically short its useless in most situations.(2) 95% or so of the enemies are generic humans with guns. Running out of ammo for your secondary weapon is very uncommon and their AI is essentially to stand in one spot and shoot.(3) Uninspired boss fights. They are mostly shoot and dodge until a brief window opens up to use some gimmick such as a turret, shooting a platform, or swinging a grappling hook at a clearly pointed out object. Most of them are not hard at all and were not that fun.Graphically it isn't anything spectacular but for its age it's fairly solid. There are FAR less bugs than Anniversary but there is one pain in the butt bug you will run into a couple of times that is more or less guaranteed to happen and it will crash your game. Just a heads up to get around this: reload the game, go to settings, turn off the next gen graphics option, play past the part that crashes, then re-enable the setting.So between the crash bug and the often repetitive combat why do I recommend it? Because I still found it interesting enough for a play through. HOWEVER one caveat to that - I generally enjoy tomb raider games. Always did growing up and for the most part still do. If you're not a tomb raider fan and you are not planning on playing the sequel to this (Tomb Raider: Underworld), chances are you won't want to get this unless its on sale for cheap.			"

Tomb Raider: Legend follows Lara as she goes on another adventure to discover artifacts from a time long forgotten, in exotic, varied, and beautiful locations around the globe.Gameplay+ Amazing puzzles+ Fun traversal+ Nice variety+ Easy combat+ Fun boss fights- Repetitive combat- Driving levels seem drawn outTomb Raider Legend is much like other games in the series, with enjoyable traversal, fun and challenging puzzles, and a nice variety of each, no puzzle being the same. The combat is easy; however can get quite boring to me as you simply lock on and then hold left click for the majority. Boss fights bring some new things to the table revolving combat, and make it less repetitive and menial. There are also some driving levels when you are on a bike, with some combat, which seemed drawn out and unnecessarily long to me. All in all, great gameplay with nothing being too miserable to progress through.Controls/Camera+ Easy controls+ Easy combat- Lara sometimes just, doesn't do what you want her to- Occasionally frustrating camera placementThe controls and camera in Legend are quite good, much better than previous games. She is easy to control, and the combat is easy to aim. However sometimes Lara just, doesn't do what you want her to, and the camera placement can be frustrating and cause you to miss jumps, but nothing game breaking by any means.Audio/Visual+ Beautiful level design+ Amazing variety in levels+ Nice sound/music throughout- Some graphical glitchesThe levels were beautifully done, and had an amazing amount of variety. No level looked the same and each had something cool to look it. The sound and music were nice as well, nothing being terrible, but nothing truly amazing either. There are some graphical glitches that you will come across, but nothing that will prevent you from playing or progressing.Story/Dialogue+ Amazing, engaging story+ Interested from beginning to end- Some annoying dialogue from Lara's companions- Short compared to other games in the seriesThe story in Legend is amazing; I loved every minute of it. It was well done, well thought out, and kept me interested throughout the whole story. It got a lot of reactions as well, from simple laughs to ""Oh my god, that's awesome!"" and ""Wow, Lara is such a badass!"" Some of the dialogue coming from her companions simply was not needed, and just came off as annoying. Most comments and banter between them and Lara were funny or entertaining, but other parts were just not needed.Quick ReviewOverall, Legend is an amazing addition to the Tomb Raider series. Like the many other games, it has challenging and entertaining puzzles, with incredibly fun traversal. The combat falls short occasionally, being repetitive, but the boss fights stop it from being unbearable. Legend's story is engaging and interesting, and will keep you interested throughout, but is a little on the short side compared to other games in the series.Amazing addition to a beloved game series.Buy it. 9/10 "

												This is much more linear than the old TR games but it I found the story and gameplay enjoyable despite that.+The levels are varied, the puzzles make sense and Lara controls fluidly. You can also set the difficulty to easy if you don't    like fighting enemies and want focus on the puzzle and story aspect.+There is a checkpoint system so you don't have to worry about saving a lot.-There are motorcycle sections that are cringe-worthy but only two of them so it doesn't kill the whole experience.Fun game overall.

												Legend is a solid title in the Tomb Raider series. I was pleasantly surprised about most aspects of the game. In this one, you are trying to find Lara’s mother after she vanishes when pulling out an ancient sword. The graphics still hold up today I think. Character models and environments are detailed.  You can also toggle “next gen graphics” which adds some graphic fidelity but also can introduce some glitching with shadows, textures, etc. Unfortunately, during some levels of the game you will be forced to turn off next gen graphics as the game will continually crash. A quick fix but something that should have been patched by the devs since it’s a common problem.  Gameplay is good. There are a few quirks with the controls and you can fumble a little trying to traverse an area. One odd thing is that if you have your guns out and go to jump on a ledge, Lara won’t grab on and will fall. You have to holster your guns first and the make the jump. Otherwise, Legend is a very linear game and your path forward is almost always clear. There are collectables throughout each level that will award you bonus outfits, character info, art and even pistol upgrades. Some of these are very tricky to find but you can easily replay any level after you beat it. The tombs were all done well and the puzzles took a little bit of thinking but were not hard at all.It’s been said before on here, but the vehicle chase areas of the game are pretty bad. The poor vehicle controls and repetitive nature of just firing constantly until all the enemies are gone is my least favorite part of the game. One little touch worth mentioning is that if you exit the game on any level, the title screen will change to that area and Lara is dressed differently. Pretty neat. Pros+Graphics good for 2006+All environments well done+60fps+Tombs and  puzzles+Some replay value with time trials and collectablesCons+Very linear+Minor control issues+Vehicle levels+Buggy in certain areas+Minor random graphical glitches (shadows, textures)+Poor AI+No Steam overlay6/10 Above average "

												Tomb Raider: Legend is the first Tomb Raider game I've played, and I found it really enjoyable. The puzzles are well-designed and felt just difficult enough, while the combat is comparatively sparse and fun enough to button mash through. The game's pretty forgiving with appropriately placed checkpoints, which come in handy on the more precise platforming segments. Most of the game is great, but the camera is absolutely awful, often actively working against you and the rather clunky control scheme. The PC port has controller support, but all the screen prompts are still for the keyboard, which is irritating early on when you're still learning the controls and during some of the QTEs, though those mostly involve directions. The lock-on system is inconsistent as well. All that being said, the fun parts in this game are enjoyable enough that I feel the less-than-stellar controls and terrible camera are outshone by the great puzzle platforming design and genuinely cool story.

TL;DR: A solid action platformer and a decent first entry to the series from Crystal Dynamics. Featuring atmospheric locales and overall solid core mechanics, the game is weighed down somewhat by awkward combat and a short story which doesn't hold up to much thought or scrutiny. If you are buying with the hope of getting into the franchise, this is a solid starting point due to it's shorter length and overall easier difficulty when compared to other entries in the series. Though be warned, the PC version in particular is prone to several bugs and glitches, especailly with ""Next Gen Content"" enabled.Full ReviewFirst off a DISCLAIMER: I am a massive fan of this franchise and have been playing this particular game on various systems since it was first released back in 2006, so this game does hold some nostalgia value for me personally. That said I will do my upmost to be as objective as possible throughout this review. Also this is my first review so be warned.StoryTomb Raider: Legend tells the story of the world's worst best archaeologist Lara Croft, searching for the legendary sword of King Arthur, Excalibur! This a search that will take our intrepid heroine from the mountains of Bolivia, to the lush jungles of Ghana, the frozen peaks of the Himalayas, the towering skyscrapers of Tokyo, and Cornwall! (as in take the M5 to the A30 Cornwall). On her way she'll encounter a mysterious group of mercenaries intent on stopping her, led by a mysterious woman who may be a link to Lara's past.    If the synopsis above is all you want to get out of this game's story, a fun globetrotting adventure to link all the diffrent locations and you don't care about anything else going on around it, then you'll get that, and you will be somewhat satisfied. The story does its job fairly competently as a device to get Lara to all these diffrent locales though is criminally short. Without going for any extras you should beat the game in 6 hours maybe 8. Other Tomb Raider games often double this. Its when when the game starts to add things on to this premise that things start to get....messy.Its hard to pinpoint exactly why this story just doesn't work for me but I feel it has to do mostly with aforementioned mysterious woman. We see in a flashback during the second level that Lara was involved in a disaster at a dig site where she lost a close friend during a cave in, caused by a mysterious demon.... monster..... thing resembling black smoke (never freaking explained BTW). This is really where the story fell apart for me as everything about it just seemed to make absolutley no sense. Why was this incident never reported? Why did no one dig up the sight after the cave in? (they say its a memorial BUT THERE WAS A LITERAL DEMON DOWN THERE! Honouring the dead can really only stretch so far in these situations right?) Why does Lara obsses over artifacts theorised by her father but not in finding out whatever the heck killed her friend? The story can be picked apart all over the shop but I won't go into spoilers here. To summarise, the story is fine if you're looking for a basic treasure hunt, and fairly awful if you're looking for something halfway engaging. Dialouge is a mixed bag too. Ranging from horrible when Lara and our antagonist swap words, to actually somewhat fun when Lara banters back and forth with her helpers on radio (though this can be a mixed bag too as I'll get into later).Before going forward a word on the game's ending: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Moving on.GameplayGameplay has seen a major overhaul since Angel Of Darkness thank god and by extension the classic series of Tomb Raider. Gone are the PS1 era tank controls, slow methodical jumps, automatic lock on aiming and the turning circle of a shopping trolley attached to a rocket. Those of you coming up from Tomb Raiders of years gone by will have a bit of learning to do, where as those coming down from Tomb Raiders of years after will be able to jump right in.Save for a few hiccups and glitches, overall the revamped controls work pretty good and you should find yourself used to them in no time. Lara controls well on the ground, in the water, and dangling from various high places. The game is fairly easy by Tomb Raider standards as well so new comers should feel right at home.In game you are generally going to find yourself doing 1 of 2 things. Climbing or shooting. First the climbing. Those familiar with the Prince of Persia games on PS2, Uncharted or even later Tomb Raiders will find things fairly standard. You control Lara up various climable things (walls, cliff faces, tesla coils, you know the usual) by jumping and shimmying from ledge to ledge. Aside from a few glitches here and there, overall this works well and can be fairly safely relied upon. The climable ledges stand out quite clearly and there's only one real path to climb so you shouldn't get lost or stuck too much. Leap of faith gameplay (times where your forced to jump somewhere you can't see) is also kept to a minimum thanks to a solid camera that mostly tracks you quite well and shows you were to go next when needed.Any of the puzzles encountered in the game which don't involve putting box on button will generally be a climbing puzzle.Then there's the shooting.... oh boy. In games prior, combat went down mostly like this. Enemy appears, you draw your guns, hold down fire, the enemy died. It was simple because Tomb Raider was never really about the combat. Here, the combat is more in depth, and there is a lot of it. In my opinion, a little too much. So now, in combat, you have to hold down the lock on button to make Lara lock on to an enemy. Seems simple enough but the lock on feature is pretty unreliable at times, ESPECIALLY during boss fights  The final boss on Hard can actually go %$&! itself because of this . Melee combat is present in the form of rolling into enemies to trip them up and jumping off them to enter bullet time. Again, this works ok mostly but is unreliable and leads often to a whole lot of frustration when you miss and take a few hits because of it. I would just stick the game on easy and get through the combat as fast as possible to get to the climbing.On an extra note, the game is flooded with secrets and extras for those of you out there who like to go for 100%.Before going forward a word on the motorbike sections: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Moving on.PresentationIf you take anything away from this section, don't turn on ""next gen content"" in the options. It causes crashing, bugs and looks awful compared to without it.Running out of characters here so I'll be brief. This game, for PS2, looks great where it counts, the tombs. Each one is dripping in atmosphere, feels like a real tomb ancient people could have built, and begs to be explored. Ghana and Nepal in particular are simply beautiful. Coupled with an absolutley gorgeous soundtrack, this game's atmosphere is simply incredible and to me is the best part of the game. You really need to play it to really appreciate it. However, is where the banter mentioned earlier unfortunatly becomes a bit annoying. No matter how funny the line, sometimes you just want to soak in your surroundings. Character models who aren't Lara look pretty dated by today's standards but the game was released over 10 years ago so that can be forgiven.Overall the game looks great for a 10 year old release, and has atmosphere oozing from every level. For me, the atmosphere alone, warrents a purchase.If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Hope this review helped you make up your mind in deciding to buy or not.			"

Great story, great friends, and a lot of fun. Love all of the Tomb Raider games. from a scale of 1/10 I'd give 7.5. well worth $7. Very happy with this game.			"

Well worth the discounted price I got it for, although it's just as good on the 360. And ftr, I also enjoyed the new Tomb Raider, played it through twice as well, and loved it!

												Just to start off, I first played this game on the Xbox 360 back when it came out and I just recently got the PC version of it on Steam. Now onward to the review!Tomb Raider Legend is the first in the trilogy of *new* Tomb Raider games released by Crystal Dynamics. This title was released in 2006 and features a whole new game engine and a brand new control scheme that greatly aids the spirit of its exploration aspect. No longer must the player fanaggle their controller to get Lara into a very-specific position in order to land jumps properly!  The story takes a different approach to the plot by wiping the slate clean of prior history of the TR canon. It starts off with a young Lara and her mom traveling in a plane over what it seems to be Nepal, when something happens to their plane. The plane is malfuncioning and is unable to be operated properly. Both Lara and her mom struggle to decide what to do. They both buckle up in their seats and brace for impact. It turns out that Lara was just having a flashback when we cut-away to see a now fully grown up Lara scaling a big mountain in Bolivia while talking to her new crew mates Zip and Alister. After this brief scene we finally get a taste of what a next-gen (at the time) TR game would feel like! I currenly like to play using the 360 controller so my opinion on the controls is only going to be based on this particular scheme. The controls are simple and intuitive. They make playing the game really enjoyable. Everything is how I remember it to be from years ago when I first played it. The ""A"" button jumps, ""B"" rolls, ""X"" is using the grapple hook etc. It won't take anyone long at all to conform to this scheme. The level desgin is really neat especially the England level, the rain effects are really nice and I like navigating the underground labyrinth near the end of it. Overall my opinion is positive. Tomb Raider Legend is a great game to play and was actually my introduction to the Tomb Raider franchise and I've loved the series ever since. Buy it now!			"

TL;DR: A solid action platformer and a decent first entry to the series from Crystal Dynamics. Featuring atmospheric locales and overall solid core mechanics, the game is weighed down somewhat by awkward combat and a short story which doesn't hold up to much thought or scrutiny. If you are buying with the hope of getting into the franchise, this is a solid starting point due to it's shorter length and overall easier difficulty when compared to other entries in the series. Though be warned, the PC version in particular is prone to several bugs and glitches, especailly with ""Next Gen Content"" enabled.Full ReviewFirst off a DISCLAIMER: I am a massive fan of this franchise and have been playing this particular game on various systems since it was first released back in 2006, so this game does hold some nostalgia value for me personally. That said I will do my upmost to be as objective as possible throughout this review. Also this is my first review so be warned.StoryTomb Raider: Legend tells the story of the world's worst best archaeologist Lara Croft, searching for the legendary sword of King Arthur, Excalibur! This a search that will take our intrepid heroine from the mountains of Bolivia, to the lush jungles of Ghana, the frozen peaks of the Himalayas, the towering skyscrapers of Tokyo, and Cornwall! (as in take the M5 to the A30 Cornwall). On her way she'll encounter a mysterious group of mercenaries intent on stopping her, led by a mysterious woman who may be a link to Lara's past.    If the synopsis above is all you want to get out of this game's story, a fun globetrotting adventure to link all the diffrent locations and you don't care about anything else going on around it, then you'll get that, and you will be somewhat satisfied. The story does its job fairly competently as a device to get Lara to all these diffrent locales though is criminally short. Without going for any extras you should beat the game in 6 hours maybe 8. Other Tomb Raider games often double this. Its when when the game starts to add things on to this premise that things start to get....messy.Its hard to pinpoint exactly why this story just doesn't work for me but I feel it has to do mostly with aforementioned mysterious woman. We see in a flashback during the second level that Lara was involved in a disaster at a dig site where she lost a close friend during a cave in, caused by a mysterious demon.... monster..... thing resembling black smoke (never freaking explained BTW). This is really where the story fell apart for me as everything about it just seemed to make absolutley no sense. Why was this incident never reported? Why did no one dig up the sight after the cave in? (they say its a memorial BUT THERE WAS A LITERAL DEMON DOWN THERE! Honouring the dead can really only stretch so far in these situations right?) Why does Lara obsses over artifacts theorised by her father but not in finding out whatever the heck killed her friend? The story can be picked apart all over the shop but I won't go into spoilers here. To summarise, the story is fine if you're looking for a basic treasure hunt, and fairly awful if you're looking for something halfway engaging. Dialouge is a mixed bag too. Ranging from horrible when Lara and our antagonist swap words, to actually somewhat fun when Lara banters back and forth with her helpers on radio (though this can be a mixed bag too as I'll get into later).Before going forward a word on the game's ending: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Moving on.GameplayGameplay has seen a major overhaul since Angel Of Darkness thank god and by extension the classic series of Tomb Raider. Gone are the PS1 era tank controls, slow methodical jumps, automatic lock on aiming and the turning circle of a shopping trolley attached to a rocket. Those of you coming up from Tomb Raiders of years gone by will have a bit of learning to do, where as those coming down from Tomb Raiders of years after will be able to jump right in.Save for a few hiccups and glitches, overall the revamped controls work pretty good and you should find yourself used to them in no time. Lara controls well on the ground, in the water, and dangling from various high places. The game is fairly easy by Tomb Raider standards as well so new comers should feel right at home.In game you are generally going to find yourself doing 1 of 2 things. Climbing or shooting. First the climbing. Those familiar with the Prince of Persia games on PS2, Uncharted or even later Tomb Raiders will find things fairly standard. You control Lara up various climable things (walls, cliff faces, tesla coils, you know the usual) by jumping and shimmying from ledge to ledge. Aside from a few glitches here and there, overall this works well and can be fairly safely relied upon. The climable ledges stand out quite clearly and there's only one real path to climb so you shouldn't get lost or stuck too much. Leap of faith gameplay (times where your forced to jump somewhere you can't see) is also kept to a minimum thanks to a solid camera that mostly tracks you quite well and shows you were to go next when needed.Any of the puzzles encountered in the game which don't involve putting box on button will generally be a climbing puzzle.Then there's the shooting.... oh boy. In games prior, combat went down mostly like this. Enemy appears, you draw your guns, hold down fire, the enemy died. It was simple because Tomb Raider was never really about the combat. Here, the combat is more in depth, and there is a lot of it. In my opinion, a little too much. So now, in combat, you have to hold down the lock on button to make Lara lock on to an enemy. Seems simple enough but the lock on feature is pretty unreliable at times, ESPECIALLY during boss fights  The final boss on Hard can actually go %$&! itself because of this . Melee combat is present in the form of rolling into enemies to trip them up and jumping off them to enter bullet time. Again, this works ok mostly but is unreliable and leads often to a whole lot of frustration when you miss and take a few hits because of it. I would just stick the game on easy and get through the combat as fast as possible to get to the climbing.On an extra note, the game is flooded with secrets and extras for those of you out there who like to go for 100%.Before going forward a word on the motorbike sections: ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Moving on.PresentationIf you take anything away from this section, don't turn on ""next gen content"" in the options. It causes crashing, bugs and looks awful compared to without it.Running out of characters here so I'll be brief. This game, for PS2, looks great where it counts, the tombs. Each one is dripping in atmosphere, feels like a real tomb ancient people could have built, and begs to be explored. Ghana and Nepal in particular are simply beautiful. Coupled with an absolutley gorgeous soundtrack, this game's atmosphere is simply incredible and to me is the best part of the game. You really need to play it to really appreciate it. However, is where the banter mentioned earlier unfortunatly becomes a bit annoying. No matter how funny the line, sometimes you just want to soak in your surroundings. Character models who aren't Lara look pretty dated by today's standards but the game was released over 10 years ago so that can be forgiven.Overall the game looks great for a 10 year old release, and has atmosphere oozing from every level. For me, the atmosphere alone, warrents a purchase.If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Hope this review helped you make up your mind in deciding to buy or not.			"

												With enough bad luck, sometimes it turns into a buggy mess (it even led me to lose my main save file) but when not, it's a really fun and wonderful experience. There's enough content to keep you coming back after finishing the main game (which is amazing) and looks really good for the present day. There are some control (at least keyboard and mouse) and camera problems too, but if you manage to deal with them, you'll have a good time.			"

												Tomb Raider games seem to come in threes, I've noticed, but anyway... this one here is a classic. Lara Croft is revisiting some darker mysteries in her past pertaining to her mother, journeys that will take her from sweltering jungles to frigid Himalayan peaks. Rude dudes are after you, as per the usual in action games, and Lara has to deal with them in varying capacities. The fights are challenging, but not overly frustrating. As you peruse the worlds, you can also happen upon collectibles.What I like most about the collectibles in this game is that there are levels to them. The gold and silver collectibles are harder to find than your usual bronze ones, but if you find all of the different kinds in a level, you can unlock outfits and cinematics. The replay value for the unlockables alone is quite high, but if you're here for the story, then you are in for a good one.Lara is after something that she thinks points to her mother's disappearance long ago, but bad evil goons are after it too. Sure, this is standard TR affairs, but the story actually gives us a far more human Lara than the one of previous games and her grief over her mother is tangible. I like the action sequences because you are not confined to running, jumping, and the occasional grapple. You have zip-lines, grenades, and sure, you have your basic twin pistols plus a weapon that takes special ammo (one of those), but that's half the fun! Mastering what you have on hand really just adds to the thrill of Lara's adventure.As far as outfits go, there are quite a few to unlock and most are relatively practical. There are defaults for each level that you can't change the first time you play through them (like that awful evening gown without shorts under it that Lara prances around in), and again, half the battle is unlocking different top colors and stuff. Croft Manor is explorable, which is nice for practicing difficult moves and or wrapping your head around different button mappings (there are a few in this one).Now for the bad part of this game... it is an older game, which means all of us people who have just built PCs and or upgraded to Windows 10 have to tinker around with the game to get it to work. Keep Next Gen Effects off (it's just some extra hair and skin stuff anyhow) if you want the game to run without crashing (King Arthur will always crash for you if you don't). If you like a challenge, go for it, just be prepared for some wonkiness until you sort things out. I recommend this game, old quirks and all, because it is a fun classic every fan of Tomb Raider should pick up.			"

												PROS: The game has an engaging storyline. There is alot of action, and alot to find on your journey. The puzzles are hard enough to keep you entertained and on your toes. Cool weapons to pluder your enemies with. Insane boss battles. CONS: The camera angle acts funny sometimes (like in all games and it is never on your side) in certainareas of the game. The game is unoptimized for the keyboard and mouse because when you want to shoot and strafe it will often not respond, respond late, or keep shooting. FINAL RESULTS: This game is great and has a few problems that may restrict some skill but is great dispite anything wrong with  it. 8.3/10			"

												Streamlined Tomb Raider. Great story and good graphics (even if dated). Interesting variety of environments; levels and puzzles are rather simple and linear though so exploring doesn't feel as adventuresome as previous Tomb Raiders, but the pace is good and the fun never wanes. The inventory system and pickups have been simplified almost to the point of nonexistance, but the new shoulderlamp, grapplehook, and binoculars are welcome new equipment. Weapons are similarly minimized, as is combat in general, but the few action sequences (coupled with Lara's new moves) are satisfying. Keyboard controls are clunky I recommend a controller. Quick, casual, fun...Recommended!			"

												I hated the control and camera interface in the original. I hated the redo of the original for the same reason. I hate the same thing in this game. It seems the latest TR title has modified Lara's control scheme to be a ""QTE"" interfae along with the clunky, poorly responsive cinematic-action scheme popular in many games these days. But then, I'm not sure that's an improvement over the tedious control method of navigating through the tricky death-defying stunt scenes in the preceding TR titles. Unless the proper buttons were pushed in precisely the right order and in precise timing, and facing the precise direction, you die. And die. And die. And die. I'm not enough of a misogynist to enjoy seeing Lara blown-up, shot, impaled, burned, mauled, eaten, or fall screaming to her doom again and again. And again. And again. Its rather troubling. I wonder if the game devs really hate women?			"

												Gameplay: Even though it doesn't do anything really amazing, it controls good (played it on controller, do so too if you can) and isn't as frustrating as Anniversary and Underworld. Platforming is great, puzzles aren't really challenging but not exactly easy too. Action sequences were good, I felt like a badass killing enemies, but the difficulty of these encounters is really low, as enemies drop many health packs and I never ran out of them (played on medium difficulty, so I would probably recommend playing it on hard). The thing I also really liked were the QTE, because they weren't really annoying.Boss Fights are okay, although not really hard, but at least are fun (this may not apply to you, but I had fun)The game isn't really long though, took me around 9 hours to beat it (and one more hour for Croft Manor), I see that as the only main problem of this game gameplay wise.Music: The soundtrack is really good in my opinion and I liked it the most out of the trilogy. The music fits the mood and areas.Story: It's nothing remarkable, but a good B adventure movie style story. The characters are in my opinion well written and dialogues as well. I also liked that Lara's companions at Croft Manor were always in touch with her (something that's missing in Anniversary and Underworld) and were supplying Lara with info about the stuff she finds in ruins. Only downside is that the story ends on a cliffhanger, that isn't resolved until Underworld.Technical: The game is a port from X360. It ran at 60 fps for me at all times. The graphics are good for its age, but I'm not sure if I liked ""Next generation content"" that is available here. It makes the game look much better, but on the other hand makes it more glitchier (the water reflection was really weird in my case). After Japan mission, the game kept crashing on the level preparation screen until I lowered everything and turned off NGC. After it loaded I switched everything on again and it worked without problems. Even though it's a X360 port, I found it impossible to switch on screen prompts to controller, so even though I played with a controller, every hint on screen was presented with keyboard layout (funny thing is that it worked for a while, but after Japan it refused to show controller buttons)Overall: Really fun game, to me it's the most enjoyable one from the old Crystal Dynamics trilogy. Try it out if you like games like Uncharted, because the game reminded me of it a lot (it shows that Uncharted borrowed from TR).8,5/10			"

												I *LOVE* this game. Not the whole franchise, just this game in particular. Played it through twice on the 360. Fired up the Steam version here and it looks and plays exactly the same so I didn't play through it a 3rd time but was tempted to. Well worth the discounted price I got it for, although it's just as good on the 360. And ftr, I also enjoyed the new Tomb Raider, played it through twice as well, and loved it! But, I was not crazy about Anniversary or Underworld. Those two just seemed buggy and not as immersive. Looking forward to the new one. Planning on getting Rise soon.			"

												With enough bad luck, sometimes it turns into a buggy mess (it even led me to lose my main save file) but when not, it's a really fun and wonderful experience. There's enough content to keep you coming back after finishing the main game (which is amazing) and looks really good for the present day. There are some control (at least keyboard and mouse) and camera problems too, but if you manage to deal with them, you'll have a good time.			"

												Just to start off, I first played this game on the Xbox 360 back when it came out and I just recently got the PC version of it on Steam. Now onward to the review!Tomb Raider Legend is the first in the trilogy of *new* Tomb Raider games released by Crystal Dynamics. This title was released in 2006 and features a whole new game engine and a brand new control scheme that greatly aids the spirit of its exploration aspect. No longer must the player fanaggle their controller to get Lara into a very-specific position in order to land jumps properly!  The story takes a different approach to the plot by wiping the slate clean of prior history of the TR canon. It starts off with a young Lara and her mom traveling in a plane over what it seems to be Nepal, when something happens to their plane. The plane is malfuncioning and is unable to be operated properly. Both Lara and her mom struggle to decide what to do. They both buckle up in their seats and brace for impact. It turns out that Lara was just having a flashback when we cut-away to see a now fully grown up Lara scaling a big mountain in Bolivia while talking to her new crew mates Zip and Alister. After this brief scene we finally get a taste of what a next-gen (at the time) TR game would feel like! I currenly like to play using the 360 controller so my opinion on the controls is only going to be based on this particular scheme. The controls are simple and intuitive. They make playing the game really enjoyable. Everything is how I remember it to be from years ago when I first played it. The ""A"" button jumps, ""B"" rolls, ""X"" is using the grapple hook etc. It won't take anyone long at all to conform to this scheme. The level desgin is really neat especially the England level, the rain effects are really nice and I like navigating the underground labyrinth near the end of it. Overall my opinion is positive. Tomb Raider Legend is a great game to play and was actually my introduction to the Tomb Raider franchise and I've loved the series ever since. Buy it now!			"

												Ah Tomb Raider Legend, the first game developed by Crystal Dynamics, creators of the famous Legacy of Kain series (e.g. Soul Reaver). I remember I was not concerned that different people would continue the series because I played those games and really enjoyed them. The story involves Lara's mother, Avalon, and the famous King Arthur's sword - excalibur. CDynamics promised that Lara will go back to what she does best - raiding tombs and they kept the word. Game mechanics are easy to learn and the overall game is a lot of fun (there are 3 levels where you ride a motorbike)! What's important to mention is the Croft Manor returns where you can practice movements and uncover few secrets. The graphics are very nice, music is very good just like in every Tomb Raider. I think every fan of the classics was satisfied with what we received. Finally is time to write few words about Lara as she is essential to the series. In my opinion she is great, she's still acrobatic and tough and still beautiful (her original creator was brought back to help). Miss Croft has new voice which I personally like it a lot and think it fits her character perfectly. New developers surely did a great job bringing back Lara from her downfall so that we could once again feel the thrill of her adventures.			"

												Overall this is a really impressive Tomb Raider game, not my fav by a long shot, dosen't mean it's not worth the buy..Controls could be better, but it's kind of what you expect with an older game really. Great story, great friends, and a lot of fun. Love all of the Tomb Raider games. from a scale of 1/10 I'd give 7.5. well worth $7. Very happy with this game.			"

												It's a great start when Crystal Dynamics took over. I've played all the games countless times, even though my playcount doesn't say so. I've played them so much on all difficulties I can easily tell you even on the hardest of difficulty, you can pull it off - saying this regarding to some of the negative comments being crybabies about 'impossible commands to pull off' lol.Now for the game itself though: >Art style is about what you'd expect for the year 2006, still very nice and a big difference from AoD.>The game controls very well, at least for a TR fan. Enables controler, otherwise mouse and keyboard. Even on the highest difficulty it will automatically aim for the enemy which I hate from the depths of my soul but it's still very nice + you can kick some serious♥♥♥♥♥with dem combos.>The story is.. alright? I mean, it's not bad. I myself was the biggest Amanda fan, but idk, it's a change from the previous games. Not a bad change but it's meant to be the building stone for the next games - until 2013 which completely changed the whole saga.>TR: Legend offers a lot of puzzles as well, funny moments, you get to ride a bike, chase a train, ride on the train and discover the secrets which lay behind a military base and more.I recommend this game, obviously. It's a great bargain during the sales and not purchasing it for not even 2 euros is a crime.			"

												This might be the best Tomb Raider game after 2 and before the 2013 reboot. It's got pretty nice graphics. Stupid story but whatever. Classic fun puzzles and gameplay (mediocre gunplay).One game breaking bug on PC (disable Next Generation Content during the Khzakistan level, or else the game will crash)But what really makes this one of the best Tomb Raider games is well, the B-movie dialogue. I don't know if they thought they were making the characters cool by saying things like ""WOOOOOH!!!"" whenever you get a tiny bit of air during one of the slow and lame (but still fun) motorcycle chases. Like, the ""extreme"" factor of the jump doesn't even make it to a 1 on the scale of 1-10 and they're commenting like they saw Tony Hawk do the 900 for the first time.9/10			"

												Tomb Raider: Legend is the first game in the first reboot of the franchise, created by Crystal Dynamics after they took over the franchise from Core Design.TR:L story start off with a flashback when Lara was just a young girl, when she was travelling on a plane with her mother, which suddenly crashes and leave them as the only survivors. Lara and her mother finds an ancient site where they, by accident, activates it, which results in her mother suddenly disappearing through a portal. Years later, Lara is a renown explorer and archelogist on her way to find a similar site in order to uncover what truly happened to her mother. Obviously that wont be easy and she immidiately stumbles into others who wishes to use these sites as well.The gameplay is pretty much what is typical for the classical Tomb Raider game; you arrive at some place and do puzzles to progress further into the levels, some places have secrets which requires you to do something special in order to get the Relics and artifacts. Controls are pretty much standard in the series, where you use the movement keys to move around, space to jump and some additional keys to do special things such as grapple.Most of the combat comes in the form of facing literal hordes of humans coming at you, and while the numbers might scare you, they're pretty stupid, at least on the easier difficulties. The game can automatically aim for you, so you don't really have to aim yourself like in most other games.As something new in the series, the game actually gives you the chance to ride with Lara's motorcycle! However, it is pretty straightforward rather than open for you to explore while riding it, and it happens only in, imo, the most boring levels in the game where you do nothing for 5 minutes than drive on the motorcycle and shoot hordes of enemies.The graphics are rather decent considering it came out in 2006. I played the game  way back in either 2007 ot 2008 and while I didnt have the best PC back then, I experienced some of the same graphical issues that I had back then, raging from crazy textures glitching like hell, lightning/shadows going bonkers and last but not least, textures that appear transparent yet still have *some* textures, so at some points it was hard to see where to go, especially during the level where you ride a motorcycle.I have some faint memories of when the game was announced and how scared I was what would happen to the Lara we all loved from the classical franchise. I also remembered the games gained a lot of criticism, that I agree on, that the games began to lose its focus on Lara's adventures as an archeologist and became more of a ""I need to murder my way to get where I want"" kind of a thing. My impression was that Crystal Dynamics wanted to reboot the franchise to give the game a bit of a better outlook and make the game refreshing and new, however, within the first minute into the game you literally murder one of the mercenaries for no proper reason. Even the supporting characters, which I have to admit were horribly annoying during the game with their bad jokes, puns and constant comments on literally *EVERYTHING* in the game, asked why the guy was there, whereas Lara more or less answers ""lol idk"". I mean, I could justify the murder if it was in self-defence, but oh well.Overall, I still think the game is enjoyable, albeit it is incredibly short and many of the puzzles are very very easy to go through, at least if you ignore most of the secrets. If you can play through the game without having any bugs or glitches with the gameplay, graphics and cutscenes, then I am sure most people would enjoy this game.PROS+ is in the spirit of the classical games+ controls are easy to get into+ story is not the best, but it keeps you interested+ the sword ;)CONS- way too short (game can be finished in around 5-6 hours)- puzzles are too easy and offers too little challenge- doesn't really fix the ""problem(s)"" of the previous games regarding the enemies- those damned motorcycle levels....

												Легенда в своё время тоже была обновлением серии, но если бы сейчас сделали её ремастеринг, то она затмила бы недавний ""перезапуск"".Что мне нравится в этой игре больше всего, так это калейдоскопическая смена декораций. Думаю пальцев на обеих руках не хватит чтобы перечислить все уголки света, в которых доведётся побывать Ларе (и вам :) На вскидку: Англия, Боливия, Япония, Непал, Казахстан, пещеры, небоскребы, гонки на мотоциклах и т. д.Другая особенность Легенды, которая радует меня не меньше первой, - это гардеробчик Лары. Шкаф буквально ломится от обилия цветов и фасонов: около десятка базовых моделей, плюс две-три расцветки на каждую. И за всё это разнообразие не надо платить жадным издателям, вы просто получаете эти шкурки в награду за прохождение игры и выполненение заданий. Кроме того, игра не ограничивает нас рамками якобы ""реализма"" при повторном прохождении, и позволяет отправиться в заснеженный Непал в платьице или же в знойное Перу в полушубке.Устаревшая графика нисколько не омрачает картину, она наоборот выталкивает геймлей на поверхность. Согласитесь, большинство современных игр маскируют унылость игрового процесса под красотами картинки.Из всех сыгранных мною игр (АОД, Анни, Андер) эта наиболее разноплановая и содержательная.			"

												This game says it has partial controller support, but it looks like it has partial mouse support. Now I felt the frustration console peasants may feel when playing shooters in their devices.Considering this game was released 10 years ago, its looks are fantastic. The best part of this game are the puzzles. Once you figure out how a controller is supposed to work, you can navigate easily til the end.Combat is the lowest point. In my opinion, if you are going to make an autoaim combat, just don't do it. Stick to the puzzles. It is really frustrating to keep smashing your mouse buttons hoping to kill an enemy, and I won't say anything about the last level to not spoil it.I came straight from Rise of The Tomb Raider to play this and I can definitely say they nailed the last installments.But still, this game is worth playing and I'll play next Tomb Raider Aniversary and Underworld.
