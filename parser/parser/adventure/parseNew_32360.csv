												The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is a remake of the popular Lucas Art point and click adventure game which was released back in 1990. The remake was released in mid-2009 on PC, Mac, PSN and Xbox Live Arcade. The game is set in the Caribbean at the time of pirates. You play as Guy Threepwood - a guy who dreams of becoming a pirate. This game is set in a third person perspective point and click style gameplay. You are able to explore around the world and interact with objects in a couple of different ways, such as inspecting them, picking them up, pushing or pulling for example, whilst you are also able to interact with other NPCs in the game through multiple dialogue options. The game has no death scenes in it for your character; game play is heavily focused on puzzles and exploring. The puzzles in The Secret of Monkey Island are in adventure style; and make no sense what so ever until you finally figure it out, then it becomes clear as day, but all of the puzzles are fun to take part in. Personally my favourite would be the pirate insulting duels. This was the first game in a long while that actually had me taking notes on a pen and paper! None of the puzzles are really time based, so you can spend as much time as you want on them without being penalized. What I really liked about The Secret of Monkey Island is that you can either play the game in the remastered settings with the higher quality art style, or you can actually play it in the classic pixel style that the original game was based on, you can do this on a scene by scene basis too.  The art style of the remastered edition looks really good though, lots of vibrant colours and some really nice looking background environments.As this was my first experience with The Secret of Monkey Island I wasn't sure what to expect from it story wise, but I was pleasantly surprised when there is a whole load of humour added into the plot. Every single character I ran into had an extremely memorable persona. I don't want to spoil any of the story since the game is essentially the story, but it is captivating and interesting right until the end. The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is completely voice acted, and done really well. Even the none main characters are voice acted, such as bar dwellers and town folk which was a nice touch, much of the sound track is also the same, just remastered to a higher quality. This is another game that completely baffled me at parts, whether it be on some of the puzzles or just knowing where to go next to progress the story; which resulted in me looking up the guide, to be honest I am not sure how you are supposed to figure some of it but it has been done by plenty of others! I was really immersed in the story of the game and didn't want to lose too much time faffing around with not knowing where to go so I was happy to look up the answers this time. Each of the game's scenes has plenty of objects that you can interact with, most will end up with Guy giving some sort of witty remark towards them, and there are also lots of NPCs which you can talk with to get more out of the plot and some of the side stories going off in the game too. The Secret of Monkey Island took me ten hours to complete; this was with the aid of a guide at parts, and following up all dialog options with NPCs to get the most out of the lore; I thought this was a pretty good length for the game considering I actually thought it would be a lot shorter given my past experience of point and click games. Given that the story is linear and that there is only one ending to the game, there is no reason to replay it through a second time though. Given that this is a remastered edition of the game, it works fine on the newer operating systems, and I was able to play at 4K resolutions perfectly fine. I encountered minor problems with the controls in the game, and the scroll wheel functionality when choosing which action to take on objects stopping randomly - but this was easily worked around by using the keyboard shortcuts.  An odd issue which has been reported is that for some reason the game refuses to run when being installed on a 3 TB hard drive, so that may be something to consider if you are purchasing it and you only have a 3 TB drive. The Secret of Monkey Island is often referred to as the pinnacle of point and click adventure games, and this series is what spawned many more of the greats we have today, and rightly so. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of my time playing this game, and the story is absolutely brilliant and I cannot wait to get stuck into the rest of the series. The low price of £6, 99 on Steam makes The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition a serious contender for a must play title.

THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND: SPECIAL EDITION - A LucasArts Classic beautifully and masterfully reworked  || 9.5 || Score Comment   Graphics 9 Simply stunning, switching between the original graphics and the special edition you can really appreciate the time the artists have taken to faithful reproduce the backgrounds, characters and animations.  Audio 9 Excellent music (I mean come on! its monkey Island I don't think I will ever get that tune out of my head) and really well done voice acting for all the characters. Gameplay 10 Ok, first I admit I am completely biased here: I love Monkey Island. Back from the days when I first got it to run on my 268 (I know showing my age) this game was something special. Monkey Island is one of the classic games from the golden age of point and click adventure games where LucasArts and Sierra ruled supreme with games like Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max and the Kings Quest series. The controls have been reworked, making them more user friendly for a modern audience, but are still faithful to the original and don't detract from the game in anyway. Even if you weren't old enough to appreciate these games the first time round they are masterpieces and I feel stand the test of time.   Story 10 The game is pretty much all about the story (a truly amazing story), and while you are free to do some exploring around the islands and some trial and error with the puzzles, the story is essentially linear (so don't expect an open world game). The dialogue is full of dry humour and the situations (and solutions to puzzles) fantastical, absurd and brilliant. While the story has many aspects that will appeal to younger players (slapstick humor), much of the humour will appeal to adults. The puzzles are challenging but not to the point of frustration and are worked into the story well.   Replayability 7 If you have played the game its likely to be memorable enough that you will know the solutions to the puzzles, but its still good fun, and was for me very nostalgic.   Overall 9.5 Completely biased review, take from it what you will, but we all have childhood games special to us and this was mine. Good times More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree?

AUDIOClassicVISUALCrowd-pleaserDIFFICULTYToughVIBEUnforgettableCRAVINGChallengeON SALERarelyPROS: Remastered game looks amazing, remastered music is spot-on, voices are all great and fit with the rest of the series. Story and dialogue are wonderful. Puzzles are outlandishly-memorable, but entirely possible. I absolutely love the ability to switch back and forth between classic and remastered to see exactly what was changed.CONS: Most people don't like the way Guybrush looks in this one, understandably-so. Someone even made a full mod to fix his hair. Dialogue stops are necessary to keep the game in-tact with the original flow, but can be a little distracting once voices are added to the mix.WORTH: Did I mention you can transition back and forth from remaster to classic? well, you can transition back and forth from remastered and classic. Both experiences in one pretty little package! Excuse me while I fangirl. OVERALL: 10 years ago, Ron Gilbert said in a magazine interview that he was amazed at how often Secret Of Monkey Island is brought up, 15 years after its creation. I wonder if he's realized yet that he's made a piece of gaming history.SCORE:10/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

Monkey Island (MI) is a unique blend of bizarro characters, whacky plots & even stranger puzzles!The most entertaining aspect of Monkey Island though is the humor used throughout; in the dialog, situations & actions you perform. It's rare to have humor used so well in a game. With your want-to-be pirate,  'hero',  ahem, Guybrush Threepwood there are plenty of hair-pulling challenges & interesting locations to explore.There is even swashbuckling sword play, although in a much more creatively different way than you would ever expect! Mind you, that will happen a lot in MI, where the most creative .. strange .. crazy step is often the next step, not the logical one you think.The fresh coat of paint in the Special Edition with its 3D-ish cartoon look enhances the setting well, although you can also switch to the classic graphics at any time too! Voice acting is excellent taking full advantage of the great dialog. Always enjoyable taking a pirate holiday back to MI! Yarr!Timeless point 'n' click adventure! One of the best!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												If you haven't played this game before, do it now. It's video game history. If you already played the 1990 original it's time for another playthrough. Everything that makes the game great was left untouched: The story, the humorous dialogues and the puzzles. The changes made to this re-release really add to the experience. HD graphics, outstanding voice acting and a beautiful re-recording of the classic score. Purists have the option to switch between enhanced and original graphics anytime during the game, even during cutscenes, and experience the game in it's original glory.			"

A story about mystery (Monkey island), ambition (To become a pirate), love (True love lasting over a series of 5 games), betrayal (Carla and Otis), epic humour (A red herring) and the start of the most awesome of it all….insult sword fighting!

												The Secret of Monkey Island - a game reverently enshrined in a hallowed place of honor from the golden age of adventure games.  The Secret of Monkey Island is indeed a definitive masterpiece of adventure gaming and one of the most important games in its genre.  It's also incredible fun to play, even today.  While the Special Edition is a mixed bag, the underlying game is as funny and charming as it has always been.  Every gamer deserves to treat themselves to this timeless masterpiece.The Secret of Monkey Island was a watershed game for Lucas Arts.  While their earlier efforts were also excellent (especially Zak McKracken, which is so unfairly forgotten), The Secret of Monkey Island is where everything comes together and the stage is set for a truly incredible run of masterpiece adventure games that would culminate with 1998's Grim Fandango - the greatest adventure game of all time.  The Secret of Monkey Island takes the brilliant ideas in Loom and for the first time, fully realizes them.  The Secret of Monkey Island is a game that refuses to allow the player to reach a dead end - one of the most maddening aspects of earlier adventure games where the player could reach a point in the game where further progress was impossible due to the lack of an item missed earlier in the game.  This required reloading an older save game, or even restarting the game entirely.  Not fun.  The Secret of Monkey Island also refuses to kill the player.  Unlike so many other early adventure games where death was a frequent and often unforeseeable occurrence, Monkey Island recognizes that dying is unnecessary and detracts from the fun.  The heart of adventure games is the exploration, story, and puzzles - and these are exactly the elements that The Secret of Monkey Island embodies.   The Secret of Monkey Island thus laid the foundation upon which the future of adventure gaming would be built.  No longer were adventure gamers going to be satisfied with unforeseeable deaths or maddening dead ends.Not only is the game a hallmark of the genre, but it is also a joy to play.  The characters are simply drawn, but charming.  Mighty pirate wannabe Guybrush Threepwood is a hilarious lead character and he is impossible to dislike.  His one liners will have you rolling.  Even some of the dialog choices you don't choose will have you snickering.  The story of Guybrush's quest to become a pirate is a wonderful mash-up of pulp piracy cliches.  There's buried treasure, thrilling sword fights, voodoo magic, mysterious islands, and even cannibals.  It's an inherently lighthearted and silly game, and every one of those elements (and much more) are inverted or lampooned in very funny ways.The Special Edition update, however, is a mixed bag.  The game's graphics have been updated for significantly higher resolutions than the game's original 640x480 resolution and now supports widescreen resolutions.  I have mixed feelings about the update.  There is a certain flatness to the graphics work that I don't find attractive.  I do give the artists credit, however, for their attempt to remain very faithful to the original artwork as well as subsequent games in the series.  The animations are also rather rough.  Characters moonwalk around the screen in a decidedly unnatural way and there are some clipping issues.  All of these faults are almost certainly due to Lucas Arts not investing enough resources and trying to get by on the cheap.  It's a shame, because there is indeed potential for a wonderful remake.  The game also now supports full voice acting for all characters using the familiar voices from the later Monkey Island games.  The main cast is wonderful, but some of the supporting voices are a bit rough.  Also, some of the jokes are ruined with the poor timing of the audio - for instance, try asking the Men of Low Moral Fiber in town about what's in the keg.  It doesn't work like it does in text.  The other poor aspect of the Special Edition is the changes to the inventory and verb (interaction) system.  The game no longer has the classic SCUMM verbs in the lower portion of the screen along with inventory items.  The inventory must now be accessed via keyboard hotkey, and verbs must be selected via mouse scroll wheel or hot key.  This is a significant downgrade, in my opinion.  The original system was more streamlined and allowed for faster interactions.  There was one puzzle in the game that I couldn't manage in the Special Edition due to the cumbersome inventory system, but can easily accomplish in the original.  I won't spoil it for you, but will say that it involves grog.The truly brilliant aspect of the Special Edition, however, is that the original, unaltered game is included and can be seamlessly switched between.  Essentially, you get two games and you can try them out and see which you like better, or complete the game both ways.  I still prefer the older version, but I'm an old grey beard gamer.  As I see it, there's just no improving on perfection, and The Secret of Monkey Island is a very near perfect adventure.			"

												An excellent way to relive an experience with a classic point-and-click adventure game! This remake of the Monkey Island offers the same experience but with refined music, sound and fully redrawn scenes. I understand it is possible to switch back to the old graphics but why do so if the new look is so detailed?The jokes hold up to this day and the puns are just as hilarious as they used to be. Word for warning though: it is possible the game does not let you go and you complete it in one sitting just as I did!I look forward to playing its sequel and pretty much anything that was a classic in this genre and gets a release on Steam.

The ability to switch back and forth between the classic and re-done graphics is a nice touch as well, though I must say I don't really enjoy the art style of the new graphics. The voice acting, using the Curse of Monkey Island actors for the characters that are shared, is superb though and makes it worth sticking around in the revamped graphics mode.			"

Runs great on modern hardware and Windows 8.1.Not much else to say. If you like point-and-click adventures, it's a must-have. Unless you don't like comedy.

The Secret of Monkey Island – Special Edition is a point & click adventure game. Having arrived on Melee Island, you follow wannabe Guybrush Threepwood on his quest to become a great pirate captain, which gets him in the way of ghost pirate LeChuck's evil plan.Pros: This game an exact replica of the 1990 game with a fresh paint, capturing the cartoony feel to this comedic adventure. The game story breaks the forth wall constantly, anywhere from adressing and looking directly at the player, to referencing modern culture. Nostalgic players will especially enjoy the winks at other LucasArt adventure games such as Day of the Tentacle or the Indiana Jones series. You meet the most stereotypical characters throughout the story, collecting a huge assortment of objects and trickets you will use, pull, push, pick up and give to solve different puzzles. Dialog choices are used as an actual mechanic such as Swordfighting.Cons: The story really is nothing special, and you don't feel compelled to do anything besides advance the linear story until the next gag comes along. If you played this game in the past and remember the solutions, you will find it a breeze to play through it again. Some animations are just HD versions of animation limitation of the old days, so in-game closups get dated animations with no lip movement during dialog. Controls for picking ""verbs"" and navigating your inventory feels clunky, especially during timed events. Some puzzles aren't obvious at all, requiring to try the same action or dialog choice over and over until a different result happens.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youI really feel like giving it a better rating, but I know a lot of the fun I had playing this game comes from nostalgic references which players who didn't play such games ""back then"" won't get or even notice. On it's own, it's still a good game for all ages, funny with a few challenging puzzles. Give it a try!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

7/10 A good remaster with some minor issues of a game that didn’t age as gracefully“My name is Guybrush Threepwood and I want to be a pirate!” And that’s really as simple and as straight forward an introduction to The Secret of Monkey Island (Lucas Arts 1990, Special Edition from 2009) as you can get. You’re playing as Guybrush, a light-hearted, clumsy fellow on his way to becoming a real, grog drinking pirate. While trying to gain the respect of the real pirates, Elaine Marley, governor of Mêlée Island™ gets kidnapped by ghost pirate LeChuck and it is up to Guybrush to save the day.

About the GameThe Monkey Island series is by no doubt the best known point & click adventure series out there and anyone interested either in the genre itself or the evolution of video games as a whole should pick this game up. Lucas Arts has done a marvellous job at preserving the old game and has given players the option to experience the game with new graphics, a hint system, new controls, new music, and of course a voiceover. But if one had to nitpick, the remaster has a couple of very minor issues.


There's a three-headed monkey behind you 
A Screenshot of The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition
By: Gao Li




It sounds odd to mention this in a point & click adventure, but this game is unresponsive at times. When moving the mouse to the edge of the screen and telling Guybrush to go there, he often times refuses to, something that later Lucas Arts adventure games remasters don’t suffer from. When having the new graphics turned on, I could also only navigate through the item menu via keyboard. This ultimately lead me to prefer the old graphics over the new.Another issue is that, when playing with the modern graphics turned on, you can only select dialogue options when you move your mouse icon near the left-hand side of the of the screen. This edition also does not contain any achievements, unlike the Xbox 360 port of the special edition and the other Lucas Arts remasters. Audio commentary is also absent.


So inspiring 
A Screenshot of The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition
By: Gao Li




ConclusionAt the end the question aficionados will ask themselves is: “Does it hold up?” It’s a mixed bag, there are several portions in the game that are just supposed to artificially lengthen the playtime instead of contributing to the story; Most notably the one segment where Guybrush has to pour grog from one mug to another while trying to reach an NPC and the other part where players venture through Monkey Island. These parts are just boring, tedious, and annoying. The puzzles at times rely on Moon Logic to solve them, which really dampens the fun that even the hint system cannot always help bring back. The humor is still on point, but it’s obvious, especially with the lack of a coherent narrative, that the Lucas Arts adventure games were still in their infancy here.			"

I just hope that Double Fine or Telltale will pick them up (and rest of lucas arts non Star Wars games) and ill have whole Monkey Island series and other LucasArts quests in modern HD form just like this one.Oh game itself is classic and stills plays well. Also seamless switch to classic mode makes it absolutely awesome both for those who love original feel and shape and renewed one.			"

												Sometimes classics just don't hold up. I used to like a movie called The Adventures of Milo and Otis (a Westernized version of the Japanese movie 'A Kitten's Story'). It's a fun movie about a cat and a dog! They work together, solve crimes! Except there's all sorts of shady business concerning animal abuse around that film. I can't watch it anymore without wondering how many kittens and puppies died for this movie.Now that you've got that wonderful nugget of information, I'm here to tell you that The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is a classic that DOES hold up. It has no dead kittens in it. It has lots of ghosts, though. All those ghosts lovingly rendered in actual art graphics rather than those pixel art graphics that kids hate today. (If you like the pixel art graphics, all you have to do is press F10 and you will TRAVEL BACK IN TIME TO 1990 IN VIDEO GAME FORM!) Part of the draw of the Special Edition is that it modernizes the 1990 classic for 2015 audiences - because who in the hell wants to play with a verb menu permanently glued to the bottom of the screen these days? It's like watching a movie in a theatre with an uncomfortable mask on. That may fly in The Bad Old Days, but this is 2015 and I have MONITOR REAL ESTATE. There's also a built-in hint system if you get stuck on the puzzles. Just hammer the H button. The H button stands for ""Help, Hi! Here Hi Ham Hin Hthis Hcomputer Hgame, Hand Hi Hhave Hno Hidea Hwhere Hto Hgo!""As for the actual game itself? It's a pirate story with a wonderful atmosphere, interesting characters, and jokes coming out of the wazoo. But as for the progression and puzzles... well, they're not so hot. Half of the game is about gearing up for the big expedition, and then the other half quickly flys by. The puzzles range from 'fine' to 'irritating'. The best course of action when playing this is to take in the atmosphere and choose every dialogue option you can get. That means you get more jokes, and the puzzles aren't as tedious!Anyway, this is one of the greats, and no animals die in this video game, so I am happy to say it'll be a thing you can treasure for some time.

												(Let me start off by saying that I still own the original releases of this game on Floppy, CD-Rom, and the remake on Xbox 360. I only installed it here to write a review. Don't judge this review my playtime on steam.)  Ok, so I have been playing this game annually for over 20 years now, and I still enjoy it as much as when I was a kid.This game is the DEFINITIVE point&click game to me. It literally embodies everything the modern game-industry is missing, and you can feel the passion the developers had for this game when they were making it.   It might not be packed with action, but as it stands it can not only keep up with modern games, but absolutes wrecks many of it's modern day opponents. All of the characters feel believable in a whacky way, yet achieve to fit into the world around them. The Plot is incredibly immersive, and the protagonist will forever stay in your mind as  ""Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate."" From the first second of dialog to the last cutscene, every second is filled with hilarious jokes - some of which even break the fourth wall (remember this game released in 1990). Additionally the graphics have been reworked, and the ENTIRE GAME has spoken dialog, and monologues.If you (like me) are old as ♥♥♥♥, and would like to take a stroll down memory lane, or you'd like to experience the game that started it all - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS GAME.5/5 - This game is literally a timeless classic.

												Never played the original......The humor and story of the now 26 year old game (!) is still brilliant today, while the interface and graphic has aged a LOT (in my opinion). But this remaster is very nice. You can toggle beween the new version with redrawn and revoiced everything and the old game, and compare for yourself.+ The now classic Monkey Island humor.+ The new art is gorgeous.+ M U S I C+ A help system which gives you litte suggestions to whole instructions to cover up for the typical flaw in adventure games (it works REALLY well).

Quite possibly the funniest game I've ever laid my eyes on.Would not recommend only for someone who completely despises point & click genre.

												I played this when it first came out - I had lots of time playing the old Sierra titles and this was so incredibly fun and original I was hooked immediately.  The remake offered here does something I love - they included the original version!  You can easily switch between the new grpahics (they seem rushed and a little ""off"" - more than in Monkey Island 2) and the original UI.  You can use a gamepad, and while I didn't enjoy that control I have a few friends who used it with only some minor adjustment (cursing).At any time you can switch between the two versions and can even grab hints in the newer one.  I did bonce back and forth in a few scenes to see how it looked ""remastered"" but just went right back to the original.This game is a classic for a reason - you can't die, (rubber trees to the rescue!) it is clever and the story is great, and there are so many little gags and goofs that will keep you chuckling throughout the game.This game is also why one day I will own my very own rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle - mark my words as I am also a Mighty Pirate!If you can grab it on sale, don't miss it!

ENGLISH and Italian Review Recensione Inglese ed ITALIANAEnglish: Oh boy, what can i say? Monkey Island is a game that EVERY gamer MUST play, and this is the perfect time to do it, with this remake. Personally, i'm not a huge fan of this version of the game, i prefer the classic version but, ehy, this is great anyway, and it brought my memories back to when i was a child. But you don't care about this, don't you? So let's keep going. The graphics are modern and beautiful, the gameplay is the classic one that these games invented at their time, and as always, is GREAT. The story is a lot engaging, and the UNIVERSE of this game... Oh god. I just love it, is so well done, with its lore, its characters, its jokes, its stereotypes, THE GROG... Just play it and you'll understand, wait the sales if you need it but PLAY IT. You'll thank me later ;)(Sorry for my bad english)And remember..   ""Never pay more than 20 bucks for a computer game.""Italiano: Oh, ragazzi, cosa c'è da dire? Monkey Island è un gioco che DEVE essere giocato da TUTTI i videogiocatori, e questo remake è l'occasione perfetta. Personalmente non vado PAZZO per questa versione del gioco, preferivo quella originale sotto certi aspetti ma, ehi, è comunque fantastico, e poi mi ha riportato con la mente a quando ero bambino. Ma a voi questo non interessa, giusto? La grafica è bella e moderna, la giocabilità è stupenda, il gameplay è quello classico del punta e clicca, inventato proprio da questi giochi ai loro tempi, la storia è avvincente e divertente e poi l'UNIVERSO di questo gioco è talmente ben fatto, con le sue battute, i suoi stereotipi, i personaggi, IL GROG... Giocatelo e basta, aspettate gli sconti se dovete ma, giocatelo. Poi mi ringrazierete ;)E ricordatevi...  ""Mai pagare più di 20 dollari per un gioco del computer."" "

												The Secret of Monkey Island is a very classic and revolutionary game. Although it was made in the 90s, it will always be a brilliant game, and this special edition shows that it can even stay up to date with modern video games (Although you can never beat the classic graphics).The Secret of Monkey Island series is one of the most funny games series that I have ever played, with the brilliantly weakened forth wall, and the cute child-like innocence of Guybrush Threepwood, every time I replay a Monkey Island game I cannot help but to laugh at the jokes and the little references, and every time I replay it, I always find new brilliantly absurd commands and interactions. The special edition of this game is in some aspects an improvement, but in most, quite a disappointment. The inventory is different, there's voice acting, the Stump Joke is missing and a few more differences. The special edition shouldn't be thing to deter you from buying, or from not buying this game. If you don't like the notion of a special edition, and would rather the classic, floppy disk version, you shouldn't let that stop you from buying this version, quite a lot of the special edition factors can be turned off and, apart from the missing Stump Joke, not much else was changed. If you love modern, newer games, and feel that old games are in the past, you should still not let that stop you from buying this game, for the special edition has updated the game to look sleek and new, and if you cannot stand having to read dialogue, just turn on the voice acting.The Special vs Classic edition aside, the dialogue in Money Island is very funny, Guybrush Threepwood constantly breaks the forth wall, so much so, that by the time of the second game, you would have forgotten that it was ever there. There are lines of dialogue that are just so perfect in the game, that you simply cannot help but to pick, sometimes it is Guybrush Threepwood saying he wants to be a fire-fighter (instead of a pirate) or him asking if two brothers are his mother. The plot of the game is not that thick and at some times it barely even makes any sense. But the love story in the whole series of Monkey Island games is the cutest love story you could ever see, with the stupid, innocent Guybrush, and the strong, independent Elaine, why they are even together boggles the best of the fans.There are many good things about The Secret of Monkey Island, but one big factor that cannot be turned off or on is the difficulty. This game is very, VERY hard, because it is an old fashioned point and click game, it has absurd logic, Guybrush Threepwood cannot reach something a few metres off the ground and thinks that if he mixes red flowers with meat it will poison it, also somehow he is able to use a kitchen pot as a helmet....  The game thus feels as if it goes on forever when you play it, whether you spend ages pondering over a specific puzzle, executing trial and error, or you have a walkthrough up in a tab, trying to not overuse the hints, you will spend quite a bit of time on the game. Sometimes it is merely a simple puzzle that with stitch you up, or maybe it will be the whole game, either way, I heavily recommend having some sort of hint system or walkthrough handy, just in case.I would heavily recomend this game to you, even if you are a very serious person, the humor is not all there is to this game, it has a brilliant soundtrack and very difficult puzzles, and on a whole is quite an enoyable game.

												An excellent remake of an absolute classic.  The Secret of Monkey Island is the quintessential point and click adventure game that is full of puzzles, witty humour and memorable characters.  The game is obviously at its best when you are playing it for the first time as it will be difficult and all the jokes will be fresh.  This hasn't stopped many players, including myself, playing the game dozens of times.  This remake allows you to play the game in its original form or with updated graphics, voice acting and controls.  This is where I found there to be a few problems.  The updated special edition gives you a fantastic way to play the game, but I found myself switching back to the old version during a few puzzles that require specific timing.  The updated mode forces you to scroll throw actions such as ""Look at"" or ""Use"" instead of having them all on the screen at once.  This can be frustrating and I think this is the wrong sort of game to force a controller like interface on players.  Having to switch between versions due to a frustrating control scheme isn't really good enough.The game itself is challenging and it has more than one puzzle that will stump new players.  I would also go as far as to say that one specific part of the game has a ridiculous amount of back and forth between a few locations.  This has always bothered me, but it's a minor issue.  I simply recommend that you avoid a guide and give this a try, it's difficult, but you have all the time in the world and it's certainly rewarding when you make your way towards the end of the game.This special edition is well worth the purchase as it offers new players the chance to experience a fantastic adventure game while offering the old fans a chance to play it with a bit of a makeover.

												Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition is a 2009 remake of old classic DOS point'n'click adventure title, that came out back in 1990. This version actually allows switching between original and remake on-the-fly. If you just want to play original, you can do it pretty much from beggining to the end, with almost no changes!Monkey Island itself is a classic LucasArts adventure game. It's well remembered for it's pirate (including voodoo) setting and humor, having world to expore and having puzzles to break head against, guessing what they want player to do. By that point, adventures games already had point'n'click setting in place, just clicking on needed verb and using it on object. Just clicking on object itself always uses the most logical verb (and often the only one possible), so you may just forget of this aspect.The game is divided into three chapters, the first one being the biggest and most open one, travelling on Melee Island, talking around and trying to complete three main objectives in order to become pirate, while starting to figure out what Le Chuck has to do in this game. Second chapter has you on another island, bigger in space, but less in NPCs, just having this funnily annoying slightly crazed inhabitant of island dropping in and out. Final chapter, ""Kicks Butt"", kicks some serious butts. Linear, short, but bumps you up and is very worthy compared to Adventure games.Now, being classic adventure game, it's more concentrated on non-stop solving of 'puzzles' and interaction, with the only action sequences being sword fighting. Well, not exactly what you think. INSULT sword fighting, used only in chapter 1 anyway. Worth noting, you have to beat such ""battles"" by choosing correct reply to insults, while later throwing your own. Heck, most of them is spend on ""farming"" new insult and replies, by losing, to collect them all and beat the Swordmaster.Otherwise, standart classic LucasArts. Which means few things. First, there is no way to die or get stuck in dead end in this game, so you can do stupid things all the way you want, unlike classic Sierra. Second, you can choose few options in conversation, but none changes the plot or progression - it's either a puzzle by itself or ""choose your own joke to make"". (You can even choose ""what we have learned"" reply in the end of the game!). Third, the puzzles are either easy and logical or they are hard and make no common sense. Quite a common thing in classic adventure games, doing something unexpect for goals that plotwise aren't the ones you would want to do, Like, suddenly finding out that you have and actually can 'combine' items in your inventory, for single puzzle, to rescue some shady figure who probably wouldn't be much of good if freed. Special Edition keeps all of those and provides an upgrade to both graphics and sound, while messing around controls. Hands down, music is superior to soundblaster and art has more resolution than what original offered. But the gap is too big and those who grew with original may be put off. Difference between pixels-art that leaves something for imagination and defined art, you see. Where main character, Guybrush, was a normal guy in black and white in original, with who most people could reliate, becomes character in it's own with that hair. And sure thing, close-ups aren't drawn in same realistical way. But otherwise, it's fancy in it's own!It also added voice acting to it, but because of limitation of original engine, it has awkward pause between each line, putting some players off. And once again, ""it's not the way we imagined it when we played original"".And you can switch between original and remake on the fly, with press of single button, no loading required! Nice! Though, you can notice that animation in remake somehow feels to follow animation of original closely, having same amount of animation frames, not always having art to make same sense in these cases. Actually, it switches not only visual and audio, but interface too. And it's another reason to stay on original, being made with in way to allow it to be controlled by gamepads on consoles as well. It tries to be as good as in modern point'n'clicks, but clumpsier. Much. Main fault comes from technical aspect, actually, where for some reason sometimes it playes like the actual cursor is placed lower/higher than it's actually shown.And sure thing, to keep modern players sane, it incorporated hints system, when on the magical press of button, you get a hint hint hint. Good joy, much needed. Not always as straight as you would want it to be though, but anything helps.Thus, nice remake of classic adventure game, which most recommend to play at least once, having humor, story and some puzzles that make no sense, this fault of adventure games eased up with hints. Not too long either and with charm.			"

A Review From An Extremely Picky Long Time FanOpen ThoughtsThe Secret Of Monkey Island holds a dear place in mine and many gamers hearts. My first play through of the game happened in 1998, when I picked up a copy of the ""Monkey Island Madness"" CD as part of a lucasarts anthology at a local cd and movie shop. I spent countless hours playing and enjoying the unique story and challenging puzzles. I have to admit I fall into the ""hardcore fan"" category for this series and take it quite seriously. As such it took me a very long time to come around and actually finish playing this special edition. My first play through had me cursing the controls, hating the new shiny graphics (I know, I know you can switch to the old style), and being unsure of many of the voiceover choices. Dominic Armato returns to voice Guybrush as he has done for every Monkey Island since Curse, which is great because he fits the character amazingly. That is about where my praise stops for the voice actors however. Many of the characters made me cringe because of their bad interpretations of the dialogue. One of the things about 'SOMI' that made it so great was the amazing humour and fantastic character writing. Much of that charm and emotion did not translate well to voice actors (again, I praise Dominic for doing an amazing job despite the other actors). I found myself playing without voices for any cutscenes heavy on the dialogue.Next I must address the art. Which perhaps I have the most to gripe about (until we reach controls). The original SOMI is a GORGEOUS game, and the included ""classic"" gameplay showcases just how well the game has held up despite limiting tech when it was created. The carefully utilized colors and pixelated characters retain a charm that is hard to find in most modern games. The characters look terrible in the new art style, though none took as harsh of a beating as guybrush himself. Guybrush was given the neck of an irritated girrafe and the hair of a bad anime character that literally defies gravity. Much of the cutscene conversation interactions are more cartoony looking, and lack a gritty reach for realism that it felt like the original game tried to achieve. The characters lost much of their appeal and had it replaced with cartoon imitations in this new art style. Now before you accuse me of rampant fanboyism, I DO think that the special editon artwork has some charm despite it's faults.So what's positive about the new art? Many of the backgrounds are fantastic! Melee Island in particular benefitted greatly from this update and if not for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ character design, I would have found the ambience damn near flawless. I was excited to go places I knew very well and see how they now looked. If there is one thing I LOVED about this special edition it was most certainly those gorgeous painted enviroments. Kudos to the art team for that.All of this was nitpicking however, and the true reason that despite my love for the series I had to not reccomend this game is that it's controls are simply not well suited for many of the puzzles. There is one puzzle in particular the puzzle in which you must continuously trade out mugs of grog to reach the jail cell that was literally impossible to do quick enough in the new control scheme. It felt like they wanted to simplify the system to leave the original action menu hidden, but it just ended up being confusing and hard to use, severely detracting from the experience. I was often switching back to the classic gameplay just to finish things quickly and easily without fumbling through the controls.Am I glad this was released? Hell yes, this series deserves more fans, and more people getting to enjoy it. And I acknowledge that my review will likely not be the typical experience as the special edition of this game is highly recieved by many many critics. If nothing else, I am happy to have a fully updated version of the classic game packaged with this so I do not have to bother with scumm or dosbox whenever I am feeling nostalgic. I promise my review (coming soon) of Lechuck's Revenge SE, is much more positive than this one (because its a much better update than this was).			"

												TSoMI is truely one of the best Point & Click Adventure of all times. It cames straight from a Decade where P&C Adventures ruled the Computer Genre and here is the best of it.In that Game you take control of Guybrush Threepwood, a young wannabe Pirate who comes to Melee Island to take a step forward in his carreer in the Life of a Pirate.In the first Act you have to prove the Pirate Leaders that you are a worthy Pirate for them (The 3 Trials) and here you meet your truely Love, Gouvernor Elaine Marley in one Trial.The Trials could be no problem if the bad Ghost Pirate LeChuck wouldn't kidnapped the Gouvernor for marry her (i dont wanna say to much) ;-)So its up to you to find your big Love and hunt LeChuck down (just a wonderfull story).You will meet a 3-headed-Monkey, Cannibals, Ghostpirates, etc. The Story counts to the best still today, the Graphics are remaded with detailed Love (even if i find the new Guybrush look horrible), the Music is so awesome that i cant forget them till today.The Controls aren't the best in the Special Edition, here was the original from 1990 much better.I would give it 8/10 !!!

												Point and Click in its most glorious moments, it doesn't get much better than this!A fabulous pirate-themed comedic world and funny witty lines make The Secret of Monkey Island an unmissable and totally worthy game. The dialogues are really well written and make you laugh most of the time, while the soundtrack is refreshing and fits the game's atmosphere, the latter giving fans of pirate stories one more reason to play this.As if all these were already not enough ingredients to make a great recipe, this Special Edition remake also includes (great) voice acting and improved graphics, both missing in the 1990 original version. Especially the voice acting enhances a lot the comedy value of the game's lines (the ""insult"" sword fights were awesome)!To top it, hardcore retro fans get nonetheless the option to switch on the go between the original and the improved version, leaving pretty much everyone satisfied (save gamers that don't like point and clicks... their loss)!

												Hi. I'm selling these fine leather jackets.Sometimes the old ones just can't be beaten. A lick of paint certainly helps Monkey Island look better nowadays, but the script is still first class. Not many games can boast pacing, timing and dialogue as good as this.I also love the fact that this Special Edition actually runs on a modified version of SCUMM so you can switch between old and new at any point in the game by pushing a button. The only thing I don't like about it is that you can't run it in SCUMMVm, which unfortunately limits it to Windows only. Oh well.			"

												This game's sense of humor is hilarious. Nowhere else in the world can you find obvious product placement, a rubber-chicken-with-a-pulley-in-the-middle and names like Guybrush Threepwood. The jokes may not sound like they'd be funny, but you have to play the game yourself.			"

												Rose-tinted nostalgia glasses my butt. This is a good game. I played it for the first time in 2010 and had a lot of fun. The hint system was a nice addition, as well the ability to qucikly move from classic to Special Edition mode, so you're not only getting the remake but also the original game to some extent. Might not be as funny now for some people but you definetly should give this one a try.			"

												So much can be said. I don't want to write out an entire review here, so I'll just say this. If you are remotely interested in this game, buy it. Seriously, you'll probably find it rather fun for awhile. Sure you might not like it after awhile (I will admit that it does take some time to get into) but if you continue at it, you'll find something good in there.That said, you should pick up this game anyways because what we have here is a huge part of gaming history. This was the series that saved LucasArts and was one of the lead pioneers of the adventure genre.Verdict: BUYGet it because then you'll have experienced a rather interesting bit of history.			"

												Not just this one, but all the Monkey Island series, it's one of the best point and clicks I've ever played. Very humorous and worth your buck even if you're one of those who don't like ""games with dialog"" (because I know some of those, and they still liked Monkey Island). It's one clever game, and terribly amusing.(If you've ever played any SCUMM games - Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, The Amazon Queen, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Sam & Max, Kyrandia, etc - it's in a similar style and has used the same engine in the past), also, if you liked Grim Fandando you'll probably also like this one.And if you like it oldschool, you can too revert the graphics to the old DOS ones.Try it, nao!

												Classic game worth playing.The humor alone is a good reason to buy this game. Guybrush Threepwood is one of the most iconic characters in any game I've ever played, and the writers of the game did an amazing job making the jokes that would define him as a piece of gaming history. I haven't played my share of point and click games, as I find them mostly boring. This game however overcomes that through wit and laughs. In any case where dialogue is present there will always be a joke to keep it from being too boring. I will say that there can be some tedious back and forth, but you don't have to participate in it if you don't want (but I will say sometimes it pays off to just go along with it). Like any point and click game, it's objectives consist of problem solving and puzzles. If at any time you get stuck it even provides a help option that basically tells you what to do just by pressing H. I don't want to say much about the story, but I will say that it was short and sweet. Overall I enjoyed the gameplay but probably won't play it again since the story is pretty short and I really don't think I missed anything.Pros:     -Funny dialogue     -Memorable characters     -Fun gameplay mechanics (as far as a point and click goes)     -Can probably be finished in one day      -Soundtrack is exquisite     -Can switch between the new and old versionsCons:     -Some of the travel back and forth can be tedious     -Short story     -Low replay valueThis is really just one of those games everyone should play at one point or another, and I hope my review influenced your dicision to buy it. If you can try and get it on sale, but 10 usd really isn't a bad price for this game and it never hurts to support the develepors.			"

												This game and it's sequel were some of my most loved first pc games ever.  Lucas Arts had some of my favorite games back then and the Monkey Island series was no exeception.As other reviewers said, there are plenty of smiles and chuckles to be had.  I had the special edition a few years back but it was on an old account  and I can't recover the information to find it again so when I saw the Monkey Island bundle on sale for under $4.00 over xmas I had to get it again!Right from the first start of the game the rush of pure glee came flooding back. Oh that music! Lol.I really love that I can play in old school mode or the newer refresh version however on my pc the original mode is hard to view, so many pixels.Honestly the updated graphics are just so much nicer that I don't really miss the original graphics.However to peek at it brings back memories when I first played it back in the day so it's fun to have that option.If you get stuck on something there are plenty of walkthrough and guides to be found online but there is an in game hint system.Be sure to really explore things, click on everything, talk to everyone and if you want to cover all the jokes, laughs and surprises make sure you have a good chat with them.I just don't want to give anything away for those that never played Monkey Island before ( if you like this one be sure to play MI2) but if you want to get the full enjoyment of this retro game then don't rush through it and enjoy the interactions on your adventure.If you aren't familar with the 'old school', those tried and true fun games of the 90's then this should be one of the first ones you try ( and don't forget the 2nd installment of Monkey Island if you enjoy the first, both worth playing). happy gaming~			"

Gameplay is similar to other games such as Sam & Max: Hit the Road, Day of The Tentacle, & Leisure Suit Larry.The game has an amazingly funny dialogue, cool story, fun & challenging puzzles to solve, awesome music, redone graphics, redone soundtrack, added voice acting which was missing from the original, original and new graphics which you can swap between at any time at a click of a button.This game is awesome a true classic, i highly recommend checking it out.

												One of the best games I ever played and still a top title!My father had the first ever version that was released and I liked that one so bad when I was like 9 years old.Now I thought I could buy the special edition, in order to look, if it has been transposed well.And now that I played it two times, I can say:Yes, it is!I love the new graphic, it looks looks very good, and it has been drawed very accurate.The synchro could be better, but it's not like it destroys the atmosphere, since it is really nice, that you don't need to read every single sentence.What I like most is the new soundscape, it is really nice and detailed, compared to the old sound. Also the music has been slightly overworked, as it is now a full orchestra I guess and not only 8-Bit sound. But don't worry the songs are still the same and they sound incredible!One off the best features is, that you can switch between the old and the new graphicstyle (which includes also the soundscape and the localization (synchro)), so if you dont't like the new graphics, you can easily switch between both, just by pressing one single button.Well, thats pretty much it.I think I dont't need to say much about the game itself, since it was and still is one of the most succesful point & click-adventures of all time.I higly recommend playing the game, for everyone who rudimentally likes p&c-adventures and because you can switch the graphics, even if you don't like the new graphic, that's no issue.Thanks for reading this wall of text, and I wish much fun with the game (Yes, I'm sure that you're gonna play it. Go ahead, buy it right now ;D )Greetings from Germany,Rico			"

												What is the SECRET of Monkey Island? Well your going to have to figure that out yourself. But one thing that is not a secret, is how amazing this game is. Quite possibly the first adventure game I ever played and the game that got me hooked to the genre. I love the music, the humor, the storyline, and almost everything about the game. Now looking back 25 years later I do see that the game is not completely without flaw. First, the game was made in 1990 so the graphics aren't all that great and there are no voices. Second, the game is relatively short by today's standards. This is not something that bothers me and shouldn't for most people, but might to the more recent fans of adventure gaming. Luckily the Special Edition gives the best of both worlds graphically (sorry but the story is still just as short), as old fans and new fans can enjoy the game they would want to play. Because trust me, there are some old fans that would cringe at the new look. The classic version and new version can be switched seemlessly by hitting F10. The old version staying true to its ancient (voodoo?) roots of a verb menu and an inventory box. The new version many good additions added to its gameplay as the new version intoduces 3D art, voices, and a much larger screen of play (due to the fact that the verb menu and an inventory box have been removed). Although I do enjoy a much larger screen, this is the one thing about the new version I am not fond of. They do have a drop down menu for the verb menu by hitting Ctrl or V as well as one for the inventory by hitting Alt or I, but this feels like more of a hassle than the old game used to be. At the end of the day, this game is a keeper. So don the adventurer's cap and become ""Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate!""Check out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!			"

I played this game years ago when it was on CD rom.  Many of you probably don't even know what that is.  LOL Needless to say it was nice to play it again after much time had passed.  The puzzles were still challenging, but not as much as the first time around.  The main draw for this game is the remastering that went into it.  Voice acting and updated graphics definetly make this game a blast from the past and appealing to newcomers of the adventure game genre.I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a funny game to play or a reminder of when adventure games had a firm foothold on the gaming world.

												Having played the original Amiga release, there is a high nostalgia factor in this game for me. One of my favourite games of the era.So the Special Edition has been updated for the 21st century and the graphics are a lot easier on the eye, but what set this game apart back in '90 is still at its core - the humour.Play with the original graphics and it still has the entertainment factor.The puzzles aren't too difficult to figure out, but at the same time they're not overly obvious either. At worst you may need to back-track to get something you didn't know you needed.TSOMI is a delightful trip through silliness and fun. Not a long or deep game at all by today's standards but it never needed to be. Just buy it at the ridiculous price is usually is, then install, relax and have fun.			"

												I can't really add anything that has not already been said about monkey island. It is a wonderful graphic adventure. Developed with a lot of heart, you will take a way a lot of memorable scenes. The special edition is in some regards wonderful. The new recorded orchestral soundtrack is the best version of the memorable songs, that you can find. The voice work is top notch, and adds a lot of flavor and production value to the game. The backgrounds are ofter wonderful drawn, BUT, the characters now look far too cartoony, and are not close to their originals. There controls, especially the inventory could have been made nicer, with a permanent inventory row on the top or something like that. But all in all, it is a good idea to play this title. It is wonderful.			"

												This is an excellent remake of the cult classic point and click adventure game. I think they have gone as far as they could to improve sound - graphics - while keeping in touch with the original. And they have left the core game - the puzzles - dialogues intact. The voice acting is consistent with later titles in the series as they have recruited the same roster of voice actors for the main characters. The ability to swap back and forth between the classic edition and the improved edition is genius, but it does get strangely addictive and I find myself wishing for some kind blinking mode where it would constantly swap back and forth in a slow pace just so I can apprciate the best of both worlds. If you are not familiar with the series but like adventure games it is fair enough to say that as long as you can take a light hearted adventure and do not mind old school adventure gaming puzzles you will end up making quite a lot of nice gaming memories for yourself and will no doubt find yourself laughing out at the absurdity of this yet believable pirate universe.

The puzzles are quite hard because sometimes they just don't make any sense, so most of the time you have to pay attention (and maybe use pen and paper to make annotations). Old school players probably know how to finish this game in 5 hours, but new gamers will have a playground to play for around 10 hours. And hey, if you get stuck you can always press H to get the solution of the puzzle. I can't forget to mention the funny plot and the absurd amount of LOLs moments from the beginning to very end.

												I nominated this game for the ""Test of Time"" award, and isn't it obvious why? The original game was released in 1990 and it's hard to find an earlier game that still holds up so well, or even among newer games! The graphics (well, the original ones) are beautiful, the music is some of the most memorable in any game, (yes, I hum it regularly!) the puzzles flow perfectly, and are pretty hard to forget, well most of them, the great care taken to ensure playability, which was almost unheard of in 1990! (Only other game that was out at the time, that took such care to ensure the player is so well treated and can just have fun... is Mixed-Up Mother Goose.) And one really great thing is the many ways there are to play certain portions! I'm still finding little dialogues and alternative ways to solve the game's puzzles to this day. It's so rare for a game, in any time period, to feel so much like the developers poured their hearts and souls into it, and well, they did! Possibly literally, if you believe the rumours. (And yes, it does feel like it's more rare these days, whatever.)Oh, I hear the game doesn't exactly work very well if you don't play it on Windows XP, Vista, or 7, and well, Microsoft's doing a pretty good job trying to erase those from the face of the earth. (Thanks guys!) So, if you do get this Special Edition of the game, and I do still recommend it, I recommend you get the ""Ultimate Talkie Edition"" patch. With it, you'll be able to play on any version of Windows, OS X, pretty much any free operating system, (whatever flavour of Linux, or BSD, or whatever else) Android, and lots of other things, and even DOS like in the Good Old Days! (You kept your old computer, right?!) You don't get the fancy new Special Edition HD graphics but well... look at the screenshots. You aren't missing out too badly.			"

Another great feature is that with a simple click of a button you can just revert back to the original game so you can compare the two versions.A must have for any fans of point-and-click adventures.The only gripe is the lack of a visible UI which makes clicking and combining stuff unnecessarily  convoluting.

												One of the greatest games of all time. The apex of the Golden Age of Adventure Games. Created by Lucas Games, the project was headed by Ron Gilbert. The music--composed by Land--deserves its own review. It is rich, varied, and seamless from scene to scene. Reggae, calypso, sea shanties, and other forms of music combine to form the soundtrack, which helps to place the game in the Caribbean.Anyone who has not played this owes it to themself to play it.

												¿Es suficiente esta remodelación para el usuario actual? Personalmente opino que es un videojuego enfocado a los enamorados de la primera versión; no creo que un desconocedor de la saga valore con este remake la joya que tiene entre manos. El resultado final no es malo, pero deja mucho que desear si comparamos con el resto de obras que abarca el panorama actual.

This is the Adventure genre at it very best, and being able to switch between the new and old on the fly is a nice touch.

												Really high quality remake of one of the most well known adventure games. The updated modern graphics and music I think are excellent as is the spoken dialogue that wasn't present in the original. Another great feature is the ability at a press of a button to swap between the original and updated versions of the game. The game itself is challenging but not as tough as Monkey Island 2, which I think was too hard in places. Definately worth playing whether you've played the original or not.			"

												Guybrush Threepwood wants to be a pirate. This is the basic premise of the first entry in the Monkey Island series, in which Guybrush Threepwood must prove himself to the pirate lords and save the damsel in distress from the evil ghost pirate LeChuck.In this old-fashioned point and click adventure game by LucasArts, you solve puzzles and engage in conversations to achieve your goal of becoming a mighty pirate. The special edition features upgraded graphics and audio (although you can revert to old school style) that mostly works, although the design of Guybrush could have been better. While the sequel's special edition is better than that of the first game, this is still a hilarious and engaging adventure that is definitely worth playing. One of the greatest comedy classics in gaming got better.			"

												""The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition"" is an OK game.  That might sound like faint praise, but considering that I first played the original edition around 24 years ago and it was distributed on floppy disks, it's actually a testament to how good the game was.For the positives, the updated graphics, story, and humor are pretty nice.  It's also nice that you can't really mess things up so bad that you need to load a saved game.  Saves, for the most part, are there just because you might want to stop playing for a while and come back later.Unfortunately, there are negatives.  The biggest is that a lot of the game is hunt-the-pixel.  Many of the items that you need to find/work with are fairly obvious in the environment.  But, many others are essentially indistinguishable from the background (a couple of planks especially spring to mind as well as the maps):  if you don't happen to mouse over the correct pixel, you'd never know you can do something there.  The ""verb"" and inventory system, though ground-breaking back in 1990 is a bit awkward today (I'm playing Monkey Island 2 right now, and they fixed this there).  Also, because the cut-scenes and dialogs are not skippable, the pacing drags.  Similarly to the hunt-the-pixel issue, in many cases you don't know that you can walk off the screen and get to another area.  And, finally, the introductory and ending credits are non-skippable.  There's nothing you can do about the introductory credits, and the only way I was able to quit the game during the ending credits was to Alt-Tab out and close the window from the desktop.So, yes.  Pluses and minuses.  It's a shame I can't say the game is better than OK (it was tremendous in its day).  But, if you can buy it cheap enough, its current rendition is a good way to spend about 10 hours.			"

												This is a really good remake of the original game. I hadn't ever played it, but I was already familiar with the Monkey Island series :).The first I actually played was MI 3 (there's at least 4 of them to my knowledge).I can vaguely remember seeing bits of MI 2, and thought it was really awesome, so I'd most definitely recommend getting the pack (The Secret of Monkey Island + Monkey Island 2 - special edition)._________________________________________________________________The best thing about Monkey Island is it's wacky & silly sense of humour. I just love this stuff. It's not meant to be taken seriously!If it wasn't for the built-in hints system, I most probably would have been stuck (especially near the end). I really was clueless as to how to proceed at one point, due to experiencing issues with pointing & clicking (which was rather frustrating, since this is a P&C game after all!).So when that's a bit ""off""... well, it definitely doesn't want to keep you going (which made me rely on the hints-system, more than I normally would have).But considering it's old age, it really is a quality game, and well worth the money!It's beauty lies in it's simplicity and lighthearted nature :). The story is very straightforward & ridiculously basic.[...young guy wants to be a pirate, ...goes off on a journey to become one, ...meets a girl on the way, ...they instantly fall in love (literally!), ...she gets in trouble, ...he faces the bad guy who got her in trouble & gets rid of him and then the lovebirds sail off together] :)This is excellent for when you want to play something different for a change, where you're not expected to think too realistically and just have a good laugh.I needed some time to grow accustomed to the graphics, but after playing a while, I became fond of the style (especially the way Guybrush was portrayed). They definitely captured his spirit visually!Also, there's a neat option that let's you switch from the ""vintage"" pixelated style to the remastered style by pressing F10 (it even helped me find something I couldn't see in the remastered version - go figure!).The voice-acting is very well executed! Apparently the voice-actors each covered more than one character and I couldn't tell! And when you can't tell, guess what? That means they're really acting!And as for the music, the main theme is very catchy and fits the atmosphere perfectly. Same goes for the in-game soundtracks - very fitting!Once you hear the OST, it's very hard to get it out of your head :).Lastly, some of the subcharacters could definitely want you coming back for more :), they're just so much fun.PS I'm especially fond of Carla & Otis :). If you ever decide on playing the game, you'll soon figure out why ;).			"

If you are not familiar with the series but like adventure games it is fair enough to say that as long as you can take a light hearted adventure and do not mind old school adventure gaming puzzles you will end up making quite a lot of nice gaming memories for yourself and will no doubt find yourself laughing out at the absurdity of this yet believable pirate universe.

												I got this game as a gift from my dad for the new year of '91.  As a foreign speaker of English at the age of 11, a good deal of the humor and much of the puzzle logic went over my head, but amazingly that did not stop me from playing it on my Amiga 500 until the early lights of the day, mesmerized by the beauty of what I was playing.  I remember basically memorizing every pixel of what was in front of me, going to bed and having dreams of being on Melee Island myself (because even after six hours of clueless clicking, I still hadn't made it off Melee Island).  Eventually, I managed to finish the game as an enchanged 11 year old (with the help of clue guides) and went back to replaying it every now and then only to better understand it as my English improved.  I still remember the first time I got the ""Is that a banana in your pocket or are you just happy to see us?"" joke.  It only got better after I learned about Mae West.  And you know what, this game only keeps getting better and better no matter how many times you replay it.  Hats off to you, Mr. Gilbert.  You have done an amazing job.Yes, there are problems with the Special Edition. Three major problems to be exact.. First, the graphics are not what anyone hoped they would be (it's not Curse of the Monkey Island quality for sure) but what really hurts is that majority of the characters and backgrounds lost a lot of charm in the transition.  Second, the animation is terrible.  Monkey Island never really animated well (most Lucasarts adventures before Fate of Atlantis did not), and the same animations used on HD sprites just becomes terrible.  Finally, the GUI is bad, and I mean REALLY bad  - it somehow manages to be worse than the original.  Manipulating your inventory in particular is a truly painful experience.  However, the game makes up for these three faults by offering you a really well done remastered soundtrack and the option of playing with the original graphics (hotkey switchable with F10) and Monkey Island 2's GUI to boot!Ultimately, this is a must have, for anyone.  Whether you played the original back in the day and want to relive it, or whether you are curious about what this gem of gaming history is all about - do not hesitate, get it.  You will thank me for it.  Back in the days of clue books and hint lines, this game would take well over 20, maybe even 30 hours for the 11 year old me to beat, but this time around I managed it under a dozen hours.  And they were a really, really enjoyable, heart warming dozen hours that took me 25 years back in time.  I can hardly wait for Thimbleweed Park..			"

												The Secret of Monkey Island SE brings a remade version of the classic point and click adventure game that is sure to please both new players and old fans alike. The core essentials of the game are left intact, with technical limitations of the older game being redone and upgraded to take advantage of modern computers.Gameplay of Monkey Island is a point and click adventure, much like other PC titles in the 90s. Players move around, interact using certain actions, and can pick up and use multiple items for an action. In this remade version, the verb and inventory screens are hidden away by a keypress, allowing full use of the screen for the graphics. This does mean that trying to do certain actions is can be clunkier having to bring up the menu and pick the right option, but it doesn’t detract from the experience too badly. Puzzles are an integral part of adventure games, and this game does throw some interesting ones. Some puzzles are pretty obvious, while some others can be nonsensical, fitting with the game’s theme. At times knowing where to go or how to solve a puzzle can be daunting, but the remake luckily features a hint system to help guide players. The hint system works almost too well if overused, so try to use it at a minimum to enjoy solving and finding out things.  Inserted into the game is the ability to switch between Classic and Remake versions on the fly with a single button press, which changes the graphics, music, and UI. Overall, gameplay is fun and engaging even though some puzzles can be confusing or have strange solutions, since the hint system keeps things in check and helps players keep moving forward rather than being unable to solve a certain part.The game’s art and music received the most attention in the remake, and it shows. The art designs have a huge change in quality, being high resolution cartoony graphics much like recent Monkey Island games. The cartoony style does feel different from the older pixelated realism style along with the animations being almost one to one with the original limited animation, but it does evoke a certain unique style in the spirit of the original. The music also has a huge overhaul, with the MIDI songs from the original having been redone with a real instruments in a live band. All of these remake additions can be changed back to the originals with a single button press, where the game instantly changes the art and music with a smooth transition. The redone art and music does a fantastic job of keeping things up to date and in high quality, staying very true to the source with the option to run with the original game content if so desired.The story in The Secret of Monkey Island is fairly simple. You control Guybrush Threepwood, who wants to be a pirate. His actions bring the attention of several other characters that become the main focus of the game’s story.  It’s not an amazing story, but Monkey Island really shines in delivering its comedy. Characters are vibrant with unique traits, and the variety of odd items and silly lines makes for a fun experience. This is the charm of the game with less serious and more humorous things being the deciding concept of the game. The remake brings recorded voiceovers as well, which really helps to bring out each character with their own personality. Monkey Island brings both humor and unique characters with a straightforward story focused on making players have fun and laugh.Monkey Island SE is a point and click adventure for everyone with nicely redone visual and audio design, hints for new players, and new features like voiceovers and Classic mode switch. The core game is basically the original Secret of Monkey Island, but the additions in the remake make the Special Edition a definitive choice to play for new and old players.			"

												This game had it's highlights; while I found most of the dialogue ok, it made me laugh a few times. I have to admit I relied heavily on the hint function (pressing the 'H' key in-game) to solve the puzzles, which took the challenge out. Overall, I still enoyed it, and it's intersting tosee how they updated the graphics from the original, and I feel it's aged well. Easiest boss fight ever in a game, so don't expect it to be like a Legend of Zelda game. ****			"

A shoddy release.If you can use SCUMMVM, you might as well use that instead. Also note that you can use this release to create a Classic version with voices.

												One of the cleverest, funniest games I've played. You don't really play a point-and-click adventure game such as this for its gameplay, but for its story and characters and all that sort of thing, which this game definitely delivers; that is why it has become one of the must-plays of its genre. This is an outstanding remake, with a new interface and hint system. Best of all, voice acting and new vibrant hand-drawn visuals. And bester of all, you can freely switch between the remade and original versions on the fly with the push of a button and watch 19 years of time transform back and forth before you within a second. If you don't mind exploring different genres of video games, you gotta check this one out.			"

												An utterly charming update on the Lucasarts classic, the game itself hasn't changed but the presentation has been brought up to modern standards both in graphical fidelity and audio quality. It could be argued that the controls feel less natural than in the original but it's a minor complaint. Fantastically you can switch 'on-the-fly' between the original 1990 style and the remastered edition. Monkey Island was a game which never felt aged and the new presentation only highlights how timeless a game it is in any design. Bountiful.			"

												02-Jul-2016 : Finished main storyEquipment : MSI GT80-2QE NotebookREVIEW :This is a really good point & click adventure game. It has witty dialogue lines and interesting creative and funny puzzle solution. The only thing I hate is the ""backtracking"" between places to search for solutions. Since this is a remastered version, I kind of hope the developer will add a fast travel system for visited areas to make puzzle solving not too time consuming while still avoiding the Hint System. As for the remastered aspects, I love this special edition, the developer has done a good job remastering this game. If you like this kind of game and or LucasArts games, get this. Nuff' said. CONCLUSION :Recommended on sale price.			"

												I bought this game cause I had played the original game years ago and pretty much liked it. This Remake does not stick to the original story but is great fun anyways. I love the detail and the irony of this game. Some of the riddles are pretty hard and sometimes we were not able to solve some though we played the game with 3 (stoned) guys, so the help function is pretty usefull at some points (especcially if u dont have unlimited amount of time to try every possibility). Overall it was a nice and entertaining story game and it was well worth the 10 bucks. :))			"

Don't expect to figure the answer out straight away but at the same time don't get disheartened because you may not have found the solution yet either ;) Excellent writting with very witty humour, you will grow attached to Guybrush as he crosses paths with pirates, cannibals and the ocational monkey :)			"

												I wish I had never played The Secret of Monkey Island. Why? So that I could enjoy the wonder that this game is with virgin eyes all over again. I remember playing this game when it first came out - I was six years old. The graphics were colorful, and the music captivating. This game single handedly sparked an interest of pirates in me that has never faded. I keep coming back to this game every few years just to relive the story and nostalgia. This game has it all. A bar full of pirates that are partying in full swing, a circus ran by two block head spaghetti clowns, insult sword fighting, a fotune teller, man eating cannibals, an irritating old hermit that stalks you around an island, an antagonist in LeChuck that you'll love to hate, a beautiful love interest in Elaine Marley, and the most important character of all, the dopey, flappable, yet loveable Gorebrush Thriftweed. Wait... sorry. Guybrush Threepwood. Look behind you - a three headed monkey!			"

												I love this game.Monkey Island is my old favourite game and I 90% recommend it, the remaining 10% leaning towards the fact that if you don't enjoy point and click puzzle/adventure games this is NOT for you. This game has incredible characters, amazing smart puzzles, incredible adventures and an eerie feeling throughout the whole game (I better not forget the monkey's! They're awesome!)So the story of this game (Which is very well written) is that you are Guybrush Threepwood, a wannabe pirate. You must go on three trials to become a true pirate, once LeChuck, the evil ghost captain, hear's that Guybrush is in town and up to no good (Well, no good for him) he attempts to capture him, torture him and kill him. He also want's to marry SPOILERS Guybrush's girlfriend, Elaine.It's very difficult to find a flaw with this game, it seems almost perfect. The only problem is that sometimes there's no music which can be just eerie and just doesn't feel nice, it's a very scary game in that sense.The other thing is some puzzles are too hard and keep you trapped on them for sometimes weeks, but you could use the hint system to help you which is a helpful add on.The voice acting is pretty good in my opinion and so is the music (If it's even there) and the sound effects, although scary they're superbly atmospheric and you won't get tired of them.Another thing you won't get tired of is the adventure: It seemingly never becomes boring, it always feels interesting and enjoyable. And there are a HUGE amount of locations and now for my favourite part of the whole game... The sword fighting. But let me keep that a surprise. Let me just say, it's not sword fighting like how you'd imagine it.The graphics are good too, especially with the special edition's effect.And the final verdict for The Secret Of Monkey Island: Special Edition is the highest verdict so far... A 9.5/10. The few flaws JUST deprive it of that beautiful and unachieved 10/10 but it's still an amazing game and it will forever hold a piece in my heart. Until the next review! :)			"

												It's so nearly very good.The remastered music is cracking, the voices are spot on and the redone graphics are excellent (Although Guybrush's new hair cut is atrocious). You can also instantly switch between the old version and the new one by pressing F10. And thank god you can, because the new controls are flat out awful. Changing verb is a chore. Using two items in your inventory together is a nightmare. The old game was playable entirely with the mouse. The new one pretty much requires either the keyboard, or to switch to classic mode for the complex puzzles and play it like that for a while. You can't skip dialogue. Which you couldn't in the original either, but this is a remaster; we've learnt ways of improving game play since 1990 and this seems to have forgotten the last 26 years. Some of the dialog is long, repetitive and annoying (Especially Stan). You can hit backspace and skip the entire conversation, but then you've missed any important bits. Where's the ""Click to skip to next line""?It's Monkey Island. Monkey Island is marvellous. I keep wavering over recommending this just for the graphics and music. But then I look at how often I play it in classic mode (Which switches off the voice over, thus killing that as a selling point), and wonder why I don't just play the original instead.And then I notice you can't actually by the original any more so this gets a recommendation by default for being the only version available. But play it in classic mode. It's superior.			"

												GAME INTRODUCTION - I never thought that I would find a better adventure game than The Wolf Among Us, by Telltale Games. Well, it looks like this game broke that thought, upon opening the game I was immersed into the original and legendary soundtrack at the main menu, I then proceeded to play and it showed me the credits with an awesome background of the island and the music playing. GAMEPLAY - The game is pretty easy to control, you click to move the character, however keys such as ""pick up"" and ""use"" an item can be hard to remember for beginners, I suggest writing the keys and the corrosponding action down on a note sheet when playing the game.STORY - I haven't even passed the Pirate trials yet, the very first task of the game. What I can tell you now is that the story so far seems interesting and grabs my attention, one of those games that you can't put down until you finish.HUMOUR - This game has extremely clever one-liners that got me laughing, even some of the characters made me chuckle.RATING - 10/10			"

												Sound is added, the graphics are polished BUT you can switch to old school graphics any time you like.Now The Secret of Monkey Island was once upon a time one of the greatest adventure games ever made.I loved it. The ONLY con it has, is two bugs one at Chapter 1, and another between chapter 2 and 3. On Chapter 1, the shopkeeper opens his safe and the combination is seen fast and once. if you dont get it, to bad, you can not open it and go on with the game. There is absolutely no way to see it again. You have to load your game to a past point. So when you go to Stan to buy a ship for the first time, before you go to the shopkeeper with his card, make yourself a favor and SAVE your game. You can thank me later.  Also, you have to make a fuse to the cannon using rope piece on Chapter 2, then get a piece of rope once AGAIN from the ship storage, in order to go on with the game. If you don't. you will not be able to get the oars later on chapter 3. You have to load the game being in the ship to fix it. Anyway the whole game goes on without any problem so it is a really fun and great experience. And also it is the first Guybrush's adventure.You will see Monkey Island humor everywhere.			"

												I love this game.Monkey Island is my old favourite game and I 90% recommend it, the remaining 10% leaning towards the fact that if you don't enjoy point and click puzzle/adventure games this is NOT for you. This game has incredible characters, amazing smart puzzles, incredible adventures and an eerie feeling throughout the whole game (I better not forget the monkey's! They're awesome!)So the story of this game (Which is very well written) is that you are Guybrush Threepwood, a wannabe pirate. You must go on three trials to become a true pirate, once LeChuck, the evil ghost captain, hear's that Guybrush is in town and up to no good (Well, no good for him) he attempts to capture him, torture him and kill him. He also want's to marry SPOILERS Guybrush's girlfriend, Elaine.It's very difficult to find a flaw with this game, it seems almost perfect. The only problem is that sometimes there's no music which can be just eerie and just doesn't feel nice, it's a very scary game in that sense.The other thing is some puzzles are too hard and keep you trapped on them for sometimes weeks, but you could use the hint system to help you which is a helpful add on.The voice acting is pretty good in my opinion and so is the music (If it's even there) and the sound effects, although scary they're superbly atmospheric and you won't get tired of them.Another thing you won't get tired of is the adventure: It seemingly never becomes boring, it always feels interesting and enjoyable. And there are a HUGE amount of locations and now for my favourite part of the whole game... The sword fighting. But let me keep that a surprise. Let me just say, it's not sword fighting like how you'd imagine it.The graphics are good too, especially with the special edition's effect.And the final verdict for The Secret Of Monkey Island: Special Edition is the highest verdict so far... A 9.5/10. The few flaws JUST deprive it of that beautiful and unachieved 10/10 but it's still an amazing game and it will forever hold a piece in my heart. Until the next review! :)			"

												I have a massive nostalgia hard-on for the series them being my first love in videogaming ever (when I was like 10 or so) so I might probably not be able to be really neutral on this review. Regardless, I will try and number the pros and cons of the game itself:- Silly story, silly dialogue. Very in-line with any other Lucasarts titles, Simon the Sorcerer, Teen Agent or the like. Harmless, witty and a bit meta sometimes. The kind of humor the Deponia guys have been trying (and failing) so hard to convey in their games.- Gameplay is what you would expect from a SCUMM game. Pure point and click, with some overworld map sections. Old and new versions use their own inventory and action systems, and I'll get into each one further on. Most of the game consists of going places, talking to people picking up stuff and using it on other stuff to advance further on in the story. At one point one will be required to master insult swordfighting, which is kind of a minigame that to me felt fun to do but that I could see some people seeing like a chore. It's fortunately not super long and it pretty much plays itself so it's not a big deal.- Although some puzzles are certainly random and cryptic, overall most times the solution to a problem will be hinted at by the game. You can't die*, you won't run out of time, the game will save you a lot of backtracking by skipping some of it, and there is not a lot that you won't be able to solve with some patience in last instance. There is also a hints system in the Special Edition, but I couldn't use it. I'll touch on that further on.*that ONE doesn't count- Music is great. Not only the main theme is one of the most iconic and memorable songs in all of videogaming for a reason, the whole OST is made of catchy pirate-caribbean-y songs. Personally I prefer the MIDI versions over the newer instrumentals. Probably nostalgia, see above.Now, I have vastly differing opinions regarding graphics, GUI and voices. This happens because Monkey Island Special Edition can be played in two ways that for me radically change how the game plays, and that kinda ruin each separate mode for me.Regarding voices, my problem is, very simply put, you can't play classic mode with voiceovers. Which absolutely baffles me considering not only that Monkey Island 2 SE already had that out of the box, but that also you can actually fix yourself a classic version with voiceovers using this[gratissaugen.de], so that gives no excuse as to why Lucasarts couldn't have patched this at some point. That kinda ruins Classic mode for me and made me feel kinda ripped off when I bought this before I found out about this third party workaround.Interface wise I guess it comes down more to personal opinion. I prefer the old SCUMM GUI where you had the array of actions and items on the bottom, and I think there's a good reason it was the standard on a ton of point and clicks of the 90s. I personally don't feel like I need to sacrifice the nimbleness of that system for collapsible inventories and contextual stuff like Sam & Max Hit the Road or this game's ""remake"" mode do just to see more of the screen honestly. So that's a yay for classic mode, nay for the remake. Regarding the hints system I thought it was a nice addition, but due to me having to play the game on scummvm using that patch above to be able to play Classic with voiceovers, I didn't have the chance to use it.Now: the graphics. Hoo boy.First off, let me say: I am aware the classic mode looks chunky as hell. I am aware that the new graphics do look very detailed and very in line with the series' aesthetics after it hit 3. The problem comes from how absolutely disconnected everything feels. Talking animations are, no joking, 2 frames, while people actually look like they are talking in classic mode. And it's not just the animation, but the fact that the newer models usually don't seem to look at each other while talking, instead just looking into the distance. A lot of the background does look nicer, yes, but the scaling is jarring as *hell* on the new graphics, while the pixely nature of the classic mode helps a lot with that. And honestly, getting into the models themselves, I personally prefer the more natural, regular dude kinda feel the old graphics have to the humongous bobbleheads that while detailed, sometimes feel like watching a bunch of animatronics.Regarding the graphics especially it's really heartbreaking to have seen Lucasarts in its final years pouring so much money and talent into remastering one of their pivotal adventure games and coming out with something that's so pretty yet so unpleasant and so unpractical. Especially when you compare it to the more-than-15-years-old Monkey Island 3, which in my opinion hit right all the notes this remaster does wrong.So. As a product, out of the box, I don't think this is a very good game. Given that both versions have different features that could be cross-compatible, it would have been good to see more customization in that aspect, especially regarding voiceovers. I have huge problems with the remastered version's graphics, and overall I would recommend going here[gratissaugen.de] and playing classic with voiceovers.That said, this is a very fun, long, memorable, silly and entertaining adventure with great voicework. If you're looking to get into the big point and clickers of the 90s, or if you're looking for the definitive version of this game, absolutely pick it up. Price is very reasonable, especially on bundle.9/10 for the game itself, 8/10 for the SE edition.			"

												The game is the same old classic, the in it's current state, it is lacking some useability and customization. For example, if you switch to the old style, you can no longer have voices activatied. Another thing is navigating actions in the new version. This is really a hassle.  Monkey island 2 special edition deals with these problems in a much better way. It does not feel fluid for this game at all. This could easily have been patched in all the years since its release. Also, why no achievements on PC version?			"

												Rating 6.5/10Overview: Point and Click AdventureThe Good:+ The ability to change between modern and retro style graphics any time is really cool.+ Fully voiced acted in modern mode.  + Clever dialogue, fun characters and an interesting world + SoundtrackThe Bad:- You can't skip dialogue when you are in ""modern mode"". You have to switch back to retro if you want to skip dialogue - The interface is worse in modern mode than in retro mode. In the original, you had all your commands and inventory on the screen so it was easy to issue commands and use your inventory. In modern mode, inventory and commands are hidden off screen, you can use your mouse wheel to scroll through a list of commands but that becomes tedious. Lets say you want to combine items in your inventory, first press 'I' on the keyboard, then scroll to the 'use' icon with your mouse wheel and click on the item, THEN press 'I' again to open up your inventory and then find the item you want to combine it with...... nothing modern about this at all. If you are going to modernize the graphics then you should atleast modernize the interface as well. - A lot of puzzles require needless backtracking that makee solving them a huge chore.ConclusionI know Secret of Monkey Island is sacred to most gamers. It was one of the best and most successful point and click adventure games of its time. I'm glad they remade this game that works reasonably well for modern computers, but if you are going to play this, stick to the original mode.			"

												The Monkey Island Special Edition (SE) is awful and I cannot recommend it.I must have completed the original game over a dozen times.  I originally tried to play Monkey Island SE when it first game out and I didn't like it, so I stopped.  I have recently completed the Remastered version of Day of the Tentacle and that was a joy; the interface was slick and everything felt right.  Monkey Island SE is completely different.  The interface is awful, selecting verbs is farcical, when the mouse cursor reaches the edge of the screen you are no longer interacting with the game, and you have to bring the cursor in 5-10 pixels to actually get Guybrush to walk that way.  Combining inventory options feels impossible.I have no doubt that I will persevere and complete this version of the game, the ONLY positive is the voice acting, especially Dominic Armato's familiar tones from the sequels.  It's a shame that pressing F10 doesn't retain the voice acting, if it did then that would be worth the fee alone.  Awful upgrade, I'd have been embarrassed to release it.			"

												This game is remaster of game that released a long time ago on island far far away.  Original game was highlight comedy moment during a time when snooker halls were filled with people wearing ponytail.  Back then you needed education to play game because you read many funny lines.The remaster is not same experience of original game.  All talking replaced with real voices.  Maybe this make game easier than reading but some voice do not fit game, and some lines are funnier to read than hear.  Gaybrush also has bad hair day in this edition.Maybe game would be better with Curse of Monkey Island animators?  If game made now then main character name would by Jay Peg.I still wait for full translation in my language then I can use ultimate insult reply ""How appropriate, you fight like a camel"".			"

												No idea why this game is praised so highly other than perhaps nostalgia. Might have been awesome back in the 90s but right now it's clunky, boring, tedious and full of redundant backtracking. Go to one end of the world to pick up something that requires you to go to the other end of the world where you pick up something that sends you to the other end. Repeat 100 times over. Forced myself to sit through that for a few hours and I don't think I can take it anymore S:Edit: managed to finish it. That’s 9 hours I’m not going to get back. The game is pretty cute but it’s an absolute waste of time. The stupid backtracking never stops and what could have been a 2 hour silly and amusing game ended up being a 9 hour chore for me. Towards the end I was absolutely rushing through it as fast as I could using maximum hints and it was still super tedious. I remember playing numerous point and click games back then when I was younger and I don’t remember any of them being as annoying – maybe cause I was much younger heh.			"

												As a stand alone game, I did not enjoy it.  I bought this in the $15 bundle (on sale, of course).  It is not worth that amount of money, even in a bundle.  It is $10 alone. I bought it due to all of the glowing reviews it received.  Obviously, many of those reviews were written by people were being nostalgic.The game itself:The items/puzzles were not intuitive, it took  a long time to get from one location to anther (town to swordmaster, for example) and this trekking had to be done several times.  The dialogue was not engaging, The plot was fine and so were the updated graphics.I really tried to like this game (Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition) but I found it boring and slow.  I only finished to getting the ship and crew, I have not even made it to Monkey Island and am stopping.  It just did not have enough entertainment value for me to continue (and I did try....6 hours of trying to like it...) I also found that not everything made sense in the way it had to be put together.  It was tedious walking from the town to the island map.  I did like some of the dialogue, but it was not enough to keep me entertained.  Had I played the original game, this might mean more to me and many people gave it a thumb's up due to it bringing back fond memories (and I am MORE than old enough to have played it, maybe too old and that is the issue!)  LOLThere are other games that I find much more entertaining, such as ""The Last Door"" (though more gruesome, which is why I wanted something more lighthearted), so I cannot recommend this, though it was not a bad game.  There are just better games to spend my time on (and I have a lot I have to try out in my stack!).I decided to look at the other negative reviews and we were all similar in our reasons for not liking the game.

												Just don't bother with this mess! Controls are very clunky . Actually they are just plain infuriating. Keyboard shortcuts for dialogue choices generally trigger the wrong dialogue. If you want to play a Lucasarts point and click adventure that has been properly re-mastered then buy Day of the Tentacle. Don't waste a penny on this garbage.			"

												People seem to think this game is hilarious, and maybe at one time all a game needed to seem hilarious was to not take itself so seriously. But if i'm really being honest, it's just not worth the time.  It's a totally skippable experience.  The humor is rather cheesy and is hobbled by poor timing.  Monkey Island essentially wants you to pull its finger, and it wants you to wander around the map for 30 minutes each time you do.I can see how it appealed to a lot of nostalgic reviewers as kids, but as a newcomer I found myself rather bored.

												I would not recommend buying this game unless you already know for a fact that you enjoyed it the last time you played it before.  The story and dialoague will be simply too horrible to bear for most new comers.While I played many classic adventure games such as King's Quest, Space Quest, The Dig, Grim Fandago, I somehow had never gotten around to play the Secret of Monkey Island.Suffice it to say that I simply could not get past the first 5 minutes of the game due to the hilarity of the terrible (terrible) dialogue.  I supposse the dialoague is intended to be funny, but I didn't get it.I supposse in the end the gameplay is just dated.  The upgraded graphics are well done, but they were not enough to save the game.			"

												It's very difficult to recommend this game in 2012. 15 years ago, these Adventure games from LucasArts were great fun. Puzzles, story, and humor.But today, they are so frustrating to play. I can recognize the artificial difficulty elements for what they are -- time wasters. A way to make a short game feel longer. Having to walk back and forth across Melee Island will make you tear your hair out in boredom. In this game, at least, the puzzles do make sense and can be solved with just a little trial and error.But the control system in this new edition is poor. It's easier to switch to the classic view (F10) and select actions off the menu than it is to spin the mouse wheel and try to figure out what all the icons mean.I can't recommend Monkey Island for anyone except the most die-hard nostalgia seeker.

												Thumbs up if you like monkey island!Unless you have nostalgia for this game, it might be a little too late to enjoy this title.If you have played a point and click adventure game before, then you know what what to expect. I wrote this review from a clean slate based on the game itself with no background. So if you enjoy point and click adventures then this review wont be of any use to you.Having never played a game of this style, I went in to this very optimistic. I wanted to enjoy a great story with casual gameplay. But I basically only got the casual gameplay. This game, while loved by many as a cult classic, didnt seem to offer a story that was in depth enough to justify its incredibly slow pace. I have played a few games of a similar style which were captivating enough that they kept me interested. The secret of Monkey Island may have been good in its day. It is just really hard to get over the graphics if you are spoiled by todays engines. The story only lasted a few hours thanks to the slow pace your character travels. The jokes would be just enough to make you chuckle on occasion but nothing to LOL about. In fact, the whole plot seems like a dull joke in the end.I cant say I recommend this game because I was truly very dissapointed. Only buy this if you enjoyed the original or are a die-hard fan of point-and-click.			"

You need the keyboard and a mouse because OSK is not working (couldn't get the overlay working) and RMB gesture ain't working within the game. Really sorry...Once switched, classical mode is working as expected and can be fully controlled with my win 8.1 slate.

												Bought this as on a friend's rec and it was more than a little too linear (and this is coming from someone who mainlines LEGO games). I also found the ""puzzle"" solving to be a tad annoying, I kept coming up with alternate solutions that had me reaching for walkthroughs at every other turn. The humor was cute, but didn't serve to make up for the plodding game play.I'm sure this game has some nostalgic value for some people, but there are much better alternatives available now if you don't already have a connection with this series.

												Can't even begin to count the number of hours that I and my friends sank into this wonderful classic and its sequel, taking turns parked in front of my 386sx. we would trade off figuring out puzzles and laugh ourselfs silly at all the little jokes. The remastered version adds voice acting, music and some really beautiful artwork. This is a game for anyone who enjoys adventure games tilted a bit to the silly. I can't recommend it enough.			"

												AS fan of the good old 80s. Yep im a child of the Dos Games aswell.Honestly this is a real nice piece of art wich brings the good memories to that Secret of Monkey IslandTriology back to new life.I know the 4th and the 5th are there as well, but i found the 3 first games the most perfect.You can change the game to old mode, wich works fine.The point and click universe of Monkey island is funny as hell with a bit of black humorand the pirates flair. Some riddles are unusual and its a Adventure of Lucasarts and can hold the magic of the Mainiac mansion series and Indiana johnes series.The new look is not all round. Its fresh its new, but there is not all the best.It came in HD sounds and music are shure better as the 8bit sound, but im a nostalgic one.Wich means i prefer the old version.Nevertheless i would recommen it all the way. Some big respect to the team wich did  a wonderfull job in the SEBTW were is Indiana johnes 3 and 4 SE? "

I remember making up my own voice for Guybrush and then being dissapointed in his actual voice in Curse of Monkey Island...Anyway this special edition does include the orignial and an edition with better graphics and voice acting.. Guybrush's voice is the same guy from curse and tales of monkey island.... Well props for continuity.Monkey island always has that same silly humor, wacky characters.. ya know what I expect from a Lucas Arts point and click. My favorite is the insult sword fighting.. always makes me lol..You'll get maybe 10 hours or less of play time here.... or longer if you don't reach for a walkthrough or hints...The puzzles are the epitome of adventure game logic... get the hamster put him in the freezer go to the future get the hamster .. get the sweater put the sweater in the dryer to get a hamster sized sweater...  put the hamster in the microwave to thaw out hamster...put the sweater on the hamster.. put the hamster on the giant hamster wheel.. viola electricity! (ok that was from Day of the Tenacle but same kinda puzzles). The characters are likeable which is not something that I say often.. Guytbrush is one of my favorite point and click male leads.. along with George Stobbart, Gabriel Knight, and Tex Murphy. I think I've rambled enough.... good game :) "

												The Secret of Monkey Island is an old school LucasArts PnC adventure game.  It is a lot of fun, and very funny, but new gamers may not enjoy it as much compared to a lot of new PnC adventure games offered today.  There is a minimal risk of death (yes, it is possible, and surprisingly not an achievement).  Few puzzles and interactive items are nonsensical (rubber chicken with a pulley), but most of the puzzles are completely intuitive.  It is simply a fun, interactive adventure.			"

												Become a pirate, save the damsel in distress, fight the evil ghost pirate, become a swrod master and find treasure!When this game came out originally, it was a total blast. Great writing, really funny and a fantastic adventure with silly and clever puzzles. Today, perhaps adventure games like these are a little outdated. But this remake is well worth it, if you enjoy the series. In many ways, the first Monkey Island is the best game, and now you can enjoy it fully voice casted, with improved artistic graphics and music.And if you don't like that, you can easily swap back to the original version as well.Perhaps mostly suited to people who know and enjoy the series, but the game is good enough for people who have not tried it before and want to try a really funny and great adventure. Probably one of the better adventure games ever made, with a great style and atmosphere.			"

												The Secret of Monkey Island is without a doubt one of the best point and click adventure games ever made, and one of the rare few in which the sequel can claim to be even better. You are Guybrush Threepwood, newly arrived on Melee Island to follow your dream - to become a pirate. On the way you'll learn how to insult sword fight, fall in love with a beautiful governor and battle an evil ghost pirate while searching for hidden t-shirts, looking for 3 headed monkeys and discovering the secret that is Monkey Island. This re-mastered version is wonderful to play, now with full speech, which include the actors who did the voices for the last couple of Monkey Island games. However, the game does not support surround sound and the action commands are cumbersome at best.			"

Another thing I appreciate is that the puzzles aren't that absurd, so you basically have to spend a great deal of time trying to click everywhere and do everything to everything, which I tend to think just extends the game play time rather annoyingly. Of course the hint system helps too if you do get stuck anyway, and I did use it a few times, and still had a blast.			"

This faithful remake does a good job of keeping most elements of the game intact....except for the graphics. The new artist is unfortunately just plain inferior - the characters now do not look anywhere near as endearing as in the original. It's a shame, because the voice-overs are perfect, and the game's charms are still present. Just wish that they had someone else better to redraw the graphics.... 8/10.			"

												Absolutely charming. A classic that holds up. It isn't immune from the fridge-logic or arbitrary only-the-designer-would-actually-solve-this-without-some-tiral-and-error puzzles seen in pretty much every adventure game. But it has so much humor and cleverness to it that I was able to forgive the game's shortcommings. It also has, easily, the best sword-fighting mechanic in any game I've played.If you don't like point-and-clicks, this might not convert you because it does not fix the genre's greatest problems. Nonetheless, if you are to try only one adventure game I would recommend Monkey Island or Broken Sword--both have excellent writting and are much more logically grounded that most adventure games I've palyed (though in Monkey Island's case, that doens't mean the same thing it does in Broken Sword's as some degree of absurdity is inherent in Monkey Island's world, it's just that Monkey Island is more internally consistent with it's absurdity than it's cohorts).The special edition is also particularly fabulous. The voicework is delightful, the artwork lovely, and every detail preserved. Hot-swapping between classic and special edition modes is impresssive; the team was clearly dedicated to preserving the game while also making it more accessible to newcomers. Especially since the entirety of the original game is included within it, this is the definitive edition of Monkey Island.			"

												""The Curse of Monkey Island"" was my very first point-and-click game, and therefore the whole Monkey Island series has a very special place in my heart. When I found out that the first and second game were remastered I was thrilled. The new design is great and sticks to its origins, and it's great to finally have a dubbed version! And for the hardcore-retro gamers: you can still change to the old version by pressing a specific button (sorry, I just forgot which one, but you can easily look it up in the menue!). I would say this is a must-have for all Monkey Island fans :)			"

												Top notch point-and-click adventure game from the golden days of the genre with updated graphics, music, sound and voiceover. Absolutely worth a playthrough if you haven't ever experienced this gem. The option to hit F10 at any time to switch back and forth between the original and new versions makes it even cooler. I actually like the old pixellated visuals better, while the sounds in the new version are far superior. It's a shame there wasn't an option to pick the best from both and combine the old visuals with the new audio.The new version's UI had some mouse dead-zones and the cursor would sometimes point an inch or so above where it was showing on screen (particularly when using the inventory), but these were minor annoyances at worst. This doesn't happen with the original version.Steam overlay, screenshots, etc. all worked flawlessly. No cards or achievements.Even though this is now owned by the Satanic Nazis over at DI$NEY, I would still recommend buying the bundle with MI:1 & 2 when it goes on sale. Or maybe find some other means of getting the game. Just get it and play it!			"

												It's a must have. You're a wannabe pirate in this game who need to solve different trials to be accepted by the pirate community. The game is filled with a huge amount of humour, sometimes challenging puzzles (I have to admit, I even needed to check a walkthrough 2x). Even though it's the remastered edition with the ability to switch between the old and the new graphics and enjoyed the traditional look more.There are very interesting characters: Stan the ship dealer, Le Chuck, the Sword master, the old man from the shop... Sometimes the characters even criticise themselves when you try to figure out something by ""brute force"" with trying out every item from your inventory :D.I found quite some references and similarities in other games. It's no wonder that it has such influence for later generation games.			"

												A classic that defined a genre and had many a swashbuckler learning how to sword fight the true pirating way. Wit.This remake is a lovingly re-creation of the original, that adds fantastic artwork and lively voice acting that feels perfectly in-keeping with the originals theme. The only character I think looks worse is Guybrush. He looks quite weedy in this rendition. You can really see the difference in the last shot, where you see his face in the old version.I have to admit that I preferred the IOS version of this game though. The UI on the PC feels much more clunky, often having to open two menu's to do something (verb menu and item menu) and it feels like a step back from the original's slightly more intuitive interface.After completing Monkey Island three times, including the original back in the day, I clearly have strong nostalgia with this title. But even after three times, some of the puzzles still feel pretty random or have flaky logic. Still a classic. 7/10			"

												What a MASTERPIECE! An absolutely classic game in what is an actually top-notch remasterization. The graphics look colorful and fun and respect those of the original, together with quality voice acting (Same as Curse of Monkey Island), as well as a new soundtrack (which sounds great and totally honors the original), and well...the game is just ALL there! But wait, maybe you're not one to really like remakes...well no problem! You can just change between the original and modern version just by tapping a key, and get the original graphics, menu and even music (the CD version). Want to see how cutscenes play out in either version? No problem! Both versions sync up, so you can just change on the fly, back and forth, and the transition is smooth and seamless. The only downsides i can think of are that you have no onscreen actions menu, you just tap keys for the functions that you want, or left/right-click on any object for basic actions (like look or talkt to), to the point some puzzles are better solved in the original version. Other than that, maybe, for purists, the graphics are more cartoony, specially the characters, which stands in stark contrast to the realistic character portraits from the original version. Not a big problem, really, but purists may prefer HD remasters of those instead of mere redesigns. Still, a fantastic Special Edition, and a most recommended purchase! 9/10			"

												If you haven't played Monkey Island before then the rest of this review is moot - go play it; you will love it.For those of you who grew up playing the Monkey Island games; the biggest bonus that this game gives is the ability to play this through Steam and without having to use the Scumm box.  The new art style, while cool, lacks the charm of the original; the soundtrack on the other hand sounds incredible in its newly remastered state.This game is largely great, my only beef with it is that the cursor is not as clear as it could be, and makes scrolling between scenes difficult sometimes (most noticable in the Scumm bar itself); but as this is hardly a game that relies on reflex it doesn't really detract from the experience at all.TL:DR - if you haven't played this game before then get it; if you are a fan of the series then get this game if you'd like to play it through steam or weren't a fan of the original graphics.

												The Secret of Monkey Island is without a doubt one of the best point and click adventure games ever made, and one of the rare few in which the sequel can claim to be even better. You are Guybrush Threepwood, newly arrived on Melee Island to follow your dream - to become a pirate. On the way you'll learn how to insult sword fight, fall in love with a beautiful governor and battle an evil ghost pirate while searching for hidden t-shirts, looking for 3 headed monkeys and discovering the secret that is Monkey Island. This re-mastered version is wonderful to play, now with full speech, which include the actors who did the voices for the last couple of Monkey Island games. However, the game does not support surround sound and the action commands are cumbersome at best.			"

												The Secret of Monkey Island is an old school LucasArts PnC adventure game.  It is a lot of fun, and very funny, but new gamers may not enjoy it as much compared to a lot of new PnC adventure games offered today.  There is a minimal risk of death (yes, it is possible, and surprisingly not an achievement).  Few puzzles and interactive items are nonsensical (rubber chicken with a pulley), but most of the puzzles are completely intuitive.  It is simply a fun, interactive adventure.			"

												Be warned, this game is one of the most charming and enjoyable experiences I have had in the last ten years of my life. Playing this game eclipses all of the happy moments I have shared with loved ones, and erases the grief that tainted me witht the deaths of those closest to me. This is the funniest, most pleasurable video game I have ever, and probably will ever touch. It has one downfall, the length isn't quite what one would hope. I was left with a warmth inside I knew I would never replicate. ""I should kill myself, end it on a high."" I thought. But no... for I discovered Monkey Island 2. And thus suicide was averted.			"

												I know the art style of the remake is a bit devisive, but it's hard to argue with a playable version of a classic on a modern system. Plus you can always play it with the original pixel art if you want. For those who've played the original it's worth going through again just to hear the full voice cast.			"

At least you can switch it back to the original look at the press of a button. however, this mode looks terrible on a 1080p modern monitor. I'm looking forward more to playing Monkey Island 2, as i missed this one the first time around after swapping my Amiga for a SNES (Biggest mistake of my life!).			"

												Great writing, charming animation, awesome music and fun puzzles for the most part. I'm of the opinion that the new art style is pretty ugly and much prefer the cute pixel art and music but your eyes may have a different opinion. The updated version also has voice acting if you're illiterate.This is a fantastic game with about 5 frustrating road blocks for those of us not used to the old school adventure games that required you to figure out weird and obscure solutions like <verb> <random item in your inventory> to progress, or pixel hunting for a stick in a screen full of stuff. These things are luckily overcome in the age of the internet with hints and guides (H apparently gives you in-game hints but I never used it so I don't know).			"

												You wave your sword like a dairy farmer!I've played every single Monkey Island game - I still have the original WITH FLOPPY DISKS in a cupboard.  Most recently, I played TMI direct from Telltale, because steam was unknown to me then (and Telltale did a special Collectors Edition), but now playing this has made me so happy.  (note - It doesn't look like I've gotten very far at the time of writing this review, but I had to reset my account and start again, believe me I have completed this game more than once!)First, and most obviously, the graphics.  During the opening - where it moves from the 8-bit pixels to the much smoother design - I got goosebumps because I knew this was going to be a different experience to the original.  (It helped that they timed it to the dramatic cymbal crash of the vastly improved quality soundtrack).  And it is.  They've done a beautiful job updating the graphics, and making the interface much easier to work with (although you can go back to the original pixel menu style if you prefer - have a nostalgia trip, it's just as I remembered it), and the newly added voice acting is wonderful - my only major niggle is that they've had to leave a pause in between some of the dialogue because the original subtitles are still running to the original timing. This is a FUN game.  It's how point and click used to be done - but with the added bonus of funny dialogue and characters you can really grow to care about (slight digression, but Tales broke my heart - no spoilers, just play it).  Yes, bizarrely, doing a remastered release hasn't necessarily improved the flow of a game which still has the original [limited] timing, but it's still a thoroughly enjoyable experience - whether you choose to play the 'original' or 'remastered' version - and, joy of joys, with this you get the choice to try both!

It was nice to see it got a reboot on the graphics which made it seem rather shiny and new.Gameplay was a little bit frustrating for me. It took me a while to work it out because I was used to all options being at the bottom of the screen ala original. But once I got a handle on that, it wasn't too bad. Well worth adding to my collection. :)			"

Monkey Island will have you banging your head against a wall trying to solve all the puzzles but it is a very rewarding experience overall, and hysterical.

												The Secret of Monkey Island is a PC gaming classic of a bygone gaming genre.  Point and click adventures are largely extinct nowadays but playing this game gives you a casual gaming experience focused on solving puzzles and thinking outside the box.  Extremely well done voice-acting and a solid and comedic storyline make this short game worth at least a play through.  Certainly a game that you should play, but its lack of replayability and retro gameplay means you shouldn’t ever pay more than $5 for it.			"

												Welcome back, Guybrush Threepwood! You're the stupidest/best pirate around!Quite literally a dream come true for me, and I'm sure many others.Secret of Monkey Island, and LeChuck's Revenge, were a couple of the games that defined my childhood.Many hours as a kid were spent playing, and watching my sister play, as we tried to figure out the silly and sometimes ridiculous puzzles, to progress without the aid of guides, because the internet wasn't quite as available as it is these days.So words can't express my happiness when these remakes kinda came out of nowhere!The characters are all memorable, and the humour never gets old, and while the Special Edition remade graphics are great, sometimes you just can't beat the good old pixely memories of Lucas Arts adventures, so it's awesome that this version of the game(s) actually lets you switch between the two graphical styles at the simple press of a button!The voice acting may seem a little jarring for those very familiar with the original games, but it's well done and not as out-of-place feeling as I thought it might be. But even that can be turned off if you're more of a reader, and/or don't like the voices!Overall, a VERY worthwhile investment for those looking for some nostalgia, but not just wanting to buy the same game again. This is not just a simple cash grab, it's very clear that time and effort went into this Special Edition (and the one for LeChuck's Revenge), and it kept me smiling from start to finish, just like it always used to.

												As great as it's ever been, It's the pretty much the same Monkey Island it's always been, but with new music.I love Monkey Island. It's funny, varied, challenging, but never unforgiving. It's a point-and-click adventure of old with verbs and stuff. The puzzles are strange, clever, confusing and sometimes obscure, but always fun. The music of Monkey Island in all its various forms is wonderful which is why I wish it was for sale. The story is just so funny with some of the most ironic settings and quirky characters.			"

												Are you looking for a high-seas adventure game where you get to be a dashing pirate, engaging in awesome naval battles and intricate sword duels? Good news: Monkey Island doesn't have any of that. Instead, it has a hilarious script and some amusing puzzle/adventure game mechanics that serve primarily to add to the comedy rather than challenge the player. Monkey Island is really more like a funny interactive movie than a game, overall, and it is best experienced with friends. This may be the best version available of one of gaming's most classic titles, but remember: Never spend more than $20 on a computer game.			"

												The Secret of Monkey Island is a classic not only of the adventure game genre, but of PC gaming in general, and this remake is a worthy adaptation. The graphics and music have been updated to modern standards while still remaining true to the original, the interface is simpler and more intuitive without losing anything, there is true-to-the-series voice acting added, and the puzzles, jokes and hidden stuff are all present and accounted for - and for the purists, a button can toggle at any time between the remake version and the original Secret of Monkey Island in all its MIDI/VGA/SCUMM engine glory.As for the game itself, it combines Lucasarts-of-old's brilliantly off-beat sense of humor and puzzles like none other into a masterpiece of the genre. If you think you don't like adventure games, this is the one that will change your mind.			"

												Remastered version is quite decent but new design of Guybrush and Melanie is wrong. Especially in the final scene, where original look was more realistic and ""breath taking"". In remastered version ending is almost completly spoiled. IMO music in classic version is better, it sound deeper. Newer one is better in quality but not as good as original sound.I really like voice acting with cast known from the newer MI games.However, remastered version is different from the classic. Because classic version gives you more serious feel with ""almost"" photorealistic faces. If you`re new to MI, you should play both versions. First try older one.			"

												This game is a classic. Probably the number 1 reason why I work in the videogames industry. If you are a complete stranger to point&click games, buy it ASAP. It's a must have, and probably the first step you should take in this genre (along with pretty much any point&click from the Lucas Arts golden era). The Special Edition doesn't bring anything new but graphics and voices, yet it's still worth every penny because it's an insane amount of funny quotes and silly situations to solve. The OST is pure gold, and even better in the Special Edition.I honestly don't know what to say against this game, except maybe it's a bit short for nowadays standards (keep in mind I've finished this game at least a dozen times already, I'm still not bored of it but I kind of know every puzzle by heart now). I guess some people could complain about the new graphics but if they do, they can switch to the original style anyway... I'll end my review with this quote, taken directly from the game itself:""Never pay more than 20 bucks for a videogame.""...Oh, and look behind you! A three-headed monkey!			"

Oh, and the general overhaul of the game(without changing any of the gameplay) is a nice and welcome adaptation for the 2010s. You still get the option to play retro style, if you want to, with all the magic of 8-bit music and state-of-the-art 1990 graphics. So it's all extra, no downsides.

												If you haven't played Monkey Island before then the rest of this review is moot - go play it; you will love it.For those of you who grew up playing the Monkey Island games; the biggest bonus that this game gives is the ability to play this through Steam and without having to use the Scumm box.  The new art style, while cool, lacks the charm of the original; the soundtrack on the other hand sounds incredible in its newly remastered state.This game is largely great, my only beef with it is that the cursor is not as clear as it could be, and makes scrolling between scenes difficult sometimes (most noticable in the Scumm bar itself); but as this is hardly a game that relies on reflex it doesn't really detract from the experience at all.TL:DR - if you haven't played this game before then get it; if you are a fan of the series then get this game if you'd like to play it through steam or weren't a fan of the original graphics.

												Greatest game ever. EVER. I'm not even kidding. The original gets a perfect 10 from me. The Special Edition gets a 9 out of 10, but that's okay because in stark contrast to the usual Lucas philosophy of ""improve then discard"" the original is actually included in the game. You'd be a fool not to buy it.Really. An actual fool.			"

												The Secret of Monkey Island is without a doubt one of the best point and click adventure games ever made, and one of the rare few in which the sequel can claim to be even better. You are Guybrush Threepwood, newly arrived on Melee Island to follow your dream - to become a pirate. On the way you'll learn how to insult sword fight, fall in love with a beautiful governor and battle an evil ghost pirate while searching for hidden t-shirts, looking for 3 headed monkeys and discovering the secret that is Monkey Island. This re-mastered version is wonderful to play, now with full speech, which include the actors who did the voices for the last couple of Monkey Island games. However, the game does not support surround sound and the action commands are cumbersome at best.			"

												Remastered version is quite decent but new design of Guybrush and Melanie is wrong. Especially in the final scene, where original look was more realistic and ""breath taking"". In remastered version ending is almost completly spoiled. IMO music in classic version is better, it sound deeper. Newer one is better in quality but not as good as original sound.I really like voice acting with cast known from the newer MI games.However, remastered version is different from the classic. Because classic version gives you more serious feel with ""almost"" photorealistic faces. If you`re new to MI, you should play both versions. First try older one.			"

												Though there are a few jokes that have become dated, overwhelmingly the humor and wit holds true.  Because I've purchased this game despite already owning a still-working copy from way-back-when, I'm making myself play the ""Special"" part of the Special Edition.  The graphics are fun and stylized enough to keep in the spirit of the quirkiness, but something about the airbrush quality doesn't sit well with me.  That and some of the voiceover work seems to displace a bit of the charm of this game.  Reading the text, you put your own emphasis and voice on the dialogue, making it fit your idea of the game's voice--something that gets extinguished when a voice is actually provided (and it doesn't match your own).  In a way, it's like reading a book and then watching the movie.What's a guy to do?  Ditch the movie and reread the book!Press F10.  Wannabe pirate life becomes wonderful again.In short, just as good as I remembered and now I can play it on my Windows 7 laptop, not my decades old desktop.			"

												The Secret of Monkey Island is a classic not only of the adventure game genre, but of PC gaming in general, and this remake is a worthy adaptation. The graphics and music have been updated to modern standards while still remaining true to the original, the interface is simpler and more intuitive without losing anything, there is true-to-the-series voice acting added, and the puzzles, jokes and hidden stuff are all present and accounted for - and for the purists, a button can toggle at any time between the remake version and the original Secret of Monkey Island in all its MIDI/VGA/SCUMM engine glory.As for the game itself, it combines Lucasarts-of-old's brilliantly off-beat sense of humor and puzzles like none other into a masterpiece of the genre. If you think you don't like adventure games, this is the one that will change your mind.			"

												The new graphics are quite bad. It doesn't bother me so much if I switch back to the classic graphics with F10, and then switch to the new graphics again, as the old graphics had a cool feel to it. However, it might just be me, but I don't know how to pick stuff up for example with the new graphics. 'Spoiler'. An example, a rubber chicken is on a table, and with the new graphics I can't figure out how to pick it up. I might have messed some instructions on how pick up objects, etc, with the new graphics, but the old graphics were a ton easier, as there are constant dialogue boxes to choose from depending on the action. A bug seems to be that it's crash prone, especially in the old graphics version.It's said to be a good game by a lot of people, so I'll give it a go, but I'm not overly impressed at the moment. "

												What a MASTERPIECE! An absolutely classic game in what is an actually top-notch remasterization. The graphics look colorful and fun and respect those of the original, together with quality voice acting (Same as Curse of Monkey Island), as well as a new soundtrack (which sounds great and totally honors the original), and well...the game is just ALL there! But wait, maybe you're not one to really like remakes...well no problem! You can just change between the original and modern version just by tapping a key, and get the original graphics, menu and even music (the CD version). Want to see how cutscenes play out in either version? No problem! Both versions sync up, so you can just change on the fly, back and forth, and the transition is smooth and seamless. The only downsides i can think of are that you have no onscreen actions menu, you just tap keys for the functions that you want, or left/right-click on any object for basic actions (like look or talkt to), to the point some puzzles are better solved in the original version. Other than that, maybe, for purists, the graphics are more cartoony, specially the characters, which stands in stark contrast to the realistic character portraits from the original version. Not a big problem, really, but purists may prefer HD remasters of those instead of mere redesigns. Still, a fantastic Special Edition, and a most recommended purchase! 9/10			"

												I've been playing adventure games for years, and love the genre. LucasArts helped define adventure gaming with the original Secret of Monkry Island, and it's stood the test of time since the remake has made it possible to keep on newer machines. That being said, I did not play this before the remake and I think the lack of nostaglia has made this game somehow less exciting for me than I had hoped for after years of hearing about it. The gameplay mechanics are tiresome, the story is pretty one-dimensional, and it's never going to crack my top 10 point-and-clicks of all time... but it's certainly worth having in your library if you see it on sale as a fun retroscpective on the genre.TL;DR worth it on sale as a throwback, but don't let the hype you may have heard set your bar so high that it can't reach it.

												This game is a classic point and click adventure game designed around exploring instead dying (its almost impossible). The puzzles aren't so hard that they will take forever, but can be challenging. The updated art style just fits the game so well. As another plus, you can also switch back to the orginal 90's style at any time. I will admit that the UI on the updated style is a little picky. My advice is to use the arrow keys and enter instead of the mouse during dialogue selection. The game also has such an interesting sense of humor. It kinda realizes the stupidity of whatever the joke is about and has Guybrush (player) speak as such. You end up snickering or laughing at how stupid whatever you just heard or witnessed was. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a few hours of puzzle solving and absolutely moronic and sarcastic dialogue.			"

												The most awesome game ever made is even better with this evoilved version. This is how old games should be done.It has the easy option of playing in the original v ersion (for romantics) and the newer version with voice over and enhanced graphics (for newbies). There is not much difference beteen the two modes and in fact you can switch between them at any time... very awesome.Highly recommended for anyone wanting to experience some old time gaming without the annoyance of old time gaming.

												I'd say this is the best point & click adventure of all-time, tied with it's sequel. Very charming game with great updated visuals and even the original graphics are still an interesting look. The story is great with characters you will remember, challenging puzzles and a great soundtrack. The length of the game is adequate with a lot of dialogue options that will make each playthrough just as enjoyable as the last, even without any real decision making changes. A true classic.			"

												Once upon a time, while i was young and innocent i played this evergreen on my dads Amiga. I was amazed by all those pixels and level of detail. As a 3 year old you gave a F♪♫♪K on open world, VR, G0ddamn frckn 4k Crysis on a 10k watercooled SLI-Titan Porno-PC... This game is one of those masterpieces of its time leading the way for modern PC gaming evolution, storytelling ppp. . Of course i got my hands dirty on games like Doom Wolfenstein and all those nasty bloody PreSequel Zombie DLC stuff you get today. But if you´re tired of all those big boobed make up B!tch games that only get you horny as long as you´re a braindead laboratory rat, then get this old Lady and treat her well and she´ll treat you better. Just grab yourself some high-end gear (e.g. Raspberry Pi) to enjoy her the way god made her with all this AntiAliasing and 64bit Midi Hans Zimmer backingtrack or even remastered and she´ll put on her little black just for you (Gtx 980Ti required).Finally i asume every REAL-Gamer heard of this Masterpiece by Lucasarts once in his lifetime, so unleash your inner Indiana Jones, take out your whip and get this game... well that sounded naughty.

You can always switch back to the origianl graphics if you wish. This is one of the first games I bought on steam along with Indian Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, and Loom. These are my favorite point and click adventures from Lucas Arts. My original Win 95 CDs won't work with Win 7 or XP but steam plays them just fine. If you liked these games when you were younger you should get this game and replay all its glory.			"

												This remake was done with great care and love; the high production quality is solely why this is a recommendation. However, the archaic gameplay of trying to guess what the developer wants you to do makes this game an awful exercise in guesswork. It's a history piece and is by no means a fun game.I could stomach act 1 and 2, but by the drawn out 3rd act, I could not stomach any more of the convoluted puzzles and resorted to a walkthrough. Even when you know what you're supposed to do, the game takes far too long to get to substantial story bits.This is a huge flaw in early LucasArts games. Although artistically and thematically brilliant, stick with playing latter games like Grim Fandango, where the puzzles at least make sense and are significantly less frustrating to guess.			"

												Monkey Island is without a doubt an incredible game I throughly enjoyed every minute of it. The charecters are typically well written, well as well written as you can get there are a few cringe worthy moments but very few.  The puzzles were simple in hindsight but hard to deduce one puzzle in the first chapter comes to mind for this fact. The story hits all the marks funny interesting and hard to put down once you make progress. And as far as saving goes no you won't have to keep a million save files on this game with the exception of a single fail nothing will stop you from continuing totally. So my rating for this game is 8/10			"

												I'm about 50-60% done with a single playthrough of this game and I must say... How could I have missed this gem when growing up???!Not only is this game so funny, the story and the art style is bright and colorful! I showed my wife the game and she instantly fell in love... which is relatively uncommon for me as most of the games I've showed her so far were ""too dark"" and ""bloody"" (hehe). Anyways, once I'm done with this game, I wouldn't mind replaying it, despite the fact there isn't much new to come back to really after you are done. Why is that the case? It's HILARIOUS! Our MC and many characters in-game break the 4th wall more than once and just the things you have to do to progress the game is so creative, but also downright insane. Any crack-addict-high-as-the-sky individuals, very much like myself will just fall in love with the game and the series :). As long as you aren't such a party pooper and is Dr. Serious, you will find your money's worth in the game.If you are really cheap, get this on sale, it's perfect!			"

												I always loved this game and getting to play it again without the fuss of DOSBox was great. I can't say that I'm a fan of the new animation, but some of the background scenery is pleasing and the voice acting is great. The new interface makes sense, but, again, I prefer the classic approach.That brings me to my favorite feature of this version: The ability to switch between the new and old versions in real-time. I spent most of my time playing in the classic mode, but did enjoy switching over to the new to hear some of my most fondly remembered scenes brought to life with the voice acting.So, if you enjoyed the original, you'll definitely want to pick this up. If you've never played or heard of the game, it's a humorous and well-written game with an enjoyable storyline. I'd highly recommend it in either case.			"

												The Secret of Monkey Island is a classic point and click adventure game. Original was released in 1990 and this special edition is the old game with new looks (nice) and new interface (clunky). As a bonus the classic mode is available which is basically the '90s original.Monkey Island is a well known classic, it was a great game more than 2 decades ago and it is a good game now. As with all oldskool adventure games you have to be prepared for some pixel hunting and illogical puzzles, fortunately not that often and also walkthroughs.VISUALSThe new look is quite nice and cartoony and also the classic mode, while not as nice, looks pretty charming. The characters look very differently, so you will want to check both SE and classic mode on close ups, just to compare.AUDIOThe lively pirate'y background music is ok, but can get repetitive. The sound effects can drive a person insane though, especially the crying cook was painful to the ears. The voice acting is very nice and fitting. The classic mode is devoid of voice acting and sound effects, and is mostly silent.GAMEPLAYThis is you basic classic point and click oldskool adventure stuff. With the good and bad. Some puzzles can be... tricky. Need a key for closed door? Sure, just look in cereals. Fortunately most things are quite logical and can be solved. Sooner or later. I have to admit I did check a walkthrough once in a while, but I'm just not good with classic adventures. I have to say that for the 6 hours it took me to finish it I had fun. If you like adventure games you should get it, it's good AND it's a classic.The Secret of Monkey Island SE Random Game Footage:

												Ever heard of a little movie called Pirates of the carabian.  Beleave it or not , pirates owes almost all its sucess to Monkey Island.  The original version of the script was actually a script for a movie based on teh first game The Secret of Monkey Island.Let me paint a picture for you.Guybrush Threepwood,  A tall lanky man in a white shirt and brown pants with light brown hair and a ponytail, the un experianced hero of our story who has to save the governor from the evil ghost pirate Lechuck.  sound farmiliar, it's none other than Will Turners direct inspiration.Elane Marley, The Female Governor of Melee island, early on she is captured by the undead pirate Lechuck.  Sound Farmiliar THAT's RIGHT, its Elizebeth Swan's inspiration, Elizibeth being the governors daughter instead of the governor and ofcourse also being captured by an undead pirate, this time named Barbosa.This leads us to Captain Lechuck, an evil ghost Pirate (who would later become a zombie and demon as he was killed off and ressurected)  who leads a crew of skeleton pirates and docks his ghost ship underneath a secret island called Monkey Island.Monkey Island itself was ripped off by the movie in their secret island that held cortezes gold.The onyl anomaly is Captain Jack Sparrow, who was clearly added to the story as it evolved from Monkey Island into Pirates of the Carabian.To fans of the game series this was very dissapointing and there are many many other heavy inspirations bordering on complete rip offs in pirates taken directly from monkey island.  The vodoo lady as teh vodoo lady, captain norrington as inspector from MI:1, the two goofy ghost pirates as BOB, theres even a reference to Murray(MI) in the form of a disembodiesd talking skull. amoung others.  I really wish they had kept it as a monkey island movie, even if they still wanted to brand it as their pirates of the carabian but kept the monkey island story intact.  But one can easily understand why they chose not to brand it after an old series of Lucas arts games from teh 90s, copywright not withstanding.However it woudl have been nice of disney to atleast TRY to change the story a bit and TRY to hide the fact that they directly ripped off Monkey Island,  atleast give credit where it is due.  Ofcourse the movie could also be seen as an homage to the game series, but never mentioning it in the credits somwhere proves they were attempting to hide that fact.If you like pirates the movie or pirates in general than you owe it to yourself to check out the best pirate themed game series ever created, and the story that was so good it was borderline infringed upon by disney for their mega blockbuster.

Our MC and many characters in-game break the 4th wall more than once and just the things you have to do to progress the game is so creative, but also downright insane. Any crack-addict-high-as-the-sky individuals, very much like myself will just fall in love with the game and the series :). As long as you aren't such a party pooper and is Dr. Serious, you will find your money's worth in the game.If you are really cheap, get this on sale, it's perfect!			"

												It's a shame there's no way to play with the original graphics but with the enhanced audio. The updated graphics are a travesty compared to the charming, beautiful original pixel art. Guybrush looks hydrocephalitic at best. Still, I must recommend any way to be able to legally play this classic, the first game I bought for my own money back in the day and still charming as few games can hope to be.			"

												Come on, it's a classic. It's one of the most famous staples of the peak of the adventure game genre, and one of the reasons why Tim Schaefer is considered a deity in the games industry. Of course it's good, and of course you should play it.That said, this particular update has its flaws. Most of the new art is great, but there are a couple of instances where it isn't, and it sticks out. Most prominent of these is how stupid Guybrush's head looks. The UI is kind of a step backwards. The simplified point and click works fine in newer games that really only have 2-3 verbs, but since they preserved all 9 verbs from the original game (a good decision, IMO, for faithfulness alone), scrolling through them with the mouse wheel or using keyboard shortcuts isn't as nice as having them all on screen in the original game. But you can switch between the new mode and the completely untouched original version (technically it's the CD version as opposed to the Floppy Disc version, but if you care about that distinction, you probably already own this version), so honestly, what's there to complain about?It's fun, it's funny, just play it already.

												This is a true classic of the adventure Point and Click days. Swashbuckling pirates and all. It has humour, it has jokes, it has even other LucasArts games advertisements.You should check this one out. The updated graphics make it even more entertaining, and the idea to keep the original graphics is great. Maybe other games could do the same.			"

												This was my first introduction (as you would expect) to Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate. I loved it so much that I got the sequel and then Tales of Monkey Island after that. It's not your typical point and click adventure game; it's a lot funnier, for one thing, but it also requires a bit more out-of-the-box thinking than any other game I've ever played in the genre. While that can be frustrating at times, it is also VERY refreshing.Prepare your eyes for the visual atrocity that is Stan's jacket, though. And I mean that in absolutely the best way possible.			"

If you even remotely like adventure games (and somehow haven't played Monkey Island yet), play this now!			"

												Having played the original version when it was still quite fresh, I was expecting this playthrough to feel a bit disappointing (you know, memories grow sweeter with time), but I was actually quite surprised how well it worked. Can't go wrong with Monkey Island, it seems. Only a couple of times in the game the pacing felt like it could have been a bit speedier (the jungle part, for example), overall it was still nice to play. What also surprised me is that even though I'm using a big television as a screen, the original version graphics still looked actually pretty good. The new graphics were of course beautiful as well.Voice acting was fine, too. I think I prefer the old music, but maybe that's because I've been listening to the songs all my life and thus got quite used to them. The new music was definitely good too, and audio overall much better.I'm not a native English speaker, and this was one of those games I learned English from as a kid over twenty years ago. So, just for fun, I tried playing this in Spanish, a language I can read just a bit, but that's pretty much it. Having just finished the game, I guess you can learn a word or two even as an adult playing the game in a new language. There are a total of five languages available, though the audio is always in English. Still definitely a fun thing to try if you're studying a new language!Even with its little flaws (the pacing and controlling is tedious at times, some puzzles are a bit lazy, if you will), definitely recommended. My only gripe: why only Windows version?			"

												Remastered version is quite decent but new design of Guybrush and Melanie is wrong. Especially in the final scene, where original look was more realistic and ""breath taking"". In remastered version ending is almost completly spoiled. IMO music in classic version is better, it sound deeper. Newer one is better in quality but not as good as original sound.I really like voice acting with cast known from the newer MI games.However, remastered version is different from the classic. Because classic version gives you more serious feel with ""almost"" photorealistic faces. If you`re new to MI, you should play both versions. First try older one.			"

This version not only contains the original version of Monkey Island, but also the updated version is really neatly done. It's wonderful hearing each character's personality emerging through the voice acting. Buckets of comedy value is included here and hey, in what other game will you find something as useful as a Chicken-with-a-pulley-in-the-middle? I'll tell you, Monkey Island is the only game you'll find such a treasured item. All in all, a fantastic adventure all-round "

												The original The Secret of Monkey Island remains one of my favorite games of all time. No game makes me laugh out loud as much as this one. This faithful remake does a good job of keeping most elements of the game intact....except for the graphics. The new artist is unfortunately just plain inferior - the characters now do not look anywhere near as endearing as in the original. It's a shame, because the voice-overs are perfect, and the game's charms are still present. Just wish that they had someone else better to redraw the graphics.... 8/10.			"

												Do you remember the famous Monkey Island games of old?  This is a (story-wise) shot-for-shot remake of the original, with far updated graphics and the inclusion of voice actors. It features the same great characters, witty dialogue and wonderful humor, and it packages them into a modern product. If you played the original, this will be a great trip down memory lane for you, and you'll be surprised at how much you remember. If you didn't play the original, you'll still love this game. You'll have a memorable and fun experience, and it'll come at an affordable price.Highly recommended!			"

												If you are a fan of adventure games (talk, open, pull, examine, etc), you will love this remake. With the push of a button, you can switch between ""retro"" mode (which is the original version of the game) and ""remake"" mode, with updated graphics and voice acting. One of the most original and best adventure games out there.			"

												This is an adventure gaming classic, and it is still one of my favorite games of any genre. Some of my first gaming memories as a child are with this game and struggling with the puzzles, and then feeling like a genius when I finally solved them. The characters are quirky and memorable, the puzzles are tricky enough to be challenging but still fun, and the humor is outstanding. Plus with the updated graphics, score, and voice acting, it's even more enjoyable than it was when first released. Definitely pick up and play this game if you have never experienced Monkey Island. And if your last experience with it was back in 1990, it's time for a replay.			"

												This is a very good special edition of a good old game. The artwork is completely redrawn, not just rendered in HD. And because of the age of the original game, it's a huge improvement. I especially like the ability to switch versions on the fly, so you can compare the new artwork with the old. The addition of voice acting is also a major benefit, although sometimes it feels like the actors didn't really get the humor of what they were saying.The controls are also streamlined from the original grid of actions, which makes the gameplay smoother.

												One of the most fun and challenging games of my childhood. Was beautifully remastered, and the option of going back and forth between original and new graphics is good for nostaglia. The voice acting is hilarious! The puzzles are not too bad, only needed to google a walk through twice. Whilst like all puzzle games there are issues around re-playability this is a great trip down memory lane.			"

												Sure, The Secret of Monkey Island is a 20+ year old game, but nonetheless, it is a point-&-click adventure classic with a fresh coat of paint that makes you itch to switch between the ""old"" style and the new just to see how far video games have progressed throughout the years.A classic game that never gets old.

												Once upon a time, while i was young and innocent i played this evergreen on my dads Amiga. I was amazed by all those pixels and level of detail. As a 3 year old you gave a F♪♫♪K on open world, VR, G0ddamn frckn 4k Crysis on a 10k watercooled SLI-Titan Porno-PC... This game is one of those masterpieces of its time leading the way for modern PC gaming evolution, storytelling ppp. . Of course i got my hands dirty on games like Doom Wolfenstein and all those nasty bloody PreSequel Zombie DLC stuff you get today. But if you´re tired of all those big boobed make up B!tch games that only get you horny as long as you´re a braindead laboratory rat, then get this old Lady and treat her well and she´ll treat you better. Just grab yourself some high-end gear (e.g. Raspberry Pi) to enjoy her the way god made her with all this AntiAliasing and 64bit Midi Hans Zimmer backingtrack or even remastered and she´ll put on her little black just for you (Gtx 980Ti required).Finally i asume every REAL-Gamer heard of this Masterpiece by Lucasarts once in his lifetime, so unleash your inner Indiana Jones, take out your whip and get this game... well that sounded naughty.

So grab your sword and get yourself a boat as it's to to find The Secret of Monkey Island. If you enjoyed this i recomend playing Grim Fandango.			"

												Classic Point and Click game with fun dialogues and a surprisingly interesting insults memory combat system.Im already liking it better than Grim Fandango just because its not that cryptic which is something bad with most of the old point and click adventures games. The puzzles are logical for the most of them if you have general knowledge. There is a how to play and a hint system, it sounds cheap, but it helps the game so much comparing to go over the internet to find what to do. It keeps the player in the game and beat Grim just by this fact; First use of the hint give you a lil help and the second use give you the full answer (maybe too much).I still looking for a point and click with many logical possibilities to advance instead of one which may help the flow. there is still some stuff you can miss by the order you do the things to advance which is not a bad thing cause it add replay value. The big positive is that the game is funny as hell and must play for point and click players.And Root Beer is da best			"

												The Secret of Monkey Island is probably the best adventure ever made. Even after 20 years the game is still as fun as it saw daylight. The Special Edition captured the the good atmosphere of the classic game. The art, music and sounds have been upgraded. But for the ultimate purist like me, you can switch to the original version by pressing one button. Well worth the money.			"

												Awarded ""Game of the Year 2009"" on my blog, Choicest Games. This game is a must-have for any Monkey Island fan or Adventure Gaming fan of the 90s. The remake comes with new high-quality sound effects, voice and music while retaining the same humour and charm of the original, all at a very cheap price. Oh, and if you prefer the pixellated original, you can play that too!			"

												I played this adventure game first when it was released back in the good old days of PC gaming. I played it again 25 years later and it still is one of the funniest adventures ever made all time. This game absolutely qualifies for the ""Test of Time"" award because its a milestone in gaming history			"

												While the Remastered version's visuals are nothing to write home about, it still retains all the charm and all the humor the original had the first time I played it so many years ago. A true classic that everyone should play.			"

												This game is so old, I don't even remember if I've ever played the original. Without the effects of nostalgia, the remastered version still manages to capture the attention of a modern audience. Overall, this is a recommended classic game that's worth your time to give it a shot. For the amount of content and fun, the price feels reasonable. Definitely don't miss getting it during a sale (especially as a bundle).Details:I decided to play this with the modern graphics throughout, which look great. You can toggle back to classic version graphics anytime if you prefer. The only thing I disliked was that hot spots on the map (in bird's eye view) can be difficult to locate unless you try hovering your cursor over a small, specific set of pixels. The story is fresh and full of humour, although dialogue can be draggy. I was able to skip whole cutscenes by hitting backspace. However, I couldn't find any way of fast-forwarding conversations on a sentence by sentence basis even though I read the dialogue text before the voice-over was done. That really killed any incentive for me to replay the game. The voice-overs were fantastic by the way. They gave the characters personality and made the whole experience more enjoyable. Also love all the music, which changes depending on the scene.Many puzzles require examining every item in your inventory carefully, or trying different combinations of actions. Some puzzles have completely out-of-the-box solutions which players may have trouble figuring out on your own. Fortunately, there is a hint system that gives you clues on how to solve puzzles and eventually specific instructions. I have no idea how players in the past completed the game without a guidebook, short of applying trial and error for hours. The hint system is the best feature and a solid selling point of the remastered version.			"

												The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition comes in two flavors: Original and Special Edition which you can switch. Many lines are funny. For example, Bob (LeChuck's assistant) spoken some funny lines about Thank You For.... but won't spoil.  I do wish that it has achievements.			"

												It's still the best, funniest, point and click adventure game of all time. Sure they ruined Guybrush's hair style and the remastered graphics would benefit from the inventory and verbs being at the bottom like the original, but it's almost perfect so who cares. Play it! Give clown stylish confetti.			"

												Leafy's simple review - #28The game harks back to traditional point and click adventure games and is a must for collectors. But if you're absolutely new, go for the real, old-school 90's point and click versions. While this edition provides both modern and old takes, it excels as a package for adventure enthusiasts and is great for a giggle or two. Guybrush has never been more an important wannabe-pirate as now!			"

												Superb game. I haven't played the original but this remake is perfect in that I think it was pretty respectful of the source material.The humor and writing for the game is on point. The dialog had me laughing out loud a lot of the times and the voice actors did their job perfectly.Still in the middle of the game (I think) but newcomers won't be scared off with this remake!

												I hadn't played since CD ROM was a new thing back on our families first Windows 95 machine. After over 20 years I was excited with how many stupid details I remembered. I never finished it as a kid, so it was fun to see the whole storyline and I loved that you can revert back to the origional graphics at any point in the gameplay. Very well done! Not as much of a mazy as other games of this type, and the hints certainly get you going in the right direction if you get lost.			"

												A true classic adventure game, with hilarious, smart and witted comedy like the folks over at Lucas Arts are renowned for.This game is so funny I found myself laughing *hard* at times.

												Hmm ... first review I wrote didn't save and was kicked out of steam...  to sum up it is a good game with a massive problem in the middle that has (up until now) kept me from finishing the game.  An error when saving and exiting after getting both the map and compass causes the loss of said items and preventing  completion.   I don't know if this has been corrected or not just realize it may be a couple of hours of grind before you reach Monkey Island.1/14-  Game is finished after a few days and a number of hours realizing that I was going about certain things entirely wrong with the inventory system and its uses.  Very very good writing for this game that would make me give it  a 9 to 10 but there are a few problems.  The inventory system is still pretty bad and using items doesnt always get those items used as they should... and can sometimes result in Guybrush saying the same thing over and over again until the proper item is used in the proper way.  There are a few puzzles in the game that are mind boggling ( the ship stew had to be watched on youtube) while others are funny (though you may need a couple play throughs to get all of the dialogue options) .Overall I was suprised at how well it holds up otherwise.  There is no reason an adventure game lover should be without this game ,as it is the classic that started everything, that I can think of (and if your still unsure wait until the summer or winter sales when you can purchase this game for a steal).  I would recommend the Youtube walkthrough to adventure game newbies.8 1/2 out of 10  (minor control problems)			"
