												99 Spirits is a refreshing JRPG puzzle game that has appealing japanese lore. I like that the game requires a bit of literacy in order to complete. It's a nice change of pace because a lot of other games in this genre do not require you to think much.I also thoroughly enjoyed the battle system. It's nice to pick from the large number of spirits and assemble a synergized team to steamroll through bosses.Overall, the game was a solid 20-30 hour experience. I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a unique JRPG puzzle game to play.			"

												A very original game with a few gameplay and functional flaws that may frustrate some.I liked:-the combat and gem system is very original-the art style is great, and the story and characters are very interestingNot too fond:-the battle music variety.  There is only one combat track which loops.  I ended up muting it.-New game+.  It is merely a restart with no changes to enemies or difficulty, with your level and money carried over.  At least it makes New game+ much faster to complete for the alternate endings.Frustrating and irritating:-New game+.  It resets your mastered spirit skills.  The game already restricts your acquition of skills by limiting the number spirits you can hold in the duration of the game and the availability of spirits by location.-Kirikiri game engine bugs.  Kirikiri is an extremely buggy engine that can make saving an irritant.  Also it can crash the GUI and freeze the combat.  Rotate your saves, and save often.Bug workarounds:Save menu bug- When bringing up the save menu, the menu is blank and I can't access the first page or it brings up the Spirit book.Fix- Click on page one of the save menu which brings you to the Spirit book.  Exit out of the Spirit book and open the save menu again.  It should display properly.Combat freeze- In combat, sometimes I cast an action and the game does not respond.Fix- Hope you have a recent save.  You have to restart the game client.All in all, a very intriguing game, if you are forgiving of poor New game+ balance and the various bugs of the Kirikiri engine.SAVE DAMMIT!			"

												""A JRPG, you say?""Well, yeah, sure, but not in the traditional sense of the term. This is a strange one indeed, but (mostly) in a good way. This game has a very strong japanese mythology theme. You play a swordswoman, whose main goal is to fight Tsukumogami, strange creatures which take shapes of common everyday items, such as a jacket, a broom and so on. When you get to fight a Tsukumogami, instead of one of the traditional RPG battle systems, you need to zap the enemy with your special Gokon Sword in order to get clues about its identity and expose it. Once you exposed its identity (i.e. what item it really is), you need to hack it a few more times to finish it.The thing is - all the clues are literal, in english and based on the japanese lore. For example, if you're fighting a broom Tsukumogami, the clues you get could be either letters from the item's name in uppercase (B or OO, for example), or details about the item itself, what it's being used for, what it's made of and so on (""wood"", ""cleaning"" for example). Once you think you know the name, you ""call it out"" either by typing it on a virtual in-game keyboard, or by choosing it from a list you can get (and later upgrade for a price) as a part of the story. If you're wrong, the enemy gets a bonus attack and you lose HP. If you got it right, the shroud is lifted and you get to see the enemy for what it really is. A few more hacks and slashes, and it's usually gone.I've only been playing the game for 3-4 hours so far, so there might be more complicated stuff I haven't reached yet, but this is what it looks like, so far, and while it gets a little repetitive, it is fun.

												99 Spirits is an ambitious title that eventually falls flat due to its cumbersome battle system. The storyline is great, and the characters are memorable. But when you are forced to execute the same battle commands again and again with very little variation, when you are forced to ""discover"" the same, old Tsukumagami again and again in battles you shouldn't skip as they help you level up -- the game becomes a chore. It's too bad, really, because there was a great game in the pipes somewhere, but along the way, it went awry. There is no reason why previously-discovered Tsukumagami couldn't have been revealed permanently, so that you are not forced to whittle away at its discovery every battle, ""guessing"" what is promptly known through repetition, and slogging through monotony.

												First thing, if you plan on playing this save often. My game crashed so many times, jeez.With that out of the way, this game is very different. Different from what I've played before and different from what I was expecting. Maybe it's my fault for just taking a glance at it, but I was expecting some kind of typing game. Instead each enemy is a mystery when first encountered, and you actually have to guess what it is (by guessing the word).At first I thought it was boring, but the game opened up at chapter 3. After that it kept me entertained enough I suppose.Plenty of reading, light rpg elements. Lots of RNG. Music was good. For how different it is, I believe this game is worth a try.			"

												99 Spirits is an overwhelmingly anime game. It even includes the untranslated Japanese version! The game is divided into visual novel, and turn based strategy segments.While I am not an anime or visual novel fan, the gameplay half of 99 Spirits is what had me intrigued. Basically the player moves their character around on a chessboard sort of thing, trying to reach objectives, stores that sell items to improve stats, or dialog scenes. This phase of the game is turn based, and enemies will move as the player moves, making it possible to sometimes avoid combat through careful navigation.Once a battle is initiated, the player uses a turn based system to attack and defend against the enemy. When enough damage is done, the player receives a hint to the enemy's name. This will be something like ‘Sh’ or ‘Digging’, to hint that it is a possessed shovel. When the player guesses the proper name, it can be defeated. This made 99 Spirits a lot more intellectual in its gameplay than most visual novels can offer.I did not finish 99 Spirits, but I have been told it is worth completing for the story.			"

												99 Spirits takes place in medieval Japan in a city attacked by evil spirits. After her mother is killed in the attack, young Hanabusa becomes a warrior and dedicates her life to destroying the Tsukumogami. Fruitbat Factory has obviously taken great care with their work and the localisation is excellent. The English dialogue flows well and without error. Unfortunately, the original script provides little we haven't seen before, and the story holds only minor interest or intrigue.Unlike the story, the gameplay mechanics are fresh and new in their design and execution. The game follows a linear story in which you move Hanabusa from place to place and fight Tsukumogami as you go. The overworld maps function on a grid, and you click to move Hanabusa around to pick up items, fight spirits and move to the next map.They may not be exceptional, but the graphics are solid and aesthetically pleasing. Portraits during dialogue exude charm and aid in developing the characters' personality. The hand-drawn style matches the feel and setting of the game well and evokes a stylistic, historical drawing. The Tsukumogami spirits look distinctively evil, and the warping of everyday objects into these frightening spirits is executed with style.Like the art, the sound suits the game perfectly. The mystical, eastern-sounding tunes draw you into the game and succeed in setting the scene. The fast moving, high-pitched score used in battle adds to the tension and pressure of fighting each spirit and working to figure out their name. There is limited voice acting in the game, but all of it is well done. If you're looking for something new in your RPGs, then give 99 Spirits a shot. The puzzle-style battles are fun and interesting and allow you to forgive the less interesting aspects of the game. The localisation is excellent, even if the story isn't quite so interesting, and the sound and graphics are solid and pleasing. If you like RPGs and word puzzles, then you'll definitely enjoy 99 Spirits.			"

												A fun little JRPG with some distinctive mechanics.  Word guessing is one of them, as is a timed-hits-like feature.  Occasionally, some enemies or obstacles may even be integrated with the plot, such as ""puzzle"" bosses that query the details of a mystery.  Mechanics are pretty solid, plot is reasonably interesting, music is quite decent too.  It's a little tedious having to discard gemstones one by one when you run out of inventory space, but that's about my only complaint.  This game's not the most epic of adventure tales, but it's definitely surprisingly fun to play.Just make sure you use the gem upgrades to make the C command reveal a ton more hints at once.  Four is good.  If you're paying attention, you should rarely need more than that.  And also get the Escape upgrades, so that you can stop attacking/defending immediately once a gem becomes available for use.  And if the clues go by too fast, there's another upgrade for that.  The game would probably be more tedious if I didn't get those, so I'm glad I got them.  Oh, and buy the Spirit Indexes from the store -- if a spirit is in the list, you can just click the name and be done with it.(Right-click to cancel if you don't want to upgrade a gem, by the way.  I'm not sure the game makes that clear, but it's there.  Though you can always redistribute all your upgrade points anyway.)The game comes with both Japanese and English voicework (which is just battle grunts/lines anyway), as well as the fully Japanese original version.(Disclosure: I acquired this game as part of the Groupees Indie Bundle.)

												99 Spirits introduces a unique new type of rpg. There are many good, as well as bad points to it.First of, it is very extremist on difficulty, it is either really easy, or pretty hard. However the difficulty to it doesn't rely on lack of skill, it is mostly because of a low level. The game is pretty easy itself, but going too fast through it may cause it to be a headache. I remember that when I got to certain boss on my first playthough I had absolutely no skills or support from monsters, and I couldn't go back to catch more because I HAD to defeat the boss. Took me MANY tries to beat, so hear my advice ALWAYS be ready with a nice or decent ""party"".Second, it is the gameplay itself, it can get really repetitive once you find all monsters of an area. And sometimes, when finding a monster for the first time, you have absolutely no idea what the monster is. Has anyone ever heard of a Torii? or a Naginata? Well it was the first time for me.Also, there are some features of the game that are never explained to you, for example Starve and Food, the only thing these two do, is make your character move slower on the map the hungrier you are and viceversa, you can't die from starving though.It has a very nice amount of characters, each different from the other (in the sense each NPC has her/his own personality). If something, I'd say this game is like a visual novel + a puzzle RPG style. In addition the soundtrack in the game is actually really good, but you might get tired of it as it will repeat itself several times on different areas (Same that happens with any song, the longer you hear it over and over, the more likely you'll start to hate it). It is a very nice overall game, I don't really suggest it for its story, but for the experience of the game itself. And again, the game is easy to beat, but a little time consuming (especially if you want all achievements). However, the game does fall short for the full price ($15). So if you can get it with discount or on a bundle, I'd say go for it. The best advice I can give you, is to try out the demo, that is the best way to tell if this game is or isn't for you.			"

												EDIT: Holy crap. Towards the last few chapters the game is actually IMPOSSIBLE to beat! The enemies will heal faster than you can damage them for an infinite amount of time. I'm 7 hours deep into this game and if I want to even have a chance at progressing I will need to start all over again from chapter one just so I can grind and capture a different set of objects to battle with. If you want to see what I'm talking about, here is a 20 minute long video of me fighting an infinitely healing enemy

Old positive review (will totally revert back to this one if the game ever gets fixed because honestly it's fantastic at its core)If you're not into word puzzles, visual novels & basic combat stay away from this. However, if you don't mind using your brain, have a good understanding of English (as well as some Japanese objects/locations) & do enjoy a good read every now and then this is for you. I'm roughly a quarter of the way through this game and while I hated it at first and found the whole combat system to be annoying and rather boring, it has grown on me. The story is fantastic, I love the artwork and there is enough game here to make it more then just your typical 99% text visual novel!Is it worth $10-$15? Ehh, probably not. If you can get it in an indie bundle or for under $6, don't hesitate!			"

												I found this game to be overall very enjoyable in short 30~40 minute bursts. The character design is excellent and the music is great and the storyline and dialog is very well written. It’s not the sort of game you spend 4 hours a day playing, it leans more to the casual “waiting between college classes” side of gaming. Highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of youkai (妖怪).

												Overall, I think this game is a wonderful game especially for those not new to Japanese culture.Pros: An excellent story with memorable characters (Think Inuyasha without the blatant love story), Ambitious combat mechanics (especially with the second half of the game with the introduction of capturing and fighting with tsukumogami and finding out which ones work well together), Multiple endings depending upon your choices, Beautiful graphics, Full Voice Actors, and Nice musicCons: As other reviewers have stated, that you have to re-reveal previously discovered tsukumogami is very repetitive, (Future upgrades can shorten the time of discovering though), Game is also not noob friendly. I would be amazed if someone without knowledge of Japanese culture would know what a ""Naginata"" is.			"

												The game is very original with an unique combat system, it also has a good storyline and art. The reason I'm not recommending this game is because in my opinion it's a total rip-off for the full price, you can get better for much less, but that's not even the point, the game get's really boring after a few minutes playing. The same unique and original battle system that I complimented above gets insanely repetitive and uninteresting, after you discover most of the spirits it just feels like an immense waste of time.

Posted: January 23, 2016
												To start, I give this game a recommend with the basis it is for old-school RPG players who can handle a bit of repetitive grind to get to those lovely story pieces. If you dislike going through very similar battles multiple times to find out what happens in the story, then this probably isn't for you. For me, however, I found the story worth the grind.99 Spirits feels like a combination of an old-school console JRPG with quick-time combat and a strategic layer of monster catching to gain new and very important abilities. The combat is based on first guessing the enemy spirit's name which is initially pretty tricky but this is solved by the acquisition of items you can buy/find in game (or you can use one of the awesome community guides). Combat is further modified by visiting a shrine and upgrading your weapon to speed up/simplify battles (almost to the point of removing the guessing game entirely - good yet weird since that's a big part of the game's uniqueness). One advantage 99 Spirits has over older JRPGs is that you can walk around enemies and skip most battles rather than be constantly stuck fighting random invisible encounters.The story of 99 Spirits uses a great piece of Japanese lore about tsukomogami which are basically everyday objects that have come to life. You play as Hanabusa, a young swordswoman set on the path of destroying the evil spirit-monsters with the support of your troupe. The characters and settings are engaging with lovely artwork accompanying each. Atmospheric moments provide a scope of problems beyond yours and give the world an added touch.As far as complaints go, there is a very important one: my game crashed/glitched about 3times but since I save often I lost all of a few minutes of play (lucky compared to some reviewers).Also, I suggest muting the music and using your own playlist; otherwise, some very nice songs become grating which is always a shame.

												well, where do I start.. emm.. can you imagine a spelling-bee word game crossover with turn-based tactical tile-block moving RPG? well, Final Fantasy Tactic with spelling-bee word quiz? That's what it is....It's new type of battle from this genre, but it fall down flat in 30minutes of play. In the end, you just spamming Z for attack when available, and spamming X for everytime enemy attack you (you won't get hurt), and fill up the gauge of your ""Identity Sword"" to reveal what kind of tsukumogami that was. It's that all! there's nothing like skill, magic, or special move whatsoever.BGM is awful, it's literally only one 5 seconds music for battle theme that repeats over and over.What do you hope of novel-themed RPG? A good voice-acting right? This game just serve you sound of your protagonist while attack and get hurt, what the ♥♥♥♥? even a HENTAI game do better.let's review this game feature that featured by the dev.-Work out the true identity of your enemies in a unique battle system yes, spelling-bee is a new unique battle system indeed. and nope, mistyped is not allowed boys!-Capture enemies, master their skills for battle and use them to solve puzzles on the field the field is 9x14 block grid, no other else, it's really a puzzle.-Interact with over 40 unique characters and battle over 100 monsters Interact with over 40 unique character with no voice acting whatsoever, and battle 1 type of monster that can change to over 100 types of households.-Beautifully detailed art and an atmospheric original soundtrack bring feudal Japan alive beautifully detailed battlefield grid and an atmospheric 5 seconds loop soundtrack, really bring feudal japan in my minds.-Discover multiple unique endings that change based on the player’s actions I don't think people can stand to play this till the end since this game always crashes everytime you didn't want to.(don't use steam overlay, do not receive message, do not alt tab it at some points, do not use fullscreen. just a warn, this circumstance will give you a lot of crash.)TL;DRI'm more enjoy to spend my 15minutes to write this review than actually playing this. You may try, but if you think this game worth a try. You'll have your time well-spent in another game.			"

												99 Spirits is a fun and unique puzzle role playing game with many hours of gameplay. You take on the role of the heroine Hanabusa who has received the one and only weapon that can defeat the Tsukumogami. The Tsukumogami are everyday items that have come to life, in order to attack them with the sword you must first name what they are using the hints receive. The field in the game is grid based but can be used to your advantage if you want to avoid battling the Tsukumogamis that wander around on each map. At times you will be required to fight specific Tsukumogami and capture them in order to open up new areas. The game can be a bit frustrating and at times fell like it drags on, I recommend spacing out play time.			"

Not only does it have both, it has side quests left, right and centre. Not only that, it has tons of achievements, some to do with the story, some not and an achievement for finding all of the endings.My only gripe with this game, is the grinding.

												Interesting story, charming characters, good soundtrack, beautiful art style, and I love the connection to Japanese folklore. But I can't recommend this solely based on the combat system, which gets EXTREMELY dull and repetitive after a while. I really want to like this game based on all of its good qualities, but it really becomes a grind, and the undead enemies in chapter 4 are overpowered and extremely frustrating to take down due to their huge health bars, unblockable attacks that you cannot dodge, and their HIGH dodge chance. It takes forever to whittle them down and I'm just not sure that it's worth it.They tried. Gold star for effort. It just doesn't cut it, though.Edit: WOW, the chapter 4 enemies HEAL, too. Wowwwwwwww. Yeah. I'm sorry, do not pick this title up unless you like repetition in combat, have money to throw away and nothing better to do with your time. And even then, I wouldn't pick this game up for full price. Chapter 4 is impossibly, artificially difficult. It's really pointless.Edit2: It's literally regenning its health faster and on more turns than I can land counterattacks on it to damage it. Which seems to be the only way to tackle it as far as I can tell at this point. And you have to fight like 5 of them, I believe.Edit3: Alt+F4ing the game and uninstalling. If after 100 turns I cannot even get the enemy to under 1/3 health, it's just completely and utterly not worth it. Do not touch this game, do not even look at it. Just, no. Try the demo, get frustrated by the combat, and spend your money elsewhere. All of the enjoyable aspects of this game can be yours by watching a Let's Play.			"

												Not really sure if I want to recommend this game. It's fun to play for a while since the combat has an interesting twist to it, but the narration of the story just feels a little bit dragging for me. Also, you get info-dumped on too many characters to remember right at the start, with none to little introduction to their personalities. But as I said, if your focus is not on the storytelling, but on the combat mechanics and so on, it's worth a try for a few hours.			"

												I would love to recommend this game.  The problem is that this game suffers from so much pacing issues.  Points where it just takes such a long time just to one action.  There's also the fact that the enemy can have multiple chances to hit before you even strike.If you really want to try this game get it from either a bundle or when it's very cheap.  It's just not worth it at full price.			"

												I haven't finished 99 Spirits yet, but I find it to be addictive due to unique battle system, it does get repetitive but honestly the only thing that frustrated me was during one of the battles the answer was obvious  and there was no other answer that would fit and yet it said it was wrong. Luckily when I restarted the game it seemed to be fixed.The art, music and story are very interesting and very pleasing.The gameplay itself is interesting to the Jrpg style mixed with a guessing of what the enemy is.

												This is a game you probably love or hate.love : with the fast paced battle and a lot of activity in the middle of the fight, i say it's a good mechanic. for the story its good, not the best but there is something that make you want to go back, it can be for the character or the plot. the game is simple so its easy for everyone to play.hate : you know this felling if you need to grind. especially early on in the top i say the battle have a lot of activity... yeah but early on the only activity you get was attack and defend. the enemy is stupid you can 100% guaranteed block the enemy attack.despite the grind thing, the enemy do get smarter letter on, they read your movement and dodge constantly and you have some useful ability to use.for the guess your enemy mechanic it stand in between. you will like or hate it.beafore you buy i recommend to search online first because this game not meant for everyone.

												Undoubtedly the most unique feature of 99 Spirits is its battle system; it's probably not for everyone, but it is pretty interesting (and easy) once you get the hang of it.  If you like the game's combat system and are still trying to decide whether to get this game or not, perhaps the biggest issue is how you feel about ""grind-y"" games.  It also helps if you like anime/visual novel-type games, or word-based games.    Yes, the battles get very repetitive, and I've experienced crashes on a few occasions, but overall I enjoyed playing this game.  The story is good (but nothing groundbreaking), and the art is well-done.  3 endings add a little bit of replay value (though NewGame+ mode makes subsequent playthroughs much faster, should you go with that); getting 100% takes some dedication.

												99 Spirits is a weird RPG-Puzzle hybrid, which plays in a feudal Japanese setting with evil spirits, called Tsukomogami, which are alive everyday objects, running rampage.Before you can damage enemies, you need to uncover what they are, by collecting clues, and then typing out the object's name, so being fluent in English is a requirement, and you also should have knowledge about some things of the Japanese Edo period, like ""Kusarigama"" or ""Torii"".The battles get pretty repetetive fast though, but the game has an exceptionally well written story, which made me finish the game. If you are interested in Japanese folklore, try this game. You will like the story.Oh and the DLC story is god damn scary.			"

												99 Spirits has a lot of spirit in that it tries do something different but falls flat on its face in trying to do so. The storytelling is generic albeit interesting with a unique flare to it which ties into the battle system....and here is where it loses points....how do I even describe it...you do series of actions against monsters until you get them to the point where you can  name them and then defeat them....Sounds obtuse? Well it is, and although I applaud it for trying something different I honestly can't see who this is targeted at....even at a glance of other reviews....few if any praise the battle system for anything beyond its uniqueness, and frankly when a games core mechanic is a  meh or pass feature, the same should be said for the game. It certainly is different...but I still cant recommend it.			"

												Oh, wow, what can I say about this game that has not already been said? The story, the music, the artwork, the combat system combining puzzle solving elements as well as quick reaction timing... I don't know where to start! The story is much deeper than it first appears on the surface, the characters are all pretty cool--from the Gokon sword weilding heroine Hanabusa, to her foxy companion Komiya and all the gods in between. The artwork is very simple but surprisingly detailed, much like the paintings created in Japan's past--not quite as epic as Okami's art, but not bad for a still picture RPG!I love the music, though it may get repetitive for some people, as it tends to loop quite often--especially in the longer battles. The combat is just as I described it: puzzle solving combined with split second reactions of the player to beat the living tar out of TONS of demon beasties called Tsukumogami and the forces of darkness.The mythology of ancient Japan, artwork harkening back to the paintings of the time, a really neat combat system equals--to me--a pretty cool game! Give it a try!One note: SAVE OFTEN! Sometimes, the game crashes in battle, completely freezing up for... I dunno, some reason I don't know of. Usually I can get it functioning by leaving it running for 10-15 minutes and not touching it, but sometimes a restart is necessary.			"

												This game is a very interesting oddity, with a unique way of doing combat and and a very grand story. Taking place in medevial Japan, it's up to you to destroy all the pottery, tableware and clothing articles for justice. By that, I mean possessed objects, just like the start of Mother 1. Pros:Incredible soundtrackGenuinely interesting characters, your actions can dictate how they act and even save or end their livesLengthy storyNo two people will ever have the same loadoutMultiple endingsQuite a few bosses which put a twist on the combat systemShizuru is hilarious.Cons:The combat system is a love it or hate it affair, which the hours I put in you already know what I thinkAn inperfect translation, there's a few typos here and there. This is a very minor nitpick.Saving a certain person who can't keep their chest contained is easily missable on your first runIf you can't identify a boss even though you've seen all the hints, yeah, good luck buddy.Overall, I believe this game is rather grand and will provide you with at least 20 or so hours of enjoyment. This can go to 60 hours depending on what kind of run you'd like to do. However, it's a game that you'll love or you'll hate, so keep that in mind if you decide to purchase it. "

												99 Spirits is an rpg with a unique style of combat. The story is about Japanese folklore and plays in the time of old Japan. This is beautifully visualised in an 2D art style and complimented by the music. It set a good atmosphere kinda like Okami. Though it's has a low resolution. Which is unacceptable in these times. But the gameplay is my issue with the game. Mainly with the combat. It's a mix of quick time events with word puzzles like Scribblenauts. It is very slow and tedious. The rpg part is that great either. You walk around on maps with only tiles with you and enemies on it. And between these maps everything is told by characters talking to each other. Which makes you feel like you are reading a story instead of playing a game.But you have to go through the tedious gameplay to read further. And the story isn't written that good either. So I can't recommend this game.			"

												3 words can sum this game up: A real shame.99 spirits is a wonderful game, but is boggled down by frequent crashes. I want to carry on playing this game, but the amount of times it randomly crashes has just ruined the experience for me. Maybe once the devs do something to fix these issues I might return to it. However until it is fixed the game, and the story I was so looking forward to seeing the conclusion of, will remain incomplete.There is only so many times I can put up with the game crashing when going to save, or doing anything for that matter, and losing game progress. I am at chapter 9, and so far the game has crashed a total of 10 times.I really want to recommend the game due to how simple, yet fun, the gameplay is and the engrossing story and likable characters. Until the game is fixed, though, I can't recommend buying the game unless you find it in a cheap bundle.As I said, it's a real shame. The game is designed so well, but is just close to unplayable due to how frequently it crashes.			"

												This game is a colorful, rich carnival of ancient Japan aesthetics and folklore (if you're an occult nerd, the accuracy to lore here and there will blow you away), with a great story and an endearing cast of characters to glue it all together.That doesn't mean it's all fluff and no substance, though. It sports a refreshingly unique battle system where you must discover the name of the supernatural creatures you fight before you can reveal their true form and move in for the kill: a play on the idea of ""kotodama"", or the ""soul of words"", according to which knowing the true name of something gives you power over it. And that's exactly what happens, as eventually you're given the ability to capture them and wield their powers to your advantage, both in and out of battle.The only flaws to be found are some rare stability issues and the fact the explanations of game mechanics are somewhat vague and easy to miss sometimes. (As a matter of fact, remember that after meeting the goddess of jewels you can return to her to power up your gems to charge faster, reveal more hints and so on.)In conclusion, if you enjoy medieval Japan settings, unusual gameplay, or just want to be told a good story, without a doubt 99 Spirits deserves a spot in your wishlist.

												The overworld is gridbased. The combat is attack a guy to get hints and hint words (say you get TEP and pottery) and then you have to guess what the thing your fighting is (teapot) its alot easier then it sounds because the game gives you lists of possible monsters in the area.Combat: pretty unique, however it can be boring when you already know what youre fighting with the first hint(s), the upgrade system is pretty cool (you get gems in your sword that allow you to do stuff like attack and defend and get hints, you can go to a shrine to power up specific gems) the combat screen is basically earthbound (early rpgs) Another neeto thing about the combat is later on in the game you can capture spirits and use there powers as your own in battles. however later on in the game most bosses just spam heal and it becomes a major chore to backtrack and find the few guys that can stop that♥♥♥♥♥♥ really ruins a good thing5/10Music: Game really falls short here with around like 10? songs total, But the songs are alright but they get stale quickly with how much there repeated. Might want to make your own playlist for this one.4/10Story: anime/10, cute girl with sword travels around with a perverted furfox to save gods and kill da bad ghosties. The game does have multiple endings and NG+, so thats good.Overall: I'd pass on this unless you: Want the trading cards, want to support fruitbat factory, or think the concept of finding out what you're fighting before you can kill it is the hypest thing in gameplayIf you do decide to get it, Do yourself a favor and always have a wand and a katana, you'll thank me later.

Isn't that a ghosts job? More specifically a poltergeist? Don't they ""haunt"" and ""possess"" stuff in order to terrorize people?You may think that is nitpicking but actually that is the reason I can't play the game. No not because I have a fear of ghosts, because you need to type in what the object is in order to reveal the demon inside. Only problem with that is, the game was originally in Japanese and many of the cultural differences and object names have not been translated very well so what ends up happening is that you may see a 'T-shirt'. So you type that in but it's wrong, so you type in 'T-Shirt' thinking maybe the capitalization was off or something but its still wrong so you try 'top', 'short sleeve shirt', etc~, etc~ and you go through the whole spectrum until finally you give up and find out after much random guessing that it was 'sleeveless shirt'.I love the concept behind the game and maybe as the game progresses the answers become much more obvious; I know the game does allow multiple answers for the same object so you don't need to get them down perfectly however you do need to guess the answers the game has provided for each item and sometimes the range of items themselves are convoluted or the clues are anything but helpful.I recommend the game because it is not going to sell well regardless of what I or anyone says but it is certainly an original game and genuine effort was made to try and make it accessible.

To start with, this game is NOT FOR EVERYONE, far from it. You SHOULD try out the demo before buying it.The game is about a swords(wo)man, Hanabusa, who fights evil spirits on her journey to restore a blade that is imbues with powers from differents gods and ultimately find out the source for the mass of spirits that have been rampaging lately. How the fighting happens is quite a different aproach from what you'd expect and also is the catch of the game.When you fight the spirits, you will find out that they are practically invincible to your attacks, by attacking you'll gather energy that you can use to not actually damage the spirits, but to gather information about the spirit you are facing. What do you do with the information then? You'll have to find out the spirits actual form in order to be able to defeat it.Sounds crazy all right.When you enter combat you will have no idea what you are facing, apart from the knowledge of ""this zone has these and those"",  you start off with a round of attacks, hopefully filling up your energy (or gem as the game calls them), when it's filled, you then spend it to gather info, the information gained will be hints about what the actual form of the spirit is, when you think you have enought information you can try to name the spirit, thus revealing the true form, and only then your attacks will start hurting the spirit. Naturally, you can skip the information gathering and just throw guesses, usually the spirits do a rather mean counter attack if you try to call them out and are wrong.All this is done with simple controls, you either atttack, or defend, both gather energy for their respective gems, during the action round, you'll have the chance to deflect attacks from the monster and counter attack, in a reaction game fashion.It gets repetive, fast, no doubt about that, but the challenge and fun is the little guessing game you have to do with the spirits. Eventually that will get to you too, and you wish it would be easier and faster, well luck is with you! Not too far into the game you actually will be able to start boosting numerous aspects of the fights, making them a ton smoother at which point the game really starts to slowly turn towards a more story telling type of a game with some action as the side dish.Thanks to the cast of quite charming characters, it's not a bad thing at all.Really, play the demo if you are curious, some will hate it, some will love it. I personally find it quite an entertaining experience. Oh and remember to save often if you end up getting the game, I've had a couple crashes when facing certain spirits and there are no autosaves.Pros+Loveable characters+Story+Soundtrack+Guessing the spirits can prove to be great fun for some+Original audioCons-Repetive gameplay-Soundtrack (too much is too much, no matter if you like the music or not)-English audio made me want to tear my ears off-No autosaves of anykind.

												Pros:Interesting story and backgroundGreat character art and funny dialogueGood graphics - cute little isometric travelling gameInteresting mechanics allowing capturing of spiritsNeutral:Music. I heard battle music so much that I just stopped listening to it.Con:Combat. Really boring and tedious. If you use the keyboard, you're forever hitting Z, X, C, V, B or N as well as A or S if need be.If you use the mouse, click clickclick click. Nothing more interesting than clicking all day.			"

												Got it as part of a humble bundle.Err, it's basically just a giant click fest and guessing game.The story parts made me interested, but after just a bit of playing, my clicker finger was aching so bad. x-xYou basically keep spamming left click until you fill 2 types of gauges, one that you can ask for a hint, the other gauge so you can enter your guess. The enemy/yokai are invincible until you guess what item they were made from first, then you spam left click until it's defeated (think like how a kamaitachi weasel demon would have originated from a sickle).I'll likely try beating it eventually just for the story tho, despite the repetitive ""combat"".

												99 spirits is the name of the game and while you play you will see many flames.99 spirits is a fun filled adventure like the pokemon of old with a twist. You have to guess the name of the enemy and they are fixed once you learn 1-2 letters or type of ghost they are. Another repetitive game has lots of missed potential. The enemies become stronger as you play the game and I gotta capture them all and sometimes luck does not bring the enemy you want. Is it fun you ask, why yes it is early on I had loads of fun figuring out and capture pokemon I mean Tsukumogami. The enemies will require tactics and you need to capture certain enemies at progress later on into the game and it might require leveling your new found pets.

Using various attacks you determine the name of the monster you are facing, and then kill it.  Some may enjoy this game, I did not.			"

												(NB: I have cleared the game on Desura in about 10 hours in addition to the hours logged in here.)99 Spirits is a Japanese indie game localized into English. The gameplay itself contains mostly turn-based fighting, JRPG style but with just one character, and with blocks and counters requiring quick reflexes.The battle system is the main novelty here: the character must first find out clues of the enemy's name, then guess its name (an English noun, such as ""beads"", ""hatchet"" or ""hat""), and only then can the player deal damage to the opponent. As the game progresses, the combat gains more complexity with the enemies guarding against attacks and the player capturing the monsters to do her (Hanabusa's) bidding.There's not much progression in the way of gear - the only gear the player can change are the Tsukumogami (the monsters). By identifying more different Tsukumogami, the player can boost some abilities that will make the battles less of a chore later down the line.The translation itself is mostly competent. Especially the monster names - that the player has to guess properly - use English words known to most, with the only exception being ""Torii"". The puzzles are simple and usually require only a specific type of Tsukumogami to accompany the player to a marked spot. Again, there's only one problem and it is knowing that the ""wand"" Tsukumogami is used to purge evil spirits. Then again, these aren't a problem due to the translation itself.Visually, the game is bare-bones. It's functional, but in the battles the enemies are not animated at all and in the ""walking"" mode Hanabusa and the Tsukumogami just ""teleport"" from one tile to another. There's nothing wrong with the character portraits displayed as they do a lot of their talking in the game.As for the plot - there's a lot of dialogue, some tropes, and some branching points between which the game progresses with nary a sidequest. A sandbox game of any description this is not, and there's about only one sidequest in the whole game.The battles have some voice acting, with separate tracks in English and Japanese. The dialogue itself is not voice acted at all. The music is a curious blend of modern and old - you might want to check it out (and not only the game's theme song).Bottom line: 99 Spirits is a bit different game. The visuals are a bit underwhelming and eventually, the game gets a bit monotonous in spite of how the new features are added for several chapters from the start of the game.Give the demo a go and see if you like the concept and how it was handled.

												I've been thoroughly enjoying this game. It's a fairly unique JRPG in the spelling system to conquer the enemies with a bit of exploration to boot.There isn't great depth to 99 Spirits, but it has a fairly interesting story, and I find it's most enjoyable in short bursts. Fans of bizarre Japanese myths will enjoy this I'm sure, as well as gamers who enjoy a fairly simple and unique experience.			"

												This is one is a tough one to reviewThis game has the unique mechanic of having you try and defeat enemies by guessing what type of object they are by typing/inputing the correct spelling of their name.While many of these objects have basic names like ""pants"" others have a japenese name which makes sense given the setting of feudal japan, which is fine.................if you know japanese words and culture.The problem is that this is a translation of a japanese game (obviously) with the main gamplay being featured around language and spelling. Otherwise translation would not be such a problem.Non japanesese people/speakers are at disadvantage as it is but the real problem is there is no compensation for this fact in the translation (at least in english) or gameplay.So unless you are VERY knowledgeable of japanese words and culture (feudal japan no less) it stops being a fun game of trying to guess the word/item from the hints/letters given to you and becomes a game of ""well what is the japansese word/english equivalent for it.............sigh better go look it up or cheat"".In conclusion i just can not recommend the translation of this game with these problems unless you are big into japansese culture (in which case you probably already own this). That being said i did rather enjoy it when it was mostly english words and japansese words i already knew or could see in the index. It does start getting rather repetive after a while though but this would be tolarable if it were not for the above mentioned problem. If this problem was not present i might rate this as average (IF STEAM HAD SUCH A OPTION )♥♥♥♥♥♥maybe more given it's unique gamplay feature but as it stands it has a problem that can not be overlooked.

												Personal Score for game:78/10099 Spirits: A story based on the Japanese folklore ""Tsukumogami"" or literally 99 Spirits. A game fit for the Japanese culture nerd in you, but a little prior Japanese knowledge needs to be known to understand parts of the story. All in all, 99 Spirits is a charming story with a mix of a JRPG style of game with puzzles. Is this for everyone? No, but here are Pros and Cons.Pros:-Charming story, one of the best in this genre-Memorable characters-Game is pretty linear, except for the decision points. There are no major side quest or things like that (This can be both a pro and a con)-Beautiful music and scenery-No MAJOR level system, so you can use the best spirits whenever you are able to obtain themCons:-Like most reviewers said before, really really really repetitive-If you are an achievement hunter, like me, you will have to go through the game at least 2-4 times to unlock all achievements-Some concepts never explained, like hunger and status conditions-Status conditions and most items in the game were practically useless and you may never use them, except for the Festival Sake for a teleport or medicine for Hp gain and the rare seed item that pumps you up a level-Some points in the game are almost impossible to do unless you switch to a lower difficultyIn conclusion, this game is a really good game in terms of story, but the rpg element is a bit lacking and gameplay is a bit repetitive. Play this game for the story and you will be astounded.			"

												Some poeple may think, ""Meh; it's just some typical dull doujin-soft game."" But don't be fooled! This is actually a game that takes the traditional JRPG genre, in an interesting direction! Gameplay-wise, you have to IDENTIFY enemies, and spell what kind they are, BEFORE you can kill them off! This makes the game quite unique, and with some obscure words that not everyone knows of, it may even improve your vocabulary, by giving you knowledge, of new, obscure things that sometimes, you may have never even heard of! (Specifically, some things that do exist in real life, but not as evil spirits.) Would I reccomend this? Only if it's on sale, for $3, or less; this is because $9.99 would be a bit too overpriced, even for a game like this...unless you're a super-rich person, in the ""higher class budget citizen"" category.

												It's like a visual novel with but with an actual game in the mix. The gameplay itself plays like some sort of bad strategy game/RPG hybrid. You're given a play field, which looks like a board of wood with a grid on it. You basically select a square on the grid and your character walks to it. There are enemies however, and if you get intercepted on your way to the square you selected, a battle starts. The battles are pretty basic. One button to attack, one to defend. It's timing based, which is the most interesting part about it. If you're a huge otaku you might find the Japanese folklore to be interesting, for the rest of us it's essentially all gibberish. If you're desperate for a competent RPG (competent meaning it works, nothing more nothing less), I guess this might do the trick as well. Just prepare for a lot of reading.Personally, I'd avoid spending the ludicrous $10 that they're asking for. Go buy Undertale if you're really looking to spend $10. As of this writing it's on sale for $3, which is about the right price. To wrap up, I'm not a huge fan but understand why people might like this game. But, that's not enough to recommend it to anyone.			"

												First of all, this is very obviously an Anime Game™. If you can't handle the ugu~, get out of the kitch-nya~-nThat said: 99 Spirits is a very 90's and very PC-feeling jRPG. It features a fairly interesting idea for a combat system that is extraordinarily simple and, until you get the upgrades given to you at about an hour in, extremely tedious. Once that's down, though, it's smooth sailing and you're in for a pleasant time.I assume. The game crashed on me when I alt-tabbed and I lost all my progress, and frankly I don't feel like slogging through that first 90 minutes again, so I'm going to pass. But feel free to let me know if the rest of the game is any good.			"

												So let me get this straight, you happened to be a young swordswoman who is traveling across Japan with a fox demon of some sort in order to find her dad while killing other demons possessing common household objects. I guess that sums up the basis of the story. I don't remember how long I have spent with 99 Spirits because I mostly played it offline when my internet was down for a period of time, but I still have not finish my first play through so keep that in mind.The combat system pretty much consists of guessing a word through hints given to you when you attack the enemy and after you have successfully guessed the word, you are able to kill the enemy or capture the soul when given the opportunity, but guess the word incorrectly and you will take damage with no chance to negate it. Other than that, it is really just a QTE. In theory, it sounds like a good idea, but in practice, it gets repetitive pretty quickly because you are guessing the same enemy over and over again due to the limited enemy variety in each region, not to mention all the enemies feel very similar to one another. The boss fights completely enforces the idea of sitting through QTEs because they behave just like the normal enemies you have faced for the umpteenth time except they have maybe 10 to 20 times more health, has the ability to kill you in maybe 2 hits at most throwing in unblockable attacks every so often forcing you to stay in the defense stance around 80% of the time, and heal very frequently to extend the length of the battle. The movement for the world map is pretty standard with nothing special to make note of except for the hunger meter that does nothing except makes moving around the map slower than normal. Even if the hunger system did something to impact the game, it does not tell you what it even does and even if they do tell you, the game does a pretty bad job at it.The soundtrack is, in my opinion, ok at best, but the battleground music can get really repetitive sometimes and you can even hear the where the track loops.Perhaps the worst offender this game has is that it crashes very often if you don't know what is causing it to crash in the first place so if you are going to play this game, I suggest you head to the forums to look up on other people's experience so you hopefully won't have to deal with them too much.I am really having a hard time on whether or not I should give a recommendation for 99 Spirits because it's game play feels lackluster in some areas in addition to the frequent crashing and a fairly iffy story, but it has an interesting idea with the combat system despite on its shaky execution and has some fairly interesting characters to meet. For $15, I think it's a hard sell for those who are skeptical about the gimmicky combat system, but if it goes on sale for maybe $10 or less, it's possible to take it into consideration. At the end of the day, I can't recommend 99 Spirits despite that fact that I had a decent time with 99 Spirits due to all of the problems I have stated before, but then again, it's probably a game that is best played in short bursts. If you do happen to take an interest in 99 Spirits, try the demo first before pulling the trigger.			"

												I got this in a bundle years ago, and decided to finally pick it up and play it a few days ago.  Verdict: this is not a good game.I was shocked to see that it was $15 in the store.  I would not pay this much for this game.  I would not pay HALF this much for this game.  I would not even pay a dollar for this game.  Really, except that this game came bundled with other games I was at least somewhat interested in, I wouldn't own it.  But I do, and I played it for a little bit, and now I can hopefully convince YOU not to buy it.The combat system is interesting!  ...for about two seconds.  The mechanics of fighting aren't ""fun,"" they're just a timesink.  Battles are designed to just... waste your time.  Fill in time.  I don't know.  The game moves pretty slowly, partially because of that, and partially because the system is really clunky.  Spam too much of the attack button because combat moves so slow and you just want to move on?  Be prepared to keep attacking when you're supposed to twitch react for a defense.  Trying to spam your ability so you use it as soon as you finish attacking?  Nope, we'll just keep on attacking afterwards because you hit any button at all while attacking initially.But to be honest, the clunkiness isn't that bad, you can get over it - but it doesn't help an already unfun combat system in any way.  Or an unfun overworld - there isn't really gameplay outside of combat, except for talking with people - which is okay, if strangely translated.  I mean, it has voiceacting - entirely in Japanese, sure, since it didn't get localized with the text, but they're talking and feel like better characters because of it.  But not enough to justify it - really you're getting a bad slideshow story with tedium between the scenes.Not a good game.			"

												This game is really unique, and at first it really caught my attention with it's puzzling combat system.You have to battle the Tsukogami, who will appear as purple mist at first, and in order to reveal their true identity you have to find out the name of the object which they possess.Sounds pretty cool at first and acutally it is.But after twenty minutes it gets as boring as it can be.It is the most repeating game I have ever seen and by that I mean every single aspect of it.The gameplay is the same over and over, the graphics are the same, the borad you are playing on, the sounds, really everything.After playing a good bunch of time, my room mate came over and nearly killed me, because of the background music she heard the whole time.You can turn off the BGM, ""Voices"" and sound effects seperately, though.After 15 hours of gameplay I turned off the music  permanentelySo, why did I play this for 35 hours in the end, you may ask?Because of the really well written story.It has emotions, action, plot twists and different endings, so if you are content with only a good story, go ahead buy this.If you are looking for exciting gameplay, turn around and never come back, really.The biggest issue I had with the 99 spirits, was the massive instability.It crashed about 15 times for me. So I recommend to everyone to save your game often.And that's it. A can't say much more about it without to spoiler, because the story is really this biggest part of this game.I would give this a 3 out of 10.			"

												If I had to sum up this game in one word, it would be disappointing.  The game feels like someone had a possibly brilliant idea, but then lacked the time, money, energy, talent, or something to actually make it into a good game.  All of the maps are identical, the hunger and weapon damage systems add nothing to game and seem to only exist as ways to drain money from you, and the combat quickly becomes repetitive.  The only good thing I can say about this game is that it has decent art, although the art in the ending credits is not colored for some reason.  I could possibly recommend this to some people if it was a much lower base cost, but at $15 it needs to be much better than it is.			"

Later on in the game there are demon objects that canBlockDodgeHealGot into a fight (had 2 wet stones to repair sword) that the creature just keeps healing, an hour and 99 turns of clilcking the same button I _Finnally_ kill those demon sandalsSo, fast forward and my save is completely ruined (Yes I'm a one save kind of guy) Can not go back to town, and don't have enough sword left to defeat the boss.

												A great idea, but poorly executed, resulting in frustratingly tedious and overly simplistic gameplay. Numerous times the game will have you enter fights over and over again until you find the right tsukumogami to help you progress. You can keep a maximum of five and having them in the right order gives you bonuses. However, since you often have to capture a particular one, the order gets messed up and you have to recapture all 5 tsukumogami to have them back in place. This made me lose temper more than once, as you have to backtrace for (potentially) hours, just because you needed something for a freaking minute. But the worst problem of this game is that the combat system is so simple, it's obsolete. It doesn't take any skill or thinking to win a battle, you win them by wasting your time. Revealing the identity of enemies is a pointless chore, since after a few hours of gameplay you'll be guessing it at first try, yet still you'll have to wait for all the hints to disappear (you often get the same hint multiple times and there's even an option to make them stay longer, seriously?) and find the bloody thing in the index (and for a small part of the game you will have to enter their names manually...). The visuals are very high quality and the music is nice, even if there's little variety to it. That's what made me keep playing despite the horrible gameplay. The story is silly and overly dramatic. Seldom, you'll get a crash during combat and ain't a damn thing the devs can do, cause they ""couldn't replicate the issue"" and didn't bother to get back on the topic in half a year.			"

												I really wanted to like this. I really did. I love Japanese folklore and aesthetic, but this game is insanely repetitive. It's build around discovering the identity of the spirits, but after you do they don't stay permanently identified. So you have to keep doing the same repetitive battles over and over and over. It's clearly very ambitious, and has a great localisation... but I cannot recommend it at all.			"

												99 Spirits is a fun JRPG/Visual Novel crossover, with a deep and interesting storyline, and a fun, unique combat system, that is easy to learn, and hard to master. The story follows Hanabusa, the main character, whom was selected by the gods to weild the Gokon Sword and Komiya, a white fox that can be viewed as human if you have the sword. They're trying to rid the world  of Tsukumogami, items that have been possessed and come to life, causing mass panic and destruction. You meet many characters along the way, all of which are memorable. The storyline is based from actual Japanese legends, such as the Tsukumogami, and Kitsunes. The art is nice, and the animation is pretty smooth. The only thing I would really change is making the walking/exploring sections smoother and more visual. Overall I'd say it's an 8.5/10Also, it drops 8 trading cards total, so if you're into trading cards, this is a good game for those.			"

												Firstly I have to qualify my comments; I have never played a game like this before, so quite how this compares to others in the genre, I am not sure.My first question was, 'did someone makes this game using the RPG maker program that steam occasionally flogs?' I had to click and read for a good 15-20 mins before I actually got to do anything, and when I did it was largely clicking again: choose defend or attack, with very little other game play to speak of.I am guessing the draw of this game is story driven, but even then, I was bored to tears reading the setting at the beginning.This game has officially replaced Surgeon Simulator as the worst of the 400+ games I own.

Hanabusa sets out on a quest for vengeance and revenge guided by a spiritual white fox to cleanse the world of the Tsukumogami using the Gokon Sword.The gameplay is very unique as well, you won't be able to damage your opponent unless you figure out what you're fighting. Until you do, you'll be fighting a dark misty fog that cannot be damaged nor killed. Everytime you hit a Tsukomogami, one of the Gokon Sword's special abilities builds up. After every sixth hit, you can use that special ability to get a hint to try to figure out what the Tsukomogami is. And after every sixth block, you can use the second special ability to type-in the correct everyday object which you the Tsukomogami you're fighting is. If you guess correctly, the dark misty fog/shroud will be lifted, and you'll be able to damage and successfully kill the Tsukomogami. And later on in the game, you'll be able to capture the Tsukomogami and use their abilities against your enemies.			"

For example, a monster I fought once gave the clues ET, T, chopping. There aren't many weapons that are commonly spelled with those letters, requiring me to just cheat and get a dictionary out. Without one, I'd be stuck just on the second monster! A game that difficult has never been fun for me. Not an instant buy for all. Still enjoyable to watch.			"

												A really fun concept (play 20 questions to banish demons) let down by a lack of enemy types and a bland dungeon system. Within a couple hours the repetition had already began to grate. The reason being that once you've beat an enemy you can just beat them with your first answer everytime.But overall I'd recommend it for its art, its concept and to support its developers.			"

												The art style and the setting is good. But what is lacking is the game mechanics. At first the battle seems tedious. However, after playing for a while, the game play is not unbearable. I went through the game on easy as the story is what I care about the most. The play through is around 15 hours.Battle mechanics-During each turn, you perform either attack or defend. These actions saves up points to perform the five skills - get hint, identify, capture, defense special, offense special. Before damaging the enemy, one must guess the enemy's name through identify, using hints that could either be a few letters of the word or description of the word. Each battle could easily take 10 to 20 turns at the beginning, which is quite long. Any grinding would make the game very boring because battles are highly repetitive, with only around 7 enemies in each area. Later in the game you can level up the skills, and the game moves significantly faster, taking less than 10 turns.Story-The story is set in Heian Japan to fight evil invaders called Tsukumogami, objects possessed by souls that turned evil because of hate.It might have been more fun if it was a more traditional RPG. This is a tough recommendation, because the initial impression could be intimidating. Anyone who likes this type of stories could give it a try when it is on sale for an insignificant price.			"

												I got this game as part of a donation bundle and despite it not being the main reason for donating in the first place - or secondary motivation either - this game had me positively surprised and took my main attention of the bundle in the aftermath. As I am sure many will have told you in here, this game is an edutainment game done right. You identify enemies through a clue game. If you can't speak English well, you might be able to do it a little better afterwards. And even if you don't know the right monster, with the spirit index you can obtain, solving the puzzle is more than possible and may teach you one or two things you didn't know about the English language yet. I consider myself not native, but well educated, and I learned several new things. Not about Heian Japan, I knew that much. There are some nice things you might only notice on your second run and a lot sense for detail, although I found some places where that detail sadly lacked. For example if you didn't save a certain character, if you haven't been up to date with the talk of another, that person regards the other person as still alive. Some kind of event trigger would have been nice and several altered text. If you act 'evil', the other characters should at least shortly react to it on the next visit. But those are minor immersion problems I only suffer from as a roleplayer.I got it in both, English and Japanese, and if my motivation ever reaches its peak to learn Japanese fully, I will use it as some kind of final test to complete it yet again. For now since I only donated half the bundle price to the creators - and 99 spirits was one of many games - I decided to support these games by buying the sidestory content DLCs. These 10€ are well earned.			"

												I honestly don't get why this game has such ""mixed"" reviews. So let me start explaining why this game is worth playing.Pros:+ Good plot+ Original gameplay+ Good artwork+ Nice soundtrack+ You can capture Tsukumogami, like Pokèmons!+ Bonus white fox+ Bonus skirt-chasing monk+ Bonus armor you see in some screenshots and you can actually get for yourself+ Three different endings+ If English is not your main language, guessing the Tsukumogami's name can actually be a good exercise for your vocabulary+ Every Tsukumogami has different skills, and you may choose your party according to your needs and preferences+ The characters are fun to interact with and overall well-writtenCons:- Sometimes, it's gonna crash, and you're gonna rage- Sometimes your save gets corrupted- I personally found looking for new Tsukumogami relaxing, but it might not be the same for everyone, the encounters are random and it may get somewhat tedious. (I found 5 pots while looking for something else. 5 pots. In a row.)- After a while the combat system may tire you, because it's always the sameI recommend getting this game on a good sale or a bundle because of its ""crashy"" behaviour. The only real thing you can do to somehow prevent the legendary crash-rage is saving often, changing slots from time to time so you don't have to start over, should your save get corrupted.			"

												First Opinion:I don't know why the reviews are mixed, this game is pretty good...Now, i haven't played much yet, (4 hours at the moment) but so far it's seems pretty fun and interesting!I admit that i started playing this game for the steam cards, but ended up getting into it. AND THAT IS SOMETHING!Gameplay:The gameplay is retro styled and that brings a really good feel to the game.It's like an RPG/Puzzle kind of game, (it kind of reminds me a bit of Pokémon gameplay on the old GBC or GBA) and brings some kind of riddle sistem to help you defeat your enemies, but even though it's easy to learn and requires simple methods, it's still challenging and will leave you scratching your head many times!  Story ""no spoilers"":The story seem to be pretty interesting, and is what got me most appealed to the game, (even though i haven't progressed much YET, it seems very promising).It's Japanese Folklore, so as you can imagine it revolves around ghosts, gods, talking animals and mystical swords, and the plot seems very intense... Imagine it being like storytelling.Final thoughts:If you're here just for the gameplay, you might as well just spend your money elsewhere because this game is not for you... I wouldn't really recommend it for everybody, (i imagine the target audience for this game is really especific) but to the people that enjoy visual novels or intriguing plots (there are even some comedic subplots to help break the tension), you should give this game a try.Overall, this it is Pretty Good, (looks nice too) and it's a big shame that this game is so underrated!

												Definitly a unique combat style of turn based rpg.  Dialog is fairly well written.  All in all a good game, nothing spectacular but pretty good.  Game seems to drag from about midway through the second act of the story onwards, turning it into more of an endurance contest than it should be.  Once you gain the abilities to use the spirit skills, if you know how to combine effects right you can become broken very quickly (the two spirit combo i had made it so that fighting the level 50 monster at level 20 was doable with no damage, albeit took a while but was doable).   Definitly worth picking up while it's on sale.			"

												I usually don't like Visual Novels, but this one had very unique and interesting combat with RPG elements, a pretty good story, and some wonderful Japanese art. However, it isn't without it's flaws.- Currently there is a problem with the game crashing when you try to identify an enemy, but while this is frustrating, it's not that horrible if you remember to save often.- The pacing is a little strange: there are some chapters that will only take you a few minutes to clear, but there are other chapters that will take you a few hours.- There are a few grammatical errors, but seeing as how this is an English translation of a Japanese game, they actually did a very good job. It's never bad enough to misunderstand what's being said.RecommendationI got this game in a bundle, but I believe that it actually is worth full price. If you work to 100% it, you will get more than 10 hours out of this game.			"

												I can't really say anything here that hasn't been said already. Tons of exposition, an interesting combat mechanic which does get a little tired over time, but seems to be good fun. Some good characters, but a little lazy on the asset creation on maps and the like.Overall though, if you see it in a sale, pick it up for certain and enjoy some time playing this curiosity!As always I've catalogued my journey playing this game:

												While I got this game on sale, it is every bit worth the full price. I loved all the animations and story line though I often found myself opening notepad for some things but overall it's an easy game to get into. I really loved the combat in this, and especially the time when I had to do more work to figure things out due to plot reasons. You don't need to grind at all [even though I ended up doing so] and the puzzles are mildly challenging. If you are looking for something engaging and unique look no further than this game			"

												The answers aren't always obvious.  If you're easily distracted, you'll find it especially hard to piece the words together when you repeatedly have to attack to obtain the clues over and over again.  The Combat will quickly become repetative, obtaining clues during battle will just serve to annoy you into quitting and it doesn't help that the maps are just grids with no design.  The battle music is very distracting and will start to get on your nerves after failing a defense or two.  99 Spiritis could have been a dungeon crawler with the current battle system still intact, but it became something much worst with an ugly grid styled field and annoying battle music.

												[ENG] Despite the bad reviews about this game, i found it very interesting. The combat system could seem boring, however some parts in the game are not that intuitive and that's challenging. The story line is cool, the characters and the graphic are not the best, however are simply and enjoyable; the music tracks even if are simple and short, are very suitable and nice.There are 3 finals in this game, and i only got the bad one. For getting the other endings i need to play again from the beginning, because i didn't spoiler me how to get them. If you are going to buy this game and want to finish it with all the ending, i just tell you to save before chapter 9 and then continue on a new save.Plus, if you're japanfag you'll really enjoy this game :3 Ps: By the way i'm disappointed with the price of the game, 10 Euros is too much. Buy it, but not for this price, wait for any sales ^^.[ITA] Nonostante le critiche e recensioni negative, ho trovato questo gioco interessante. Il sistema di combattimento potrà sembrare noioso alla lunga, ma ci sono parti del gioco che non sono così intuitive e questo risulterà competitivo. La trama è molto carina, i personaggi e la grafica non sono chissà cosa, ma nella loro semplicità sono molto piacevoli; le tracce musicali anche se semplicissime e corte, calzano a pennello in questo titolo.Ci sono 3 finali in questo gioco, e sono riuscito solamente a finire il gioco con quello negativo. Per sbloccare gli altri finali dovrei ricominciare il gioco da capo, perchè non mi sono spoilerato niente (ovviamente ci si può arrivare da soli su come finire con gli altri 2 finali, ma c'è una serie di azioni da compiere prima di un determinato capitolo, per questo non è intuitivo. Vi dico solo che se comprerete questo gioco, fate un altro salvataggio prima del capitolo 9 per poi continuare sull'altro salvataggio in modo da non dover ricominciare il gioco da capo). In più, se siete giappofag vi consiglio davvero questo gioco :3Ps: comunque non sono d'accordo con il prezzo di 10 Euro, compratelo ma aspettate per i saldi! ^^			"

While it can be a bit clunky, the combat system is unique (albeit a bit repetitive), and the characters are endearingly fresh in design.
