												If you like what you see in the picture then you will like the game. It's a beutiful game with a great atmosphere to go with it. The game has five worlds with 6 levels on each one to go through, and each world gives new environmental touches, new puzzles to solve, and new unique cubes to play around with to solve those puzzles. And for those referencing the game to the 'free' one on Desura, while good, it doesn't even compare to the polish and content this game offers compared to the student project demo on desura. For the asking price i think QBEH-1: The Atlas Cube is a great purchase.More info here: KSalue[www.ksalue.com] "

												Play time ~29 hoursThis game is fantastic. Simple basic mechanics that are easy to learn in order to progress through the game, with then more powers unlocked later on and more obstacle types as well. The puzzles are hard enough to make you think but never too hard to ever stump you. The game may pose to be slightly repetitive after awhile though so I suggest playing with breaks in between. Still worth every penny though. I also love how there are secrets on each level that make you try to discover where they are - some are not trivial and you will just feel great finding them.The game looks fantastic, has great atmosphere (settings, sound, music, expansiveness), so not only does it test your mind but you also feel immersed in to the game.Also the game is family friendly - no violence what so ever. I highly recommend this game.			"

												Qbeh-1 is an awesome labor of love from developers Liquid Flower. After playing the free original game on Desura, this ""prequel"" game goes above and beyond the scope of what came before. Boasting almost 10x the content including levels, mechanics, and music, Qbeh-1 is a must have for those who love puzzles in a laid back setting and serene atmosphere.I had the oppertunity to play this in beta form and seeing this launch on Steam makes me very happy. This game is for fans of Portal, Zelda (puzzles), a slight hint of Minecraft, and zen.			"

												I played the beta and I like this game. Music creates a very soothing atmosphere and visually it's really pretty to look at. Puzzles are easy at first and get trickier when you get further. The levels have checkpoints, but not around every corner so you won't continue right where you fell into nothingness, which I think is a good thing. Movement, jumping and overall sense of footing are done well. Solid work, thumbs up!			"

												Once a 4-level mod made as a puzzle platformer, Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube has gained a dash, a colon, and even a tagline.  The remarkable thing about this mod-to-game is how polished and professional the entire package looks.  Inspired by games like Portal and Minecraft, this game has carves itself a niche that makes it both familiar enough for players to try out, yet unique enough to keep players intrigued and interested.One of the strongest things Qbeh-1 has going for it is the simplistic gameplay.  It's very obviously inspired by early games, and eschews many of the trappings of modern gaming's superfluous complexities.  Because of this streamlined gameplay loop - find block, place block, move on - it allows the puzzle design to shine.  Rather than throw a substantial number of complicated puzzle mechanics at you, this game instead chooses to give you four basic concepts - building, powering, jumping, and traveling - and by combining them in various ways, can deliver challenges as simple as building a basic set of stairs to a complicated maze with no floor that must be travelled using synchronized floating paths, complete with a white-knuckled jump at the end after placing a power block near the end of the path.  Puzzles start as being simple - its a tutorial that doesn't feel like a tutorial at all, which is commendable - but build and combine in ways where you end up scaling a tower with only a handful of blocks and a deep sense of satisfaction when you reach the top.The art design is commendable.  One of the most interesting art projects I ever had was to draw a still life using a single color - brown, and two shades, one light brown, and one dark brown.  The point of the exercise was to force you to make your choices more meaningful, rather than rely on an explosion of various colors.  In a way, Qbeh-1 replicates this exercise.  Rather than rely on flashy explosions, the latest and greatest shader effects, models with tens of thousands of polygons, and other graphical gimmicks, it focuses on a narrow band of artistic effects, and then pulls it off with great success.  The colors - stark whites and greys accented with bursts of vibrant colors - not only are visually appeasing next to each other, but also contrast nicely with the amazing skies; some of the best I've yet seen in games.  I got distinct feelings of Mirror's Edge and how they used color to guide the player through the levels.  The color palette here is similar, and I think Qbeh-1 pulls it off better due to how uncluttered the worlds appear compared to Mirror's Edge.The sound and music design for Qbeh-1 is amazing, as it's simplicity not only fits the thematic elements perfectly, but because of the simplicity, it manages to achieve depth.  Rather than attempt to wow you with orchestral suites or generic dub-step wub-wubs, the music is airy, dreamy, and light.  It fits in perfectly not only with the levels - large buildings floating high in the atmosphere - but it also hits a sweet spot that so much of game music misses; it's unique enough to be noticed, but not catchy enough to become so immediately recognizable (much of World of Warcraft's music suffers from this) that it becomes quickly tedious.  It serves its purpose precisely - as ambient background sound to draw you in, but never to distract you.  It's almost childlike sound and instrument choices help to draw you into the exploration motif, and even still, some tracks have almost a dark feel to them, suggesting there may be more under the surface than what first seems to be the case.As someone who does level design, the design of the levels was something that impressed me immensely.  Visually, the levels were stunning - floating monolithic structures that combined the comforting feeling of symmetry along with enough asymmetry to still remain visually interesting.  Each world has its own theme, and the themes blend perfectly into the levels - icicles hang overhead in the winter levels, empty calcareous shells of molluscs lay in pools in the water levels, dead leaves lay in corners in the wind levels.  Because everything was uniformly scaled (and the borders on the cubes helped reinforce this), there was never a feeling of having to make ridiculous trick-jumps.  You immediately got the sense of what was possible and what was not, based on distance and the world's physics.  Rather than try to cheat the puzzles using tricky jumps or falls, the solutions felt fair, and ultimately felt rewarding by using your brain rather than trying to exploit the physics, jumping, or collision.The story and theme is something that I specifically wanted to touch on, as I had seen some posts about there not being a story or anything resembling it.  I'm not entirely sure that's the case, as there definitely feels like there's something going on below the surface.  I think it might be safer to say that rather than a storyline, I felt like there was some overarching theme to the game.Qbeh-1 feels like a dead world, in a lot of ways.  There is beauty here, but also sadness.  Presumably it was inhabited once - something or someone had to create those owl and elephant statues - but whoever it was is now gone.  The player feels like, as he is exploring, he is inadvertently bringing this world back to life through his actions, either by literally building with red cubes, or by powering up devices with blue cubes.  The notion of power - or the importance of it at least - is reinforced with the windmills and fans in Chapter 4.Something else that is striking is the feeling and sense of an entropic world.  An extremely basic (flawed, but works here) definition for entropy is the lack of order or structure - that in a closed system, energy flows out of organized and structured systems to leave them in a disordered and chaotic state.  Qbeh-1 really has an entropic feeling to it - the idea that the world is gradually falling into an entropic state of disarray.  Rooms are missing walls, floors, and ceilings, where blocks literally fall into the atmosphere.  Even in areas where walls and floors are straight, the occasional cube will be out of place - sticking out a few cm, or perhaps tilted just a few degrees; clearly done on purpose by the designer for effect.  Floors crumble beneath you as you walk on them.  Perhaps the fans and windmills were an effort to make sure energy remaining in the system, holding it together as best as it could.  And perhaps by our actions, and how we (in a way) organized the system, there is hope for this world after all.Qbeh-1, overall, is an amazing example of a non-typical game that easily surpasses much of what would be considered more mainstream games, by virtue of the fact that everything is does, it does really, really well.  Rather than be a jack-of-all-trades to attempt to appeal to everything while exceeding at nothing, Qbeh-1 excels at the simplistic gameplay that leads to complicated puzzles, stunning artistic theme, amazing music and sounds, and incredible level design that pulls all these elements together into a cohesive unit.  It's a peaceful game that alternates some degree of timing puzzles with the slow and methodical exploration that allows you to play at your own pace. For those who enjoy exploration, each level also contains a golden pyramid pickup which are usually hidden in fiendishly clever places.Developed using the Unity game engine, this is a game which is highly recommended, but I fear that it will slide under the radar for most gamers which I think is a tragedy.  It's a great example of the ability to marry the puzzle genre with a more  traditional first person genre, and still be successful without resorting to violence, being spoon fed a storyline, or the overly scripted gameplay which creates the illusion of cerebral choice, but actually offers none at all.  Rather this game celebrates choice, exploration, and emergent problem solving in an environment which nutures it.			"

												This game is made by liquid flower who can be found here http://qbeh-1.com/ . It seems to be their one and only game at the moment.I liken the experience of this game to going for a walk along the beach. Everytime i do i have to climb along all the rocks. Don't ask me why. I just do. It's not like i'm exploring new territory, or achieving parkor greatness, even though in my imagination I am. Eventually we play that game where you try and get your feet as close as possible to the waves of the sea without getting wet. Silly games, but they make the walk along the beach enjoyable.Qbeh-1 (pronounced cube negative one) is exactly like that, but in heaven. Why heaven has portal puzzles I'm not exactly sure? I guess it sure beats just playing the harp for eternity. Anyway as you go out and explore Minecraft heaven your imagination will start to tell you that you are achieving parkor greatness and thanks to the various magical cubes scattered around the place you probably are. On top of this you will eventually notice a game that the developers want you to play and that is don't touch the water (more about that later), but as you can see it's clearly the beach. Jump around the rocks and don't get your feet wet.Story? None. Zip. Completely void of story. Let me see. There are windmills and fans, and trees and fountains, and carpet and native american owl totems. We have no idea who you are other than the fact that you suddenly appear through a entry portal and your objective is to find the exit portal. Your journey is aided by various cubes which help you build, defy gravity, activate devices or simply tranport you. The game is divided up into 6 worlds, the 6th you will only unlock when you have found all the golden pyramids. There is 1 golden pyramid hidden in each level in which to find them you will basically need a phd in puzzle mechanics or at least a youtube walk through. Each world has 6 levels and the 6th level contains a unique portal cube which will transport you to the next world. Each world has a unique theme from summer, winter, autumn etc and sort of feels like its in homage to the old mario games. If you find all the pyramids including those in world 6, the secret ending hints that there are many more worlds to come. This could be true as the developers have been promising a level editor feature to the game, but alas they have been promising that for a while and since the developers hardly respond to any comments in the Steam forum anymore it stands to reason why many have become somewhat disheartened.Graphics are superb and the art and level design really makes this game for what it is. While the game doesn't ever reach levels of sheer brilliance, it does have the workings of becoming that if the developers really wanted it to. Personally I had some graphical issues with the trees in the game flickering black lines and there were a few places I found where I could trap myself in a block here and there or even make blocks disappear, but with these lingering teething issues aside, the graphics and game play in general was inspiring.The Music and Sound has its moments. All the tracks are fitting in some way, but some seemed slightly grating at times or not as relaxing as others did. There was one track in the game which was truly magical to listen to and would entice you to want to explore the place. The track i'm referencing is found in world 1 level 6 and interestingly is the same one they use in their preview for the game. While the ending feels somewhat lackluster and there is no story to be absorbed in here, and the level editor is somewhere in limbo, there is enough in interesting graphics and game play to give this a solid thumbs up. Various gamers have furthered amused themselves by entering a speedrun competition which you can only complete in if you download various speedrun mods. Again unfortunately another oversight of the developers not to include a timer in their game. Lastly it deserves a mention this 'don't get your feet wet achievement'. It seems to be only possible to achieve this if you complete the whole game in 1 sitting without touching the water, which basically requires you to never make a mistake. Needless to say with my two left feet and my absent minded ways coupled with my nervous twitching fingers, it's one I probably won't be getting in this lifetime.If your ever in need of a good jump around the rocks session. This is a good game to get.			"

												In this first person puzzle game, you find cubes that do different things to help you navigate the floating worlds. There are four different colors of cubes: red (structure - build structures), blue (energy - power doors and platforms), purple (gravity - decrease gravity), green (growth? - moving platforms). The cubes can only be attached to certain areas of the world (yellow anchor points).The gameplay isn't difficult, at least not initially. The first four worlds (there are six levels in each world) go by fairly quickly. The fifth world is a little more interesting as you have access to all the cubes and the designers mix up the puzzles appropriately. The sixth world, which feels like a bonus since it is accessed after the credits roll, is much more complex, yet still not difficult (in my opinon)However, the joy is spent trying to find the secrets. Every level has one, and finding where they are hidden is what (in my opinion) is the fun in the game. It can be frustrating to get a vantage point in a level and see the yellow pyramid way back in the level. You also learn to ""look"" at the architecture to determine where the ""best"" hiding places may be. In the initial levels the roof isn't very accessible, but the later levels - particularly world six - that accessibility restraint is still true but there may be one (maybe two ways) to get up there using the blocks you have or gathering some and backtracking. As I said, the game play isn't very difficult. It is a ""zen-like"" experience especially with the background music. The world is a lonely place, occupied by you alone. It does seem long for what it is and slightly underwhelming in retrospect.Difficult to recommend as there are other games that are more ""fun"" to play.			"

												If you love puzzles, and need something relaxing and laid back to play, this is your perfect choice. The atmosphere and the music of Qbeh-1 makes you want to keep playing; I've just spent about 5 hours on it without realizing what time was it, it was that fun. Some puzzles can take several retries, but I never got stressed because of it, that's the magic of the music and the ambientation of the game; level design is simply amazing. The price is just right, I'm enjoying every cent of it. I'm glad Liquid Flower released this polished prequel of Qbeh, their college project, and I hope they keep bringing up more awesome games like this.			"

												Qbeh is another puzzle platformer that is remarkably similar to Q.U.B.E. Both have the same cuboid environment, and both are FPS puzzle games that feel a little unfinished at the time of their release. Qbeh should have some sort of story, at least a symbolic abstract one, to accompany the gameplay. At the moment we don't even know if the player is human or not since there are no viewmodels. For reasons I don't fully understand, this game has hooked me in a way that most of the stuff I have bought recently has failed to do so and I recommend it for all fans of portal or Q.U.B.E. You will not be dissapointed (as long as you don't alt tab).			"

												Beautiful little gem, really feels like a new world instead of a puzzle game with puzzle levels... Even though it really is just that.The world is formed around blocky architecture with ""natural"" assets added to give it a more friendly and inviting environment. There's no story, dialogue, or text except for the main menu/chapter titles. Everything is presented in a manner that teaches the player what to do, instead of holding their hand/letting them walk around blindly.The best aspect about this game is the... everything. As I said, it has no story, but with what it has (instead of what it's missing); the level design, the atmosphere, the music, the sound design, the HUD, the graphics, it hits the right note on every one of these.I found myself smiling and feeling a sense of wonder and calmness throughout the levels, but it knows how to be a tad more serious/somewhat challenging at times as well.As I mentioned, the game is missing something that's keeping it from being even more. I could probably say that a story would improve the experience for me, but if it weren't done correctly, it may ruin the already wonderful experience it gives.For such a short game, I'm probably writing too much or more than such a simple game warrants, but I think everyone should consider playing this for its atmosphere and sound design. The water sounds really wet, the wind sounds really windy, and the cubes sound really cubey. Just play it for the experience, not for challenge or story.It made me happy.			"

												Probably one of the most atmospheric games I've ever played. Soundtrack fits pretty much perfectly with the world and its events. World looks mysterious and that leaves alot of space for speculations and theories. I really loved Portal & Portal 2, and this has some of the same aspects in the gameplay-wise, puzzles are getting progressively harder to solve, and you might even have to backtrack a bit in order to solve them, I played the original QBEH on desura, and I found it pretty enjoyable(for a student project). This although has some of the same levels, but enchanced, which makes it comfortable for me atleast. If you have played the original QBEH, and you are ready for another adventure with waAAaay more gameplay and tricks, you should definitely pick this up. I liked the climbing parts the most, maybe because I really like platformers alot. I know some people who can't stand platformers at all, but the game is reasonable fair and gives checkpoints in the beginning of a trickier platforming part, I found it really neat for myself even, since I happened to fall off a couple times in those parts. :CAnd the soundtrack was absolutely amazing aswell, I wouldn't have guessed that I would even pay attention to the soundtrack this much(I really don't pay attention to sounds that much in games), but this was pretty noticeable.Anyways, TL;DR:Very atmospherical game with a fitting soundtrack and clever puzzles, combined with fun and working game mechanics.

												Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube is a beautiful little atmospheric first person puzzle platformer. A good comparison game would be Q.U.B.E., both Qbeh-1 and Q.U.B.E. feature a very atmospheric world where the story is without narrative and open to interpretation. One of the most notable differences is that, unlike in QUBE which had some color puzzles and other such puzzles, Qbeh-1's puzzle mechanics, although varying, focus around different ways to move your character around a level. In this sense I found the game captured something of older platforming collect-a-thons, the levels themselves get rather large and many times you find yourself scaling a large tower...and add in the secret golden pyramid on each level and it really homes in on that collect-a-thon feel. This game also does a good job in encouraging you to explore, don't expect every piece of the puzzle to be out in the open for you to get your hands on, sometimes you need to look around and check the nooks and crannies to find what you need, something I wish other puzzle platformers did just a bit more.I really don't think there is much else to say, the gameplay is superb and the aesthetics really set a nice mood (the music is stellar!) I'm glad I bought this when I did and I'm glad I played it. I found the six hours playthrough to be satisfying, and despite having a huge backlog to get through, I am looking forward to continuing by finding the remaining golden pyramids and unlocking the bonus world. Highly recommend to puzzle platformer fans!			"

												Qbeh-1 is a beautiful, peaceful and hauntingly still game with a feeling of ancient isolation that washes over you like an ocean breeze. No harm can come to you here, and there is no rush to make anything happen. It is all a matter of enjoying yourself. The worlds of Qbeh-1 are like Myst ages for the retired archaeologist, like the planet Risa for the weary dungeon puzzler, like Robinson Crusoe with none of the threats to survival. You begin to get the sense that this place has been lived in many times before, but that it still has secret knowledge to reveal. This game is an escape and a release from the stress of other times and places. I go here to breathe.			"

												Surreal and engaging from the start, this is definitely my kind of game when I want something challenging; yet won't take me all day to progress. Qbeh-1 is certainly a puzzle game, but you are certainly not forced into a linear approach. There are often multiple approaches to resolve challenges. You can utilize hidden paths, strategic jumps, and a variety of cubes with different functions to tackle each task. And, particularly later in the game, you can be tempted into making decisions that could force you into a trap. But it's all part of the fun to learn what to do and what to avoid! The tougher challenges bring greater satisfaction when you eventually solve them.There are also secret tokens each level to find, although they are optional. Since I enjoy these secrets, I find that these extras force me to take each world with a holistic approach (figure out where a secret might be by considering the whole map), as well as an analytical one.The visuals, sounds, and music bring a fresh and even soothing atmosphere to the game. Yet there is also danger: Looking below you and seeing nothing but sky can tease more than a little vertigo. You must always watch your step! The controls are very simple and avoid complexity that can interfere with immersion into the game. And you build upon your acquired knowledge as you go. You learn solutions to common puzzles, and sometimes you gain inspiration to improve those solutions. And you truly feel you're learning when you are able to combine those solutions into an even greater one.I truly recommend this game to anyone. Even if puzzle games aren't normally your cup of tea, the relaxed pace, beautiful setting, and multiple approaches may just attract both the hardcore and casual gamers alike.			"

												Absolutely spellbinding, and the music soundtrack is so relaxing. There are no monster chases, nothing to kill, no time clock to beat -- it's just you and some great puzzles... The small worlds actually make it feel a bit like an exploration game.Another bonus is that a Level Editor was added so you can also create your own Qbeh-1 Worlds.SIDE NOTE: I've heard the game plays well in VR systems -- I'm not sure whether I would have the nerve to try it (some of those leaps in the game are pretty intimidating)... but I can imagine how breathtaking it must look in 3D.

												Bought this at 25% off regular price but this is well worth the sticker price of $9.99. The visuals are stunning and the puzzles are easy enough to keep most people interested but not so easy that you feel cheated. Of course the puzzles do get progressively more difficult but theres something satisfying about finally finding the solution. There doesn't really seem to be any kind of storyline or supporting characters so if thats what your seeking look elsewhere. However, with the tranquille almost trancelike quality of the sound track, you'll quickly forget about storylines.NOTE: I have not completed the game yet so if there is a storyline I appologise in advance to the devs and anyone reading this review.If you like first person puzzle games and don't mind a slower pace or lack of supporting characters/storyline then this is a great buy for you. I do think it could do with a world builder and maybe some kind of stat/ranking system but other than that I really like this game and recommend you play it.			"

10/10, one of my favorite gamesQbeh-1 is amzing. The developers sucessfully created an amazingly original premise for this puzzle game. You are provided with a total of 36 beautiful levels. If you find yourself hungry for more by the end, you can browse the workshop and download community made levels. There are 6 unique worlds with different atmospheres and coloring styles. You progress through each level by using the cubes scattered across the map. There are quite a few different types of cubes, each providing a specific function; anti-gravity, power, transportation, basic, etc.What really sells this game on me though is the beauty of each level. To be concise, the maps look like minecraft with shaders, without any lag. I definately recommend this game, although be sure to watch the videos and take a look at the screenshots to see for yourself.The ending on 5-6 is amazing "

												QBEH-1: The Atlas Cube is a first person puzzle platformer that takes you on a quest through a variety of divergent worlds, each filled with new mysteries and secrets to uncover.The basics behind the game are simple, tasking players with collecting cubes that can be used to build steps and platforms to reach a portal to the next level. There are a limited number of cubes in each level, and they can only be placed upon glowing segments of wall and floor tiles, making Qbeh-1 a challenging game that requires the player to think about their next steps and anticipate the eventual consequences.The music is soothing and pleasant.The graphics looks good so far, with vast blocky levels that stretch to the horizon, inventive level design and some great texture work that makes it easy to spot interactive elements and collectable objects.Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube is an interesting little block puzzle game which you should try out if you like first person puzzle games.Sounds 8/10Graphics 6/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Awesome first game for anyone who just got their Oculus. Very gripping gameplay. Its amazing something that would be so simple on a regular screen becomes quite challenging in VR. Some bits will drive you crazy as you will die often and have to start from the beginning, but these are good learning tools and eventually you will get it. jumping is a little unpredictable. Some You really have to guess your way through a level but i like that they dont prompt you. Its peaceful in there.			"

												Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube is an adventure that will relax your mind and has some food for thought at the same time. Briefly, this game is incredibly beautiful and astonishing with its music, landscape and puzzles. Well-hidden secrets will provide few more extra hours if you're an ""Achievement Hunter"" as I would say. Qbeh might not be everyone's cup of tea but certainly worth testing out.			"

												I'm only two worlds into the game but, well, there's already a laundry list of problems.First off, the game is barely a puzzle game. It tries to act like one, but a lot of the game is jumping, and a lot of the jumps are kind of terrifying, since you can barely make them, and a good number of them are over death pits where falling means back to the last checkpoint.That's the thing, what's up with the checkpointing? Why are there so few per level, why are they so far apart? It really makes no sense. You end up having to redo a lot of stuff if you die between checkpoints, and it's just... really tedious. Really unfun.The game also seems to want to make you explore to find secrets, but also punishes you for exploring by killing you a lot if you try to explore? It doesn't work out.The puzzle design itself feels really clunky; I'm rarely sure whether or not what I did was the intended solution or not because it feels so janky and off. Sometimes I feel like I'm breaking a puzzle and I actually am, other times I do a similar type of puzzle-breaking that turns out to be the right solution? It's so confusing.The game also has a major oversight where it tries to make you lose cubes by having indentations where you have to put a cube in, but a lot of the time you can stand on the ledge above it, go just far enough out, and grab the cube from inside the indentation, thus generally giving you an extra cube to work with. And I doubt this was intended, but, hey, it works.There was one puzzle where the solution was literally just a hidden passage that let you skip a door that would otherwise require a blue key block to open. So that's... something. Also, there's fall damage for some arbitrary reason. Another one of those anti-exploring things as it's never been relevant in a puzzle yet.The basic mechanic of this game, even, is just... kind of dumb. There's an arbitrary limit on how far away you can grab stuff, where it's too far to be ""realistic"" but too close to be ""useful"". It feels like an arbitrary limitation that only exists to make puzzles more tedious.Another arbitrary mechanic. It's really picky about where you can put blocks. You can't stack blocks down, at all, unless you have a deep enough angle under the blocks. Not just ""a bit below"" but ""standing under"". So sometimes you'll end up needing to stop what you're doing, go back down and put a block under another block, then come back up to continue onward, because of this completely pointless limitation.You also can't place blocks in a bridge in front of you, so yep, go back down, walk to the other side, stretch the bridge out... doesn't this sound tedious as heck? Believe me, it is.And even then... the game runs out of interesting things to do with its basic block building mechanic about one world in. Yet still continues to reuse the same slow building puzzles over and over, for... some reason or other, I really don't know.This is just two worlds' worth of experience and I highly doubt it's going to get better but I'm inevitably going to end up playing more so I'll update this later... I just, already had a lot I wanted to say and definitely wouldn't recommend this game based off what I've played. There's starting out on the wrong foot, and then there's not having a right foot to start with, period, and this game... seems to be the latter.World 3 update: The game introduces a low-gravity hi jump mechanic... that's horribly inconsistent and I can't figure out why jump height varies so much. Getting stuck on ledges also becomes a thing. The rest of the game is pretty much the same tedious schlock. I'm not sure I can keep playing much further, honestly, this game is just a special kind of unpleasant.			"

												It's hard for me to give it a negative review, I rather give it a mixed review, but given that it's already mostly positive so I decide to reveal its downside. Every puzzle game has two part: Thinking and execution, the former requires you to find out the solution, the latter requires you to act properly to reach the solution. Basically most puzzle games focus on thinking part, but this game heavily focus on execution, I don't think it should be called a PUZZLE game at all, its thinking part is too easy to be any challenge, while execution part is very tricky and may be frustrating. I seldom take more than 5 seconds to find out the solution, but when executing I get my hand all sweat, it requires you to jump, walking, act, PRECISELY. For example, jump across gaps, there are mass situation you need to jump just before falling to reach other side, or stand on a small cube, try to move 1mm to adjust position and avoid falling. And when you fall, you have to retry again entire section from checkpoint. Dull, tiresome, sometime annoying is my game experience.I love puzzle games that give me brainstorm experience, enjoy the process of thinking around, I thought this one will provide that kind experience too, unfortunately I'm wrong. I familiar with first-person games so in fact this game doesn't trouble me a lot, I'm just not really into EXECUTION game like this.But don't misunderstand me, it's not really a bad game. It has unique artwork and beautifully soft music, these two are strong point of this game, many player enjoy this game, but if you are seeking a game make you ponder a lot, think over and over, then this game will not meet your expectation, if you sucks in first-person movement, then you will definitely hate this game.

This is really awesome stuff to hear hope they keep up the awesome work.Nice, Clear, Beautiful Puzzle Game. Gameplay was solid and so were the puzzles. Story was a mistery the whole way through but the art style and the gameplay made up for that! I give this game a ""Yes"" for anyone looking for a single player adventure!Thanks Liquid Flower!

												Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube is a minimalistic first person puzzle game. There's not really a story per say, but you ultimately progress to power up the Atlas which I think creates more worlds. I'm always a sucker for first person puzzle games and even though there are a lot better games out there, this one is still pretty satisfying. I would say the majority of puzzles are moderate difficulty, but finding all the tokens is extremely difficult. There isn't a whole lot of handholding in this one either so you pretty much have to figure it out as you go.They've also added a level editor since I've played it so that's a bonus.			"

												One of the best games I've played in a while. I love this game. It is a Portal like game, but without portals. You are the only being in this mysterious world, and your objective is to get to the exit in each room. Now, after beating the first world, I realized I only picked up one pyramid. I went back to level 1 to start finding the other 5 in the first world, and I have to say, they are really tricky to get to. They are usually in a hidden room that you won't normally see. Now those made the game for me!The game is good at leading you in the right direction, except for the pyramids, those are a lot harder to find. But to simply get to the exit, you can usually just follow the paths and do the jump puzzles.Basically, you pick up these red blocks and use them to get to places. You can climb them, walk across them, create stairs, whatever you need, as long as you have enough. There are climbing puzzles where there is a huge wall, and you have to somehow climb up to the edge. I love the graphics, I love the music, I love the atmosphere, I love the Portal like world. You are the only being, and you are trying to simply get to the end of each level. When I say these graphics are better than COD, I mean it. I know that's a joke that goes around, but I was shocked to see these graphics on Very High with MSAA turned on. Advanced Warfare was a million dollar game and doesn't look as good as this. Great job guys! One of the best indie games I've played in a long time.			"

												Qbeh-1 is a good platformer. It's not bad, it's not terrible and it's certainly not amazing or astounding. It's just plain good and if you ask me - which you should since you're reading this - is something rather rare these days. People always want to make the next best blockbuster that blows everyone's minds and generates billions of dollars and whatnot. Which, granted, is fine, I get that...but Qbeh feels a lot more humble and I like that. The atmosphere is created through level and audio design combined with a good colour palette, resulting in a solid foundation for a game. It's serene and calm in the strange world of Qbeh. The slow and relaxed melodies combined with desolate but beautiful visuals gives a nice, pacifying feeling to the player. Playing this game relieves stress, well, personally speaking anyway, and I find that to a really nice and rare quality.I highly recommend it. Not because of any action - there is none to be found. Not because of any electric guitar shredding - you're in the wrong neighborhood for that. Qbeh is a game of peace, exploration and a little brain work. When you're bored of blowing everybody up with explosives, riddling them with a hail of bullets or slashing zombies to bits, play this. It helps.			"

												With the level editor FINALLY being implemented after so long, I can definitely recommend this game.Even with the base content, it's definitely worth the $9.99 USD price tag. There are a total of 36 levels spread out around 6 'worlds', each with their own theme such as spring, winter, fall, summer, etc. Each level has a secret, which is a golden triangle, and if you manage to find all of them in worlds 1-5, world 6 will then unlock. In addition, there are a few extra secrets for achievements as well.The gameplay is typical of puzzlers, starting out easy and getting progressively harder. However, it is also VERY fun, with four (technically five, but the fifth is a portal key to unlock the next world only found in the last level for each world) block types. The red cube, which is a structure block. The blue cube, which is a power block. The purple cube, which is a cube that reduces gravity in a certain range. And the green cube, which is a motor device that deteriorates after a certain distance. Typically, each world introduces a new block type, making the levels and designs more and more complex and challenging. Expect to fall out of the world to your death many times, this can be a very challenging puzzler.The sounds and music are also superb. Each level has its own special music track, each as equally entrancing as the last. The musical score for this game is honestly amazing, and they also have the soundtrack available for purchase, which I will provide the link to (https://launchablesocks.bandcamp.com/album/qbeh-1-ost).I can't leave out the graphics. For as simple as this game is, the visuals are honestly breathtaking. Lighting and shadowing are definitely the biggest strong points of this game graphically, and they never disappoint. Everything from the soft lighting on the blocks, the varying skyboxes, the flowing trees, and the glistening water all look the very best. If you're a sucker for that kind of thing, you might find yourself like I was, anticipating the next levels to see what lighting and graphics tricks they would apply next.The only thing that's really any kind of drawback is the lack of a story whatsoever. There isn't necessarily an obvious point to the puzzling madness, but imo it's nothing major. It isn't what the selling point is anyway in any case.Amazing game, definitely a must-buy for puzzle fans, particularly if it's ever on sale, and I'm very excited to play and build community levels.

												I've got to say, I rarely write reviews for anything, but I think that in this case, I just have to. So let's get started! A quick intro Qbeh-1 is a prequel to game Qbeh (which you can download via Desura). Qbeh was a student project, practically a demo containing 6 levels. This '-1' (minus one) standing next to Qbeh tells that this is a prequel. So, getting back to Qbeh-1: This is a  first person perspective non-violent exploration puzzle platformer game.  You will meet several game genres here.   What you can expect The game contains 5 (or maybe 6? I won't spoil it) worlds, each with 6 levels. It's an exploration game, so you will not be told practically anything except key bindings (in options).a) Your goalYour goal is simple: find the portal to the next level. Simple but difficult.b) EnvironmentAs you probably saw in the trailers, Qbeh-1 is inspired by Minecraft -  almost everything is made of cubes.  In every level, you will be placed in... well, locations floating somewhere high in the sky. The sky is above you and below you. On your way, you will encounter several kinds of cubes you can pick up, each one with a unique ability.c) No violenceFor some it's an advantage, for some it's a disadvantage. The only dangers you face is falling, being crushed by a door and touching poison.d) SoundtrackSoundtrack of Qbeh-1 is what makes the game incredible. It's ambient, atmospheric, soothing, relaxing... Each level has different soundtrack, and every song creates a different climate. You will definetly like it.e) PaceThe game is rather slow-paced, but if you don't like it, in one of the worlds you will encounter fans, transporting you at high speeds.f) GameplayI forgot to mention about this at the beginning of my review, sorry ;) As I said before, you can pick up special cubes (several kinds) you can then place on special surfaces or other cubes. The game gives you the freedom of building, so there are always several ways to solve each puzzle. On each level, you can also find a Secret Token, and if you collect them all, you will unlock something special.  Overall Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube is a relaxing game, you can have a break from reality. You will have to jump, think, explore and have good eyesight.It's now on sale, so I fully recommend you to buy it.  Buy, and you will not regret. Thank you for reading :)			"

												This game is like the love child of either one of the Portal games and any 3-D platformer, and it is fantastic! The soundtrack for the game is amazing and each level has its own song that makes it unique.  Keep in mind that this game is not meant for those who want something to completely penetrate their mind and make their heads bleed from various places.  The puzzles in this game are very casual and are meant to be played a little at a time, take it slow and enjoy each level for its music and its individual challenge.This game deserves a solid 10/10 because it is truly great!

												Qbeh is a first person puzzle game where the player must progress through a series of temple style structures that are built out of cubes, and are floating amongst the clouds. I really enjoyed playing Qbeh. Its a shame that it didn't get a lot of media attention, and consequently I guess not many people have played it, because I think its much better than certain other games that gained a lot more hype *cough*thewitness*cough*.The main objective of each level is simply to enter the portal to travel to the next level. The problem is, each level is filled with ledges that are too high to climb, and gaps in the floor that are too long to jump across. Fortunately, scattered around each level are coloured blocks that you can collect and place in specific locations to help you reach your goal. Each type of block is useful in different ways. Red blocks just exist to stand on, blues can unlock doors and power moving platforms, purples create a field of low gravity and greens can move either horizontally or vertically but disappear after a few seconds.The level design is really intelligent, especially later in the game, when you're using multiple different blocks together, and you encounter additional hazards, such as fans that can push you off a ledge, and a black ooze covering the walls and floor that kills you instantly if you touch it. Many areas feel like they've got multiple solutions. Every level also has a glowing prism hidden away in a secret location. Finding these usually requires thorough exploration, and creative block usage. But they also give you that really satisfying ""I am the smartest person in the world"" feeling.I've finished all the main levels and found half the secrets, in just under 9 hours. There are a few more bonus levels but they're unlocked by finding all the secrets, which is something that only the most dedicated players will do. I didn't encounter any bugs or crashes and the controls are fully rebindable. I also have to say the music is great, and it creates a relaxing, chilled out mood.The only real negative I can mention is the lack of a story tying all the levels together. It kind of feels like we're exploring the ruins of a dead civilisation, so it would have been cool to know more.If you enjoy first person puzzle games such as Portal, Talos Principle or Qube, I highly recommend Qbeh. I'd say its worth a full price purchase, but at least give it a try on a sale.			"

												This is an excellent game. It looks fantastic; the levels reward exploration and there are plenty of good puzzles.The best levels are great. Sometimes a level feels a little contrived rather than having a smooth organic feel to play through - they are still a lot of fun and I think this can be forgiven in an indie developer who is learning their trade.Overall - I'd definitely recommend the game :)			"

												This game is a treasure. Call it puzzle, call it explore.. it makes you feel like being placed in a mysterious yet beautiful and intriguing world. It is so simple but facinating. The soundtrack is soothing, calming, sometimes strange.. it creates the mood of the world you find yourself in. Check it out for free! http://launchablesocks.bandcamp.com/album/you-and-the-viewI had no technical issues, neither can I complain about the game being unfair or too hard. It just right for some relaxing late night gaming hours.Gameplay: 10/10Graphics: 8/10Sound: 10/1030th of June: 51 positive reviews and 1 negative. Your call.			"

												I'm reminded of that lesson from the YouTube series Extra Credits - Mechanics are more important than content. You may have some good ideas, and this game certainly does (enough to at least recommend it), but it's spread so thin that a lot of it becomes tedious, especially around the middle. Still, it has a pleasant aesthetic and smooth frame rate, the gameplay is functional enough that the first-person platforming doesn't become too frustrating, and the mechanics are interesting even if they outstay their welcome sometimes.IMPORTANT: Turn vsync on. The puzzles involving the green cubes are impossible with it turned off. You'll see.			"

												This is an interesting game, the levels have a decent amount of replay value especially if you are someone that likes to 100% games, the level editor is quite fun but can be difficult to use. The community does not have many level at the moment so you can get all to many new maps after you have finished the main game.I would definitely recommend this game, it's got clever puzzles that are not all to difficult at the beginning but begin to become increasingly difficult. Overall this game is definitely worth a purchase if you like puzzle games but if you don't i would recommend getting it from a sale.			"

												This game is incredibly fun and does a great job teaching the player new skills while jumping from cube to cube over thin air! It will make a skilled jumper out of even the most unlikely of players ... like me. With the addition of the level editor, it is my favorite game on Steam. The achievements add lots of replayability, and the atmospheric levels are beautiful. The game hints at a story, which is enough to enjoy it thoroughly. Definitely a fun game to play over and over and over ... and then build so you can play some more!			"

The puzzles are sometimes challenging but mostly good to slove. A few jump passages can be a little nerve-racking. I can say that this game is freakin' awesome in my opinion.Leveleditor-update: I am very disapointed of the editor because my Level had a production time of about a week. The editor doesnt let me publish it. It only says: ""k_EResultFileNotFound"". Not very satisfying. :(			"

Posted: September 9, 2014
												I fully recommend Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube - it's been a long time since I've been that obsessed with carrying on in a game.""First person 3D platform discovery puzzler"" is how I'd sum up the game category. As such, the game is to some extent comparable to Antichamber and Portal, both of which I have been playing in recent months. There is even a reference to Portal hidden in one of the Qbeh-1 levels.Despite Portal and Antichamber having more innovative game principles, of the three I enjoyed Qbeh-1 most.As I see it, the beauty of Qbeh-1 stems from the level design, the atmosphere and ambience. It has the feel of discovering abandoned places of ancient cultures, with some left-over machinery such as doors to be opened with switch mechanisms, cube elevators and fans (ventilators). The background music perfectly enhances the visual impressions and the ""exploration"" feeling. It will change at some points within levels, for example upon entering impressive, awe-inspiring halls.Qbeh-1 is linear in the sense that there is one level after another, each a place of its own, with its own theme, and separate from other levels.What may seem odd at first, but really adds a lot to the atmosphere, is the fact that each individual level is located mid-air, sort of ""in the clouds"". You will often find yourself balancing on the brink of ""abyss"", and falling down is the main danger to be faced in many levels of the game. Due to cleverly placed checkpoints the game never feels frustrating. Many of the places feel like ruins, some of them crumbling under your feet.Discovery is one of the main joys in the game: There are several surprises to be found within the levels, and finding special items hidden within the levels is part of what's needed to beat the game. So looking around closely to find non-obvious paths to progress on is essential in Qbeh-1. Often you'll find yourself ""outdoors"", or peeking outside hallways and halls, getting the tease of seeing parts of levels you want to progress to, and not knowing yet how to get there.Your basic interaction with the world around you consists of running around and jumping, similar to most first person 3D games. Most other interactions are done by collecting cubes - there are different types scattered in the levels - and applying them in certain locations within the levels, sometimes to activate switches, sometimes to build bridges or to provide other means of getting to some place that would be unreachable without cubes. These ""cube application puzzles"" will rarely be intellectual challenges to spend hours on. However, there are often different ways of applying the cubes - it is a creative task with non-obvious solutions and surprising new paths.Usually you have all the time in the world within the levels. There are only a few locations and challenges within the levels, such as elevator cubes and fans, where accurately timed jumps and cube placings are essential.It feels really rewarding to reach parts of levels previously unreachable, often seeing levels from completely new angles, and often climbing incredible heights - face your vertigo!

												Upon writing this review, I've only been playing the game for about an hour - already, I simply adore it. The incredible serenity of the game is enough to make me feel entirely content just walking around and experiencing the beautifully calming atmosphere and music - and if there're two things I absolutely love in games like this, it's well-established atmosphere and music.The texturing in Qbeh-1 is really lovely too. I'm genuinely impressed with the simplicity of the surroundings, yet also with how intriguing and gorgeous they are. One thing I would especially love to mention is the wonderful view you receive from these mysterious skybound islands when you look out off a clear edge and observe the skyline, clouds, and seemingly distant world below. On top of that, the gameplay is absolutely lovely, and the controls are solid and pleasant to use. I recommend this game to anyone who digs Indie titles with serene atmospheres, beautiful soundtracks, and peaceful - yet relatively simplistic - puzzles.... Did I mention that the music is absolutely gorgeous?~			"

												Wow, just wow. Let’s get started.I – Story [10/10]Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube is a first-person puzzle platformer from Liquid Flower. There is no real story in this game, nothing. Somehow though, you feel compelled to keep going, as if you just know there’s something greater going on behind the scenes. It’s a difficult thing to explain to someone who hasn’t experienced it first hand. The atmosphere is just amazing. I’ve never seen a game do something like this with so little. You really have to play it to understand what I’m saying.II – UI [10/10]The user interface is incredibly simple. Menus are bare-bones and well done. The HUD is very minimal to allow for a more complete sense of immersion. By way of HUD, you have a small dot reticle and some fading tabs that show you how many of each type of cube you currently have. Most of the time, you won’t even notice that it’s there.III – Gameplay [9/10]Playing Q1:TAC is an amazingly relaxing experience. Going into it, I had no idea what to expect beyond I was going to be solving puzzles. It’s so much more than that though in it’s entirety. The gameplay itself is as basic as can be. You can move around, move around slower, you can look at things, you can jump, and you can collect and place cubes in certain areas of the world. That’s all there is to it.The puzzles are brilliant. There was a never a puzzle that I encountered that seemed impossibly hard. Some required more though and experimentation than others, but I was never overly frustrated by something. The only real problem that I had with Q1:TAC was the sparsely placed (and sometimes not very helpful) checkpoint locations. It didn’t detract from the game in the least, but it made things a bit tedious at times if mistakes were made.IV – Content [9/10]Rarely have I ever played a game with such a small amount of content that felt so very full. There are five types of cubes you can pick up and use in total and that’s it. (There are some secrets that you can find by exploring the levels, but you can’t do anything with those after you find them.) I would have liked to have seen a few more types of cubes, but it’s no big deal.V – Visual [10/10]Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube is a beautiful game. Merely rushing through it, trying to complete it as fast as possible is a disservice to yourself. Take the time to wander and enjoy all the beauty that the world of Q1:TAC has to offer. The environment is absolutely stunning (especially when it is coupled with the superb soundtrack). VI – Audio [10/10]If you ever play a game that has a soundtrack that syncs up with it more perfectly than Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube I demand that you notify me immediately. The music was, without a doubt, the best part of the entire game. You may have come here to solve puzzles and not to feel, but I will be damned if you make it out of this game without getting on the feels train at least once. Bravo to Launchable Socks to one of the best soundtracks I’ve ever heard (or felt) in a game.VII – Overall [9.7/10]Overall, Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube is more of a blissful, reflective experience than a game, and it is sheer brilliance. If you’re a fan of Portal, you’ll be into this. On sale or not, this one is worth every penny.			"

												For me, this game is an interesting mix of Voxel blocks with puzzle elements and different mechanics designed into 6 tranquil, serene but playful environments that make for a relaxing yet still challenging Puzzle Platformer that made me think.The variety of mechanics and gameplay excels, and while there are some barely noticeable mistakes, all of the levels are well designed and approach diverges often. I had great fun in one world where one level was about solving different sections by connecting rooms together and using floating platforms, the next was the simple fun of jumping from level to level around the outside of a tower and the next involved conserving cubes and placing them in just the right order.HighlightsThings that stand out about Qbeh-1 include the stellar serenity of the levels. The lighting in particular is well designed, and has clearly had more time spent on it than most games. The backdrops to worlds are beautiful and little floating trees, fountains and foliage mesh with the clouds and light to make it nice just to look around. When combined with a calm and mildly uplifting soundtrack, the worlds become very relaxing and sombre from the outside.As already stated, the other important stand out factor of Qbeh-1 is the varying approach to levels, and most worlds introduce a new mechanic or two, a new cube or a new approach to gameplay. It keeps you thinking in different ways and makes it a better experience overall.* The secret items are placed pretty well and most require you to think outside the box. They're a fun optional extra.Mistakes & AnnoyancesThere are some small annoyances on this title, but absolutely nothing that takes away from the gameplay or stands out. Things I came across are listed here purely for the sake of complete review.* Placing cubes around edges is slow, fiddly and frustrating. Due to the nature of gameplay a ""hold"" button (like in Minecraft) wouldn't have worked, but some effort towards making placement around edges easier would've been simple and made these far less fidgety.* The title screen is somewhat lacking and mediocre. The World Selection menu in particular is simply frustrating and forces you to spin overly responsive cubes to find the world you want each time.* The game will actively remove your cubes if it doesn't correspond to the amount it thinks you should have for a section if you die or reload a checkpoint, which is very annoying.RecommendationsQbeh-1 is priced at £6.99/8.99€/$9.99 at the time of review, and with 6 slow-paced levels on each of 6 worlds for a total of 36 realms, play time clocks in at a minimum of  7 hours, and completionists and collectors can expect more trying to find all the Pyramids. Overall Qbeh is fairly priced and has reached as low as -90% in sales, which is an absolute steal for what is quite clearly an underrated puzzle game.* The blissful soundtrack is by Launching Socks and you can listen to a number of their tracks free on their Soundcloud[soundcloud.com]*Qbeh-1 is actually the pre-sequel to the original title Qbeh, which is still available to play for free on Desura[www.desura.com] and offers 30 minutes+ of very similar gameplay* An impressive set of Minecraft maps with a similar theme is being created, called Qbeh-1 A Crafters Cube[www.minecraftforum.net] "

												This game took my breath away, when I played the demo on Desura, I was impressed, fast forwad a few years later and I  discover the full game and I immediately had to get it. Unlike any other puzzle game I've played, I never found myself getting frustrated with puzzle solving, and the music and scenery are too beautiful for me to put into words. This is possibly my favorite game as of now.			"

												I found it to be fun overall, but a little monotonous at times. Most puzzles have multiple ways of doing them, so it's sort of up to your imagination and creativity, which I like.The difficulty scales fairly well and never gets too hard. My biggest complaint about this game is not being able to save where you want because the save spots are horrible for the most part. Also, there are puzzles that you don't know what to do until you get there and then you have to start over, etc until you get to the end.... mainly one in particular in the last cube world. Trial and error should not be part of a puzzle. Granted, some would argue that you could do it first time, but you have to be quick and accurate that first time through.Anyway, it's no award winning game, but is worth it on sale.			"

												Voxel, parkour, puzzle game. Probably the only linear game you wood like, with the nice soft textures, beautiful skylines, and rhythmic ambient music, you can stare at or listen to for hours. The music will change, depending on the ambience of the setting. With the gameplay going between easy, medium, hard and back, throughout the adventure.I loved this game. Wish it didn't end. Worth $5 - $20 depending on your taste. 5 Stars for me. 3 or 4 for others.			"

												Highly recommend this intuitive platform-puzzler with a great variety in difficulty. Relaxing and stimulating soundtrack coupled with beautiful graphics. Has a linear solution, but is open for some creative platforming which makes it even more fun to try out each course again. Very few bugs and glitches makes this a well polished game, despite it's rather fresh state. If you are a fan of 3D platformers or puzzle games where you have to check your surroundings carefully, check this game out!			"

												Like exploration ? like puzzles ? like platforms ?Well, then, trust me, you'll enjoy this game.The environment is beautiful, the music is remaxing, the controls are very good.Once we've said that, we already know we have a good game. Now, let's focus on contents.Each world (there are five, containing 6 levels each) introduces a new cube with new abilities (red will stack with others, blue will activate switches ...). Basics are easy to pick up, mastering them might be a bit harder, but anyway the cdifficulty curve is pretty smooth.Finishing the levels are more about puzzles and platform skills, but in each level there is an extra to find and to reach (reaching it can sometimes be pretty easy, but finding it can be difficult, even frustrating sometime). Well, that's the exploration part, and is is optional, so it's fine.Some levels can be pretty long, but they all have a few checkpoints (despite that, in some levels, death can be quite the punishment).All in all, that's a great game that I recommend. For me, its only weak point would be that it takes a little time to charge a level, but it won't stop you from having hours of fun playing this game. "

												Simplistic First Person platforming puzzle game.I bought this game on a whim, and I have no regrets. If you're interested in games like Portal or Trine, this game is for you. You'll be able to adapt to every situation after a quick analysis of what's laid out on the table. Puzzles do not jump quickly in difficulty, they scale extremely well as you progress.The game presents a very calming atmosphere that will keep your mind at ease as you build your path to success.If you're feeling up for a challenge, there are hidden pyramids in each level that will give completionists a very satisfying feeling.After completing the game, feel free to take a look at the Steam Workshop, as it has quite the active community.Please give this beautiful game your time.

												This game has really good soundtracks relaxing. Also no clock to beat. The levels are incredibly made and the graphics are beautiful so the player can see awesome things from heights and etc.. Addicting game. It's good to teach players new skills with low difficulty and then increasing it with more rewards (beautiful views, etc.). It has an interesting game concept and a really good atmosphere. Also the level editor is also fun if the player gets a bit bored and want to make his/her levels and create a beautiful map teaching a new mechanic to the game and after that publishing it.Try first the demo and then choose if you want to buy it or not. I recommend buying the game.The developers are also really positive and friendly so no worries if you need something :)			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a First person Puzzle game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou are able to make your own level.You are able to make multiple profiles for more then 1 user.There are many resolution sizes.You are able to play this game in fullscreen or windowed mode.You are able to change the quality between Low and Very High.You can change the volume of the Master Volume with a slidebar ( It shows the % )You can change the volume of the Music Volume with a slidebar (it shows the %)There is a sensitivty slidebarYou are able to use a Xbox controller.About the game.You are on a level trying to find ""Red"" Cubes in order to make a safe passage and reach the exit. You are able to place them in top of each other or on the Dark yellow blocks. You do need to take those blocks with you in order to complete the level. There are some checkpoints, so if you do die by falling off you are able to respawn here. However the checkpoint will only safe the progress that u have done already, Not after the checkpoint. What i do not understand is that you can't place those blocks below you. There has to be one cube connected to the Dark yellow block in order to make a Passage and you can't cut this away or else all blocks will transfer back into your pocket.You are able to kill yourself by pressing a button and then hold that button.You can't crouch but you can jump. Game REQUIRES alot of Jumping.Puzzles are not too easy.There is no Music in this game but there is a nice calming background soundtrack.The game is very Athmospheric and it looks very good.Graphics are good.You are able to change your controls on the keyboard and xbox controller.Other things.There are Collectables, but they are not really fun to collect. The level on level selection will show Yellow, Once you have found them all in the level.Running doesn't feel like Running.The puzzles requires some thinking and if you can't do that, then im afraid the game isn't for you.Best way to hear those collectables is turning off the music. The collectables are making some noise when you are near them.You will lose the collectable if you have died and didnt found a checkpoint. So in order to keep it, you need to find a checkpoint so you can save that current progress.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

												I really tried hard to like this game.  I love Portal and The Swapper and tons of other puzzle games, but ultimately this game failed me because the platforming elements vastly overwhelmed the puzzle elements.  I would say that this game is 90+% dexterity, which is way too high for an ostensible puzzle game.  Much of the dexterity consists of precise jumps, which, if you fail, mean you have to restart at the previous checkpoint.  You can't save the game just before a jump; the checkpoints are fixed, and very far between, so missing a jump means redoing a big chunk of the game, which gets really boring really fast.  Also, when you have made a structure out of blocks and are standing on it, very often you have to add a block right next to the block you are standing on, which requires extremely precise control or you will fall off the structure, requiring you to start over, which is just bad game design.  The puzzles (such as they are) are usually pretty trivial; most of the time if you can't solve one it's because you didn't see some place where a cube could go.  Finally, the game is just plain monotonous, and finishing a level feels like a chore.  The graphics are gorgeous and the music is nice and serene (though I ended up turning it off anyway), but the flaws in this game make it not worth your time.  This isn't a Zen-like game at all; it just looks like one.  It's actually aggravating and frustrating.  Perhaps if you consider walking on a tightrope over a canyon to be Zen-like, you will like this game.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.			"

												Great puzzle game, and not too hard, not too easy. The scenery is beautiful and the soundtrack completes the atmosphere of the game. The difficulty and even size of each level increase gradually as the player progresses through the levels and worlds.The levels are occasionally tricky to navigate, plus they're airborne, so falling off is definitely not recommended, and to add to the challenge there are no maps or compasses, though they are not labyrinths, outright. There are very rarely alternate paths whose dead ends you cannot see from the beginning, so the correct way forward isn't hard to find, or create. You only have to take detours to find hidden rooms and crevices containing items you may need to continue.I wish the game was longer. Absolutely recommended.			"

Randomly placed doors that don't require anything in particular to be opened are also suprisingly annoying for something so insignificant. Play mirror's edge for the parkour. Play Infinifactory or the Talos Principle for the puzzle aspect (or Portal if you haven't).			"

Posted: June 5, 2016
												The negative review that came up first for me on this page is so misguided that I feel obligated to counter with a review of my own, which will be my first ever. First of all, there are no broken or unintended mechanics involved with grabbing cubes at weird angles, that's all part of the game. In fact, the game is remarkably free of such things. With hundreds of hours of game time, the only glitches I’m aware of all involve a specific series of steps that has to be taken to enable the glitch, none of which have ever happened to me accidentally during gameplay. The game is stable, extremely well thought-out, and the only complaint that rings remotely true is the one about the checkpoint/save system, which is indeed sometimes frustrating, but not nearly as much as what I’ve encountered in other games - this is a minor nuisance we’re talking about, not a deal-breaker.  Qbeh-1 is one of my all-time favorite games, continually teasing you onward with gorgeous vistas and mysterious ruins and strange enigmatic machines... It‘s a pleasing blend of puzzle-solving and exploration, that introduces new gameplay elements at a perfect pace. There are new kinds of cubes to be found in each of 5 worlds, each containing many levels, and then, when you think you’ve finally mastered the game and reached the end, you’re given a highly motivating reason to go back and do it all over again, this time with an emphasis more on exploration. And when the final world’s final secret is unlocked and the game truly completed, there are now many new Workshop community levels that can be played, greatly enhancing re-playability.I admit I do like FP puzzle games quite a bit, but that doesn’t quite explain why I love this game so much. It’s really a hard question to answer, but I think it comes down to two things that make Qbeh-1 a standout even amongst similar games: immersive-ness and aesthetics. The first is a bit inexplicable, since the game has no real story to speak of, nonetheless you are totally THERE, completely immersed, in the moment, eager to explore the world and get to the next magnificent vista... Which brings us to the second thing, the aesthetics: the visuals are just spectacular. I can’t think of another game in which I spent so much time just staring at the sheer beauty of my surroundings. I found myself constantly stopping to take screenshots, in the manner of a tourist in an exotic land who stops to take photos - I couldn’t help myself. There’s such a strong sense of atmosphere to many of the locations, such ethereal beauty, enhanced by a haunting, often plaintive soundtrack that creates a perfect musical ambience that’s barely noticed because it fits in so well, but which will haunt you once it’s gone. The game gets all this stuff right, in fact I have referred to it as a playable work of art, which it unquestionably is. If that doesn’t sound appealing to you, then maybe the game isn’t meant for you. But for those who live their lives always needing to find out what’s at the end of that lonely path through the wilderness, who can’t help but explore an ancient ruin, this is for you. I’m guessing this is as close as a game can get to pure poetry, and I’m actually not one for poetry, usually. If you like the awesome, the mysterious, the unknown, try this. It’s not expensive at all, and you may be surprised at how much you will like it and return to it. And don’t get me wrong, the puzzle aspect is strong, there are some real challenges here for those who just like puzzles. I really can’t say enough about this game, it’s a genuine hidden gem. At the price, I can almost guarantee you’ll find it money well spent, and if it‘s on sale, why the heck wouldn’t you? Highly recommended, for those who are in the intended audience for this kind of thing, and even for those who aren't. Check it out.			"

												This game is a puzzle game where you have to strategically place different blocks (that do different things) in order to move forward, progress in the game and go to the next level.  Thus far, there is no story to the game, just the puzzles.   I am currently on World 2, Level 1 with a little over four hours of game play.  I may edit my review once I have completed the game but wanted to get a review of encouragement out there for those of you who may be contemplating buying it.To give you a benchmark, there are a couple of similar games that come to mind:  Portal (which I did not like) and Talos Principle (that I loved, though it had a rather complex story line to go with it).I wasn't sure I was going to like it because a number of the (mostly negative) reviews talked about the platforming aspect.  I like some platforming games but admit I've quit a couple because I got too frustrated with constantly falling and/or dying.  Not so with this game.  For me, it's been easier using the mouse and keyboard than the game controller.  The best way to do the jumps, in my experience, is not to ""look down"" at the jump, but rather straight ahead.Very challenging puzzles, but not insurmountable.  I am enjoying the challenge. "

												GUYSGUYSI JUST GLITCHED IN LEVEL 4-1I'M IN A PERMANENT LOW-GRAVITY EFFECT WITHOUT BEING IN A LOW-GRAVITY CUBE ZONEI CAN GO ALMOST ANYWHERE NOWTHIS FEELING OF FREEDOMAhem. In all seriousness, while I've only gotten to level 4-1, I must say I'm really quite impressed with the atmosphere. One level in particular stood out for me: 2-3, Monolith. The fog combined with the music gave me chills the entire time.I should note, though, that the level design hasn't been playtested thoroughly. So far in every level except 2-3 (and to some extent 3-6) I have managed to somehow get myself outside the area that the player is intended to play within, all using only the mechanics provided to me. Backtracking once I have more cubes often allows me to climb out the top of the ""expressive"" area that I am meant to play in, and out into the areas with flat, featureless exteriors. On 2-2, you can even see pieces of models sticking up out of the roof you're standing on, icicles and snow hanging in midair because the rest of it is being used as interior decoration. That said, this is still a really good game, possibly BECAUSE it gives you the freedom to do such things.In short, I love this game despite its quirks, because those quirks just expand what the player can accomplish.

												QBeh-1 is an atmospheric 1st person puzzle based on simplicity and elegant looks: it’s a relaxing experience that it should be taken note by everyone who enjoyed games like Portal, Antichamber or Q.U.B.E. It is very similar with those mentioned titles but it maintains its own personality too. Mainly, it is an exploration game that is taking place in four distinct worlds, all of them created by cubes. Each world contains six stages: you have to navigate into tricky mazes and thus finding the final door that leads to the next stage. The primary game mechanic has to do with obtaining and managing the special cubes that lay sparsely on the map. There 3 or 4 types of different colored cubes : the most common type is the orange one, which is used like footstool for creating platforms and steps that help you move into other areas. The blue one serves like a switch and is used for opening doors or operating elevators and there is a purple one that alters gravity in the surrounding area. Each stage contains a hidden rotating pyramid that waits patiently for you. In order to locate it you have to use your wits and find alternative routes that will often send you in seemingly inaccessible locations on the map. What is it for you if you find all the pyramids you ask? Well, nothing really except for the sheer joy of doing it! QBeh-1 excels in gameplay but it also looks surprisingly pleasing to the eye: the graphics are lacking in detail but they have a unique art design inspired loosely by Minecraft. Combined with the excellent ambient soundtrack, they create a very soothing, relaxing experience that you will definitely keep you occupied for a long time. In a nutshell, I highly recommend QBeh-1 to everyone who looks for a good and challenging puzzle game.			"

YouTube™ Video: QBEH-1: The Atlas Cube first impressions 

			Views: 8		

			This is my first impressions of QBEH-1: The Atlas Cube by Liquid Flower and published by Digital Tribe Games. It has recently been released on Desura and Steam. Enjoy.		

I bought this game to get a first impression. Played through the first four levels. I actually got it through Desura (where it’s a little more expensive dammit lol).As you can probably gather from the trailer you place blocks in order to create platform which you can use to pass obstacles.The music and visuals create a very relaxed atmosphere. The right angles and square columns reminded me of the original Rise of the Triad.It’s a simple game that very easy to pick up. Puzzles are stimulating. However I imagine that later more difficult level could become frustrating. Also you can’t run and are forced to walk down long corridors which could get annoying. But I suppose running doesn’t fit the vibe of the game.It priced right and fun.Click here for more let’s play videos =)			"

												An absolutely fantastic and calming puzzle game. They claim it's similar to portal, albeit without the portal gun, and I can certainly say this is a game that lives up to that.

			NEW QBEH-1: The Atlas Cube, a very unique and relaxing puzzle game, where you traverse new worlds with just the help of coloured cubes.		

The puzzles start very easy, giving you only a select few cubes, and then quickly gets you to use them in a variety of ways.With absolutely lovely music, the game encompasses you in a serene and calming atmosphere that seems to be there to stimulate creative, and problems solving thinking. I would easily recommend this to any puzzle lover. "

												This game is pleasant to look at and enjoyable to play.  It gets the difficultly right without being confronting.  The levels are cleverly designed with the game set high in the sky.  You rarely get led up the garden path and if you do its for a good reason.  While players aren't provided much guidance, intuition should kick in. For example, I just knew there had to be hidden secrets.  The lack of attaining a corresponding achievement after completing the first world confirmed my suspicions.The art direction is understated.  Ambient music only plays on the occasion.  The lighting is effective and varies for each level. The sporadic plant-life spruces up the spartan levels nicely while the background clouds are gorgeous.  Its easy to recommended this game.  7.5/10			"

												Think 3D puzzle maze and you've got a fairly decent description of this game, but you'd be missing on a few key aspectsQbeh-1 is a first person puzzle platformer that places the player on a structure floating in the upper atmosphere with only one goal: reach the doorway at the end of the area.  In order to get there, you'll use various cubes to open doors, reduce the effects of gravity, or raise yourself to new heights.  There is no narrative to this game so you'll not find any purpose to your level progression and puzzles really aren't that complicated, but the levels themselves are extraordinarily fun to explore.Each world is set over a gorgeous sky scape that changes from level to level.  Some levels show bright blue of mid-day, others the darkness of night, and still more the orange hues of sunrise and sunset.  The lighting within each level is built to reflect the setting outside, so you really feel like you're immersed in the level.  It all combines to make a very peaceful game-playing experience.Puzzle design:I felt every level could have been more difficult.  The game practically throws cubes at you, so you never actually have to worry about using your cubes judiciously and picking them up when you're done.  I'd say the puzzle aspect of this game could have been much improved if the game actually made you think about how to build a stairway with 4 cubes, rather than giving you 10 cubes to make your way up.  One or two levels early on actually did make you build stairs with only 3 cubes, and that proved to be a fun and challenging puzzle.The first world starts you off with only one type of cube that you will use to add to the structure of the world, enabling you to progress to the exit.  Subsequent worlds slowly introduce new cubes and you're ability to affect your surroundings slowly begins to expand.  The difficulty ramps up smoothly as you progress, but never reaches a point that casual players would find frustrating.Level design:I would say that I had more fun exploring the levels than I did actually solving their puzzles.  This game gives you a lot to explore, and it rewards exploration with secrets that you can find in every level.  I was constantly looking for gaps in the wall that were at least 3 cubes tall (that's the size you can fit through) or for ways to jump to higher levels.  I often found myself standing on the wall of a level looking down on where I previously trekked just to see if I somehow missed the hidden pyramid.Of the secret pyramids I found, my favorite was probably the one that had a switch underneath the floor right before the exit.  There was a small crack in the ground that was barely noticeable, but if you put a cube on the switch, a platform would lower and you could get the pyramid.  However, you couldn't get back up to the exit unless you saved all your cubes earlier in the level, so I felt doubly rewarded for being observant and for being stingy on my cubes!The checkpoint feature in each level is a bit too unforgiving.  Rather than remember the farthest you've reached, the checkpoints reset to the most recent one you pass, so a small slip off a platform could force you to restart a level if you land near a checkpoint but left all your cubes above you. (This happened to me more than once!)One caution I would say about exploration is that the game not often but occasionally punishes you for exploring.  A few times I ended up on a platform that I couldn't jump out of simply because all the walls were 2 cubes high (you can only jump up 1 cube height).Community workshop:Qbeh-1 features a level creator in case you want to try your own hand at creating some levels, or if you want to try what others have designed.  I tried a handful of community-made levels, but didn't like any of them.  Seems like people just want to make levels ridiculously complicated or are just trying to create the minimum amount necessary to get the Steam achievement.  I don't know if I'll ever come back and make my own, but I probably won't play any more anytime soon.Minor grievances:The level selection map has probably the poorest design I've ever seen in a game.  Each world is represented as a cube, and you have to rotate the cube until you find the side that corresponds with the level you want to play, but the cube faces aren't numbered.There is also a glitch that allows you to use the effect of the purple low gravity cube without actually attaching it to a wall.  I stumbled across this early on but played through the game without it because let's be honest, cheating your way through a game on the first play really isn't all that fun.The later levels have a lot of empty hallways that serve no purpose to the level other than to increase the time you spend walking in circles.  I like to explore, but a boring circular hallway isn't what I'm looking for.Final thoughts: 8/10This game is entirely about discovery, and the developers put a lot of creativity together to present you with a fantastic world to explore.  This game was definitely created with casual players in mind, but I'd say anyone who wants to play a relaxing game with beautiful atmosphere and puzzles nearly reminiscent of Zelda would enjoy Qbeh-1 immensely!

												I'll mainly write this from the perspective as an Oculus Rift user and how I experienced this game in VR.Qbeh-1 is a puzzle game with pretty straightfoward mechanics, taking place in simplistic but atmospheric environments. The music and presentation make it very enjoyable to play in VR. The fact there is a hidden token in every level also encourages you to be aware of your environment and spot hidden routes.However there are a few downsides for the VR player at the moment:* Movement isn't too VR friendly. This is mainly because of the continous turning of the player instead of having the option to enable incremental turning (the aptly named ""VR comfort mode"" pioneered by Cloudhead Games). Jumping might feel a bit abrupt too and can be a bit heavy on the stomach for those that are sensitive to it. I'd recommended new VR users to acclimate to VR a bit with other demos before jumping into this game.* Framedrops in some levels. Even on my high-end rig, some of the larger levels dip below the recommended 75 fps for some reason (while my CPU and GPU remain underutilized). This could be in part due to the current Oculus drivers and the performance impact of using the Rift's Direct Mode, but anyway, it ruins the experience.* Some spots in the game might require you to stretch your neck a bit in order to reach spots that are right above you (and might make your headphones fall off, as in my case). This is to be expected if the game wasn't initially designed with VR in mind, but it's still playable. Just something to keep in mind.			"

												I picked this up looking for a relaxing puzzler.The music and art style are certainly relaxing, but the gameplay is anything but. The entire challenge comes from precision jumping onto small blocks.

												biggest gripe / negative = single use checkpointit looks like a nice puzzle game, has some fun elements, but the checkpoint is bad.  once you use a checkpoint, you can't ""update"" your checkpoint again so any new additional progress is wasted if you fall & die.  this means that a simple misjump has you re-doing a bunch of stuff over and over again.for me, it's too easy to get annoyed by that.  and that makes the game not worth playing that much.

												First-person puzzle game.You have to get from the beginning to the end of the level using the different features of several different types of cubes. Unlike DOOM (1993), in which you had to fight enemies while activating switches and getting colored keys to open like-colored doors to access more of the level until you reached the end of the not-really-3D levels, Qbeh-1: The Atlas Cube levels exist in a fully-3D world in which you must use cubes to construct platforms to reach other areas, approach bird-like structures which unfurl their ""wings"" (I'm unsure about the function of these bird-like or spaceship-on-the-ground-like structures at this point), and, eventually find your way to the shining white exit region.Instead of baddies, your primary enemy (other than the puzzles themselves) in this game is gravity; the levels (at least in the first world, the last level of which I'm close to finishing) are constructed of stone cubes and other structures suspended in a void of some kind. The lighting and shadows are really beautiful, but falling through a gap or off a ledge will restart the level or load the last save point.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys first-person games, and especially to those who enjoy solving puzzles.

												You know that joke about strategy games upping the difficulty level by giving ridiculous odds against the player and having AI spearmen defeat player tanks, because creating actually smart AI is too much work?Well, that's basically the Qbeh-1 approach to puzzle gaming. What little I saw of the game consisted on quite pretty visuals, mild puzzles with rather neat idea brought low by disastrous gameplay: already at the beginning levels started to rely on making several jumps on narrow ledges and far too many of these were such that if you missed, you die and the whole level starts from the beginning. Again and again and again. It's like when they decided to rip off Portal, they decided it would be a great idea to rip off the worst aspects of Portal. Well, it wasn't a great idea.And yes, the sad thing is that there was actually some promise showing here.			"

												NOT Oculus compatible with DK2(stem really needs to have a dedicated paid editor who tests to see if these games are actually VR compatible, because about half the ""VR Support"" category titles that I've foolishly bought so far have been frauds or else haven't been patched for DK2), the only feature i bought the game for isn't there so not willing to say positives. However, if the developer ever updates to DK2 I will change my position. I understand it's a lot of work for smaller developers so I'll wait... but definitely not playing again until that happens, so in case of continued failure to support VR I can still get a refund.Seems like a decent game but based on what I purchased it for, the game MUST recieve a thumbs down from me, as I won't play this plain style puzzle/platformer if it's not in VR...

												Updated Review: September 2015.After more than a year I still cannot reccommend the game.The major complaints I had last june still persist.I have a brand new, high end computer, and the gameplay still doesn't seem to get fluid.The camera seems to be slow to react, and specially when moving the camera quickly it just doesn't feel right. If you're used to playing on lower (~30) framerates you probably don't notice it, but for me it was very noticable.Another major issue is the jumping, you seem to be falling down really fast after reaching the highest point in your jump, because the game features quite a few of fairly harsh jumps this can be really annoying.The fact that I can't save when I want can be a valid design choice, but not being able to re-save again after a checkpoint can be really frustrating. If you fail a section multiple times and need to keep grabbing the same cubes it just gets frustrating. I don't understand why we can't save again after say a cooldown period of ~5 seconds.==============Original Review: June 2014Do I recommend this game? At the moment no, but if the developers fix some things I think I will:1) perfomance issues.without vsync I had some horrible screentear.with vsync I had some horrible fps2) Save pointsSome of the save points are often a pain. They can be really unforgiving and walking past them again doesn't save again. This can lead to doing things over and over again.3) Lack of personal savesI think this is a design choice but I'd liked to have a quicksave option before trying some crazy moves. Combine this with the sometimes terrible save points and it can be really frustrating to play sometimes.Some personal problems I had:- the music got on my nerves quite a bit- slow pacing, specially the first 2 worlds are very easy.The game has some good things too though:- the mechanics from the third and fourth cubes cube are really fun.- the visual style is really cool and works pretty well.- the gameplay itself is  done well, the mechanics work well.- it feels like minecraft combined with portal!

												I'm not sure why all these Millennials are comparing this to Portal - they are nothing alike. About all they have in common is that they are both in first person and involve puzzle solving. Portal is was not the first puzzle game! This actually reminds me more of Sentinel returns, but only slightly.Anyway, that aside, this game isn't bad if you are looking for some casual fun. You can't die, there are no enemies and the puzzles aren't too taxing to finish, at least where I have got to. All puzzles in this game are solved by collecting and placing different blocks in certain pre-defined places on a floating map. You can relax and play the game at your own pace. I don't agree that it's as atmospheric as everyone is saying it is, though. I'm not sure where these ""nice graphics"" everyone keeps mentioning are, either.Personally, I got very bored very quickly but I also got the game cheap. It's not bad but I don't think it's anything amazing either.			"

The Atlas Cube' - QBEH-1: The Atlas Cube is an atmospheric 1st-person puzzle platformer by Liquid Flower that takes players on an inspired quest through a variety of divergent worlds, each filled with new mysteries and secrets to uncover. In each world, players find special cubes that must be collected and used to navigate to the next portal. Some cubes will simply be used as stepping stones to new areas while others are imbued with magical properties such as gravity and propulsion. Created by Liquid Flower, QBEH-1: The Atlas Cube is a prequel to their much beloved Qbeh, a small student project that found its way online and into the hands of gamers and journalists alike who wanted more after feasting on the appetizer. Now, QBEH-1: The Atlas Cube builds on the core concept and aesthetics introduced in the original and brings even more polish, passion and gameplay into the new game. - Highly Recommended!			"

												This is an excellent VR experience and I'm especially fond of being able to turn the ""Tracker rotates body"" option off! Wow, what a difference it makes for FPS controls in VR! Simple laid back gameplay, great performance and a relaxing ambiance! If you own a Rift, this is definitely one to add to your collection!Oculus Rift DK2 (3D) gameplay recording:http://www.interleave-vr.com/youtube-proper-player.php?v=kW9ks-j9EBY "

												I hate the controls in this game, I've almost smashed the keyboard in frustration a couple of times because I was unable to correctly time jumps across the gaps. And what happens after falling? Yup, the level is restarted. I also think the game is rather boring and the music is monotonous. Don't recommend in any way.			"

												AVOID IF YOU HAVE FEAR OF HEIGHTS. That's obviously not going to apply to everyone, but, it did to me. The trailer somewhat indicates that the game is set way up in the sky, but it doesn't really communicate the fact that a large amount of it involves leaping across destroyed floors above endless pits.That's actually some what of a relevant complaint for everyone else too: I came into this expecting something like Antichamber (which it shares at least one mechanic with), and while it is a mostly puzzle-focused game, there is a much larger focus on precision platforming than I was expecting. (And in a somewhat poor choice, a single misstep often means you have to replay an entire, fairly large portion of the level all over again.)As for the VR support, I haven't even been able to get it to work, but a game with this much stop-and-start jumping seems like a poor choice for VR anyway.

												Sleepwalking pace, lousy controls and... seriously. Level title screens, that are solid white save the title, that take upwards of twenty seconds to clear? If you're hiding loading progress, don't. I'd rather the illusion that something is going on behind the scenes, rather than the suspicion that the designer has their thumb up their♥♥♥♥♥A checkpoint-based save system, short jumps, and absurdly slow movement through water --contact with which locks you out of an achievement-- punishes exploration and experimentation, requiring the player to backtrack every time they miss a step. This feels like something that would have been impressive fifteen or twenty years ago, but is merely an unpolished tech demo today.			"

												1.Booring. 2. Easy. 3.WHITE!1.The sence (place cube jump on it - go on) isnt fun after 2-3 lvls. New cube (blue) didnt help. Grabity was ok, but it just gives a higher jump.2. U dont have to think. Just auto: see the place where u can place a cube - place it, jump on it, step forward - take the cube back. Maybe at world 5 it'll be more difficult, but i dont want to spend 5 hours with punkt.3 and 1 to make some activeness to brain. I can just open Portal and play some custom maps.3. Everysthing WHITE. made the half brightness on screen, still somethimes painfully to watch outside the corridors (the background on some lvls are totaly white. And the end-start loading is white screen. With the lvl name on BRIGHT WHITe. Between the levels its about 20 sec of empty screen, u can guess what colour it is.So have no idea who liked it and why. Probably with oculus its pretty fun, but with no - awfull.			"

												Beautiful game and concept ruined by excessive use of jump tasks. Not even puzzles, just cheap amateurish, guess where your feet pixels are and pray they come into contact with the ledge pixels when you make your obscenely tiny jumps. Also apparently your character has no hands and arms or legs, because you can't climb over anything or even step up on to things. It's jumping and walking and that's it. Party like it's 1995. Seriously Daleks jump better than this guy (or whatever.)Super disappointed because I love the music and sound and other aspects of the level design. If I could cheat and make the floor marble instead of death-sky it would probably be an awesome game. Honestly I think the floor being lava would be better. At least that would explain why you don't grab ledges with your hands. (No point if you just jumped hip deep into lava.)If I could play the game with the mirror's edge girl that would probably rock also :)			"

Well I don't have one so, woooo.And that’s about it...~Cons~""All these features and much more""The level name shown at the beginning of a level is ssllllloooowww and booooorrrinnng and you can't even skip it.When there are floating cubes/ areas that you can't access can you add some motion? Please? it makes it look a bit silly and makes the game look bland.Seriously?? You can't start playing using only a controller?? You HAVE TO USE THE MOUSE TO NAVIGATE THE MENU!!! Is it that hard?! You are only able to use the controller while playing in a level!!The same-same look of the levels really gets *Yawn* boring after playing four levels!And a few more bad things that I can't be bothered to mention because writing a review for a boring game IS boring!Unless you like ""zen""-like experiences (sitting down looking at a bland ""thing"") or interactive loading screens this is for you!My final words are....I WANT MY MONEY BACK!

 The first puzzle platformer I've ever played where the character runs.Well, jokes aside, this puzzle platformer revolves around cubes, cubes, cubes, and more cubes. These cubes can be used as platform extesions or switches that causes some events in the stage like opening doors, moving platforms, etc. The terrain looks calming for me but may look bland for others. Nonetheless, I got a good experience from this, so I'd like to recommend this game.			"

Imo some savepoints should have been set different, but overall it seems pretty fair. Jumping can be tricky from time to time.If you find all pyramids in world 1 to 5 (each has 6 levels, so in total 30 levels), world 6 (with 6 more levels) will be unlocked.  36 levels in total with easily over 10 hours playing time is really nice for this price.9/10 for me			"

												At first when I saw this game I thought it would be another voxel-minecraft-wanabe-puzzle-cheap game. I was so wrong, first the only similarity between this and minecraft was the main shape of the game: a cube. The graphics are supprisingly good and run well on my Asus r510c. The simplicty of the game makes it so good, there is absolutely no need for a tutoral and doesn't overcomplicate the begining with dumb-filler-nobodycaresabout-exposition. Rather it lures you in with mystery. I have still yet to play the game through but from what I've seen in a mere 54 minutes is awesome.The name ""Qbeh-1"" is hopefully insinuating a second.Overall 9.9999/10 reason: the .00001 deduction is because the trees glitch out, the textures for some reason are plauged with black lines.

												You need to be specific about your expectations when you look for a game to buy.Having said that, this game is definitely worth its money, if you're looking for something action-packed with lots of stuff going on or something heavily reliant on a plot, turn back now because this isn't what you're looking for, however if you expect something lightweight that puts your thinking skills as well as coordination to the test then you'll get your fill with this game.The game itself is well put together as every element of it harmoniously comes together into a relaxing and soothing experience, if anything I'd compare this game to a day off when you don't go to work or school and just pamper youself all day.I'll rate this 4/5why not a 5? because I believe that its a little short, it has some replay value as you explore and revisit the same places to find the hidden items if you haven't done that in your first run however it's a shame that the people who made this game didn't add some sort of level editor so that people could make and share their own levels online.

												Qbeh is a puzzle platformer that does not disappoint. You pick up colored cubes to place in marked positions in the map. You'll build small bridges and stairs out of these cubes to get to the next area, and, when you discover the other types of cubes, you'll be making low grav jumpways and riding cubes over precarious pits.The experience is just like the music in the game -- relaxing and beautiful. If you're looking for a thrillride or a sarcastic, witty narrator, this isn't your game.If you'd like to relax, figure out some puzzles at your own pace, this is a great game. If you're like me, you'll be hoarding cubes in an effort to break out of the map and discover secrets. This game does not disappoint in this respect either.I really enjoyed every second of this game and didn't want it to end. I can't recommend this game enough.			"

												Pros:-Graphics are awesome-Puzzles are well made-VERY unique conceptCons:-Some puzzles seem to have more than 1 solution by accident (ex. parkouring somewhere awkward to get somewhere else)-Puzzles get difficult. Really difficult. Not for the simple minded. (I might be one of them :P)			"

												This game is relaxing to play, the puzzles start off easy and get harder and I have not found all the secrets yet and look foward to doing that, for the main game it is worth it alone. The level editor takes time to get used to and can seem quite complicated to start with, stick with it because it is fun to build in. many colours of wall and floor, Ice and dirt and hazard blocks make big variety in design. Light cubes and source can be any colour you like with the RGB mixer intensity and range.I have created 8 levels I guess now and still like making more. if you dare you can do curved levels. also the music in the main game can be used and sky boxes are plenty so every level can have a different feel.

												I am approaching the 2 hour (gameplay) mark in this game and am loving it now that I know how to play. The levels are great both in design and difficulty. The level designs make the secenery something players should take a second to admire and differing enough per level and ""world"" so as to not get repetative. The level difficulty is at a point so that they are not something that you will breeze through (except for speedrunners...yes there are speedrunners in this game) because they will require thought. Add on to that the fact that there is the story levels and player designed levels. I recommend this game.			"

												I loved this game. It was perfect to pick up and play in between other games when I was in the mood for a puzzle, as there was no real story to follow so I wouldn't forget anything if I was away from it for extended periods. The puzzles were just hard enough to keep me interested and not too hard to frustrate me. 9/10			"

												I love this game a lot but *please developer of this game just add a run button that makes it faster than how it is now* because I feel like I'm walking most of the time and the game is so long that I want to run through to beat them but so far 5 hours of the story and still can't beat because I can't run!

												lovely game with lovely graphics and a lovely soundtrack/sfx. so far i haven't found any puzzles to be hard, but i haven't completed the game yet, either. i find it relaxing to focus on and fun to play. puzzle games can be pretty subjective-- in my opinion this isn't exactly challenging, but i'm alright with that because it's enjoyable anyway. new things are continually introduced to keep things different between ""worlds"".make sure you have time set aside to fully complete a level, though. exiting the game erases all progress within a level regardless of save points. if you're the type to have to get up or leave the computer at the drop of the hat during the middle of something, this game can get a little frustrating.

												The atmosphere in this is brilliant in its simplicity, the controls are effective... the game just needs actual puzzles. Qbeh doesn't subscribe to the ""Portal"" school of puzzles, where the puzzle elements are clearly laid out in such a way that the solution seems impossible until you figure out some clever trick. Instead, the game is a lot of ""wander around, solve a simple mechanical exercise that can't really be called a puzzle, wander around some more, oh the look a random end of the level"". I haven't run into anything I could call a puzzle, more just tech demos for the gameplay elements, and the fact that the gate that takes you to the next level is always just around some random corner after one of these mechanical challenges makes it hard to be interested in progression. Any time I got stuck it was because of red herrings or something important being hidden in an alcove in the ceiling, which are filler elements we shouldn't see in puzzle games in 2015.tl;dr, whoever made the game world did a fantastic job, whoever made the puzzles should spend 20 hours playing the top-rated maps in Portal 2's map maker.

												The combination of having a 3d environment you can walk through and neat puzzles is great! Especially when the environment is so nice looking/atmospheric :). If you like puzzles and the pictures/trailer, there's a good chance you'll really enjoy playing the game.The puzzles are also really nice, and more mechanics are added throughout the levels so it doesn't get boring at all, There's also some hidden things you can look for, which are sometimes really hard to find (or to get to) which I really like.
