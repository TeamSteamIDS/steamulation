												Lone Survivor is a 2D psychological survival-horror game that pulls a lot from David Lynch and the Silent Hill series. I originally played it back when it came out from the developer's website, and have played through it a few times since also on Steam and on the PS3.You play as a nameless character who is stationed in an apartment in a ruined city. Each day is a struggle, with limited supplies and draining willpower. Our character decides that he doesn't want to die alone, and sets off to find someone else to give meaning to his minimal existence. As he ventures out, he does meet other characters, but they all seem rather odd. Are they real, or a figment of his imagination? Is everything as it seems, or just an illusion?The game has atmosphere in spades. While the graphics are low-res and pixely, the game has a fundamental understanding of the effect minimalism can have on games; like the original Silent Hill or Resident Evil, your mind fills in the blanks of details. Everything is just detailed enough to make out what everything is, but minimalistic enough that your imagination fills in the blanks. The game also utilizes some nice lighting and fog effects to help add to the atmosphere.The audio is fantastic, with moody and stylistic music, wonderful sound design, and while unsettling, adds so much to the experience.The game doesn't have jump-scares, but rather mood to unsettle and oppress you. Some will find this decision to make the game ultimately not very scary, but it remains tense and unnerving through tough obstacles and strange moments.The game is a bit cryptic, which might turn some off from the title. Something that most may not see coming is that our character has human needs for things like sleep, food, and rest of mind. If you don't take good care of your character, it effects him. And to take good care of him means to search around for things that may help, such as gas for his stove to cook things or a game system and batteries to use to play it with. You collect food and supplies from the environment, and from utilizing these elements you can help tend to your characters needs. Or you can not, and just do the minimum effort to get by.But choice in gameplay matters here. The game has about six different endings (one of them is a slight alteration of another ending though), with four available on the fist playthrough. Which ending you head towards is not determined by simple A or B choices, but by how you play the game. And most everything effects it. How often do you eat? How often do you sleep? Do you use the transfer mirrors to return home? Do you indulge in side-quest? Do fun but meaningless things to help your sanity? Do you help or hurt this guy? Do you kill or avoid enemies? All these choices add to an unseen score (that they finally show you after the credits) which determine which ending path you're going on. Well, that is except one ending, where you need to do a secret side-quest to obtain it.There are a few points the game drags on a bit, particularly of note in the basement segment where your map is near useless and maneuvering can become rather confusing. After completing the game for the first time, you'll probably have more questions than answers. To really get the full experience of Lone Survivor means to play the game more than once, in fact certain areas, side-quests, and endings aren't even available until the second playthrough. This kind of commitment will turn some off from the game. And for some the survival element will feel superficial, as the game essentially will give you anything you need if you don't mind gaining 'ending points' to go on a certain bad ending path.But it's also probably one of the truest Silent Hill games to release since Silent Hill stopped really being SH, and is one of the best 2D horror games to exist. To really dig into the game requires hard work to keep your sanity up and your spirits high, and rewards those that dig into the game's systems and figure it all out.Lone Survivor is atmospheric, and in my opinion, one of the best 2D horror games in terms of atmosphere, and one of my personal favorites. It has sim-like mechanics not all will care to manage, but those that delve into it will be rewarded with interesting story twists, revelations, and new areas. It needs to be replayed to be fully experienced, but likely will attract a niche audience with its surrealism and mysterious storyline. For those less interested in the strange, there is a pretty solid old-school styled survival-horror game here. It may not have all the bells and whistles, but it's an ominous adventure while it lasts.			"

'My name is… not important anymore, I guess. […] As far as I know, I’m the only one left. The Lone Survivor.'You__________________________________________Introduction'Lone Survivor: The Director’s Cut' is one of these little games that shows how good indie titles can be.This little pixelated horror adventure suceeds where many huge (Horror-)AAA-titles fail nowadays: Creating a deep and atmospheric experience full of creepy and mysterious situations without relying too much on (cheap) tricks like e.g. jumps scares behind every corner. After the outbreak of an unknown disease the nameless protagonist – only called 'You' – tries to survive in this harsh and cruel world. He lives withdrawn in a lost apartment building, unsure if he is still sane or if everything he sees is only a hallucination. Due to the questionable mental stability and the omnipresent problem of starvation he doesn't know how long he may be able to stay alive. First of alll 'You' doesn’t want to die alone – therefore he starts exploring the apartments and looking for other survivors of the catastrophe.While exploring the remnants of the 'good old times', 'You' will be confrontend with deep fears and mysterious situations, monsters and hallucinations, unsure what is real and what is just a trick of his own mind. Armed with a flaslight, batteries and a gun with very limited ammunition he makes his way into the unknown depths of the apartments, facing mysterious horrors while trying to keep the rest of his sanity and finding enough food to eat and time to sleep. The only 'true‘ friends he has in this apocalyptic world are a plant and a plush doll – but is it really a sign of sanity to talk to them? Who knows…The story is short but well done and the dialogues make you actually care about the characters, their well-being and their behavior, questioning the situations that 'You' has to face in and what’s really happening in front of him as everything may change in the blink of an eye. And in the end every step and decision you‘ve taken may affect him. Until 'You' will see the end of his journey it will take approximately four up to maybe five hours (I finished the game already two times outside of Steam, therefore my short gaming time is no sign of lacking experience). Fortunately the replay value is quite high due to many different endings based on your choices during 'You‘s' journey and a NG+ Mode with some additional content.__________________________________________Graphics and AudioTo cut it short: It’s a pixelated game based on Flash Engine so you shouldn’t expect too much – but for this it does quite a good job. The games‘ soundtrack is fantastic and fits most of the times absolutely perfect. It’s creepy and catchy at the same time, giving you the chills in the right moments. The pixelated graphics are well done and you can see that the different appartmens, rooms and scenes were crafted carefully and with a love for details. The game feels like a great trip in good old 2D-Horror Games and has a deeper atmosphere than many huge titles nowadays. __________________________________________ConsUnfortunately 'Lone Survivor' somehow feels bulky and using the inventory or selecting items can be quite annoying from time to time (just as using your gun in my opinion). The controls aren’t very comfortable despite some hotkeys, remapping them isn‘t possible and due to the restrictions of flash games there is no easy solution for controller support aside from third party software – a fact where the game would benefit from heavily. That’s kind of sad as the PS3-version has both controller support and achievements (that are somehow missing in the PC version).__________________________________________ConclusionThis game may give you the chills while taking you on a little journey about sanity, surviving and the horrors that are hiding either in the shadows or in your own mind. Sure, it has some flaws and edges but the overall experience is intense and it suceeds in creating a deep and nice atmosphere when 'You' tries to hide from the strange creatures or faces them – realizing that he’s actually out of ammunition. Moreover it has a brilliant soundtrack. Seriously.I’d rate it 9 out of 10 points and definitely recommend the game - it's worth the money, even without a sale.This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union, providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.

												I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is or has been a fan of psychological horror games. Lone Survivor has a very Silent Hill feel to it, and quickly allows the player to become immersed in it's interesting story line. Although the pacing can be a little slow at times when you're trying to discover what to do next, the game offers interesting puzzles and combat that requires you to be tactical, in a sense. The music for the game is incredibly catchy, but also quite dark, and goes perfectly with the game's dark theme and humour. Despite being only 8-bit, this game could be considered better than some big-budget that currently exist.I'd recommend this game to anyone who is in the mood for a retro psychological horror, or loves games that carry dark-underlying themes and immersive storylines.

												This is a great example of how outstanding music can elevate a game from good to great. I also do not want to disregard the writing in this game either. The creator managed to meaningful dialogue within the game without over doing it and without being corny. The retro pixel art is outstanding. The pacing can suffer a little from time to time as you wander around looking for what to do next. But aside from that, I enjoyed gradually making my way through the 7 hour campaign. The enemies are not found in abundance or varied but all placed with thought behind the room design. That and other attention to detail show me the the developer who made this game truely cared about what he was making.If you are in the mood for a retro survival horror game you probably won't do better than this.

												Ah, Lone Survivor, a 2-D retro survival horror game that makes most of nowadays ""horror"" games feel ashamed. It's not the spookiest, but it's definitely tense as all hell.First off, I'm gonna say, the difficulty of this game is truly remarkable, even on normal mode. Normal mode on other modern survival horror games basically holds your hand for the whole playthrough, with a puzzle now and then to hinder your progress, or they are rather linear. This game is hard. First, you get tired AND hungry at times. Second, food items might be common, but mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones. You can scavenge for food, cook it, collect water dripping from the ceiling with a bucket, stuff like that. Third, and my favorite, what made games like the first Resident Evil true masterpieces:Not enough ammo for every single enemy that you come across. So, you gotta play smart, hide from the monsters, distract them, use items, basically, you gotta think before you waste even a single bullet, because if you do, you are going to regret it later on. I can describe this game for common folks with a single sentence. ""It's like Silent Hill but 2D"". That's what most of the ones that have played this game use to describe it. The story has something to do with the outbreak of a disease that turns people into some kind of faceless zombies that wander around all the time. You are locked inside of your apartment, and that's pretty much how you survived, but now you gotta find a way out of that dreaded building, having to face tons of enemies with just a few bullets, so to speak. The game's got multiple endings, so there is that, too.This game might be short-ish compared to other stuff I've played before, but it's definitely worth it. It's nothing short of frustrating at times. The game starts nice and slow, but once you reach the basement, you can actually feel the difficulty spike going up your♥♥♥♥♥ Hard. No lube. It was kind of linear before that, with a map telling you were to go, but once you reach the basement, say bye bye to that, and be prepared for backtracking, corridors full of enemies, running out of ♥♥♥♥ing batteries or ammo, getting lost, or falling into death traps.The music is pretty good, nothing that extreme, just ambiental tracks that really help the game. The controls are unremarkable, standard 2D controls, move left and right, aim, shoot, interact, that's about it.There is a pause button, but the inventory isn't a safe place to hide. The graphics are akin of SNES games and stuff like that. The visuals are nice, even if it gets really dark at times.  All in all, I would recommend this game to any fan of survival horror games out there. It can be unforgiving for the casual everyman, so be prepared if you are one of those.			"

												Lone Survivor is a difficult game to reccommend.  I've been hearing good things about it from friends and various sources since its release, and I tried to play it when the Director's Cut edition first came out -- but it did little to hold my attention and subsequently collected pixelated dust for months and months. A few days ago, I forced myself to play it again at the behest of a friend who was convinced I was robbing myself of an amazing experience.  While I wouldn't call the experience 'amazing', I don't consider it a terrible one.  Lone Survivor is a game that has its moments of brilliance, but all too often this brilliance is marred by mechanics, lazy dialogue, and design theory.The GoodWe'll begin with what Lone Survivor has in its favor. Lone Survivor features a cohesive aesthetic, a persistent, chilling atmosphere, an engaging, apposite soundtrack and good pacing/length.The Aesthetic:The aesthetic design in this game is tight, cohesive, and remains this way throughout the entire playthrough.  Environments are detailed and fit nicely next to character models.  Characters are semi-detailed sprites, and all are animated well.  The Man Who Wears a Box was especially well rendered.  Enemies and corrupted environments are visceral and exploding with gore. There's nothing that stood out as exceptional to me in Lone Survivor's aesthetic, except for one: The text is presented in absurdly low-quality.  Reading it was a bit of a struggle at first, and even when I was used to it it was still ugly and strained my eyes.  I understand the intention behind the font, but readability need not be sacrificed in a retro font. Sound Design     Lone Survivor's sound design is possibly its best feature.  Sound effects are harsh, untempered, and low quality, which help augment the visceral nature of the environment around the player.  Monster screeches sound more like white noise and synthetically generated wave forms rather than actual grunts and gutteral groans, and I believe this helps add to Lone Survivor's unique atmosphere. Lone Survivor also has an apposite soundtrack that enhances the gameplay and conflates with the environment and atmosphere.  I find that many sountracks either don't do enough to augment the atmosphere of a game, or they are too zealous and begin to drown out other elements.  This one fits nicely somewhere in the middle. Pacing // Game Length: The game's pacing is quite good as well -- things develop at a satisfying rate, and the game doesn't hang on one section too long nor fill itself with useless padding; while at the same time still offering those who wish for an extended stay side-quests and multiple endings.The BadLone Survivor seems to work hard to make itself a very neutral experience -- for every good design decision or execution, there seems to be a poor one following closely in its wake.  Lone Suvivor suffers from sluggish mechanics, a rather banal pool of enemies, a narrative that is just a little too self-conscious of its esoteric nature, uninspired dialogue, and an underdeveloped character cast.Mechanics:Perhaps the most crucial flaw in Lone Survivor lies within its game mechanics.  Controls are clunky and there seems to be a slight input delay for most actions -- for instance, many times I would take an extra, undeserved hit from an enemy when using the flare hotkey due to the delay.  Combat is simple, basic, and unengaging.  Players are given the option to avoid combat using the stealth 'system' (if you can call it a system -- hit X to hide in pre-designated spaces, then hit X to unhide), but this is equally dull and boring.  There's an elaborate cooking system, but I also found this to be unengaging.  Food heals the protagonist as well as boosts his mental health, one of the metrics used to determine which ending you get.  Nothing's broken, but it's not ideal either.  Everything works and functions at an acceptable level, but nothing is compelling.  Because the game's mechanics were so prosaic, I felt absolutely no want nor desire to play the game based on them alone.  That meant that the narrative and characters had to do some heavy lifting -- which they didn't quite do, as we'll discuss in a moment.  To summarize:  Aside from the frustrating input delay and clunky controls, the mechanics work in this game.  They're just too basic or too dull to make for a fun or engaging experience.  I think many might argue that these clunky controls build tension in the game , as many other survival horror games have similar setups.  Yet that's an argument without weight, and one that excuses lazy or lackluster development strategies.  Tension could (or should) still be maintained regardless of the control setup.  Limiting a player's options is an acceptable strategy to build tension, but the options that remain available should be fluid, entertaining, and satisfying.Narrative, Dialogue, and the Cast:Lone Survivor thrusts you into its narrative in media res, but then does very little to supply the player with the backstory.  There are a few mentions by characters that hint at the past, but specifics are almost non-existent.  In fact, vague ambiguity is the main problem with the narrative: It's presented to the player as a large mystery to be solved, yet frustratingly little is resolved in the end.  It's a narrative that seems rife with potential and one that, unfortunately, instead only delivers minimal emotional impact.  Characters aren't given enough time nor dialogue to develop into something the player will actually care about.  And about the dialogue -- it's very hit or miss.  Sometimes it's fitting and poignant and interesting.  Other times it's tacky, too colloquial, or entirely too self-aware of its attempts to unsettle the player.  Many of the character developments and dialogue just feel like cheap, thoughtless shots that are meant to add tension.  For some, this might work.  For me, this only served to pull me further out of the world.Lack of Motivation:Tying all of these other issues together severly limited my motivation to finish the game.  There are mysteries (in theory) to discover, but there's so little information given to the player that I had little interest in solving them.  There are characters with which to interact, but I had no reason to care about them and felt no connection.  I felt rather insulted by the cheap shots in the dialogue with regards to generating 'tension' or 'suspense'.  I felt bored with the fact that there were only a couple of enemies that appeared throughout the entire game, and that all of them featured very predictable AI patterns.  There were only a couple of bosses, and both of those fights were inane and unimaginative.  In short, I had to force myself to finish the game. There are multiple endings, but I felt no want or desire to put the effort in to see the others (I did research them, however).The GestaltThose who enjoyed the game and reccommended it to me argued against my complaints and averred that it was the gestalt of Lone Survivor and its experience that caused it to transcend its flaws.  From my perspective, this isn't a valid argument.  Something must carry the weight in order to deliver an excellent experience, and I don't see any element doing this in Lone Survivor. Lone Survivor isn't a terrible game, it's just a boring, unresolved one.So there it is. If you feel that Lone Survivor is still something that interests you after reading my complaints, pick it up and form your own opinions about it.  However, if you want a truly compelling survival horror game that delivers both stellar gameplay and a fascinating, coherent narrative -- look elsewhere.			"

												After an apocalypse, you are a Lone Survivor lurking in the halls of a low fidelity 2D side scrolling, abandon apartment building. There is no power and supplies are limited. Every day you leave the safety of your humble bedroom in search of food and a solution to the mysterious, surrealistic hallucinations that are happening to you.What lurks beyond your apartment 206 walls are faceless mutants that only have a sense of smell to find you. This sense of smell leads them to find rotting chunks of meat that you can find in refrigerators and leave to bait them. Once you've dropped some meat, you can hide in specific areas and watch as they travel past you.You do find a gun, but ammunition is scarce and these wandering mutants take a few bullets to put down. Firing is slow, reloading is slow, but that comes with the genre. How can you be terrified of a mutant walking toward you when you can instantly kill it? Well how can you be terrified when you have a gun to take them down?Lone Survivor has all of the makings of a survival horror game or at least a point and click adventure without clicking anything. The game is keyboard only which under normal circumstances, I have no problem with, but I do prefer a controller. The real problem is there are plenty of keys to use and sometimes finding the correct key in the glow of your monitor can be a daunting task. There are keys for reloading, shoot and interact share a key, left, right, flashlight, map, leave meat, show the inventory and two other things. Eight keys in all and even more for gamma correction and so on.The game excels in an atmosphere and creepy vibe. Flesh covered walls you need to cut through. Coming across a party going on in a room while there are threatening mutants outside. Having to find a girl's stuffed animal. Saying hi to a plant as you pass by. Finding a girl locked away behind bars. You are a lone survivor though. How can you be lone and yet have all of these people inhabiting your wrecked apartment building? You're the only one tat seems to know there's any danger going on. Every so often you experience a dream or hallucination in the form of a cut scene that plays out and only adds to the odd experience. One cut scene has you and someone else in chairs discussing pills. It adds to the surrealism that the game brings.The radio in your bedroom and your plush cat toy are your only source of friendship. The radio gives hints as to what you should be doing and you will find cards that tell you what stations to tune into. Its a good way to bring you back to a game if you go long periods without playing. After all the best way to play is in the dark after midnight and who can stay up that late?I know that your character sure gets tired easy. He gets exhausted as much as he gets hungry and when he gets tired, you need to return to your room every ten or so minutes. Its only a constant recommendation. Something might happen if you take too long, but its never anything that you need to do right then and there.To make travel easier, you can look into a mirror and teleport your way through back to your apartment. It adds to the surreal nature of the game, and it becomes mandatory because you need to fight the whims of your character. He gets tired and hungry as we all would in a world of sheer darkness and famine, but he refuses to do things like traverse a hole he had gone through before. Its a good way to force you to use the mirrors as a sort of tutorial. Doors are locked and your character mentions coming back there later.You get a map of the apartment level with all of its rooms. Everything is marked, locked doors, blockages, open doors and so on. It feels small enough to learn your way around over several trips, but you can still get lost. Places to go are marked with giant question marks, but the problem is, these never go away, even long after you've explored everything in the room.There are plenty of items such as can openers, gas tanks for stoves and hams that need to be cooked that manage to still be fine in a refrigerator with no power. You can see an item's description in the menu. Some things are obvious, but its the food that you need to see if its spoiled before you consume it. There's also an option to talk with objects, such as your sleepy cat doll. Whatever keeps the crazy isolation away I suppose.While I do feel the menu is a bit cumbersome to use, it keeps you in the action because its just a minimal series of items at the top of the screen. I'd rather stay in a game like this than hop to a menu. When you see an item that can be interacted with, you still need to delve into the menu and use the item when it could have been streamlined so you just use it at the proper place. I can chalk it up to survival horror game design forcing you to figure out that you need to use a can opener on cans.You can find red, green and blue pills scattered around here or there. The choice to take them is yours, but I learned from arcade games in the 90s that winners don't use drugs. They accumulate to a sort of score at the end determined by what food, pills and choices that you made such as pushing drugs on someone.As a character, you're alone and sanity has gone with everyone else. You're wearing a medical mask that might keep out whatever mutating apocalyptic virus there is, but it also makes him look like he has a giant smile in this shambled building shooting ""mutants"" while downing pills.Lone Survivor feels like a good, simple game, but once all the mutants are dead the challenge goes with them. New areas have new mutants, but roaming through an empty wasteland for the fourth time can get dull. With an area so small, its never frustrating and the game lays out your objectives in a good manor to keep you going. Other times you'll need to check cabinets that you've already checked previous to being stumped in order to find a hole to crawl through.Its easy to recommend for its atmosphere, surrealism and simplicity. Its a good environment that takes you to a different place where there are no clear answers only your interpretations.			"

												It's like a 2D Silent Hill game, but doesn't really deliver on horror for me. Its strength lies in its ability to make you wonder just what the hell is going on. It plays on the fear of the unknown, I'd say. There's almost always something weird and unexplained around the next corner. All in all, the game has very nice atmosphere, pixel art and just a tight survival gameplay mechanic.

This game is one of the best games you will ever play, though you may not understand until you finish it. It was emotionally impacting, and made me think for a long while.

												I really knew next to nothing about the game when I started. I had only read a few lines of positive feedback on it, and seen about 5 minutes of gameplay on youtube, after which it had captured my interest enough for me to take a chance on it, and I'm thoroughly glad I did. It turned out to be one of the best indie titles I've played. The reason for this is perhaps because I went in blind with no real prior knowledge or spoilers about the game. There's something to be said for experiencing a game in this manner. I thoroughly recommend it.As for the story.. Well it's rather hard to talk too much about the story in detail. Partly because it's fairly weird (no, really), and partly because there isn't much of a story at all. It's one of those kind of games where the whole world has gone mad, you are seemingly one of the very few survivors of what must have been an event that ended civilization. You wake up in your apartment, which acts as your safe zone, where you can sleep (save), and prepare food and drink, and other things. Once you venture outside, you quickly find out that in order to survive, you have to deal with the monsters that now roam the halls and inhabit the other apartments. One way to deal with them is to shoot them with your trusty pistol, though you can't just go all gung ho, because if you run out of ammo, you're in for a rough time since there are no other weapons in the game. However, there are various ways of getting more ammo along the way, so it's not the end of the world. I ran out of ammo once, and it took me quite a while to get more, but in the meantime I took the more stealthy approach, which is absolutely viable, and perhaps even preferable for large parts of the game. The controls are a bit clunky if things have to go fast in terms of inventory management while monsters are about. The reason for this is that there is no way of stopping time. It'll just keep ticking away regardless of what you're doing, which means monsters aren't going to stand around and wait for you to open your inventory, find the right item, and use it. They will just make short work if you while you are otherwise occupied with your inventory. This is a good thing though, as having time stop just because you want to open up your inventory and find items in the middle of combat really breaks the immersion, so be prepared to run away to a ""safe"" area before taking care of your health or mental state.Speaking of inventory management, you will often find that you get hungry or tired as you explore the game, and since you can die of both starvation and exhaustion in this game, you'll always have to be aware of how much food and drink  you have on you, and how much time it'll take you to get back to your apartment in order to sleep in case you don't have caffeine on you. You can even die if you run out of batteries for your flashlight, so you have to watch out how much you have it turned on.Speaking of food. You might not always have the right equipment in your kitchen to cook what you find along the way either, so you'll also need to find the proper cookware if you want to prepare the various foods in the game. Apparently, you were a big fan of ordering in before the world turned bad, because you don't seem to own much of anything in that department.The game took me a little under 5 hours to complete, and I really enjoyed every moment of it. I imagine this is much like what the original Silent Hill would have been like if they had gone with a 2-d side scroller instead of 3d. It's well worth your time and money, so I say go for it if you're a fan of the genre. You won't regret it.			"

												Lone survivor is an atmospheric pixely horror adventure, where you find yourself trying to survive in a sort of post apocalyptic world. There are foul creatures lurking in every corner, your sanity is elusive, your resources are scarce, and the only other people you meet have questionable intentions. The way you choose to play and conduct yourself -being openly violent or stealthy for example- can set you toward a different ending path. Having played this outside of steam and even adding it on my account here, I cannot do otherwise but recommend this game. + Creepy atmosphere (silent hill nostalgia)+ Amazing soundtrack+ Multiple endings+ Map teleporting system helps you avoid needless walking- Pixely graphics make text a little hard to read- Some backtracking might be needed			"

												More Silent Hill-ish than P.T.Alright, that was childish, but I'll say something useful, this game makes me grab the controller and just play it. It has the same thing that SH2 has, and that is a great atmosphere. The game doesn't scares you, it makes you feel unnerved and unsafe, just like SH2. AND also the game is about how far can the human psyche go until it consumes the individual, also like SH2 without the journey to meet your dead wife. So overall, long live to this game, Silent Hill, horror, and my mother.PS: There is something that may♥♥♥♥♥♥some people off (not me). The game has a food and sleep system, that makes you scavenge through the places for finding food if your character ask for it, or that makes you go back to your bed if you are tired. This end up adding backtrack if you want to be fine, but I was so absorbed by the game that I just didn't gave a toss about that. I'll copypaste the last sentence of the previous paragraph. Long live to this game, Silent Hill, horror, and my mother.PS2: (Off-Topic) Now the P.T. joke isn't funny anymore. Thanks Konami for reminding us that we don't have to have hope on videogames.			"

It is actually one of my favorite games.As far as 2D horror games go, you can't get much better than this.Immersive, atmospheric, dark, and extremely fun.If you're looking for a retro styled puzzle horror game, with a very dark creepy atmosphere, this is for you.I strongly recommend this game.

												One of the best Indie Survival Horror games in recent history, or at least of the ones that I have played. If you're a fan, of 2D Side-Scrollers, and Survival Horror this game is for you. Having an amazing retro style to it, like if you imagine if Silent Hill 2 was in 2D but have a soundtrack as amazing as the proper game. The music in this game is fantastic, from the ambient tracks through out the game, distorted zombie sounds when you encounter enemies, and to full tracks with vocals in some of the cut-scenes, it adds significantly to the atmosphere.  The game play is very easy to get a hang of except for maybe occasional difficulty to navigate the map especially when you're trying to run away from a creature you can't fight in a hard to navigate area. The atmosphere is outstanding, with added survival needs like food and sleep, it add a lot to the experience. Puzzles are pretty straight-forward and linear but may in some parts make you scour the whole area looking for one small item to progress. The characters mental state mechanism will make you think how you tackle the situations, as every action you take will have consequences, and in the end it may be better to take the non-violent approach, no matter how unlikely that sounds. Add to it the fact that there is no one way of playing through this game, and the more times you replay this game, more new things you will find, it just adds to the replayability of this game to compensate for the game being  only 4-5 hours long. So if you're looking for a atmospheric thrill, with interesting characters, fantastic soundtrack, multiple endings, and a cat  I would absolutely recommend this game as it is a fantastic addition to the ever growing Indie video game library.

												This is still one of my favorite games ever. Is it sometimes reminiscent of Silent Hill? Absolutely. Does it feel like a clone? Not in the slightest. Does asking rhetorical questions make me feel like a phony? You betcha.Those looking to get the game for action-packed fights, or even more than one weapon, are going to be disappointed. The game is more about exploration and, in later playthroughs, taking care of yourself.The game sort of draws you in initially by seeming like your typical survival horror game, only pixelated and with really cool atmosphere. While it still does have really cool atmosphere, it becomes obvious very quickly that the story of this game is about more than just a zombie outbreak or whatever. In lots of ways, you could argue that all of that side of the game is just metaphorical anyway. While I wouldn't be able to confidently explain all aspects of the story, I can see some pretty touching themes about coping with loss, as well as free will vs. fate: Do you have the courage to keep moving on after loss, or will you just stagnate? Will you take your future into your own hands, or will you give in to what you believe is your ""true"" nature? The choices you make affect the ending of the game, and if you're anything like most people who have spent their lives being conditioned by videogames, you will get a pretty bad ending on your first try, which is in part due to the fact that killing enemies counts against your mental score. The idea of NOT killing living things in a survival horror game is going to feel very foreign, and sometimes, you're going to need to really work your brain to figure ways around conflict. It's really neat trying to find the ""good"" way to handle enemies rather than taking a gun to them, which the game clearly implicates as being the easy way out. It wants you to show some of the most powerful traits that human beings possess: resilience and compassion.In more direct terms of things, the game's just fun to look at, play, and listen to. Most of the time any item you pick up is going to be something unique. There are so many food items, and it's fun to try them out and see how the main character likes them. There's even some stuff with cooking later on, or other things you can do with the food. Sprites are all really well done. Music (or atmospheric sound) is always spot on. The game also keeps tossing in new twists or things to do and it never really gets old, despite never giving you more than one kind of gun (WHOA!).I guess that's about it. Some say the main character is kind of whiny, but I don't think those people really fully appreciate the kind of situation this guy is in, or for how long he's been in it. It's a cool game with a cool story and if you've gone through some kind of painful loss, there are definitely things that you could relate to in it. The creator, Jasper Byrne, is also a super cool guy who has even responded to emails I've sent him. Mr. Byrne, if for some reason you read this, hello, and I have bought three versions of this game. I'd love to see more like it.			"

Product received for free
This review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to both Steamified and Superflat Games for providing the key for review purposes.And here I thought that pixelated games can't be, in any way, scary. Now, it's safe to say that Jasper Byrne's Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut had proved me wrong, dead wrong. Originally a 2012 title and later updated to the Director's Cut version free of charge in 2013, Lone Survivor tells a story about a nameless man trying to survive in a world ravaged by a disease that turns almost, if not, all of it's inhabitants into mindless zombie-like monsters. Supplies dried, he's forced to leave his apartment behind after so long to forage provision and find other survivors while constantly trying to keep his sanity in check.This game is a purely a throwback to the survival horror goodness that games nowadays lack. The writing and visuals works excellent in portraying the madness of how the new world has become and the lines between reality and insanity becomes blurred with each passing day. The game plays in a 2D manner and you can navigate the masked man right and left, also facing the front and the back. Every level will have a map which you have to find and it's vital to keep your bearings intact because not only does the area looks vaguely similar at times but there's a chance that the room will appear differently when you came back. While exploring, you have to keep your hunger and tiredness in check, which are noted by dialogue cues. Items can be combine and cook to provide more significant bonuses when consumed. Lone Survivor also relies heavily on the pocket flashlight (Silent Hill, anyone?) which uses battery when lit. You can't examine things if there's no light so there's a need in moderation. Same goes with the handgun you'll find early on in the game. As you can already guess, ammo are scarce so more often then not, sneaking your way through would be the best course of action. The pixelated graphics works surprisingly well for the game! That, added with the amazing sounds and creepy lighting, will keep you on your toes whenever you enter a new area. Even though the monsters appear blocky at time, I can guarantee you that pants will be♥♥♥♥♥♥(or at least a little scream) when the thing suddenly lunges or jump up to the ceiling! The game also dealt with psychological horror aspects so do expect some disturbing scenes while playing. Despite the praises, Lone Survivor is no where a perfect title. The problem particularly arises from the controls in my view which I'll list them in a bit down below.PROSThis game is just plain CREEPY & DISTURBING! The setting, writing and the lighting sets up the mood quite nicely and oh boy, you're in for a scare! Be sure to turn the volume up as well!In general, the sound in the game is just fantastic and are bound to make your hair stands on a few occasions That damn screeching sound when the thing detects you...The soundtrack, if I might add, is just phenomenal. I highly recommend you picking up the DLC if you have the extra cash. The game runs exceptionally well, even in my dated PC, at a constant 60 FPS with no hiccups whatsoever.Resource management is pretty well done, although there are some that argue the hunger and tiredness increases to fast. I personally have no trouble with this since it encourages exploration and at the same time, that means facing unnecessary dangers.Multiple endings depending on your choices and state of mind at the end.CONSLack of any controller support. This is, by far, the biggest flaw that Lone Survivor has for me. I prefer an option to play my 2D side-scroller games with a controller, please. The keyboard control honestly felt a little off and I often misclick the buttons leading to my untimely, i.e. cheap, death. Oh, to make it worse, there's no way to reconfigure the controls and you can't exactly view the controls except when clicking the little note beside your bed. It's a shame since the game has already been updated to a Director's Cut version.There's no option to play the game in Windows mode, or at least not that I know of. I don't have any trouble with this since I play the game in full screen anyways but I'm sure there are others that appreciate the option to play in windowed mode.The game lacks all of the basic Steam functionality, even Cloud saving which is obviously stated on the store page! The overlay and screenshot works fine though.Relatively small pool of monsters to face.I find it weird that you can't change the direction of where your character is facing in shooting mode. If, for example, you have to deal with 2 monsters on each side, you have to manually exit shooting mode, turn the other side, and enters it again. Overall, I think Lone Survivor: The Director's Cut has been a fantastic experience! Despite the flaws in the game's controls, it managed to make me yell out quite a few times during key moments in the game and for that, I give it a horrifying 4 / 5! Highly recommended for any horror games fan!Personally, I think the price tag of $15 is a bit too steep for a 4 years old game but the game itself is pure gold and any survival horror enthusiasts shouldn't missed out on this. If you ever managed to find it on sale, then by all means, go for it. Money well spent, I say.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

												The main character can't survive for more than 10 minutes at a time before dying of starvation or exhaustion.

												Lone Survivor is a horror/adventure game, where you need to help the protagonist (named You) help survive in post apocalyptic city. I know it sounds familiar, but Lone Survivor has great story and it's very metaphorical.Gameplay focuses on getting out of the city and keeping your sanity, while doing this. So you need to gather food and keep your mental health high. Depending on how good is your mental health you will get an ending adequate to it.And the big plus for soundtrack, because it's really good.You need to get used to the graphics and you going to have a far more better horror experience than new Dead Space or F.E.A.R.

												This was the game that introduced me to the 2D survival horror genre. And while the idea of a lone guy in an apocalyptic world with zombie-like-monsters is seen too many times already, I would like to point out that that is not the highlight of the game. The highlight of the game is the sanity of our character, and thereby your sanity. The things that happen in this game are illogical (even by psychological game standards), and it hints at the story outside of our character's head. You will find yourself questioning most of what happens in this game like:Is there really an apocalypse?Is the characters you stumble across people from our protagonist's life or just reflections of his own mind?And what is up with that ending? (No matter what ending you get, this one counts).To top that off I think that the art style is wonderful, the controls are nice and the soundtrack is plain up amazing.I will say that your hunger and sleep meter could have been presented better than just the game spamming you with messages, but all in all I love this game. It is definitely one of my favorite survival horror games, if not my favorite.			"

												Lone survivor may at first seems like a normal horror game that you have played times and times before, but it's not. It got the thing that made Silent Hill 2 and IMSCARED Great.The main character is a nameless person and seems like he doesn't care for anything, not even his life. But he have a past and through the game you might get an idea of what the story is about if you took a close look. you will start to wonder if anything is real or if he just imagining everything because of his loneliness and depression, he's not crazy by any means but I think the game is symbolic for how he feel inside.There is a lot of optional quests to do in the game, but by the time you beat the game you will realise you haven't done a single quest, you will be lucky if you at least finished one quest. You will eventually know about the thing you missed after you finished your first run.The game is difficult because of the rarity of the bullets and batterys. I had to start the game from the beginning multiple times because I lost a lot of them and they are necessary to progress through the game.The Atmosphere in the game is one of the strongest in any video game I've ever played in my life. the soundtrack alone will give you the scares. I'll say the OST alone is enough reason to play the game. The game has one of the best soundtrack in all of video game history, It's not a surprise since the Composer/Designer is Jaspert Byrne, the same guy who made some of the music in Hotline Miami 1&2.The pixel art in the game is foggy and gloomy in the best possible way which helps the atmosphere and make it stronger.The game has ZERO Jumpscare which make the horror real and much more effective.You also have a sanity and a hunger meter that you can't see it but you can take care of it by taking care of the Lone Survivor by giving him food and letting him sleep when it's nesasary, but be careful for the food is rare and sleeping (or the lack of it) will have an effect on the ending you will get.There is Multiple Endings to the game but there is no Good or Bad ending, it's all about the things you see and how you take care of The Lone survivor.I won't spoile to much of the game I already said enough.All in All, the game is nothing short of a masterpiece and you can tell it was made with love and Jasper really loved survivor Horror games. It's heavily inspired by Silent Hill 2 and that's not a bad thing at all, the game gose for the old school survivor Horror rots and that's the best thing about it. You will enjoy the game especially if you like horror games or games that tells a surreal story in general.Definitely Play it       10/10			"

												To hear the full review, listen to the episode on Game Hoard Podcast[soundcloud.com](review starts at 22:30)Lone Survivor is a sidescrolling 2D survival horror game, largely inspired by Silent Hill. It's set in a zombie apocalypse of sorts and the story starts with the unnamed protagonist venturing out of his apartment for the first time since the infection started. Gameplay is fairly typical for the genre with a heavy emphasis on resource management and exploration. Unfortunately, I never really found the game that scary as health and ammo pickups were relatively common and I usually found it easier to just shoot mutants rather than trying to sneak by them. I also found the survival aspects somewhat underdeveloped. While having to worry about eating and sleeping in a horror game is interesting, it just became tedious because the character can barely leave his room without getting tired and hungry and you can't really craft much to help with it. I was never able to reach a place of sustainability in the game where survival became easier, which just felt unsatisfying. However, I did enjoy the level design, exploring, interacting with other survivors, and the general atmosphere of the game. Overall, I would recommend Lone Survivor to survival horror fans (especially those who like psychological horror games) but not to those seeking a game with good survival or action gameplay.			"

Bloody hard, too...if you don't like games where you have to be VERY careful about provisioning your ammo and what-not, this may not be the game for you.

												While not being the scariest horror game out there, Lone Survivor delivers an interesting story and enviorment. While the 2D gameplay feels a bit strange at first, after a while it all feels like it fits. The game itself is relatively short, it can easily be completed within 3-6 hours even if you go into it without any idea what you're doing. Though it's a very interesting game in itself, it has a few drawbacks. At regular intervals your character will constantly need food and rest, trying to attend to these needs can get frustrating at times. While the story and cutscenes are all interesting they are painfully cryptic, constantly leaving you guessing at what is happening. There are multiple endings, but two of them are nearly idendical, and getting the best ending is most likely impossible without some kind of walkthrough, as the hints to what you need to do in order to obtain those endings are extremly subtle. All in all, I think the experience is worth the price tag. Pros:   +The 8-bit graphics are very well-made   +Gameplay is unique   +Multiple paths and endings   +The enviroment and Story are eerie, disturbing, and interesting   +Great SoundtrackCons:   -If you're looking for a super-intense horror experience, you may want to look elsewhere   -Your character can be too needy    -Story is cryptic    -Getting better endings may require a walkthrough			"

 Surprisingly good adventure in 'Silent Hill' style Mass of positive reviews speak for themselves - this is indeed a very good adventure game. There is a heavy influence from Silent Hill series, but it's a great origin, to say the least. Pros:  Heavy, grim climax  Creepy  SNES gameplay styleCons: Story isn't clear at all, to say the least It's hard to understand its mechanics for a newbie player This game cries for achievements, but doesn't have any :(Overall, it's a very good title, worth buying definetely.

												No jumpscares, just ""silent hilly"" inspired anxiety.This game is pretty well conceived. The navigation throughout the map is kinda tricky at first (cause it's a 2D game in which you gotta move in a tridimentionally distributed environment) but the game is pretty stylish and the musics are marvellous.I'd suggest to wait for a good sale since this is not a game you will play much after you've completed it and even so, it is not a very long experience.

												Lone Survivor is simply an excellent title made by Jasper Byrne. It will make you shiver with its atmosphere, its marvelous music and its Silent Hill-esque sickness, who succeeds to propose an experience that will be remembered.It delves into the survival horror genre and offers an adventure that combines themes such fleeting desperation and fear with the incredible everyday survival.Every action can make difference bringing you to many finals, the choice's yours.Lone Survivor is a must-buy for the retrò-graphic/survival horror's fans and for who's looking for strong emotions.

												I absolutely loved this game. It has so much going for it, and I would love to see more from the creators! I've played through twice, and keep thinking about when I should play it again. I would really suggest giving this game a chance, perhaps your eyes are in for a little adjustment, but it is SO.WORTH.IT. Great music, characters, and awesome story to enjoy with the lights off, and volume up high. 9/10 hands down!			"

												An amazing horror game with a brilliant atmosphere that comes from a combination of a killer soundtrack, distorted pixel graphics, and themes from classic games of the genre. As a role-playing game, there are many unforeseen consequences that can come of each of your actions. The game can feel a little short, with maybe 2-5 hours per run, but with the multiple  possible endings and different high scores, it has a lot of replay value. This is the developer's best work yet; it's definitely worth picking up. TL;DR: needs Steam Achievements.			"

""The games of yesterday, today!""Indie games have something of a problem when it comes to wearing their inspirations on their sleeves. Time and again you'll hear touted roots in Legend of Zelda, Earthbound, 90s platformers - and in this case, Silent Hill. Lone Survivor hasn't so much said it's been inspired by Silent Hill as much as it has carved off James Sunderland's face and is proudly displaying it for the world to see.Especially fitting considering how paper thin and two-dimensional this game is compared to the real deal. Every part of this game is bad so we're going to break it down in steps. It's ugly. While predating the worldwide novelty of low resolution pixel art coming to a screeching halt, Lone Survivor manages to be ugly on its own merit. Filters, overlays and soft shading don't disguise the absolute amateur attempts at anything resembling human characters, to the point where it's legitimately hard to make out overall shapes, nevermind details. ""What the hell is that?"" is usually a response you want to body horror, not to regular bodies.This isn't aided by self defeating gameplay. You actually have 4 ways to deal with enemies:  You can set down an item that stuns them for a time  You can lure them past a hiding spot, or use an elongated hiding spot to shuffle past them  You can shoot them for damage  You can clear space by shooting their feet and forcing them backProblem is that the entire game is divided and dictated by a moral choice system that means you will only ever use two of these at a time. And with only two main enemy types in the game, this means that even with a 2-3 hour playtime, you're going to get bored. 2 hours and it manages to be a repetitive mess. Somehow even the sound direction manages to unimpress - the constant static that the zombies emit has beaten records in how quickly it gets annoying, and your classic Silent Hill ""panic tunes"" constantly trigger when there's nothing happening. Walking down an empty hallway? Time for some heartbeats and tempo. In a crowded room, 3 Thin Men and a Fatso right up your rear? No room for tunes, baby, not over all this ear-bending, monotonous screeching static.That's one Silent Hill classic element tossed to the winds. What about the other, what about the narrative? Good question. What about it?Every single character, plot line, ending, and interaction is obfuscated and muddled to the point of absurdity. Everything is a metaphor, or not really there, or is speaking in riddles with no answers that nothing prompted, and it all ends in a lovely ""Was it ever really real?"".It's pretentious trash. Everything is so completely convinced that it's all so deep and meaningful and smart, with every plot thread busy jamming its thumb up its colon. With the amount of theory-baiting this game does, the developer could have just thrown up a blank canvas with ""May as make up your own story, frankly we're not interested"" with a bullet point list of prompts to get you started. Who is ""her""? Why does the man wear a box? How many of these lines are just references to other, better games? You decide. ""You know my name, so why don't you say it?""All five endings over 9 hours. Three distinct ones, one incredibly minute variation, one joke ending. That represents 3.5 playthroughs, all done to explore if there really is any merit behind this game. Lone Survivor is for one niche - Silent Hill fans who are desperate for more similar content and don't mind a massive quality drop in everything. Made by a fan who couldn't see the forest for the trees, it's low grade imitation beef.The soundtrack is nice. You can buy that on bandcamp. Anything else, you're looking in the wrong place. I don't recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Lone Survivor: Director's Cut is considered one of the best games from the horror genre in 2012. I'm one of the people who agree with this, and had a great time playing. Lone Survivor puts you in the shoes of an unnamed character, usually referred to as ""You"" and is claiming to be the last human on Earth. You are on the brink of losing your sanity because of you being alone, and you're tested to see if you can truly keep your sanity or not. The plot can be a little cliché, but the sanity part keeps it from being overused. Although I do tend to prefer games that are more gameplay based, this one is an exception, along with a few others. Being from the horror genre, there isn't really much for the gameplay. If you expect a game where you have an arsenal of deadly weapons and you run around thinking you're Rambo, then trust me, you do NOT want to buy this game. DO NOT. However, when you are given the chance to go into combat against one of these enemies, the battle is usually very heated and fast paced, and the battle will end before you even know it.The graphics are probably the reason this game is popular. It provides a whole new view on the horror genre, using pixelated graphics to make you whine and scream for your mother in a corner with your stuffed animal. Okay, let's not push it THAT FAR. We'll get to the 'how scary is this' stuff later. I don't really have much to say, since pixelated graphics are more difficult for me to describe, other than it was done very well.The soundtrack is excellent, and while I, again, have not much to say, it was very well done and highly praise it. Not unforgettable, but it's something you'd probably enjoy listening to while you play.Now, for the part we've all been waiting for: How scary really is this game? Honestly, it's not really that creepy as it seems. When one of the enemies discovers you, then it can be a jump scare because of the sudden loud screeching you hear and the sudden change in the environment around you, but truthfully, even when playing this early in the morning, when it's still dark, and everyone is sleeping, with the sound up loud, this game isn't THAT scary.Overall, Lone Survivor was quite an experience, and it has many endings to choose from, which I had forgotten to mention earlier. It provides another take on the horror genre, and does it successfully. All though the plot was a bit overused with being the ""last man on Earth and blah blah blah"" kind of thing, this was still a game that is very interesting.Graphics- 7.5/10Gameplay- 5/10Story- 6/10Audio- 9.5/10Replayability- 5/10.:7.0/10:.+New take on the horror genre+Nice soundtrack+Heated gunplay (when it comes)-Overused plot-Isn't really that creepy			"

If a comparison can be made, it would have to be more Silent Hill than the current brand that holds that name. 9/10 (the ending is meh).			"

												This is a game that knows how to mess with your head, it's not just like any zombie apocolypse where you can just shoot all of the zombies and you're good to go, oh no, it's also not just a gme that focuses on survival, keeping you alive and happy is all you have to do? Think again, this game is also about keeping sane, eating rats and rotting meat, while talking to inanimate objects is the easy way out, but it's also a big no-no, and the game will punish you for it soon enough, what's crazy is the game has so much deliberate mystery, there are so many theories about the end, some that I have myself, this is a game you can replay and think to yourself ""Is this real? Is this fake? Has he done this before?"" It even has a great fear factor for a pixelated game? Ever heard the sounds they play if one of those things notice you? Heart attack worthy the first time.

This really is a scary game as it there is the the biggest real-life threat at all time, the unknown. Crafting is satisfying when found out, enemies send fear by their pressence, and puzzles make you appreciate resources to every battery.10/10 Would drop my last flare to stun two baddies to use my last bullets to kill their bro to get through the door just to escape only to have to save without bullet to make my final stand for a jar of pickles in the morning... again.

												I don't really get the trend of pixelated games so to speak and I tend to think games lose a lot when so much focus is spent on the stylistic aspect of the game rather than the storyline, game play, etc. I might have to reconsider that though because Lone Survivor is just fantastic in every way.Now I will be the first to admit that post apocolyptic stories have been over done a lot recently. Every other horror game seems to focus on similar ""monsters"", similar situations, and really  they're almost carbon copies of each other. And while Lone Survivor is not something I've never seen before (I found the storyline pretty straight forward even with the deeper issues that were supposed to be in play) I believe it's a fresh enough take to elevate it above most of the other games.One of the main reasons I really liked it is that you actually have to focus on taking care of your character. You need to feed him or he won't feel well (and boy will he let you know that) and you need to sleep, especially since that's how you save the game. To get a relatively good ending, by all accounts he has to have relatively good mental health. You're given more than one way to do things and jumping in with guns blazing is generally not the right way. Running away, hiding, distracting, and even scaring are all options and sometimes they're clearly the better ones.Of course because it's not really a game focused on fighting monsters, the gun controls are a little awkward and I can't say I'm fond of them. Your character moves really slowly when the gun is drawn and can only move backwards and forward facing the same direction so if something comes up behind you, you're screwed. And admittedly sometimes, you do just want to kill the monsters because constantly having to sneak past them gets annoying. So while I get the point of hiding and sneaking rather than shooting, it can get a little trying.That being said it's clear that the developer wanted this to be an experience that you remembered based on its merits alone not for being needlessly frustrating. You never really have to spend a lot of time needlessly backtracking. As you progress through the building and city you unlock shortcuts that make it easy to resume in the same general area you need to be in once you've slept. If you run out of ammo or food or batteries and can't manage to find any while you're exploring, you are able to get it in a couple different ways (even if it's not always recommended). And because of these little details, you're able to focus on actually playing the game itself.			"

												Bought Lone Survivor at launch years back and was very happy to see it on steam.Silent Hill 2 meets David Lynch. Jasper Byrne (the creator) is a huge Silent Hill fan and you can feel the love for that atmosphere in this game without it feeling like a 2D Silent Hill. It has its own identity and ideas.Lone Survivor is a short game with a really cold atmosphere. That detached loneliness that reverberated from Silent Hill is very palpable.Rather than boo scares, what LS gives is a dreaded loneliness. That feeling of being in a world that is inhuman and hurt. It is an atmosphere I haven't seen in a Survival Horror game in a long time, and one that is impeccably crafted. This is an emotional game while avoid the melodrama present in so many other mediums.Combat is extremely basic, in true Survival Horror fashion. You will often find yourself trying to figure out how to get through an area without fighting. Gameplay is challenging without being frustrating. The atmosphere is preserved and this is not the kind of game where you will need to retry a section 50 times. There are always multiple ways to solve a challenge, giving you an important element of control.This is not a long game, it has multiple endings and clocks at about 4.5 hours. But it is done incredibly well. If you enjoy Survival Horror this is a must-buy. It is a heartfelt, amazing achievement at breathing life back into a dying genre.			"

												One of those games, where u empathize with the character. Its not a survival horror like any other with 50 kg guns, zombies, blood and jump scares. This one have atmosphere, it shows serious meaning of sadness and depression from being alone and helpless. You must scavenge for food supplies and water. You can cook and mix food. You can shoot and kill but u can always hide. And the most important of it all, you must keep the balance of your sanity. This game is just a masterpiece, its an art with a beautiful and sad story of the alone guy and his behavior depending on ""outside"" of his apartment. I was so curious, what will be next on his path, that i spent my whole day on it. This path and his behavior depends on your choices in game, so think about it when u want to kill ""something"" or just escape your reality and swallow another blue or red pill.It has it scary moments: not a jump scares, but creepy, helpless atmosphere.Music in this game is one of the best soundtracks i have heard.A cheap, silent hill atmosphere game with great music and sad story. ""Depression Simulator 2012 with monsters and scary atmosphere""   10/10Just give this game a try and it will be placed on your top 10 games. Trust me i have a fear of depression now. :<			"

												2D Silent Hill is an apt descriptor here: Its map system, monster design, sound cues and lighting are all meant to evoke that particular classic, and with a less than a quarter of the pixels and none of the polygons, it succeeds. But it's also got an adolescent bent to it, and as with Silent Hill 2, its fear comes from the psychological underpinnings of its protagonist.Extraordinarily tense and beautiful to look at, Lone Survivor is at times alternately terrifying, puzzling and touching, and above all else it's fun. It's a game that's fun to play, fun to talk about, fun to figure out. You won't always know what's going on, even after the credits roll, but you get the idea that the creator and characters do. You get a sense of complete world, much of it outside the frame. So I call it a success. Play this.			"

This game IS hard if you don't get the jump on the enemies, but that's all part of the atmosphere. The music is spot-on for a moody, apocolyptic feel, and overall is soothing to the ears.

												It's obvious this game was inspired by the Silent Hill franchise with it's great audio presentation and twisted plot.  The graphics style pulls off deliberately lacking visuals, which, in a horror game, is a good thing when visual details are shrouded in mystery, and not hi-rez and in your face.  Unfortunately, now we come to the gameplay ... all 4 hours of it.  Due to the 2D perspective, the map is difficult to follow and encounters with the 3 total monster types often leave you with no choice but to shoot them, as avoiding them is only possible in a few context sensitive areas.  Survival through food and rest feels off because there is no meter to tell how badly you need either, except for the main character complaining without warning.  Finally, the story becomes complete nonsense the further you progress, leaving tons of questions un-answered to where horror game veterans may sense a common ending cliche approaching.  A triumph in atmosphere, but lacking elsewhere.  Tread lightly!			"

There's ""horror"" such as Dead Space, and then there's true horror, the kind with no jump-scares, no shockers - watching a man who we only know as You evade, distract, gun down and murder abominations through a bleak and bloodstained world presented with a dark mystery from which the mind can only struggle to crawl out of and find itself deeper, days and weeks after putting it down.I believe it began as a tribute to Silent Hill, but the end result is so much of its own entity that the label is, if anything, diminishing; Lone Survivor is right up there on Silent Hill's level in its own way, not an echo or a copy, but standing firm and fast on its own two feet, proud and damn tall. It captures the atmosphere and true fear in a way that only an indie developer could.			"

												Bought Lone Survivor at launch years back and was very happy to see it on steam.Silent Hill 2 meets David Lynch. Jasper Byrne (the creator) is a huge Silent Hill fan and you can feel the love for that atmosphere in this game without it feeling like a 2D Silent Hill. It has its own identity and ideas.Lone Survivor is a short game with a really cold atmosphere. That detached loneliness that reverberated from Silent Hill is very palpable.Rather than boo scares, what LS gives is a dreaded loneliness. That feeling of being in a world that is inhuman and hurt. It is an atmosphere I haven't seen in a Survival Horror game in a long time, and one that is impeccably crafted. This is an emotional game while avoid the melodrama present in so many other mediums.Combat is extremely basic, in true Survival Horror fashion. You will often find yourself trying to figure out how to get through an area without fighting. Gameplay is challenging without being frustrating. The atmosphere is preserved and this is not the kind of game where you will need to retry a section 50 times. There are always multiple ways to solve a challenge, giving you an important element of control.This is not a long game, it has multiple endings and clocks at about 4.5 hours. But it is done incredibly well. If you enjoy Survival Horror this is a must-buy. It is a heartfelt, amazing achievement at breathing life back into a dying genre.			"

												Are you a Silent Hill fan? Or a horror fan? Or maybe, you just love post-apocalypse setting? Than you will love that game.It's very clear, that the game was highly inspired by the Silent Hill series. Setting, monsters, atmosphere, - all that has definitely come from there, You might say, that it was a bad decision, just to take the idea from one game and to apply it in another, but it was not the case, really. Because this time it was not about to take and to apply, it was about adding something very new in genre.GraphicsThere is nothing special about the graphics here. A very popular way of decorating - 2D-pixel one was used here. If you are not a huge indie-game fan, that might be a little problem at first, but then you will get used to it and realise that this was the best type of graphic that could be used in the game - because there are a few details in the game that your imagination creates, your own vision of the protagonist, the people he contacts with, the monsters - just as book does.Sound and musicEven here it is easy to identify that the game was inspired by Silent Hill. Some in-game sounds are very similar to the ones you have heard in the SIlent Hill series. However, sounds here are great and it is impossible to say that they are bad or too cheap.The music here is a pure masterpiece. Inspired by Akira Yamaoki's guitars and synths, that multi-genre soundtrack will stuck on your MP3-player for the next 2 months. From melancholic guitar to a disturbing noise - you can find here everything you loved in Akira Yamaoka's soundtrack.Gameplay""Lone Survivor"" is a 2D-survival horror. You have to move from left side of screen to the right one and back. There will be monsters so you have to face and shoot them or just go behind them. You can pass the game without even shooting to monsters. However, gameplay is not something revolutionary here, but, in this case, it is an advantage, because it helps you to concentrate on setting and on storyline.Setting and storylineAs I have said it above, the setting is truly inspired by Silent Hill, and here it seems as a briliant idea. All the details from there are realised well. In fact, they were set in the game as the creator of it had worked on a original Silent Hill game. There is nothing that might be unnecessary, every detail, every word, every event - all these are truly on its places.The storyline is good too. All the human characters are very interesting and it is exciting to see how they react on the protagonist and how protagonist reacts on them. There are 3 endings depend on the way you play, so it is more interesting to complete the game again in order to see the rest endings after you finished ""Lone Survivor"" once.ConclusionThe game creates a very special effect on you. After the game, you would feel yourself as you've just finished one of the Silent Hill games. Was it a hero's dream? Or was it for real there? The answer is up to you, because there are a lot of facts for and against it.All in all, the game is worth its money. If you are still thinking whether you should buy it, I would say: buy it. ""Lone Survivor"" is not a very long game, so you do not have to play in it for days, but the time you spend here will be unforgetable.			"

												Lone Survivor plays out like a haunting love letter to Silent Hill 2. Lone Survivor manages to create a deeply emmersive horror atmosphere with simplistic (albeit beautiful) 2D pixel art.  For the past couple years, it has been my goal to collect and play any and all horror titles I can find and Lone Survivor maintains its place as my favorite indie horror experience.			"

												This game really manages to capture the atmosphere of the Silent Hill franchise and translate it successfully to the 2D space. I didn't think it would manage it but it really brings up many of the same feelings of dread and apprehension that I had when guiding James Sutherland through Silent Hill 2. It's a very atmospheric game.			"

												This game is 'tense', but it's a very interesting game. The game is in a lot of aspects similar, of course, to Silent Hill, and sometimes reminds me of Twin Peaks in its 'lounge music' cutscenes. The story is short, but intriguing. After all, it was a nice experience (but not a comfortable one).			"

												Personally my favorite game.The audio in it has a perfect horror stage like feel, it each area, each floor, each enemy, it fits so well.The gameplay is immense, there are around I believe 4 endings, the one's I've gotten are Red, and Blue. Both spectacular.The art-style like texturing, is pretty amazing, I love the feel of a small bit game. Examples of 8 and 16.The music in this game is rediculously good. And the thought of this being made by just one person, is rather shocking.I highly recommend this game, it goes on sale a lot. It gives you the choice to kill the optional enemies or not.Best music to me = Sleep Forever, I believe Sleep Forever is played during the red, blue, and blue 2 endings.Awesome game.			"

												Es prcticamente un Silent Hill pero en 2D. Aunque quizá no lo parezca, LOGRA DAR BASTANTE MIEDO Y TENSIÓN. De hecho, se me hizo complicado jugar a oscuras. Tiene bastante de survival, tenés que comer, dormir y con ello regular la estabilidad mental del personaje, lo que al final da uno de los diferentes endings. Jugarlo manteniendo al máximo la estabilidad mental es la opción más difícil y larga. Para ello vas a tener que pasarlo sin matar a ningún bicho, entre otras cosas. De los gráficos obviamente no voy a opinar, pero sí del estilo artístico, que me parece genial, y lo mismo con la trama. Los sonidos y la BSO son TREMENDOS. El punto malo es que es muy corto, aunque seguramente muchos lo rejueguen para sacar otro ending. La verdad, más allá de la duración es excelente.			"

												Lone Survivor is a 2D sidescrolling, pixel-based survival horror game that reminded me a lot of Silent Hill 2. Much like James Sutherland, Lone Survivor's protagonist searches an apartment complex that's overrun with zombies while a noise layer obscures vision. Also, much like Silent Hill 2, the threat may possibly be more psychological in origin than real.The game has multiple endings, and if you play it like you would an action game - shooting everything in sight while not caring much about the actual ""survival"" elements, you'll likely end up with one of the ""bad"" endings. This left a sour impression on my first play because of the character's constant nagging for food and sleep, and the ending I got seemed nonsensical.But if you play the game more how it's meant to be played, the hero bothers you less, and you could put yourself on a path to one of the better endings, which reveals more what the story is really about. You'll probably also pay more attention to the clues here and there and get a better sense of everything on a replay. So, those extra endings are really worth going for, though it probably won't hurt to look at a FAQ to be sure you'll get them. I ended up coming to appreciate the game much more as a result, and it certainly doesn't hurt that the soundtrack is excellent, too.And one of the things you can do is adopt a kitty! Bonus points just for that!Rating: 3.5/5			"

												Although I have not written a review in a while, I can still vividly recall my month-long indie game spree, beginning with Devolver Digital’s Hotline Miami and culminating in Superflat Games’ Lone Survivor, which I will be reviewing today. Lone Survivor bills itself as a post-apocalyptic survival horror game in which the player controls an unnamed protagonist who spends his days exploring the dark hallways of his apartment complex in search of companionship amidst a “zombie” apocalypse. What distinguishes Lone Survivor from other survival horror games is twofold: everything is rendered in 2D, an aesthetic choice not typically associated with the horror genre, and it was all made by one man, Jasper Byrne. So is immersion still possible in such unconventional circumstances? Read on to find out!The moment you launch Lone Survivor, you can easily see the amount of care Byrne has put into his game. Each pixel is carefully placed and every nuance, from the character animations to the background scenery, is extremely detailed. While some may argue that the pixelated composition of the game’s monsters and objects makes visual cues all the more confusing, I personally found the art style helpful in simultaneously maintaining an aura of mystery and urging the player’s own imagination to take hold. Equally as impressive is the game’s soundtrack which features not only your eerie but generic horror music, but also soothing guitar riffs which supplement the more lighthearted segments of the game.In addition to its survival horror roots, Lone Survivor also prides itself in being a psychological thriller—and with good reason. The plot is all sorts of crazy, and to even mention any particular event in detail would be a potential spoiler. Unfortunately, this also makes the ending a bit easier to guess as all the nonsensical happenings can only suggest so much. Maybe there is a twist waiting at the end of the journey. Maybe there isn’t. Maybe the twist is that there is no twist! Lone Survivor’s narrative, or at least its method of storytelling, isn’t its strongest quality. However, that is not to say that its world lacks depth. Byrne did a fantastic job with the writing. None of the dialogue I came by struck me as cringe-inducing. Quite the opposite: every word uttered by the protagonist effectively fleshes out his character and conveys his feelings of hopelessness.But what really matters, beneath the aesthetics and story, is the gameplay and it is with this that I have my biggest gripe. I wouldn’t go as far as claiming that the mechanics behind Lone Survivor are bad, but I found them rather frustrating. There are some stealth elements present such as hiding behind curtains to avoid monsters, but there is no sense of danger once concealed and it all boils down to waiting for the creature to pass by. At some point in the game, the protagonist will acquire a firearm but the aiming mechanism hinders its usefulness. Shots can only be fired at 45 degree angles, making it difficult hit foes at their weak points until they are too close for comfort. What I did grow fond of were the survival aspect of the game, which encourages resource management and exploration, and its side quests, which help further flesh out the post-apocalyptic world our protagonist finds himself in.Lone Survivor is a decent indie title that can be had for a dollar or two plus change during any video game sale. For the three plus hours of entertainment to be had, this is far from a bad deal. If the idea of a psychological thriller told with unconventional visuals appeals to you, there is no reason you shouldn’t make the purchase. But I suppose if you stand adamantly against pixelated graphics, the survival horror genre, or supporting stellar developers, then there really is no convincing you, is there?Grade: 3/5			"

												I honestly never heard of this game up until I have seen it on the Steam Holiday Sale. My curiosity got the best of me and decided to give it a shot because the game claims to be a survival horror. But in 2D? That’s just crazy.After playing and completing the game, I can officially say that Lone Survivor is nothing short of a masterpiece and I don’t use that term lightly especially when it comes to a survival horror/adventure game. The game can be easily summed up as a Silent Hill 2 2D side scrolling game. So does that mean is it scary? I wouldn’t go down that line but more like psychology creepy. Because you don’t know what is real or not and yet you have to deal with weird looking monster by either shooting them, distracting them or hide out of plain sight just to pass by them. The game creator Jasper Byrne has really put a lot of effort by taking the 16 bit graphics and turning it into something special. The added mosaic textures and grainy effects makes this game visually stunning. Not to mention that he has created an original soundtrack specifically for this game that will sink into your ear holes and brain waves as soon as you run the game. Its games like this make me appreciate Indie games a lot more than big publisher companies that make AAA games like Capcom or Konami who have completely lost their roots to what made their own original survival horror  games a legend. If you're a true survivor horror adventure fan, give this game a go. You will not be disappointed. *TRVIA*--- Jasper Byrne also has some of his original soundtracks in Hotline Miami which was nominated as Game Of The Year of 2012.			"

												I never was a fan of survival horror games. The Resident Evils (pre 4) and Silent Hills were never my thing. However, for whatever reason, I loaded this up and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It's pretty simple and accessible for the genre. You've still got to eat and sleep, but thankfully, an unlimited inventory and fast travel points back to your bed make this much less annoying.It's got that ""retro"" pixelated look that 98% of indie games have, but here you can actually SEE the blocks that make up the character and items. Despite this, it's still got a strong horror atmosphere and it was unsettling exploring some of the areas. Like a lot of indie games, it's got a decent soundtrack with a few songs I could probably listen to outside of the game.The most interesting aspect is the ""mental health"" system. It seems that almost every action you take affects it somehow and therefore, what ending you get.  I went in without knowing that all my actions were being recorded and got a less than desireable ending. However, a second playthrough wouldn't take nearly as long as the first and will add a new challenge in keeping the character in good mental health.If you got it in the humble indie bundle, try it out. If not, grab it at 75% off next time.			"

												In Lone survivor, you control the titular survivor of some kind of apocalypse that has left the majority of the population as faceless monsters that wander around searching for prey. ""You,"" as the game refers to the player character, wake up in your apartment and seek a way out into the surrounding city streets. The problem is the apartment building You are in is in shambles, leaving doors locked, hallways in ruins, and more than a few monsters running around.Right from the get go, this feels like an early Silent Hill game. Despite the very simple pixel based graphics and the side scrolling perspective, the game manages to hav a good atmosphere of tension and dread. It uses its limited perspective to its advantage, leading to a lot of atmospheric touches.It's a good thing that it has atmosphere, too, because the story is a bit all over the place. You run across a few different characters throughout your journey, and they usually serve as some sort of source of goods and supplies, while also asking You cryptic questions that don't make a whole lot of sense. Unfortunately, this is one of those games that, I have a feeling, needs to be played through numerous times in order to fully grasp what's going on, because the ending I got was anticlimactic at best and confusing at worst. I'm not someone who needs everything spelled out for me, but the vague nature of the game is a tad frustrating.Still, this is a worthwhile survival horror game. As mentioned above, it's very creepy and manages to feel old school thanks to its hunger and ammo systems. You must constantly explore to find more supplies and ammo, meaning conservation and planning are a must. Give this game a shot if you like games such as Silent Hill or are itching for something highly atmospheric.			"

If the idea of a psychological thriller told with unconventional visuals appeals to you, there is no reason you shouldn’t make the purchase. But I suppose if you stand adamantly against pixelated graphics, the survival horror genre, or supporting stellar developers, then there really is no convincing you, is there?Grade: 3/5			"

												I honestly never heard of this game up until I have seen it on the Steam Holiday Sale. My curiosity got the best of me and decided to give it a shot because the game claims to be a survival horror. But in 2D? That’s just crazy.After playing and completing the game, I can officially say that Lone Survivor is nothing short of a masterpiece and I don’t use that term lightly especially when it comes to a survival horror/adventure game. The game can be easily summed up as a Silent Hill 2 2D side scrolling game. So does that mean is it scary? I wouldn’t go down that line but more like psychology creepy. Because you don’t know what is real or not and yet you have to deal with weird looking monster by either shooting them, distracting them or hide out of plain sight just to pass by them. The game creator Jasper Byrne has really put a lot of effort by taking the 16 bit graphics and turning it into something special. The added mosaic textures and grainy effects makes this game visually stunning. Not to mention that he has created an original soundtrack specifically for this game that will sink into your ear holes and brain waves as soon as you run the game. Its games like this make me appreciate Indie games a lot more than big publisher companies that make AAA games like Capcom or Konami who have completely lost their roots to what made their own original survival horror  games a legend. If you're a true survivor horror adventure fan, give this game a go. You will not be disappointed. *TRVIA*--- Jasper Byrne also has some of his original soundtracks in Hotline Miami which was nominated as Game Of The Year of 2012.			"

												A 2D survival-horror game? Surely you jest. No, I'm dead serious, and Lone Survivor is an amazing game. It captures the feel of retro survival-horro games perfectly and is, at times, genuinely scary. As I say in many reviews, this is not a game for all tastes, but I do offer this my highest recommendation.			"

												I never was a fan of survival horror games. The Resident Evils (pre 4) and Silent Hills were never my thing. However, for whatever reason, I loaded this up and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It's pretty simple and accessible for the genre. You've still got to eat and sleep, but thankfully, an unlimited inventory and fast travel points back to your bed make this much less annoying.It's got that ""retro"" pixelated look that 98% of indie games have, but here you can actually SEE the blocks that make up the character and items. Despite this, it's still got a strong horror atmosphere and it was unsettling exploring some of the areas. Like a lot of indie games, it's got a decent soundtrack with a few songs I could probably listen to outside of the game.The most interesting aspect is the ""mental health"" system. It seems that almost every action you take affects it somehow and therefore, what ending you get.  I went in without knowing that all my actions were being recorded and got a less than desireable ending. However, a second playthrough wouldn't take nearly as long as the first and will add a new challenge in keeping the character in good mental health.If you got it in the humble indie bundle, try it out. If not, grab it at 75% off next time.			"

												Lone Survivor tells a story an amnesic protagonist's survival through a ruined city, which its inhabitants appears to have changed into aggressive faceless creatures. It is a side-scrolling survival psychedelic horror game.The mechanics of the game encourages the player to maintain their protagonist's health by sleeping and eating.Each time the character sleeps, which saves the game, the day also progresses. This made me consider the actions I took throughout the day was limited, even though it did not explicitly define a day night cycle.There character's awareness/fatigue seems to affect your character's performance against combat situations.And food is associated with the character's HP and also seems to determine whether if it heals or not during sleep.Even though serving a core gameplay purpose, these seemingly mundane actions plays a larger role in my experience in the game. It made me wonder if my actions defined the protagonist's character.The protagonist is given a handgun to defend himself. The shooting is rather basic, there's only three preset angles I can shoot at, up, straight, or down. This forces the me to rely on options rather than just my shooting skills. Such as, to line up a head shot I'll need to move the character closer to the enemy, thus risking the chances of being harmed. Otherwise, I can shoot straight which allows me to keep my distance. Additionally, you can only aim the handgun in one direction while firing. To switch directions, the gun needs to holstered before the character can be turned around.There is also the option to just avoid all conflict and use stealth to sneak past enemies. I found this, however, frustrating. As the options given for stealth is limited to only one path. Additionally, I would have to put up a blind faith that the path is viable. The game gives no indication that I could have failed the stealth before even completing it. I found myself spending time waiting for an opportunity to sneak past an enemy to only find myself minutes later that the path back out is blocked, as the enemy would not move from its position no matter how long I wait, causing me to resort to guns blazing.The puzzles in Lone Survivor served as a way to guide the player throughout the game. It is presented one at a time, rather than a typical adventure game puzzle where you combine items and use your wits to accomplish multiple puzzles at once. Another critique, the puzzle items seems to apply to only one puzzle, and is not automatically discarded afterwards, leaving me wondering if it could be used elsewhere.Overall, even with a slow start, what kept me in the game was its subtle tension well as the mystery behind the protagonist.Eventually, leading up to a conclusion which makes me crave a re-play for the secret and alternative endings.

												This had such a massive potential to be the best Silent Hill game since Silent Hill 2. Everything from the art direction, music, sound and story are inspired by that series and are very well made. Unfortunately the game ends suddenly. I was expecting the final location to be a whole new chapter with new areas to explore, that would build on the ideas presented earlier and nicely wrap up the story... but it just triggered a final cut-scene. Even though it is short and has some minor flaws, I highly recommend this game.Pros:+ Interesting story.+ Great atmosphere, music and sound design inspired by Silent Hill games.+ Option to kill everything or completely avoid all confrontations.+ Side quests.+ Boss encounters.Cons:- Very short.- Infinite resources make the game too easy after a certain point.- Expert mode doesn't increase difficulty or change the game in any significant way.- Super low resolution graphics. The game's native resolution is around 160x100 pixels. For comparison, even NES supported up to 256x240. Sometimes it is hard to tell what you are looking at.- The game is dark and is recommended to be played in a dark room, but all the speech text is very big and bright when played in fullscreen, causing me eye strain and headaches.

												I was really impressed by this game. Considering how many recent survival horror titles try to involve different, more ""realistic"" mechanics and graphics to immerse the player, ""Lone Survivor"" takes a step back, to an older, seamingly more simple style, 2D pixel graphics and a set of few, but crucial mechanics.It may seem too simple at first: No big story, it's the end of the world and you have to survive, only a few objectives to look after, get food, consider how to defend yourself, don't waste to much bullets, run, hide if you must, scavange food, don't forget to rest and maybe try to find out, what is going on in the first place. But, if you try to commit to the game and it's setting, the simplicity itself may be the key, to what really makes this game so exciting: Your mind! You start to wonder, ""what is actually going on here?"", start to think about the few decisions you have to make ""shoot, run, hide? should i eat the last scraps i got now, or should i wait a little longer?"" and you realise how the atmosphere of the game is changing, shifting according to the state the character is in, if you don't eat or sleep, the screen starts to become blurry, it may show things which might or might not be there and all the rest is up to what your fantasy is constructing around the frame the game is providing you with.And then, after a few hours, the game is over. If you just didn't like the style, maybe you'll shrug it off as not very interesting. But if you liked it, this short game will still stick to you for a while longer, as it should be the case with good games. Maybe you'll want to play it again in a few years, the graphics are ""old"" already anways, or show it to someone else, because it doesn't take much to get through anyways.However, i think it's a small, but very exciting gem of a game and definetly worth the time and money invested.

												You wake up in the small side apartment on the second floor. The radio talks nonsense, there’s no food and all your neighbors are now scary pixelated monsters. It’s hard to tell if they have become zombies or some other♥♥♥♥♥♥has happened to them. The game isn’t heavy with going on the specifics of what is actually happening. This is an abstract story of a nameless protagonist, swallowing pills that change his dreams and exploring the building and its nearest surroundings.Going outside is dangerous and challenging. Monsters can kill you easily; avoiding them is the preferred course of action. Ammunition is scarce. Rooms and corridors are dark. Batteries for the flashlight don’t last long. On top of that the character has to eat and sleep. And take those pills before having psychedelic dreams in which he talks with a man wearing a box for the hat.A deconstructed version of classic survival horrors, Lone Survivor keeps only the most core features of them. 3D world is among them. This is a rare for 2D metroidvanias, most of them use a door for nothing more than a couple of completely separate rooms. Lone Survivor makes use of its scene. Corridors go around the floor, intersect with each other and make a dense maze that you have to study. Two sections of hiding in the shadows, turn to the left, then to the right, enter the gaping fleshy hole in the wall, find the new key, some canned fruit salad or even another survivor. So, no, you’re not really lone. But at least you’re survivor. You’ve got that gas can for the stove. There were a few very scary zombies in that dark corner where you’ve found this can, but you’ve managed to pass them unnoticed. Tonight you’ll eat some cooked ham. Who knows if you’ll be that lucky tomorrow?Packing a lot of action on such relatively small map makes the game tense. The best compliment for a survival horror. The requirement of enough variety and challenge forces most metroidvanias with the flat world map to resort to some kind of red herring like gigantic elevators in Metroid. It’s a neat way of separating the parts of the world and still preserving the integrity of it. Extravagant ride on the carriage with undead horses in Bloodborne is essentially the same thing. Of course it’s more noticeable this way. You can now separate the “main” part of the world from this one. What you didn’t notice yet though is that “main” parts consists of such “separate” ones. Their connections are more believable. They could be one level from a technical standpoint, they could be separate ones — it doesn’t matter. You can still percept them as a whole. Lone Survivor is very careful with its level design. Architecture may make no sense when put in the actual 3D perspective, but the protagonist seems to be delusional anyway.A small geographical anomaly is easy to overlook when you try to precisely target a zombie slowly coming at you. Perhaps, even easier than the supposedly unexpected subplot-which-was-the-actual-plot-you-fool. The game rather mimics the melancholic tone of Twin Peaks than its mystery; to the point that it manages to end anticlimactically. Those green, red and blue ending sequences are still better than their counterparts in Mass Effect 3, but they too are nowhere near the legitimately scary journey through post-apocalyptic nightmare that has preceded them.

												Great concept, bad execution.  It uses the same morality system that would later be put to better use in Undertale - the more enemies you spare, the better your ending - but here, they're just mindless zombies instead of developed characters, so there's no reason to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about them.The other factors that contribute to your ending are almost random and have to be discovered through trial-and-error.  Unless you use a strategy guide, it takes multiple playthroughs to figure it out.  And - my opinion, at least - the game just isn't fun enough to make it worthwhile.That's because there it has plenty of other great ideas that just don't work that well in practice.  For example...You have some flares to blind the zombies with, and a gun you're not supposed to use, but you will.  Each flare lasts all of ten seconds and the gun's aiming mechanism is bizarre: you have to be within melee range to get headshots.  You can sneak past one of the two types of zombie, but that just becomes a long, slow exercise in tedium after a while.You get maps, but since it's a side-scroller, figuring out which direction corresponds to which is a pain.You have to eat and sleep, also good ideas, but the game is so short, you'd only need a tin of beans and a power nap in real-time.  So the dev makes up for it by your player character complain about being hungry and tired every five minutes, knocking off karma points every time. This would be fine if it spelled out that the in-game times and distances were greater than what it shows you...  But they're not.  You live in a normal-sized building, in a city with normal-sized blocks, that take a normal amount of time to walk across.  Apparently, you just can't function on any less than 23 hours sleep a day and constant meals.  Also, about sleeping: the game docks you points for sleeping too much, too little, irregularly, and when you're hungry.  But you HAVE to sleep in order to save.  Want to pop back home for a quick save after cheating death or unlocking the next area?  Too bad, you're losing points.-SPOILERS-Worst of all, there's no reason to care about getting a good ending in the first place.  The story's so vague it might as well not exist, and what little you get of it is pretty cliched: you have amnesia, a psychotic disorder, and a dead wife (the Horror Game Protagonist Starter Kit), you keep hallucinating people who toss you hints at a distant plot, and it's likely the apocalypse is just a delusion.  But an observant player can figure that out early in the game, so no matter which ending you get, it won't clarify things any further.(As a side note, the final boss is also the most anticlimactic I've seen in a long time.  Its roar is scarier than the fight.)But the game DOES deserve credit for its atmosphere and the lack of cheap jumpscares.  The soundtrack is also as good as everyone says, so I'll give it that.  Although I'm not recommending it, I wouldn't advise anyone against buying it, either, if you're into retro horror games.			"

												An attempt at silent hill-esque survival horror, but the gameplay is more confusing than terrifying.  There were so many instances of the character blacking out, hallucinating, or dreaming in the first few minutes of the game in response to situations that might kill him that I haven't even been able to determine whether or not the player character can actually die.  It limited the possibility of tension and left me disinterested in the plot.  I can't imagine playing an entire game as disjointed as the first thirty minutes or so of this one.			"

As well as this, it shows that fancy graphics arn't required to scare you, the ominous and well-made soundtrack is catchy and stays in your head, while on the game and off of it. The game is about choices: stealth or action, drugs or no drugs. The game and its atmosphere is morphed and changed by the choices you make, allowing a unique experience everytime you play.In short: 10/10.			"

""We're all in this together""Lone Survivor is a 2D survival horror game. You play the role of You who lost in the abandoned apartment block must make his way out. It won't be easy though. You don't have much food, medicine, ammo and you have to pass countless corridors full of danger. Finishing the game left me with mixed feelings. The whole experience was sometimes very enjoyable and often annoying. The game has a great soundtrack. It doesn't consist of many tracks but they all contribute to a nice lonely, unsettling atmosphere. It's also got an openly interpretated plot. The story may seem confusing. No, actually it is very confusing.You don't know who you (he?) really are. Was it all just a dream or?However it's obviously not perfect. One of the most annoying things I encountered were controls. Can you imagine not being able to turn around while pointing your gun at enemies? Yes. It does happen.The game is pretty hard itself and its mechanics make it even harder. You get hungry a few minutes after having a tin of pickles and sleepy 10 minutes after waking up. When you die, that happens quite a lot, you need to wait for the game over sequence and then re-load the game from the main menu. When you screw up, you can either find someone/something to kill you or quit the game and load it from the main menu.Maps... The game is a 2D side-scroller so the in-game maps will probably make you confused. I couldn't get used to the map system till the very end.Although playing it is not always a pleasant experience, the game is worth a try. You can do it.			"

												Yeeeah, I see the Lynch Comparison, The Dialogue definately reminds me of Eraserhead/Naked Lunch. Never watched Twin Peaks. (*update: I'm over half way through with Season 2 now and it's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome) I ""liked"" the game the first playthrough....got frustrated at times, but I enjoyed it. I'd say it's more of a Psychological Thriller than a Horror game...I was never scared at any point, it just has a really creepy, ambient vibe. I was compelled to try for another ending and LOVED the second playthrough, even though I got the same ending. I enjoy it enough that I'm going to atleast get the White and Yellow endings next. *Edit - Got all the endings. ♥♥♥♥ing amazing game.**Edit 2 - I just wanted to play it again, try some new recipes and stuff....getting the White Ending a second time was really emotional since I had taken the time to analyze what exactly was going on.10/10, gonna be a classic for me.Make sure you don't set it to ""Expert"" on your first playthrough. (selecting the ""Scared"" option is ""Normal"", not easy or anything like you might think. Like I thought.I'd strongly recommend using Xpadder or Joy2Key to set up your gamepad.Oh yeah, I don't see many people comparing it to ""Maniac Mansion"", which is clearly an inspiration, also confirmed by a cameo from ""Chuck the Plant"".

												If you enjoy games that give you a reason to rethink what happened, what was it, what are the meanings of this and that and that leave a little hole in your soul then I'd recommend this game.It's not about the thrilling graphics, it's not about a 200 hour game, it's not about a ""zombie and survival"" game or playing with your buddies... It's about an alone experience that will make you wish to go through all possible endings about what happened to ""You"", to ""Her"", who is the ""Man Who Wears a Box"" and ""The Director"". It's about mental health and survival. It's about the meaning of life and death and decay. And overcoming it.I bought it just as I bought Hotline Miami: cheap price, looked like fun and with a casual single player intend. But it was the game that bought me. Specially as I had to rethink about what this and that meant a lot afterwards. Just like a good book.Would recommend!			"

												Lone Survivor is an amazing game, but what is so good about it? Well, firstly, it has an amazing retro-esque art style which will make you love it from the get-go. As well as this, it shows that fancy graphics arn't required to scare you, the ominous and well-made soundtrack is catchy and stays in your head, while on the game and off of it. The game is about choices: stealth or action, drugs or no drugs. The game and its atmosphere is morphed and changed by the choices you make, allowing a unique experience everytime you play.In short: 10/10.			"

												Play Length: One complete playthrough.Positives: A great indie horror game, which takes a lot of influence from Silent Hill 2 and David Lynch.  Putting those influences through a retro filter creates a pretty unique and interesting horror experience.Let's talk about the graphics.  The retro style can certainly work for a game like this, and I think it's a decent style.  It's heavy pixellated, even more so than most retro inspired games.  It's a bit of a peculiar look, but the abstraction works pretty well to create atmosphere.  The music is uncommonly good for an indie game... I would go as far as to say that this is the best soundtrack in any indie horror game, excepting maybe Corpse Party.  This is important, because a good soundtrack is vital to creating atmosphere, and Lone Survivor is much better at creating atmosphere than just about any other indie horror game.The gameplay is very good for this style of game.  It has combat and stealth elements, both of which is very simple, while at the same time always presenting the player with choices.  A lot of the game is just exploration, monsters aren't all that common.  There's also some fun survival mechanics, as you have to collect food and manage your hunger and sleep levels.  There's a huge amount of food, all of which has different effects, and you can also cook meals if you can find cooking implements.  There's also drugs you can take, with various effects.  I like that these various systems add depth to this game without feeling out of place, or distracting from the atmosphere.The story is very much in the mold of David Lynch / Silent Hill.  It works pretty well, and there's some pretty good set pieces and imagery.  You're never quite sure exactly what is going on, but you know enough to stay involved.Negatives: While the graphical style is decent and works for the game, I think it could have been done better.  Sometimes the game's art can border on amateurish.  This is obscured by the heavily pixelated graphics, but I still noticed.  While I like the gameplay in general, one thing I felt that was a little lacking was the monster variety.  There could have easily been a greater variety of monsters, and it would have added more depth to exploration as well as keeping more surprises for the player.About my rating system: I have two things I rate on.  The first is the overall score, and the second is soundtrack.  The reason why is because I feel like soundtrack is tremendously undervalued; to me, it's a tremendously important factor in whether I like a game.  For the score, I grade on a scale of 1-10, and I try to grade in such a way that each number has a meaning and each has equal importance.  The numbers have the following meanings:0: Garbage, 1: Awful, 2: Poor, 3: Underwhelming, 4: Mediocre, 5: Decent, 6: Good, 7: Great, 8: Excellent, 9: Phenomenal, 10: MasterpieceLone Survivor's score:Game Rating: 8 (Excellent)Soundtrack Rating: 8 (Excellent)			"

												Silent Hill has surely cast one of the longest shadows over the horror genre. Few major studios have attempted to capture its success with psychological horror (and not even Konami themselves can regain what they had), but indie developers are always ready to attempt their own thought-provoking thriller. Lone Survivor sticks about as close as you can to the Silent Hill legacy without calling down a lawsuit on itself, but the retro presentation and more immersive mechanics help make it a worthy game on its own.You are cast as the last survivor of a mystery plague holed up in a decaying apartment complex. Uninterested in dying alone, you set out from your safe space to find someone, anyone, to share your company. Unfortunately, the whole place is overrun with gangly, fleshy abominations that would just love to eat your masked face. Owing to the retro 2D style this plays out more as an adventure game than even the restrained action of Silent Hill. Combat is something to be avoided if at all possible, taking alternate routes or skulking around with your flashlight off, or creating distractions with rotting meat. However, you can't get through the game without some fighting. Your weapon of choice is a handgun which you can fire straight, upwards, or downwards, and the enemies take some interesting locational damage. It's a good combat system supported by an intelligent balance of combat and sneaking.Having your face eaten isn't your only concern, however. Your character gets hungry and tired as well, and you have to scavenge for supplies to keep yourself going. You'll find bags of chips and tins of beans along with more suspect foods, and as the game progresses you can combine foods for different effects and even do some rather involved cooking. Sleeping is necessary (and is also how you save your game), but coffee and pills can keep you running and have some additional interesting effects on gameplay. It's an interesting consideration to add because items are finite but you grow hungry and tired over real time, so you have to constantly be moving the story forward. After some early uncertainty I've come to really appreciate this mechanic, because it pushes you to forge ahead into the darker, more threatening areas in search of food. It adds a genuine sense of urgency that helps justify the terrible risks your character takes.All of this is held together by a fantastically dark atmosphere, but one not without its holes. Most areas are VERY dark without your flashlight, but light attracts the creatures. The whole complex is rotting away, and there are far more sinister things taking the place apart as well. The sound direction is excellent, with uncomfortable cues for the monsters and some excellent atmospheric pieces while exploring. The writing is good, though I feel the atmosphere does take a bit of a hit when your character is speaking with certain... things. I think I know where the story is going with these elements I won't expand upon, but for now they feel a bit out of place. Additionally the low-res look doesn't always work in its favor, sometimes making things look a little too cartoonish or obscuring something that would otherwise appear horrifying.These are just small nitpicks, though. Lone Survivor takes its inspiration from Silent Hill and runs with it, creating its own atmospheric experience that terrifies and intrigues. I knew I had played something solid when I finished an hour session around midnight, my wife asked me to check on the laundry in the basement, and the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Yeah, I think I'll check it in the morning, thanks.			"

												Not a particularly frightening game. Lots of self-reflection going on and homages to Silent Hill. That being said, I think it is its own thing despite its clarity about what inspired the creator. Jasper Byrne's created a lot of other games, too, which are worth a glance through. Some of them are referenced to in Lone Survivor.There are some plot meaning theories out there that make a whole lot of sense after you complete the game, so the story's consistency is very gratifying..There are multiple endings, too.. Think about Draco..			"

												Lone Survivor has some interesting ideas, but fails to execute most of them in a satisfying manner.Let's start with the pretentious story.  In the first 5-10 minutes of the game, you'll get that all of this may or may not be real.  The problem is the story never progresses or reveals anything.  The best you'll get is 1 of 5 vague unsatisfying endings that are designed to let you interpret the story however you want.  It's not my job to come up with the story or interpret it, that's the designers job.  I wouldn't mind it so much if the rest of the game made up for it, but it doesn't.  Which ending you get is dependent on your mental health.  You have no way of knowing what things you can and can't do that contribute positively or negatively to your mental health, so unless you go in having looked up how to get good endings in advance, enjoy one of the bad endings.  After you finish the game, it does give you some idea about what's affecting your mental health, but it's a sizable list (including how much you eat/don't eat, what you eat, whether you sleep too much, not enough, how many enemies you kill, how many pills you take, etc), and there're things unlisted that you have to do in order to get the “best” ending.  I'm not bothering to play through this again.There're a couple characters in the game, but they never develop into anything and you're never given a reason to care about them.  Characters, including your own, speak in cryptic messages that serve no point other than to frustrate the player.  Also, some dialogue makes no sense.  Cut-scene dialogue often moves at an absurdly slow rate considering there are usually only 6 or 7 words on the screen.  I don't need 5-10 seconds to read each set of 4 - 8 words.Combat isn't very good either.  There are only 2 types of enemies throughout the game, along with 2 bosses.  You can kill enemies, sneak by them, blind them with flares, or place meat to distract them.  The limited enemy types as well as the limited options means enemy encounters get repetitive pretty quickly.  Both of the bosses are fairly lackluster as well, considering you don't even fight one of them.  I got somewhat annoyed going through the game killing monsters, I can't imagine how annoying the game must be going through while avoiding killing monsters to get the “better” endings.  Without going into detail, the combat mechanics are clunky, and I'd imagine even people who love this game would be hard pressed to say they're good.Your character gets hungry and sleepy throughout the game about every 5 minutes and will constantly spam messages up about how hungry and sleepy he is every 30 seconds until you satisfy these.  Especially fun is when he's doing it while you're fighting enemies.  You can eat pretty much anywhere, but sleeping requires you to go back to your room, and you don't get good sleep if your character is hungry, so you need to make sure you eat right before you go to sleep unless you enjoy getting spammed messages about how sleepy you are a minute after you've finished sleeping.  It doesn't help that the game provides no bars to gauge how hungry or sleepy your character is, so you never have any idea how much certain food is decreasing your hunger or how much rest your character got from sleeping.The game also has an inventory system divided into 3 layers (health/tools/notes) that gets increasingly big throughout your playthrough as you find more items.  It's clunky to go through and isn't very well managed, especially when items you think should be in one section are found in another.  For instance, if my gun is in the tools section, why is my ammo for it found in the health section?  Some items are pretty easy to determine what they do, but others are left very vague.  Naturally you will attempt to experiment with them or even play around with them (you know I'm going to try eating that rotten meat).  The developer though decided that doing such things should be a punished, so you'll lose mental health using some items or fooling around with them, but you won't know this until after you finish the game.  Thank you!The game does have a couple good qualities.  I enjoyed exploring (though the map can be confusing), some of the weird stuff you run into, and the music is alright.  There's also more I could complain about, but I'll stop here.  I don't hate this game, but the best I can say about it is that it's ok at times.  The game usually ranges from playable to annoying.  It rarely did anything that got me excited or really wanting to continue on.  Your time is better spent playing something else.			"

												Disappointed by this game. The map system and level design is a total mess, and I keep getting lost, while my character is complaining about being tired and hugry. The pills are also confusing (should I take the pills, or not? should I save them? should I trade them later?). The game discourages you from shooting zombies in lieu of just standing and waiting long periods of time for them to pass by. The art style is ultra-low res pixel art and the game is too dark to be practical. It looked good in the game trailer videos, but it gives me a headache while playing the game full screen and trying to explore the world.Playing this game feels like a frustrating chore. There may be a payoff, if I were stick to it and keep playing, but I just have no desire to keep playing based on what I've experienced so far.			"

												I bought this game in 2012 (5 years ago at the time of writing this review). I tried to play it before, but was put off by it for some reason. Now, after I mustered up the strength to go through it and finish it, I know why that was.Due to the overall presentation (highly pixelated 2D side scroller) I could not, for the life of me, feel any kind of tension or even much of any atmosphere. This leads to the complete inability to be scared.However, there are other issues abound: - opening the inventory screen does not pause the game,- the mental health system the game gives almost no clues about and which is the main factor for the ending the player receives,- navigating the basement of the apartment building is a complete chore,- the chase sequence in this basement is a case of the main character going full retard and conveniently forgetting about the shortcuts (or, to be more precise, not allowing the player to use them) just for the sake of the chase,- the constant need to eat and sleep every 10 minutes just to pad out the length of the game,and last but not least,- the fact that the whole game is a tribute to Silent Hill without a sliver of its own identity; it even follows the same story cliches.The whole time through I was thinking how much I would prefer to play an actual Silent Hill game over this.At least the music's nice.

												I have already bought and played this game on PSV for years, and I have reached 4 endings out of total 5.This is still my favourate game! My favourate ending is 'The Peaceful Man' (AKA Yellow ending), that our lone survivor finally decided to ignore all the ""brutal facts"" and enjoy Chie's party...For those who find the story confusing and unattractive, I strongly recommend the coffee... I mean the hints that shows so many times in the game already. “The realations among the lone survivor, the old man in blue and a man wears a box ( I believe the old man is Draco, the man wears a box leaves the message without signature). How the player completes the whole games (killed everything you see, or try to avoid violence with wise), will finally lead the lone survivor to finally become either the man in blue ( blue ending and red ending), or the wise man that no longer wears a box ( green end and white end)Also the coneection between our herione and Chie, which I also consider are the same person, is quite obvious. When the man in blue ask you again whether you know him or not, you would either see hime dance with our herione or Chie.”You ask me why I buy this game again on steam? For Jasper Byrne's AWESOME SOUNDTRACK！！！			"

												I.....don't really know how i feel about this game.It certainly is an experience. To be honest though, I'm just plain neutral about this one. I think it's far from a bad game, but it is far from a great one as well.I enjoyed the art style and music, the atmosphere is superb. Gameplay is decent as well, and though it could be a bit difficult to find my way around, i managed to beat it.My main issue with the game is the story/lore behind this game.You ever play Silent Hill 2? Remember how a lot of the enemies, and even Silent Hill itself, was all based around what was going on in the main characters life? (Such as that one enemy that spits at you, was thought to represent your wifes 'harsh words', and it's death animation was supposed to represent someone thrashing on a hospital bed?) That game was a puzzle, and if you managed to put all the pieces together, you got a ♥♥♥♥ed up (but amazing) picture.This game feels like a puzzle you bought at a flea market. It's missing a lot of pieces, and the one's that are there don't fit together well.For example, ""The Man That Wears A Box."" Who is he? What is he? Is he meant to represent something? You don't know. Nor does the game tell you. Same with The Director. What's his story? Why does he give you free items? Or whomever writes up about your actions about the game afterwards. Was the story a dream? Are you in a Hospital? Are you dead?You. Don't. Know. Nor will you ever.Honestly, i wish i could be neutral when i rate this. I'd say for 5 bucks, you can waste a few hours shooting weird creatures and popping pills. Also again, music and atmosphere are executed well. But just because of the vauge, almost non-existent story, I'm going to say save your money for something else.(Note, i only played through once, as i was so bored with the game i didn't wanna play it again. So if multiple playthroughs/different endings reveal more about the story, then i apoligize for being so critical. But even if that is the case, i still wouldn't wanna beat this twice.)			"

												I love retro games. I love pixel games. Still, Lone Survivor has something about it that just doesn't fit. The ideia behind the game seems very nice, and it has some nice art also. The environment is great. Just, there are somethings that doesn't make sense. Two types of nonsense things. ** ALERT: This part may contain information you might consider spoiler **The first type is the completely nonsense, like not being able to see the map again after the first time. You get the message ""I don't need maps, I know my way around"". Except that I didn't know may around. If I got the map into my inventory, why can't I look at it? Or, I got into a gun store, with many better guns that my pistol. Still I couldn't game any. ""Too noisy"", ""Too big"", etc. Don't limit me this way. Let me choose between the silence or the noisy. If you don't want me to use it, don't make me want it. Don't put them there.The second type is the maybe nonsense. I say this because the story of the game don't become clear at the end, and so some nonsense things can be acceptable if you look at the game from another point of view. Still, the game has more than one ending, so, again, the endings might explain one thing or another. This don't bother me too much, even though I think that some parts could be better used (story and game), so to give the player a deeper felling and more him more connected to the game.** Not spoiler anymore **I know the game is indie and developed by a very small group of people (in my understanding, almost only Jasper Byrne), and by that I agree that this game is a great thing. They did a very excelent job. A negative review just because I felt it lacks some basic things.7/10			"

												I really admire what this game managed to accomplish with the limitations of 2D side-scrolling. The design, atmosphere, and music are well rendered tributes to the Silent Hill games it was clearly modelled on. This is a long review, and what I've said many have already mentioned, but I felt this game was just too close to the mark of being brilliant that it needed to be given justice. That said there are weak points, some minor and some not so, and these for me made the game a real chore to play and enough reason to not finish it. Yes, reviewing a game you haven't even finished is laughable, but for me it serves as a statement about it's appeal and playability. For one thing, the lack of being able to access the title screen to quickly reload a game when you screw up (and you will), means having to either find monsters to finish you off (if they're still alive) or exit the game completely and restart it. And that takes just long enough to be a real pain, not least because the sequences you can't skip (like the Game Over sequence and the first loading screen) go on for longer than is necessary or desirable. This becomes a major problem by the way when facing the first ""boss"", which was the point in the game where I waved the white flag and stopped playing due to much bigger problems. The fact the character can't last ten minutes without needing a nap means either backtracking to your apartment (albeit facilitated with ""mirrors"" - itself a nice nod to Silent Hill), or drinking coffee (although you still need to go back to your apartment to brew it), or taking ""booster"" pills which you run out of way too quickly. It should be mentioned that sleeping in your apartment is how you save the game. I am not kidding when it is literally about ten minutes before you need to ""nap"" for 24 hours and lose another day in the game. What would take any normal person a couple of hours to complete took far too long for it to be enjoyable. Instead of fighting monsters, I spent most of my time sleeping and eating, backtracking to my apartment again and again. I'm grateful they didn't program in the need for the character to go potty and floss. Then there's the healing process. As with most other games, you do so by eating and drinking. Problem is, the character gets hungry, regardless of your health level. And if you don't have food, you die. Same goes for water. And sleep. And yes, foraging for food takes just as much time and effort as satisfying the need for the character to sleep. Which means going back to the apartment. Over. And Over. My final criticism is the plot. Not the main story, i.e. trying to escape a city suffering the ravages of an infectious outbreak, but the special characters injected into the game to add mystery to the hero's back-story. It's difficult to say what exactly feels wrong about them. But I guess it's the fact they speak so vaguely that very little is revealed about who you are, and who they are, until later in the game. Long enough to lose interest with all the sleeping, cooking and foraging you'll be doing while apparently playing a survival-horror game where a quick getaway from an apocalyptic scenario is key. What they do say is cliched and generic to the point of being another reason to quit the game and apply for a refund.I really wanted to like this game. What is has accomplished is impressive, and it is by no means a bad game in terms of potential. But the gameplay issues I had with it marred what I hoped would be a memorable experience. As a casual, no-frills (and not very competent) player, it's more effort than it's worth for me to persevere with it.			"

												I really want to feel like I can reccomend this game.  The adaptive story is really kool, I love the visual style, and I respect what the developer was trying to do here.  It's disturbing, it's detailed, and it certainly deserves the attention it's gotten, if not more.  I've only got 2 complaints.  For one thing, the controls are awkward.   This isn't such a big deal, it just feels a little clunky at times.  The second complaint, on the other hand, is a deal breaker for me.  This game is just not very scary.  It's really not.  Even playing it at night, with headphones on and the lights off failed to scare me.  Don't get me wrong, it's got it's moments, but they are few and far-between.  I never thought that playing a game about a man losing his grip on reality in the zombie apocalypse would bore me.Maybe it gets better later on, but after giving it 2.5 hours to get good, I think it's reasonable to lose faith.It could still be your thing though, it's got a lot of promise.  Just didn't quite do it for me. "

												Que buen juego. Me encantó la trama post-apocaliptica. Como bien dice la descripción, el juego trata con el genero ""psychological survivor horror"". La verdad es que te compadeces del protagonista, realmente si te pones en sus zapatos tienes una perspectiva increible del juego. El protagonista está solo en la ciudad sin saber mucho los motivos, entonces el tiene que buscar pistas e información que lo lleven a encontrar las respuestas a sus cuestionamientos; sin embargo, lo que se encontrará durante su recorrido pondrá a prueba su estado animico así como su toma de decisiones. Es un juego que bien vale la pena los 150 pesos que pagué. Muy recomendable!			"

												Great game with equally great music. It's short (about 6 hours for me and that is the most of all people in my list who have it) and the endings don't altogether offer too much replay value from what I can tell. But that's okay because this is one of those games where the journey is more important. It's written with Adobe AIR which I have my own opinions about but despite it the game is still fairly solid. There are several mindscrew moments too. It's hard to really do an involved review of it without spoiling anything. I did a playthrough of it here for Project P.			"

												There are next to no jumpscares in this game. With that said, there shouldn't be any hesitation about entering the dark corridors.And yet, it's still one of the most terrifying things I've ever played.You'll always know where the hazards are. You'll always know how badly things will go if you make a mistake. You'll always have more than enough time to let the dread settle in as you step out into the next area only to find that things have gone much darker, and the infected are practically everywhere.This isn't a game that is meant to make you rush things. You'll revisit areas over a course of several in-game days, having to ration your food and knowing when to sleep, and figuring out how to slow your descent into madness.If you're rushing things, it probably means that you're panicking. But you might be doing a lot of that.If you're not into horror because you're sick of the same formula being followed every time, then consider giving Lone Survivor a try.			"

												When I bought this game I was thinking ""nahh I cant get scared from a 2d pixel game..."" ohhhh how I was wrong.. oh so wrong. This game took me to the point of questioning my own sanity, not knowing if what I just saw was in my head or in my characters head... Seriously a great perspective on a whole monster like apocalypse, instead of going for the ""Lets shoot everything until the world is saved!"" approach this game takes ot from another angle, the one of a ""Lone Survivor"". Having to sit sweating trying to sneak past a monster or feeling proud of myself for using various bait traps to lure them elsewhere, this game just has everything a horror game needs. To top everything off the graphics and sound work together so well to give this game that edge that is needed.			"

												It's odd, this game. It is relatively minimalistic in many ways, but it turned out to be a lot better of a game than I expected. I do not mean to say that I thought the game would be bad; but I just had no idea what it would really be like, even after watching videos and seeing some photos.Lone Survivor starts off and you have no real direction. You are stuck in this weird, apocalyptic area, beginning in your apartment building. You find maps around the game with some places or rooms marked, which is helpful, but getting to the places and finding other necessary rooms or items is just random on your first playthrough. The world isn't that large, in the long run, but it is not easy to simply explore everything.The game really is a survival game. You have to make sure that your character eats healthy food, to both restore health as well as simply feed yourself and prevent death. You have to make sure you sleep regularly, which is bad if your character is starving, and getting back to your room is very difficult in some scenarios. You are very limited in what you can acquire, in terms of ammo and food, and it is relatively difficult to get around enemies your first run-through, as most do not have hiding spots near them.To be honest, this game actually scared me, and I did not expect that. The sound effects are really good, despite how simple they are, like the monster scream. I also enjoyed the pieces of music here and there throughout the game, especially the beginning/ending song. As far as graphics, again, simple, but effective. My only complaint in the aspect ratio and not really having a different resolution. At the beginning, text was taking up nearly 1/3 of my screen and I had to move back to read it. After adjusting, the whole game screen only took up like 1/4 of its available space. I understand not wanting to have some crazily detailed game (in some senses), but there could have been a better way of doing that. Either way, the graphics were mostly fine, though too fuzzy in many places.The monsters creeped me out and I often ran away as expected, and I died quite a few times. In most horror games, after I lose a few times, the monsters wear off on me. Not here. I was still creeped out by the end, mostly because the game doesn't let you get any real ""safety."" You have to make it through chunks of the world before getting back to your apartment, and there's no other way than to push on through. That gives the game a good atmosphere, as does the exploration and lack of direction. Lack of direction is not always a good thing, but it is fine in this game, as the world is not ""too big"" to explore.Story-wise, there really isn't much on your first playthrough, very likely. I made many guesses about what was going on, but by the end, I still don't know, though I have more information. I got the ""bad"" ending of the game. There are multiple endings, and it seems intentional that you need to play the game multiple times to get other endings. Many actions in the game influence your ending, and some things (like avoiding killing enemies) are really hard to do on the first playthrough because of your limitations.Despite not getting a fulfilling ending (although that's not really that rare anymore), I was still happy by the game's end. If I get into the mood again, I will try another playthrough and work harder for a better ending. One of the reasons I don't really want to do so now is because the game will play the same. I will have more items and know where to go, but nothing will really change other than some of my actions and getting a slightly different ending.I already did all of the side quests, such as visiting The Director all the time, helping Hank, and adopting the cat (which was actually a lot more enjoyable and fun than I expected). I loved the cat. Oh, and I loved the fact that Lone Survivor has a mentality system. Little cheesy actions help your character keep collected, such as talking to a plush toy, playing a handheld game system, adopting the cat, reading comics, etc. They're small things, but in such a simple game, everything comes together in a nice form.But at the same time, that is pretty much why I don't want to play again right away. I looked into the actions that influence your ending, and I pretty much did the majority of ""good"" actions to influence towards the positive ending. The only thing that mainly influenced my ending then, was that I had to kill a lot of the enemies because they were unavoidable and you do not get items like flares until late in the game. So basically, I would have to replay the game, changing nothing but using extra flares instead of firing my gun. If I hadn't done the side quests and other things, then I would replay immediately.All in all, everything was put together very well, besides the graphical sizing. I think that this game surprised me a lot, and will probably surprise others who don't know what to expect of it. I suggest playing the game, to delve into its little (rather creepy) world. Fight through, but enjoy, the atmosphere. Try to put the story together. I will return to it again, once I feel like it, and if you play it, you should return later as well.			"

												Got this game back in June 2012, but didn't get around to playing it until now. And wow - Lone Survivor is a wonderful game by the obviously talented Jasper Byrne. With it's surreal Twin Peaks meets Silent Hill feeling it manages to weave together elements from many genres. The gameplay of the survival horror genre, the look of old school adventure games, the intelligence and introspection of other new indie games, and some pretty funny and seriously dark humor, Lone Survivor is best describes as a survival horror game though, and while it doesn't scare you it may very well haunt you in different ways. It's a moving game with more than a small touch of emotion and the bizarre, and it's a game I should have played a long time ago. It's also a game anyone can pick up. It doesn't really require any skills or knowledge of a specific genre to appreciate.If you're wondering if you should pick it up? The answer is simple: ""Yes! Yes, you should pick it up! NOW!"" While a playthough won't take more than between 3-6 hours (depending on playstyle and the amount of exploring you do), the game (especially the director's cut) should be played at least 2-3 times. There are five different endings and, while it may not look like it, the game is extremely detailed. Every action has consequences, but they are far from apparent. Lone Survivor is not just an interesting and beautiful game, it's a damn good one with great gameplay. This is a game that quickly rose to my top-20 list of best games of all time. A definite must have.			"

												I have to respect this game's particular pixel art style, but in terms of what it's trying to accomplish, I find that it fails.I haven't read any reviews or interviews with the creator, but I got an incredibly huge feeling that it was inspired by Silent Hill. It's so much of an hommage that it looks like more than that, it's almost as if it was intended totally as a new Silent Hill. The psychological horror, the look of the monsters, the lack of lighting, a main character that is hiding something, all of it and even an area that was previously normal looking suddenly turning nightmarish.It works artistically and I have to say it's a huge thing to accomplish to have a truly scary looking environment in a 2D pixel art game. But the way it plays, I had no sense of stress, of being scared, of not knowing what was hiding from me.The fights are too simple in that the enemies are simply moving towards you and you just press the shooting key and hope to have enough bullets. Aiming is usually not necessary and if you stock up on bullets, it's just pressing the shooting key when you see an enemy with no strategy implied. The enemies' strategy is mostly always just moving towards you, as simple as that.If you play the stealth way, it's a matter of having enough rotten meat with you and placing it at the beginning of a section where you can hide in the background and get on your enemies' left or right while they're busy eating, but there's not enough of figuring out how to get past those sections. In the end, the strategy is having enough bullets or enough meat on you, at least in my experience.I would then guess this game relies on the psychological element and the atmosphere, but without the feeling of stress, no matter how you achieve it, the way a Silent Hll type game is specifically designed will never feel like true horror in my opinion. Which is a shame, because I loved the concept of Silent Hill as the series was even better than Resident Evil for me (true uncomfortable horror compared to jump scares).This game seems to be made by a talented person and there is a lot of good to be said about what it feels like outside of how it plays. I would have to see a similar game with better mechanics, it could be a very good replacement to Silent Hill if this game was improved upon. I certainly don't expect to play a real Silen Hill any time soon anyway.			"

												You may have, at some point in your life played Silent Hill 1, 2, 3 and perhaps 4. Since the mentioned franchise went down the gutter long time ago, enter Lone Survivor. A game that catches the unsettling tone and spirit of the SH games with the added bonus of a tamagochi mechanic (read: feeding, sleeping and keeping the main character mentally balanced). Danger lurks at every corner and shady characters loom around dark alleys, are they friend or foe? Do they even exist?! This 8bit gem also features some eerie music as you traverse the decayed areas in search for food, ammunition and truth of just what the hell is going on. Will you find what you seek?

												If you're looking for a game that's scary and moreover though-provoking, buy this game right now. It's not a long game if you know what you're doing, but it's worth every penny. The game looks cheap and gritty, but it uses this to create the tense, lonely atmosphere that really defines the experience. The soundtrack is simple, but catchy and perfectly fits the atmosphere. Jasper Byrne masterfully executed everything about this game, taking after the examples set by titles like Silent Hill, but furthers his approach to the survival-horror genera by implementing mechanics like hunger and the sleeping system. This game is great for story and gameplay.If you're worried about the price, just wait for the Steam Summer Sale. If you're still worried about the price, then stop worrying and just buy this. This game is worth every single penny. If I had to pay for it again, I'd happily put down up to $50 just because I love it so much and I'd like to support the developer.			"

A very long play for me, and my go to for any kind of good horror game I have, disincluding Silent Hill.GameplaySpeaking of Silent Hill, while the storyline of Lone Survivor is not as detailed, the storyline of Lone Survivor relies on a similar gameplay mechanic of Silent Hill, rather than relying on jumpscares. For the majority of the game, it's only going to be you and your gun. The gameplay itself when it comes to shooting is simple and easy to use. However some parts of the gameplay is definitely lacking. You'll find yourself using lures that barely work at times, and as the game progresses, you find yourself stuck with that one weapon. The pacing is slow, and good for a person who likes slow paced and Silent-Esque games. When it comes to the Protaganist, a gameplay mechanic known as mental health that uses several enviormental things that serve slim to nil importance to the game itself. It is not explained in full and is weirdly shoved without much explanation to determine the ending. There are barely any useful and credible ways to find out your mental health.StorylineThe storyline however, is somewhat awkward and fails to fully establish itself. The storyline jumps all over the place and gets hard to understand from a person who picks up the game. There's no distinction on what is and isn't real, or what is good and bad to the survivor. There are few things clear at what happens, and who is and isn't real. There's not as much to say about the storyline, as it is lacking at best, however there are certain parts that exceeded lacking.SoundtrackThe soundtrack is extremely good. Made also by Jasper Bryne, the soundtrack is absolutely stunning, and really helps immerse the player at points. However, despite the soundtrack being amazing, there are parts where the soundtrack fails to really immerse, and sometimes seems out of place at some points. The sound effects are very well made and placed perfectly. There's not a lot to complain about the soundtrack or sound effects, only that songs from the soundtrack sometimes feels out of place.Other Points and Final RecommendationsThe graphics, despite looking pixelated, exceeded my expectations, and really killed it in that department. It really shines in this department, and sometimes doesn't even feel as if it's pixelated, and more of a more detailed game.Overall, if you're looking for a game that has pixel-graphics, a Silent-Hill esque game, or a game with a good soundtrack and some good gameplay, I'd recommend this. However if you're looking for a linear story that isn't vague or doesn't really jump around, I'd recommend passing up on this.			"

												Silent Hill and Maniac Mansion had a pixelated baby. A short and sweet survial horror/adventure fix with replay possibility since theres three endings and the game tracks a surprising amount of stuff you do (sleeping too much, eating bad food, talking to a plant, how much stuff you kill...)However id recommend looking up the games steam forums for a possible change of resolution and window size unless you got a tiny old CRT or enjoy having your eyes sandblasted by 640x480 fullscreen			"

												Lone Survivor is a survival horror game that really makes you feel both the survival and the horror and thirdly the horror of survival.Right off the bat LS has a demo out there, so you should give that a couple minutes to see if you can handle the retro graphics.Not for you? Move on.Pixel lover? Let's dig in.LS takes quite a few cues from other survival games, like an auto updating mapping system and flashlight that needs new batteries constantly, but really the game remains largely unique. You play as a young man set in a town filled with zombies caused by disease. The game starts very quickly with little explanation and leaves the player to fill in what is going on, who you are, and how to really survive.It becomes very clear very quickly that your character might not exactly be in his right mind, a large part of the story and vibe of the game is a psychological one, but this review is not going to expand on this because its best left for the game itself.The biggest chunk of surviving the game is managing your food and sleep levels, which might not sound fun, but its so key to the game in multiple ways that its inescapable. The character will let you know maybe a little too often how you are feeling, tired or hungry.You will need to find and cook, or combine food in different ways to keep yourself going. It takes some trial and error... is this bottle of milk still good? Whats more filling these crackers or a squid on a stick?The more important question comes in while exploring and being harassed by critters that want to spit infected blood on you, or strangle the life from your body.Should I push on, do I have enough food, am I well rested? Should I return now or risk it and explore a little more.Thus the game follows a good pattern of exploration, and retreat, each day you'll either need to hoof it or use teleporting mirrors to return back to your apartment to rest and save before heading back into the mirror and continuing.As you explore you'll find lots and lots of things a flashlight, a weapon, a cat, coffee, a ham, a source of water, fuel for your stove. Also you'll unlock several shortcuts and even pseudo vendors to allow you to get a helpful boost if you need more ammo or pills or rotten meat.In several areas you'll need to use the flashlight to be able to interact with something in the darkness but the light will increase your visibility to the games creepy monsters, also the flashlight has limited energy and you have limited batteries.Many monsters are near spots that allow you to sneak around them, but your character isn't a complete wimp and its not too hard to kill them off, if carefully watching your supplies and planning your attacks.The controls work well, and are responsive but might take a bit of getting used to as you can only attack to one side at a time, and walk much slower while trying to do so, needing to lower your weapon before turning and re-raising it. Other than that the game is very minimalistic, a few hotkeys, movement keys, interact key, inventory key.A real treat in LS is the sound that immerses you and gives you clues about your character's state of mind and health. Monster noises are creepy and while there is no real voice work, this is a retro-style game after all.All in all Lone Survivor is a wonderful exercise in a lot of things, retro graphics, minimalistic controls, sound, creepiness, and of course survival mechanics. At 9.99 it's a steal for hours of enjoyment over many other games of lesser quality at many times the price... it might even keep you up at night.			"

												Nothing about this game feels natural. It's just a ""designer says do x, so you need to go do x, despite what you were thinking about doing"". And then, as if he anticipated that, the game trys to baby you through it, constantly telling you where to go and explaining things to you.On top of that, the character moves obnoxiously slow, as well as paces himself incredibly while firing his gun. It's like, Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ zombies! I'd better saunter away from them! And if they get too close, I'll fire a round at them! But that always makes me tired, so I'll have to take a few moments to catch my breath before I fire again! Gee, why does everything have to be so hard!This game is bad, and Jasper Bryne should be ashamed that his name is on the front of it. Don't buy it.			"

												...Eh.I expected a scary experience. A chilling and down right creepy horror game with an interesting story to the likes of the actual Silent Hill games...I got an ""Eh"" title that tries to do that with muddy graphics and some form of a narrative, but fails to captivate me enough to actually care.Lone Survivor is the 2D, pixelated SIlent Hill, that just isn't. Sure, the monsters creep you out at first, mostly due to the noise they produce then the stickman figure they happen to look like. But they just tend to be more of an annoying blockade in the hallway than something you should fear.This game also brings up some annoying mechanics like an invisible sleeping and eating meter. Cause God knows we need that much ""realism"" to a game so that people get so ""immersed"" in it! It's not at all an annoying and unnecesary mechanic, especially when the character ♥♥♥♥♥es and moans about it every 5 minutes.This game also brings back the clunky aiming mechanics of the old Resident Evil. It kinda works for it since it's used in a 2D setting. Though you'll mostly want to avoid confrontation since the enemies  tend to be really bullet absorbent. Which is a plus considering it's a survival horror game.As for the story...I'll be honest, I lost interest in this game after getting to the basement. And I really just did not care what was going on in the appartment. Who that lady in the cage was. If the monsters were actually people and the protagonist was just delusional this whole time. I just didn't give a damn.Why didn't I give a damn. The narrative felt a bit lifeless. I didn't feel like I should actually care what was going on in this world. The fact that most of dialouge amounts to the damn hunger/sleeping meter prompts whenever the protag feels hungry and/or tired may have added to that.Pros:-It's, kind of an interesting take on a Horror game. (Though I wasn't impressed.)-Some of the puzzles were actually kinda clever, like luring a monster to another room by placing meat near it.-You can kinda mix and match items to make new ones, sorta. (From what I experienced, it was mostly to cook food.)Cons:-Hunger and Sleep meter...oh joy.-Muddy pixel graphics (The filter made it seem nice, but it really just adds to it.)-I didn't care for the story or mystery of the game. (Which is a big con considering that's an important motivator to play these types of games.)In short:If you're interested in a 2D, sidescrolling horror game. Try something else.You don't wanna take my word on it and wanna jump into the game anyway? It's your money. Do with it what wish.I recommend you to get it on sale.			"

												An aggravating, rather subpar horror game. Early on, it's neat, since it has good atmosphere and an intriguing story, but the interface is so obtuse that it becomes a chore to play. Combat is a bore, which normally wouldn't be a problem in a survival horror game. But this game tosses samey enemies at you like there's no tomorrow, forcing you to either kill them (clunky, and also locks you out of the best ending) or use one of many consumable items, forcing you to navigate a menu in the middle of being chased.Horror games should make you fear for your life. Not make you curse for dying repeatedly against boring enemies who are only halfway scary because of the banal scare chord that continually blares while they see you. After a while, the only dread I felt was the dread of trudging back through those same '2spooky4u' hallways.			"

												If, like me, you are not a big fan of survival horror games, this game may not convince you to become one. I enjoyed the atmosphere invoked by the graphical and audio design, but the gameplay and plot often took me out of the experience. I kept asking questions that I'm not sure the game wanted me to ask. Why is this man selling items in this back room? Why am I given so many unexplained, unnecessary items? Why is backtracking more boring than tense?It's very likely that this game requires players to be more willing to experiment, fail, and try again, but I never felt rewarded for the experimentation I did. (""Oh look, I just wasted something I didn't know I needed. Better reload an old save."") If I had been more invested in the early exploration, I might have been able to forgive some of the less-optimal moments later in the game.This game wasn't for me, and if you can identify with my gaming preferences, maybe you should stay away, too.

												Overall, all aspects of the game come together to create a  really tense experience for the player. I refrain from calling it horror though since I was never afraid while playing the game, this shouldn't take away from how tense I did feel while playing it though. That tension was quite aggravating though and I'm glad to be done with the game. This game seems to be really popular with fans of the silent hill franchise so I'd recommend it to those people, otherwise you are free to skip this game as you won't be missing much.You can read a more complete review here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2015/10/lone-survivor-directors-cut.html.

												Gamers who like retro survival adventures, gameplay that has to be figured out (a bit like Don't Starve), and old skool UI probably feel right at home. For me this was too retro.I think there is no excuse not to have an ESC menu where you can do basic setup and look at key commands: what key does what, to get you started and see what can be done in the game, especially with one that has so little to no explanation to start with. But the ESC menu is mostly empty. To look at key commands, you have to go into your apartment, into a specific room, and look at some random note hanging around in that room to see the key bindings. If you forget some and head out and are in the middle of something, you're out of luck, leave everything and go back to your room to look at the key bindings. This should be in the ESC menu somewhere, some kind of basic help. I don't want to memorize or write that down myself.Also the visuals are extremely blocky. Retro adventure and pixel graphic all nice and good, but to me this looks extremely raw. You almost don't see what the objects are because it's just 2 pixels glued together. It's like having really bad vision. You go to some pixel pie and see if you can interact with it. Sometimes it's nothing, sometimes it's something important, a note, some object. But you can never tell in advance if this is something or just a block of randomly colored pixels that is dirt on a table. Visual readability is very low.If you like finding out how to play a game the hard way, it probably is enjoyable. If you're looking for an adventure that is more streamlined, go somewhere else.			"

												tl;dr: Neat little experience, but kinda overrated and not worth the price tag imo.I've had this game highly reccommended and had been told it was one of those hidden gems on steam that I just had to play through if I wanted good horror. After finally playing through it, I was disappointed on most of those accounts. What it does right: For what could be a gameboy  game, it certainly has a decent atmosphere and mechanics that I couldn't complain about, even with the menu system. It was interesting enough that I wanted to see what happened next and I actually finished it, but not enough to want to play through it again or try to find out the smaller details of the plot.What it does wrong: For a game that had been paraded to me for how scary it was, it really wasn't. The few first experiences with the thin men were creepy, especially if I ran out of ammo, but the fact that you have a limitless supply of ammo and batteries if you take pills takes any stress out of the game. There's no suspense if I can just walk up, shoot the things in the head a few times and be done with it. Coupled with the fact that I could go home and save somewhere within every level at any time, things just weren't tense or suspenseful enough to make me feell actually afraid or in the moment. It became more strategical as the game went on, instead of me being actually afraid. I suppose it would be hard to really set up a realistic experience with the size of the game, but I'm sure it could've been done better.Like I said, having an unlimited supply to pills, and therefore and unlimited supply of ammo and batteries takes a lot of what could be a good survival element out of the game.  When I initially found out you could do this, I stopped trying to avoid the monsters entirely. Why take the time to avoid the problem every time you go through that area if you can permanantly remove it? It might've been different if my ammo supply was actually limited. Any fear of these monsters was entirely gone when I figured out it was that easy to take them down.Another thing was the protagonists messages. They seem entirely useless after a while. While initially he complains about hunger or sleep, when he starts saying he might collapse and other things, I would try to eat or sleep to no avail. It seems that message system wasn't entirely necessary, and I just ignored it entirely when I would eat and sleep at regular intervals. Maybe it had something to do with his gradual downward descent, but it certainly wasn't helpful from a gameplay standpoint.Lastly, I hesitate to call it something that was done wrong, but the story. [ALSO SPOILERS] I see it was trying to be this deep journey about a guy imagining his own depressing world after his girlfriend was killed in a car crash or something, but it never took the time to make me interested in the main character or his situation enough to really care for him. This may be to try to immerse the player deeper into the role, but that never works when you're trying to tell a compelling story at the same time. It may just be me, but the story was never involving enough to make me like the game any more than I already did.It was also really short, but I guess that isn't a bad thing. I could've beat it in two or three hours if I didn't mess around so much.Guess it was an alright experience, but I doubt I'll ever come back to it. Dunno if I would've actually paid fifteen dollars for it if I'd known what it was really going to be.			"

												1. I wish there were some sort of neutral rating on Steam. This game is worth starting but not really worth finishing.2. The standout quality of this is sound design, which is simply as good as it gets. The sound effects almost feel like a natural extension of the music, which is excellent in its own right.3. The art style, I am not in love with. It is just sort of a pixely blur. It works well enough but something about it just looks like you have resolution on your monitor set incorrectly.4. The atmosphere--see number 3--is enticing at first. Very immersive. This isn't really scary exactly but there is a menacing quality that is very foreboding and appealing all at once.5. Gameplay is a survival horror game boiled down to 2D. While the giants of this genre are rotting away into AAA action games, it is nice to see an indie dev do something that stayed true to what people love about survival horror while adding their own twist.6. 2D survivor horror works fine. The third D is overrated in gaming.7.  Number 5  is why I really, really wanted to like this game and why it's been on my to-play list for years. Unfortunately, this works only as a proof of concept. See number 6.8. Once you absorb the atmosphere, the gameplay starts to wear thin. There is nothing wrong w/ it inherently but the whole thing seems to lack polish. You are backtracking all over the place. You have to rest and go through the same little clip scenes over and over. There is a mild puzzle solving element but it's just like, ""You need to cook? Find a pot, I guess.""9. Yes, backtracking and an overall slower pace are hallmarks of survivor horror and I just praised this game for being a true survivor horror game. What can I say? This game is both good and bad. It's a paradox.10. *the sound of minds blowing*11. There are multiple endings. Multiple endings are overrated in gaming. 12. Like, seriously, are you so full of yourself that you think your game is worth playing like five times over and over? Sorry, I got things to do. 13. In all honestly, I didn't finish this thing even once. I was just bored to death after picking it up the second day for another hour. Tried again on a third day and still bored, I set down my trusty Steam controller, and thought, yep that's all I'm ever playing of this game for the rest of my life and I feel good about it. I will totally buy a sequel or preferably a new IP in a similar style if the developer makes one. There is promise here but unfulfilled.  "

												This game sucks, IMO. I have given it a few tries but quit out of boredom. I generally like games that are seen by others as 'boring' but not this one. I like the retro-style look and the creepy places. The game severely lacks in interesting gameplay mechanics (placing food to lure zombies is quite cool but gets old fast). For a game that heavily relies on story, the story is below mediocre in my opinion. i didn't enjoy it. Others appear to have somehow enjoyed it though.			"

												This game is kinda boring. It has really great atmosphere and mind screws with the audio and visuals, but the horror genre just doesnt fit well with 8-bit graphics. I loved the monsters, they clicked in a lot bettert than the cookie cutter zombies, and as someone whos played Demonophobia and seen similar creatures leave you a messy blood splatter on the wall, they terrified me. But this game had a few major flaws that i just couldnt look past. firstly, there is a hidden hunger and tired meter. I didnt play long enough to find out, but i assume if one runs out, you lose. Secondly, i may have missed something, but i could NOT find an options menu, which led to a lack of windowed mode. The game didnt lag, but this would make it difficult to record and all the text looked blurry because it was all stretched. If i had to rate it, i'd give it a 4/10; Not totally awful, but really has a lot to be desired.			"

												I didn't care for this game because it didn't play well on my larger television. The pixels were grainy to the point of not being able to make much out. It definitely fits the mold of survival horror, but the constant need for backtracking to sleep and save seemed like being on a constant timer, also serving to pad the game's length. Play it if you're a huge fan of both indie games and survival horror.			"

												I'm a huge fan of Silent Hill 2, and I thought that a 2D version of that sort of thing might be a cross between SH2 and Maniac Mansion (another favorite of mine).  I guess that was really setting the bar unfairly high, so there is that.  But ultimately I just didn't really care about my character or what was going on.  There wasn't any sort of story angle (emotion, story, mystery) that could hold me here.  Beyond that it was just kind of creeping around in the dark, and that just felt a bit empty to me.If you're more of a fan of horror as a genre than I am, then this is probably right up your alley, though.

												I really wanted to enjoy this game, but sadly, I just wasn't having fun playing it.  The game is more ""survival"" than ""horror"" as I wound up trying to keep myself alive rather than soaking in the atmosphere and as a result, made me just stop playing the game.  Atmosphere: 4/10While the atmosphere does give off an eerie feeling at times and give off the feeling that everything is dead, I wasn't really scared or even creeped and I didn't feel very threatened.  You can tell when standard monsters are around only because they create what sounds like radio static, you can easily outrun them, and they won't follow you to another screen.  Story: 2/10The story was not very interesting and sometimes hard to follow.  The basic plot is that you are believed to be the last man alive but leaves his appartment to try and find if there are any other survivors.  It's a good setup, but the pacing is so slow that it doesn't seem in any rush to progress past the ""escape the apartment"" portion which takes a long time to actually do and has the character go through multiple halucinations and black-outs instead of moving forward.  Taking bule or green pills before sleeping will put you in a dream state where two different characters bring up psychological topics to ask you.  As much as I like this idea though, it distracts from the main story and just took me out of the game.  Graphics: 6/10I have to be honest and i don't mean to offend anyone, but the characters in this game look pretty ugly.  I am not expecting them to look like something out of a AAA title so I do cut it some slack, but they still look unappealing.  The monsters look basic and the ""walkers"" as I will call them do not look very threatening.  The graphics' saving grace is the backgrounds as they do look dead and abandoned giving the game a sense of dread.  Gameplay: 3/10Surviving is a challenge itself as you WILL be dying more times than you can count.  When encountering monsters, you are mostly given items such as rotten meat or flares that will only distract enemies and the only thing you have to kill them with and defend yourself is a shoddy pistol with VERY scarce ammo.  More often than not, you will wind up running out of ammo as monsters take quite a few hits to kill and the later monsters take even more hits to kill, so you will be constantly backtracking looking for blue pills or ammo you hope you had missed; and you'll be lucky if you can find them.  This could have easily been fixed if a better gun was available or at the very least a melee weapon, but the protagonist says he would rather keep his weak pistol.  If you want the player to stick with one gun, don't throw in something that will make us want something different.  There is a hunger mechanic that seems to just be there and didn't really affect my survival.  The game just seemed to nag me when I got hungry or got sleepy to make me eat some food I had found or go back to my room and sleep to the point where it felt more like a chore.  Replay Value: 2/10I honestly, can't see myself replaying this game anytime soon.  There is not a lot of things I understood even looking back at them and it will just be the same repetitive gameplay that gets boring after a while.  Final Verdict: This game has potential and so do the developers.  I honestly want to see them go far an make some very enjoyable games.  This particular game, however, was a bit of a disappointment; if you are looking for a game that will scare you and keep you invested, you might want to look elsewhere.  Final Score: 17/503.4/10 - Cannot Recommend			"

												I had just played Home, and was impressed with the overbearing atmosphere and psychological horror. I spent the entire game on the edge of my seat, and jumped when I heard so much as a mouse scurry.I felt really happy with the experience, and I (unwisely) thought I'd try playing another horror game. I noticed Lone Survivor, so I loaded it up.After having to sit through some boring and uninformative text boxes, I found myself in a colorfully lit hallway face to face with a noodly guy doing some whacky noodle walk. He just seemed to be walking around and he didn't seem too threatening, so I decided to stroll on past him. He wiggled at me a few times until my character fell over and I lost. I put it down for later.After cleansing my palate of the bitter aftertaste my first try at Lone Survivor left me, I ventured another nibble. This time, I tried to give it an earnest go, pledging a prudent prescription of play before passing a proper opinion.So I read the inordinate quantity of introductory text boxes, cautiously avoided the fleshy Air Dancers wandering the halls, following the instructions. Once again the halls were lit like a strip club and the sound design echoed the subtlety and fidelity of a Bar Mitzvah on a budget. I grit my teeth on my very expensive new crown and carried through.I reached a part of the game where you meet people, but everyone was acting veeeerrry straaaange! It was soooo spoooooky! Anyway it turned out everyone was actually DEAD THE WHOLE TIME (SPOILERS OH NO) and I quit the game because that plot twist stopped being novel to popular media after the first season of The Twilight Zone in 1959. I gave it a grand total of 23 minutes, and now it's uninstalled for good.			"

												well...uh... where to start from?ok, let's start with saying that this indie game  has more than one defect, but you could pass over them and enjoy playing it for some hours if it was developed as a free game, on a site like Flashgames.but the story is different 'cause this game is being sold for 6,99 euro here on Steam. i know at least one other horror themed game better than this one, made with 2D graphic, called The Deepest Sleep. that is completely free in the web. (go see it, it's worth a look)i think it's not definitely worth the price; the developers should have put really much effort and improvements to justify it.so basically, in front of the price, i'm forced to underlight the CONS of this game. a buyer must know what he's buying:*an horror game that is not really scaring. no old jumpscares, nothing unexpected, nothing made me feel any fear.*a game with repetitive atmosphere, that gives no real contribute to the horror component; the music too is not worth a particular mention, for what i remember.*a game with hunger and sleepness to deal with, but in a way that becomes frustrating: your character needs to sleep or eat every 3 seconds, and believe me, this becomes boring after 15 minutes of play.*a game whit a confusing story, really hard to understand, or maybe with no sense at all.*a game with at maximun 10 chars to encounter and to talk/interact with.*a game with a quite confusing map.*a game with multiple endings, one less rewarding than the others. you won't have the will to finish the game more than 1 time to see them, i believe.that's my opinion, i really don't understand all the positive comments i red about this game....graphic 10/10?music 10/10?atmosphere 10/10?....story 10/10 ...??men, were you drunk  when you wrote them?

												BUG WARNING: The game kept forcing me into expert mode (no map usage) every time I reopened the game to resume play and you can't change out of expert mode.I enjoyed what I managed to play. I initially went straight to expert mode, not realising it meant I couldn't use the map when I wanted to, which is insane for a 2d scroller like this in an environment with so many doors and tunnels in every direction.Also, the hunger mechanic is pretty annoying, I can easily see it negatively impacting a play through for someone who prefers to take their time in a game like this.

1-sentence review :Lack of content and somewhat painful progression, coupled with an over pixelated rendering, made playing this game more a chore than a fun adventure (which it was on several occasions), especially when I understood it was designed to be played several times to get the good ending.Pros :- Good premises and good start- Has its moments- Good atmosphereCons :- Intriguing story, but it never really takes off and it's ultimately disappointing- Really painful pixelated rendering- Lack of rhythm and exciting stuff- Controls are a bit awkward			"

												GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: 37% YES / 63% NOGOODDecent horror atmosphere.Lots of sound effects remeniscent of Silent Hill and Resident Evil.NEUTRALOdd array of items. Never truly understood what was stronger than the last.BADNot a fan of invisible sleep and hunger meters.Controls are, for the most part, too clunky. This wouldn't be a problem if combat needed you to be slightly faster at aiming and moving around. Otherwise you can die rather fast.Visuals are way too muddled. Sort of a bloody, dense pixelated tone that never feels good to look at.I've never had such trouble reading such large text. The font is a terrible choice.SUMMARYThere's the beginnings of a decent horror game here, but unfortunately the game controls too awfully and sucks to look at. It shouldn't be a chore to try and read the text but it is. I tried to continue playing, but overall I just kept getting caught up in one too many poor design choices.			"

												Felt like a story game, but I didn't apprciate a lot of it.You travel through mirrors. Yeah...The eight bit didn't seem to make sense thematically. And sprites are easy to create. So this seems to me like a choice to make the game look retro in a hope to get more people buying it.Not a lot of it did makes sense. Though I don't want to give it away if you'd like to play it. All the same the twist is pretty lack luster. I'll leave it at that.The sound track is pretty good. But if that's the case just download the soundtrack.I purchased this game for about 2 dollars. I don't feel like that was worth it.			"

												Maybe I haven't played enough of it or I'm missing the point... but it's kind of boring.  The music is good, the idea is good, it just comes off as dull and disconnected.  I bought it because of how much it is praised and it wasn't too expensive but there is nothing here to keep me going.  So many questions but I really don't care enough to find the answers.  Maybe this will change if I get bored enough to really invest time into it, but right know I wouldn't recommend this game.			"

												I love survival horror games, Resident Evil, Silent Hill,  Fatal Frame, Rule of Rose, you name it, I'm no newbie to the genre. I just couldn't get into this game though. I think part of is that you can't really run away from enemies later on, the rest is I guess I just wasn't feeling it at all. I can't really recommend this game because of it, its just real boring.

There are certainly lots of weird scenes, but overall, I just wasn't feeling it.Pros:1.  Dark ambience is creepyCons:1. Way too expensive at full price2. Too dark in most places (even with adjustment)3. That mask he wears looks like a 'troll grin'4. The gameplay with that map is less-than-ideal5. This has all been done before I believe			"

												Side scrolling pretentious indie survival horror with emphasis on the survival. Gameplay is clunky, tedious, and requires a lot of backtracking. It doesn't do anything necessarily wrong (except the graphics strained my eyes at the default ""aspect ratio"") , but it's nothing special apart from the poorly executed concept. Clocking in at about 4 hours I had no clue what happened during this game. I guess it was just too deep for me.			"

Then the game started... I was disgusted. The game was super blurry. I got over that. Then the tutorial. Not bad, until they showed the thing you are suppose to be afraid of and how you can just move to the backround to avoid it but still in plain sight. YOU BASICALLY JUST WALKED AROUND YOUR THREAT! SOOO I experimented and I just walked at the creature and I pushed it back and it took about 20 seconds for it to kill me... So that's Lone Survivore for you..			"

												Having played the original, I was looking forward to this one having controller support. It never happened.And maybe Jasper really did just never think to include it, but the more likely case is the lack of intuitive controls, the confusing keyboard layout is all part of the psychological trap the game puts you in. In nightmares, people are meant to feel powerless, disabled. This would explain the odd controls on a metafictional level.The soundtrack is really really good. I remember him doing the soundtrack for Hitman: Contracts and that was very tense and chilling as well, but this brings out his talents even better so to speak. From the screeching static enemies to the trapped-in-a-hell-dimension ambiance, this game isn't shy about roughing up your ears. It wants to be experienced as a sonic scarlet letter of pure terror, mailed directly to your heart through your eardrums.Also, if you've just had a bad breakup, you probably shouldn't play this game.Or if you're one of those screaming youtube let's player who is competing with a thousand other fake screaming children all trying to soak up that Five Nights at Freddy's money . Then this game is definitely not for you.			"

												This is another great indie game... but this time it's a survival horror exloration game. It reminds me a lot of Silent Hill... (the good ones) just in 2D and with pixel art. It's well written has some good horror and an interesting storyline. The gameplay is fun and also reminds me of the good old silent hills.It's definetly one of the best indie games this year and if you want to be reminded of why Silent Hill 2 and 3 were so good you should defintely give this game a shot.

												I love retro-style horror games. Games like Silent Hill and Resident Evil and of course the beautiful scarefest that is Amnesia depend on extraordinary graphics in order to get the scares across. In Lone Survivor the creators relied on classic pixelization, and it somehow works. The music is paranoia-inducing and the alarming change in environment when a monster sees you is reminiscent of the Silent Hill 'monster warning system"" of radio static, and of Amnesia's blaring horn/string frenzy of ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ They see me!!"". And much like Silent Hill there are quite a few monsters to navigate around and it is not expected that you outright battle them head-on, as well as many doors and openings that are not always open and, as far as you know, may never be. Your character claims to be the only survivor in the apartment complex that he is currently a tenant of, residing in his own cozy little room of 206. Of course, you need to go out and fetch supplies and try to find survivors. Along the way you are shaken up by bizarre visions that may be a result of something alien and supernatural--I mean seriously, that's all that could explain the existence of those THINGS--or possibly your character's insanity slowly grabbing at his mind. Despite being dumb as a rock when it comes to logical ""one thing leads to another"" set ups that this game surely is, I managed to find my way around the place and just as I was thinking ""Okay it's time to stop for today"" I found something else to explore and just kept going. This is a great mashup of pixel, adventure, psychological, thriller, and horror.  "

												Despite the very low resolution/pixelated graphics, Lone Survivor successfully comes off as a very creepy game through effective use of tone, lighting, music and pacing. The gameplay itself is very reminicent of old style adventure games, which if you think about it is what the survivor horrors of old used, just with the distinct possibility of combat and the ability to (mostly) defend yourself.

												This game can be summed up pretty quickly: 2D Silent Hill. Lone Survivor is an indie survival horror game and if you've ever played a Silent Hill game before, this game will feel very familiar. The developer, Jasper Byrne, is a self-proclaimed Silent Hill fan and the influences are very apparent throughout the game. Everything including the gameplay, the narrative themes, and even the audio cues are very Silent Hill-esque. And Byrne, who also composed the game's soundtrack, does a great job channeling Silent Hill's Akira Yamaoka with his musical style. But even if you've never played a Silent Hill game, you may still want to give Lone Survivor a look.Lone Survivor is short, and I think that's to its credit. It's about 5 hours long, and I think that's a perfect length for a game like this. Turning off all of the lights in your house and subjecting yourself to the twisted imagery and pulse pounding terrors of a good horror game now and again is fun, but it's also kind of nerve wracking and draining. Not something to do every single night. I've played a lot of games that do a good thing effectively, but wear out their welcome by doing it over and over again for too long. I felt Lone Survivor had a very appropriate length, and I'd like to see more shorter experience games like this. I think it can work if the games are appropriately priced, but that's a whole different discussion. You play as a nameless survivor of some disease outbreak that has seemingly turned all of the world's population into mindless zombie-like monsters. The main character has holed up in his apartment to survive the disease outbreak, but is now running out of food and is curious if there are any other survivors other than himself. So you'll start to venture outside your apartment and see the horrors of the monster infested world, but you'll still return to the apartment often to rest and save. You can combat the monsters with your handgun if you have enough ammo, or you can lay piles of meat around to attract the monsters to a certain location to try and sneak past. Like any good horror game, ammo management is key. You'll want to sneak past enemies when possible rather than shooting them to conserve your ammo. You'll also want to keep an eye on how many batteries you have left. Without batteries, your flashlight won't operate and you won't be able to see many important clues and objects in your environment.While Lone Survivor probably isn't quite as complete of a game as some of the games it's influenced by, this game is still my favorite type of horror game. There are very few, if any, jump scares. Less means that the few jump scares that are in the game are more powerful and memorable. Rather than relying on jump scares, games like Silent Hill and Lone Survivor create the feeling of horror by constructing a creepy atmosphere through good music, sound and art design. Games like these understand that the most horrific things your imagination can cook up are more intense than anything the game can actually show you. So they simply focus on creating good atmosphere and let your imagination do the rest. I especially love the strange hallucinations and bizarre scenery present in Lone Survivor. Good stuff. I think the minimalist pixelated art style works to the game's favor here too. When you see a monster, you just kind of get a general impression of what it looks like, and again, your imagination fills in the details. Lone Survivor perfectly follows the prototype for my favorite kind of horror game.I didn't find the story quite as satisfying or the game design as nuanced as Silent Hill 2, but Lone Survivor is still worth a look if you like these kinds of games. Its length is appropriate, and it does a great job creating a dark and creepy atmosphere. I wish it had the narrative depth of SH2, but does do a great job replicating nearly everything else from that game.For more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/ "

												Awesome soundtrack. Cons would be that the graphics try a bit too hard to be pixelated and the story is played out and relatively transparent. The gameplay itself is a very passable inventory management horror sort of thing, doesn't do the game any favors but it doesn't hurt it much either. It also doesn't seem to take itself very seriously, which really helps explain away the horror label, considering it is about as scary as a luke-warm glass of water.Seriously though, soundtrack is full of great things.

												A truly amazing game. It's very low-priced, so go on, buy it. You'll be glad you did. :)Still here? Cool! Wanna hear an awesome backstory? Okay... I originally bought the game direct from Jasper Byrne's superflatgames -- and little did I know I was doing so a mere day before it came out on Steam! ARGH! But since it is such a good game, I went ahead and bought it again here on Steam. Why? Well, I emailed Jasper to let him know that among all the hate mail from people feeling cheated by this move, I wanted to send him an email letting him know that I took the situation as an advantage to help out a TRUE auteur of games, by purchasing it again via Steam. He actually responded, thanking me and saying that he was going to send out Steam codes for everyone who bought the game direct from him. The guy continually out-does himself, creating every aspect of his games, from the music to the programming to the art, etc. So help this guy out, and buy this awesome game.			"

In addition the beautiful pixel art and detailed environment will keep you intreigued (assuming you don't get freaked out half-way through and quit for a year like I did) all the way through.Plus you can adopt a cat, make a cheeseburger, shoot a writhing thing (or don't), and slip into drug-induced comas every night.

												A fantastic survival horror game with a distinct emphasis on survival.  Draws strong influence from Silent Hill series (no secret that the game's creator, Jasper Byrne, is a fan).  It feels like a 16-bit version of Silent Hill with a dash of Eternal Darkness thrown in.  You are a survivor of an outbreak that has devastated your city.  You awake in your apartment alone, supplies nearly exhausted and find yourself forced to confront the horrors outside to both gather life-sustaining supplies and perhaps find a way to escape the decaying city.  Along the way you will encounter mysterious figures and come to question which, if any, of these encounters even happened.  Unlike many run n' gun action survival horror games. Combat is not something encouraged and you must also take care of your basic biological needs such as eating and sleeping lest your mental health deteriorate and cause you to descend into madness.  It's a bit short but it's execution and artistic style are superb.			"

												Having never played through Silent Hill 2 (It never sucked me in, sorry), I played Lone Survivor and enjoyed my time with it. The atmosphere was dark and foreboding, pretty much making me summon courage every time I had to take a step foward. The monsters, while nothing to look at, did creep me out and want to stay away, but they got kind of boring after a while. Things did eventually get repetitious, but what kept me going was the music, the atmosphere and helping the main character survive. It is short, however, and I wished it could have gone on just a bit longer, but I enjoyed my playthrough. The ending I got kind of sucked, but that's what I get for killing everything. I heard the Red ending sucked more, so I think it's at least worth looking at if you like a creepy atmosphere and excellent music.			"

												Play this game.  Not only does it offer a unique horror story simulation, it does so without having to use complicated graphics or video, so you don't have to have a fantastic graphics card to play!  Every time you play through the story, your choices and actions - what (if any) pills you take, killing the creatures, how you answer questions, etc. - determine where the story goes and what you find out about the character and the situation.  This amazing game will challenge your perception of the reality of the game world and possibly even the real world itself!			"

												Fanatics of survival-horror games, who allready ate up the Silent Hill series, this little jewel is for you. The game as I see is a tribute to good old SH games (up to the 4-th title) with many reminders, and an original story. The pixelated style of the game may feel a bit retro (perhaps a bit too much), but your eyes will accomodate in no time since this type of Psichological horror game is much more about the horror created in your mind then the horror created by visuals. Multiple story paths, multiple endings... Soundtrack made by Akira Yamaoka... NOT! But the musical style is the same. I really reccomend this game to those who have been in that world and want to go back. Wich world you ask? Hmm... ""There was a hole here...It's gone now""			"

												Pretty cool. Its a very new take on the survival horror franchise. As opposed to normal FPS style zombie killing, the focus is shifted more onto the survival aspect such as gathering, sleeping, water and food (that and its a side scroller).The puzzle solving aspect is enjoyable, and the difficult shooting mechanics pushes you to stick to the shadows instead of going for an all out approach, which is just what a survival horror should do!That said, the plot was rather convoluted, and the lackluster ending left something to be desired.6/10			"

												Lone Survivor is a weird game. It's legitimately scary and tense, with an emphasis on avoiding combat and finding resources. You need to find food and water, not just bullets, and the game has no autosave, you have to go back to your apartment to save the game (though there a lot of teleporting mirrors around). Lone Survivor is also quite difficult. It's possible to get completely stuck and have to restart the entire game. I definitely recommend it to any hardcore survival horror fans, especially fans of the psychological brand of horror. To the more casual players, it might not be your cup of tea.			"

												This short but oh so sweet game is a great little survivor horror adventure game. Although it might not seem that way, the pixel art is actually really effective, together with the awesome soundtrack, in creating a perfect atmosphere. I know I'm a total wuss, but still, I was really scared and on edge the entire time.Any negative points to mention? Not really. The game isn't very hard, it's more 'adventure game light', but there is a difficulty spike somewhere in the middle that was a bit annoying, but that might've been because it was during the scariest part (that ♥♥♥♥ing basement, man!).The story is great, never really truly giving away too much, always intriguing. I really recommend this one!!![SPOILERS! WELL, NOT REALLY SPOILERS, BUT YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO READ THIS IS YOU'RE SENSITIVE TO THAT SORT OF THING!!!]I really liked the twist, but what I liked even more is the way they chose to gradually let you have doubts on your own, and then finally find out, but without a PLOT TWIST!!! moment. Your doubts are also never really confirmed, so it keeps you guessing. Really cool way for the story to unfold, but also a really cool way to have a plot twist in a game without getting all 'JJ Abrams' about it, :-)			"

												Lone Survivor was very well done. If Silent Hill was on the NES, it would've been this game. I had a lot of fun figuring out the puzzles. The graphics style was a bit too pixelated and I had to shrink down the screen size so the game would look ok. There's multple endings. Apparently, I got the ♥♥♥♥♥iest one. Woops. I died a lot in this game. The clunky combat can be very challenging at times, but nothing that can't be overcome eventually. The game took almost six hours to beat.

												If you like the Silent Hill series, you will like Lone Survivor. It's a creepy, atmospheric survival horror game with an emphasis on keeping your character fed and well rested while exploring the dark world. The throwback SNES-style graphics work very well, and are obviously inspired by SNES classics like Splatterhouse and Clock Tower. The game does a good job of creating a constant sense of dread and unease, using music and screen effects, even breaking the fourth wall occasionally. If you've got $10 available, don't buy coffee and a vegemite scroll, buy this game instead because it's worth playing.			"

The music, sound effects, and atmosphere seem very much to be a love letter to the first Silent Hill.You explore; examine; collect items; and avoid, lure, and kill enemies, all the while trying to decide what is really happening and what's just a dream or hallucination.  I've only played a little, but it seems that many things determine which direction the game takes, and the attention to detail is amazing.

												The last several great horror games I've played have been indie games, blowing garbage like the new Resident Evils out of the water. It just goes to show that art design and game style is FAR more important than graphics. Lone Survivor is definitely more of a David Lynch style horror where the plot definitely....doesn't exactly ""make sense"" but it's got enough creepy themes and innuendo to keep you invested. Are you actually fighting monsters or have you just totally lost it? Hell if I know, but I went through the game and it was damn enjoyable and creeped the hell outta me. If you like horror, play it.			"

												This game is pretty good... but it could have been better, and because of that its actually more of a disappointment in a way.Goal is to explore the apartment complex you are in and progress towards an ending.  Horror setting is heavily inspired by Silent Hill, but honestly it went too far.   The item use / find sound being basically the same as those in the SH series is a reference.  Monsters making static distorion when they get near you is borrowing / inspiration.  Directly ripping sections from those games and using them both without storyline purpose and without original spin (locking room, object in mouth-like hole, etc) is just too blatant.On top of that, every character you meed is of the 'mysterious' archetype, save one.  When everyone has confusing dialogue, nothing makes sense.  A lot of the dialogue for the main character is definately breaking believability too.  More on that below.Also, enemies should not become invulnerable when stunned by a flare.  That is just dumb as bricks game design.Because of the nonsensical dialogue, it made me feel like my player-driven actions that I took in the game meant nothing. I shot monsters that tried to kill me, ate when complaining of hunger, slept when tired, and acted like the survivalist the game portrayed my setting as necessitating. So then why does my ending involve my character exploring a mental ward, finding a clipboard with his and room number, then entering his room, suddenly deciding he's nihilistic (after 4 game hours of survivalist behavior), taking a pill he finds there, and then lying down on the bed and having a dream of his girlfriend saying 'Hey, you found me even though you're mental and everything's ♥♥♥♥ed up. That's cool right?' The character agrees, then the credits roll. Excuse me what? Where was the survivalist drive? He even just swore revenge for a buddy he made being killed a second ago. If anything he'd react to this exactly like he did to being locked in a random room before (aforementioned direct ripoff) and exactly like a survivalist would -- ""Crap I got locked in! I gotta find a way out!"" There's a theory the character is insane... but then that arbitrarily obsoletes the whole story I just played through. He gave up? Not believable. Was there something I missed in the bunch of mysterious dialogue from every character I meet? Yeah, probably. Games with open storylines are best when they're actually well crafted -- A mailbox with a slot that you decide what letter to put in, not a jumped arrangement of nailed boards that you could... yeah I could jam the letter in that crooked triangle space at the top but it might fall out of all the holes in the sides and bottom.There are two other endings, but given that the one I got is likely to be the default most-common one. The others are obtained for more pacifist behaviors and another for self-destructive ones (not eating, sleeping, killing everything etc). Thus if anything, this 'default' ending shouldn't be so nonsensical and break from the theme the game has presenting the whole time.			"

												Lone Survivor: The Directors cut is based off of the stunning true story of a failed mission involving Navy SEALs during Operation Red Wings. For a game based off of a movie though, it kinda branches off from the story of the film. And by kinda, I mean a lot. Instead of Taliban and Al-Qaeda combatants, the developers made the decision to change them into zombies and other 'horrory' stuff. Instead of Afghanistan, it takes place in an American apartment building and city. Creative changes sure, but at least they laft the main character as kinda 'Mark Wahlburgish' and its kinda good in its own right. 9/10, wouldve preferred they stayed truer to the story but good none the less.

												Jasper Byrne has created a pixellated game so immersive that 8-bit monsters become absolutely terrifying. The several mysterious personalities of Lone Survivor represent the different pieces of your character's psyche, and as the journey goes on you begin to make decisions with a certain sense of mortal and personal albatross. At no point does the game feel like a toy to be played with or a skill to be mastered. There is only survival by any means, and as a player you feel every hit taken, every shot fired, every gruesome corpse as a grave reminder of your own mortality.This is a truly rare game. It has chilling aesthetics, tense gameplay, and an immersive plot with several endings. Lone Survivor is not a scary game with cheesy jump-scares. It's a true horror survival game with an immersive environment. You won't be able to play this game in one sitting or even a couple days; the human body isn't meant to handle the stress this game imparts for more than a few hours at a time.			"

												It's okay, I guess. But I do have serious problems with it which have made me decide to stop playing.After hearing that this game was heavily inspired by Silent Hill, I decided to give it a chance. As you can see, I didn't get too far. I really liked the lighting in Lone Survivor, but that was about it. I wanted to like the game, but it was difficult to navigate a 2D game with a 3D map (maybe that's just me). I know the creator wanted to pay homage to Silent Hill, but he really didn't need to use the same map to do it. There are good 2D maps out there. Take Mercenary Kings, for example. You can see where you are on the map and it's easy to direct yourself based on lines connecting rooms.I will give the game props for its creepy atmosphere and art, but the main character looked like he had a♥♥♥♥♥♥eating grin and it was really distracting when I was exploring the environment. I know it's likely a mask to protect from airborne infections, but still. It does look like a♥♥♥♥♥♥eating grin.			"

												A survival horror game. Though it has a retro look, it has great use of light and dark, and a superb soundtrack (though I wish it made a little more use of it, apart from the background ambient music, a lot of the best music you will only hear in certain sections of the game)While it can't be as scary as Amnesia (since its a 2D sidescrolling game) it can still be scary at times. It is not what you see, but what you can hear, hiding in the shadows, that drives your fear.Though the game is short (4-6hrs), and can be comepleted quickly, its best to take your time. Otherwise there is much story and items you could miss out on.Well reccomended for those that like a psychological horror adventure, where not everything is as it seems...			"

												Beautifully presented, but short in length, Lone Survivor is the cross-stitched Pixel-graphic grandchild of Silent Hill 2. It's somber environment increased by the soundtrack and the gutteral sounds of fleshy monsters brings everything together - from the dark apartment hallways to the dusty streets. Weapons are scarce, food and water must be gathered often and carefully, and the enemies can be avoided through discarding rotten meat or sneaking by.It's one of the best survival horror games I've played, but it's a shame that it's a tad short compared to the length of other horror games. But! It has multiple endings, each brought on by how the player done, either dying a lot, going hungry often, or shooting everything in their path.Highly recommend.			"

This is so unique experience, specially today where we have so many blant survival horror games, where you woke up in the bloody forrest, ofc you know nothing about yourself and it's not important, there is six tentacled monster chasing after you and u need to find 9 onions to open the doors and escape. Well this game is nothing like that. Deep, intence atmosphere around, some freaky monsters (feels some times like stright from best games of silent hill frenchise ), interesting characters and adictive gameplay. What else I can say. If not a little bit dissapointing end I would give this game 10 out of 10, but so far is very strong 9. But theres still 4 more endings to discover, thats right this game have 5 totally difrent endings :) And new game plus mode.			"

												Despite being fairly short, this is one game that horror fans shouldn't miss.  As the lone survivor (teehee) of some unknown apocalyptic disaster or outbreak, you must struggle to survive on your own with your life and sanity intact.  The game focuses very much on psychological horror.  It opts for a very tense and oppressive atmosphere rather than jump scares and over the top horror cliches.  It can be argued that horror is one of the most difficult genres to break into.  Fear is a subjective response and what frightens one person may not frighten another.  While there wasn't anything that made me reach for a new pair of pants, I was certainly on the edge of my seat the entire time.  In my opinion, the best horror games are those that make you incredibly tense and afraid of the unkown.  They make your body cry out for you to quit, they make you hesitant to press on, while at the same time making you crave more.  This game did it for me, and I hope it will for you as well.In conclusion, Lone Survivor is a great horror game.  It's certainly not without it's flaws (which I haven't covered here, because they truly are minor), but will certainly not disappoint.			"

												Today at Great Games with Wolf (Issue #1) : Lone Survivor.""My name is....Doesn't really matter, I suppose.Used to know how long I've been hereNow I've got no idea.""great psicological adventure that dares the player to fight their most intricate fears and question its reality, As you embody the nameless survivor you must face the harsh world that's left behind after a catastrophic-Apocaliptic-esque infection.While this game uses very common horror concepts like a dystopic world ravaged by an unknown infection and zombie-like enemies it still manages to avoid the ""More of the same media"" Gap by throwing a really fragile (Both Physically and Psicologically) protagonist to the mix, the same character clearly suffers from a severe case of depression (given all the horrors he has faced alone) and manages to transmit that feeling to the player, The post-apocalyptic world is indeed a nightmare, Not a bullet-frenzy zombie killing spree that some other media has led us to believe so many times before.With intricate dialogue that usually includes personification of inanimate objects and self-loathing and some hallucinations the player gets to know the background story, It would seem unexistan given that it's not directly narrated but on the contrary, it's there, waiting for you to figure it out by yourself.As you progress through the story you will notice that the survivor will often hallucinate talking with a variety of characters, often passes-out and even finds himself unable to remember doing some things (like writing on his diary). as you struggle to find food, water and enough sleep while you evade the nightmarish creatures the horrors take it's toll on the survivor's mind making the setting all the more depresing.speaking about combat and scavenging, both dynamics are present and are a core feature of the game, you have to eat to stay alive, and not just ""Eat anything"". Eating rotten meat and rats will allow you to stay alive, but also have a higher negative impact on the character's sanity than taking the time to find and cook the ingredients for a propper meal (even when that meal canned beans). sleep is also necesary to keep you sane, and getting too much or not enough will affect your final sanity. The combat is Reminiscent of the golden days of resident evil, only in 2D. and while it lacks the weapon variety of the former it compensates by giving you the chance to clear the whole game without firing a single bullet, Using your wits and stealth to traverse the infected-filled streets.While the creatures in the world are few in variation the character stays human and vulnerable the whole game, Making the first enemy as deadly as the last one. nonetheless the game also pushes some interesting variations to keep your♥♥♥♥♥♥scared and some giant scary monsters to keep things interesting.My final rating: 9/10Brilliantly executed.

												This game was good from start to finish. The character has quite a realistic feel to him, like he could really be somewhere. As you progress through the game, you do really get attached to the character. Its best to keep his mental health at a high, for a decent ending (There are 5 endings.) And even though i got the worst possible end, I feel like playing it again, and not just to get a higher level. Eat well, sleep well, and dont kill monsters. Those are some things that will keep your mental state high. Be considerate of others, even those that arent humans. My rating is a 9.5/10 (Almost rated it 10/10.) I reccomend this game to everyone, but more highly to those who like survival or thriller games.			"

												I'll admit, this flew under my radar. It got added on to the Humble Bundle V shortly before it ended, and I never really though much about it till I scrolled through my library and saw it, and realized I didn't even know what it was about. Well, it ends up being a delicious indie combination of Amnesia and Silent Hill all wrapped up in a nice 16bit 2-D experience. The gameplay can become slightly tedious at times when you sneak past the same monster for the 20th time or so, but it makes up for this in being a relatively short game. Essentially, it's paced very well. It's not a very difficult game, either, as you always have ways to get ammo or food or such as per pills that are always available (they get restocked everyday) yet come at the price of lowering your 'mental health' and giving you a worse ending. Which brings me to my next point: the plot. It's your typical indie horror plot, there are monsters, and they want to kill you, and there's all kinds of unexplainable things that happen that don't make sense until the very end where suddenly they make slightly more sense than they did before. It's a nice play through, really. Whether you're getting your bang for your buck is debatable.			"

												A great game. Heavily inspired by Silent Hill, a bit of Twin Peaks, and a few references to Maniac Mansion. Ahead of its time. Definitely worth buying if you like your horror games to have actual horror in them and not just become another monster hunt.  Note though that it's a kind of tense, subtle horror that builds over time; there are very few (if any) jump scares in the game. If you are aware of this then you will enjoy it.			"

												Do you like Horror? You owe yourself this game. This is one of the best horror games on steam and it does it through drowning you in atmosphere, and unrelenting on that point. But the atmosphere does include a safe haven from the worst, which in a way helps this game a lot. It still feels part of the atmosphere, this secludes safe haven where you're safe. It's an engaging element in the heavy horror of the game. The combat is not a focus, but instead the exploration and atmosphere. It also involves some meaningful choices.			"

												Despite being fairly short, this is one game that horror fans shouldn't miss.  As the lone survivor (teehee) of some unknown apocalyptic disaster or outbreak, you must struggle to survive on your own with your life and sanity intact.  The game focuses very much on psychological horror.  It opts for a very tense and oppressive atmosphere rather than jump scares and over the top horror cliches.  It can be argued that horror is one of the most difficult genres to break into.  Fear is a subjective response and what frightens one person may not frighten another.  While there wasn't anything that made me reach for a new pair of pants, I was certainly on the edge of my seat the entire time.  In my opinion, the best horror games are those that make you incredibly tense and afraid of the unkown.  They make your body cry out for you to quit, they make you hesitant to press on, while at the same time making you crave more.  This game did it for me, and I hope it will for you as well.In conclusion, Lone Survivor is a great horror game.  It's certainly not without it's flaws (which I haven't covered here, because they truly are minor), but will certainly not disappoint.			"

												This game is AMAZING. Despite it's retro, indie graphics and playstyle (which, actually, a lot of people will like too) it has succeeded at being scarier than new Silent Hill and Resident Evil games. It's very psychological, and has a very deep storyline with several different paths to take. The soundtrack is also INCREDIBLE, in fact its a huge factor in the game.  If you like horror or psychological games, or generally story based RPGs, this game is the way to go. It's really depressing that games like these don't sell these days, and how indie it is.			"

I can't help but start by noting it's similarities to Silent Hill 2 (and the fact it does borrow heavily from SH2's soundtrack), with the same kind of dreary, atmospheric landscape, similar kinds of monsters and a vague yet simple storyline. But even with all these similarities it is so much....more. I found I cared a lot more about this simple 2-D character than I ever did in any of the SH games. I found it, and maybe because of its simplicity in design, so much more suffocating. It's a scary, sad game about a lost soul who craves simplicity. I can't recommend it enough.			"

												Lone Survivor is a brave experiment: attempting to bring a visceral horror experience with a distinctive 2D pixelated graphic is not a common thing, especially because the game must provide the player with a lot of atmosphere to make the imagination replacing what such simple graphic cannot show. To achieve this goal, J. Byrne decided to add some rpg elements to a classic side scrolling adventure game, like the necessity to properly rest and eat/drink while exploring the spectral and dangerous city. Ammunitions and supplies are scarse, enemies are tough and numerous, but exploring rewards the player with useful items. Several characters can be met during the travel, they have sidequests for the player and they also help to put together the pieces of the puzzle of a very interesting story behind ""You"", the main character of the game. Unfortunately the game suffers of a certain repeatability which may cause some yawns in the second half of the adventure, and a confusing and rushed ending			"

												If you like the Silent Hill series, you will like Lone Survivor. It's a creepy, atmospheric survival horror game with an emphasis on keeping your character fed and well rested while exploring the dark world. The throwback SNES-style graphics work very well, and are obviously inspired by SNES classics like Splatterhouse and Clock Tower. The game does a good job of creating a constant sense of dread and unease, using music and screen effects, even breaking the fourth wall occasionally. If you've got $10 available, don't buy coffee and a vegemite scroll, buy this game instead because it's worth playing.			"

												Lone Survivor is an odd puppy. It's a pixelated sidescrolling survival-horror that takes inspiration from many great places - most notably Silent Hill. You begin the game trapped on the second floor of an apartment building and must set to work finding a way out (for a start), while making sure to collect supplies, avoid (or kill) a good many monsters, look for other survivors, ocassionally obsess over cats, eat regularly, get a good night's sleep here and there, and most of all: stay sane. Which is easier said than done. It doesn't seem like you can ever truly screw up the game for good. Running out of bullets or dying is usually treated with a fever dream and some mercy supplies, but it puts a massive strain on your sanity. There are several endings, but the basic gist is that high sanity equals the good ending, low sanity equals a bad ending. Of course, what all effects your sanity - and how - is a much more complicated story indeed, and one you shall have to discover on your own.			"

												The best Silent Hill-like since Konami's golden years on PlayStation (yes, even 'The Room' has its place and was genuinely good, shut up). Hardly reinvents the wheel, because it's a carbon copy of Team Silent's efforts down to the confirm prompt sound. As far as 2D-demake/homages go, it's the only one of its kind and offers some new things to the formula. With an emphasis on the actual survival part of horror, you'll be foraging for foodstuffs and making recipes to keep your health and sanity up. Then there's the way your actions (aggression vs stealth, consuming different meds, etc) affect the possible endings. As you would expect, these systems are a bit obscure, but the game drops hints throughout if you pay close attention. There are no puzzles to speak of, but there can be some frustrating trial and error sections to the game. Jasper Byrne is no Yamaoka, but the game feels built around the soundtrack - it's quite good.A note about the control scheme: it can't be rebound, so, oops.Everything else is solid if unremarkable; this is real survival horror in bite-sized pill form.

												This game is actually pretty fun. It's really ♥♥♥♥ing weird and not too understandable, but it's fun. This game takes 16 bit and makes it a horror. I never thought horror could be done within a 2D game to be honest. But it's got the important things like risk, and  some actual fear built into it. And while your mind may be befuddled by some of the things that happen in here. The fact remains you have that fear of death and that bewilderment of what might happen next that is essential to this type of game. So that's about all I can say the game is good and well worth the money you have to pay for it. So go spend that money and get this game. If you don't like it (Which shouldn't happen), than take it up with me because I'm the one telling you to purchase it.			"

												Despite the very low resolution/pixelated graphics, Lone Survivor successfully comes off as a very creepy game through effective use of tone, lighting, music and pacing.

												Brilliant game. I can't help but start by noting it's similarities to Silent Hill 2 (and the fact it does borrow heavily from SH2's soundtrack), with the same kind of dreary, atmospheric landscape, similar kinds of monsters and a vague yet simple storyline. But even with all these similarities it is so much....more. I found I cared a lot more about this simple 2-D character than I ever did in any of the SH games. I found it, and maybe because of its simplicity in design, so much more suffocating. It's a scary, sad game about a lost soul who craves simplicity. I can't recommend it enough.			"

												Awesome soundtrack. Cons would be that the graphics try a bit too hard to be pixelated and the story is played out and relatively transparent. The gameplay itself is a very passable inventory management horror sort of thing, doesn't do the game any favors but it doesn't hurt it much either. It also doesn't seem to take itself very seriously, which really helps explain away the horror label, considering it is about as scary as a luke-warm glass of water.Seriously though, soundtrack is full of great things.

												A game that suprised me, and is now one of my favorite games ever.  The characters are interesting and creepy, the environment is creepy, everything is creepy, had me frightened the whole way through, though it does also have an odd sense of humor throughout which was enjoyable.  The soundtrack is amazing and wish it didn't cost just about as much as the game itself.  If silent hill games (esp the old ones, like silent hill 2) are your forte, check this one out, unless you hate that 8bit/16bit look.  I never thought a game with graphics like this would scare me, I was wrong.  The save system can be a bit frustrating at times, as can the shooting and hiding mechanics, but mostly they're pretty simple, they just can wig out at times.  Also, as many say, it's hard to not see a huge smile on the protagonist's face once you see it that way, it's really a surgical/medical mask, but it sure does look like a huge goofy smile.  Overall great game, I'd give it a 9/10			"

												A fantastic survival horror game with a distinct emphasis on survival.  Draws strong influence from Silent Hill series (no secret that the game's creator, Jasper Byrne, is a fan).  It feels like a 16-bit version of Silent Hill with a dash of Eternal Darkness thrown in.  You are a survivor of an outbreak that has devastated your city.  You awake in your apartment alone, supplies nearly exhausted and find yourself forced to confront the horrors outside to both gather life-sustaining supplies and perhaps find a way to escape the decaying city.  Along the way you will encounter mysterious figures and come to question which, if any, of these encounters even happened.  Unlike many run n' gun action survival horror games. Combat is not something encouraged and you must also take care of your basic biological needs such as eating and sleeping lest your mental health deteriorate and cause you to descend into madness.  It's a bit short but it's execution and artistic style are superb.			"

												A survival horror game which is ACTUALLY SCARY!? We haven't had one of those in a while. The game is one of the few survival horror games where surviving is actually difficult, as food and ammo is scarce, and your character is pretty useless at aiming at anything more than 2 meters away. Even your flashlight runs on batteries which you need to scavange for. You will spend a lot of the time making sure that your character is well rested and fed properly, as well as scavenging for ammo and later in the game flairs. The sheer tension created by the game is becoming rare in horror games in general nowadays, and it's nice to see a ruturn to psychological horror, instead of just jump scares and easily killable enemies. The main way this game does this isn't actually the surrealism of the story or the environment, or even the demonic, faceless monsters that you'll be facing, but the sound. Static starts playing whenever you're seen by an enemy, prompting you to run away or shoot it, and the little ambient sounds of the environment serve to make sure that you are fearing your next step. There are a lot of clever little things done with the music and sound which make the game a far better experience. The open eneded story is very enjoyable to play through, and many little things that you do in the game change the way it plays out. The only part I felt was out of place was a chase sequence in the middle which was mostly just memorizing paths, and the end boss, which was fairly dull and unimaginative, but other than that the enemies were terrifying and the story interesting and surreal. It's quite short, but you probably won't be able to do everything in your first playthrough, and maybe not even your second, so you won't be compeltly done with it for a while. All in all, it's an amazing game, and I would definitely reccomend it to anyone who likes survival horror games, or just games in general. I'm pretty sure it's also the first survival horror game in which you can adopt a cat. Get it.			"

												Lone Survivor is a brave experiment: attempting to bring a visceral horror experience with a distinctive 2D pixelated graphic is not a common thing, especially because the game must provide the player with a lot of atmosphere to make the imagination replacing what such simple graphic cannot show. To achieve this goal, J. Byrne decided to add some rpg elements to a classic side scrolling adventure game, like the necessity to properly rest and eat/drink while exploring the spectral and dangerous city. Ammunitions and supplies are scarse, enemies are tough and numerous, but exploring rewards the player with useful items. Several characters can be met during the travel, they have sidequests for the player and they also help to put together the pieces of the puzzle of a very interesting story behind ""You"", the main character of the game. Unfortunately the game suffers of a certain repeatability which may cause some yawns in the second half of the adventure, and a confusing and rushed ending			"

												An endearingly crafted story about the situation everyone dreams of but no one is ready for.  It's you, and you alone, against the hoard of monsters that have either killed everyone or left their spirits crushed and broken.  This is the apocalypse, and few games capture the desperation and everyday struggles of living as a dying race so thought-provokingly.The gameplay is all about planning, exploration, and resourcefulness.  The story itself is provocative and timeless, as we go into the mind of a man forced to reconcile the past so he can survive the present.  Twists and turns abound in this indie title, so get ready for a brainbender.  The graphics evoke a simpler time, and it's a shame this game was never officially on the SNES.  If you are looking for a psychological journey with a dark premise, desperate situations, and retro graphics, then this is the place.  Lone survivor delivers exactly what it promises and then some.

												A great game. Heavily inspired by Silent Hill, a bit of Twin Peaks, and a few references to Maniac Mansion. Ahead of its time. Definitely worth buying if you like your horror games to have actual horror in them and not just become another monster hunt.  Note though that it's a kind of tense, subtle horror that builds over time; there are very few (if any) jump scares in the game. If you are aware of this then you will enjoy it.			"

												Do you like Horror? You owe yourself this game. This is one of the best horror games on steam and it does it through drowning you in atmosphere, and unrelenting on that point. But the atmosphere does include a safe haven from the worst, which in a way helps this game a lot. It still feels part of the atmosphere, this secludes safe haven where you're safe. It's an engaging element in the heavy horror of the game. The combat is not a focus, but instead the exploration and atmosphere. It also involves some meaningful choices.			"

												A survival horror game which is ACTUALLY SCARY!? We haven't had one of those in a while. The game is one of the few survival horror games where surviving is actually difficult, as food and ammo is scarce, and your character is pretty useless at aiming at anything more than 2 meters away. Even your flashlight runs on batteries which you need to scavange for. You will spend a lot of the time making sure that your character is well rested and fed properly, as well as scavenging for ammo and later in the game flairs. The sheer tension created by the game is becoming rare in horror games in general nowadays, and it's nice to see a ruturn to psychological horror, instead of just jump scares and easily killable enemies. The main way this game does this isn't actually the surrealism of the story or the environment, or even the demonic, faceless monsters that you'll be facing, but the sound. Static starts playing whenever you're seen by an enemy, prompting you to run away or shoot it, and the little ambient sounds of the environment serve to make sure that you are fearing your next step. There are a lot of clever little things done with the music and sound which make the game a far better experience. The open eneded story is very enjoyable to play through, and many little things that you do in the game change the way it plays out. The only part I felt was out of place was a chase sequence in the middle which was mostly just memorizing paths, and the end boss, which was fairly dull and unimaginative, but other than that the enemies were terrifying and the story interesting and surreal. It's quite short, but you probably won't be able to do everything in your first playthrough, and maybe not even your second, so you won't be compeltly done with it for a while. All in all, it's an amazing game, and I would definitely reccomend it to anyone who likes survival horror games, or just games in general. I'm pretty sure it's also the first survival horror game in which you can adopt a cat. Get it.			"

I sort of had to laugh. But in all honesty, similar elements aside, Lone Survivor KICKS THE♥♥♥♥♥♥OUT OF SILENT HILL. It is a vastly different experience altogether; fully intimate and engaging. I was totally immersed and intrigued. It was very refreshing, like how games used to be before they just started pumping them out.The story is dark, mysterious, deep and disturbed. The only puzzle I've seen so far is trying to piece together the fragments of downard spiralling insanity as the adventure unwinds in shifting clarity.I am definitely going to keep my eye on works from Jasper Byrne  from now on.JUST GO GET IT.

												Lone Survivor is an odd puppy. It's a pixelated sidescrolling survival-horror that takes inspiration from many great places - most notably Silent Hill. You begin the game trapped on the second floor of an apartment building and must set to work finding a way out (for a start), while making sure to collect supplies, avoid (or kill) a good many monsters, look for other survivors, ocassionally obsess over cats, eat regularly, get a good night's sleep here and there, and most of all: stay sane. Which is easier said than done. It doesn't seem like you can ever truly screw up the game for good. Running out of bullets or dying is usually treated with a fever dream and some mercy supplies, but it puts a massive strain on your sanity. There are several endings, but the basic gist is that high sanity equals the good ending, low sanity equals a bad ending. Of course, what all effects your sanity - and how - is a much more complicated story indeed, and one you shall have to discover on your own.			"

												One of my favorite things about this game isn't the atmosphere or the choices you can make (which is done very effectively and requires some thought). But the characters themselves. A cross between all in the main character's head and generally nice or partially helpful characters litter the game which liven up the dank depressing mood.In fact, since I played the game on a pacifist run I found that underneath the depressing ""dog-eat-dog"" atmosphere, there's some genuine hope and optimism. It gives you such a warm fuzzy feeling to pick up a can of beans and know that it will be a delicious treat tomorrow along with your morning coffee. The main character's reaction is not only the icing, but the cake itself. Treating mental disorders has never felt so nice.That said, the difficulty flucuates from easy to hard and back to easy around the midpoint and the game requires a lot of guessing to figure out (drinking milk to get the milk bottles for bottles of water).

It is very mysterious and ambiguous, and it induces emotions that will stay with you long after you play it. The soundtrack is truly a strong point of this game. It fits the game perfectly and is emotion-inducing. You'll want to let the title screen track play all the way through, trust me. From the title screen track to the creepy undertones that play in your apartment, the soundtrack is top-notch.If you haven't played this game, you should.			"

The game focuses very much on psychological horror.  It opts for a very tense and oppressive atmosphere rather than jump scares and over the top horror cliches.  It can be argued that horror is one of the most difficult genres to break into.  Fear is a subjective response and what frightens one person may not frighten another.  While there wasn't anything that made me reach for a new pair of pants, I was certainly on the edge of my seat the entire time.  In my opinion, the best horror games are those that make you incredibly tense and afraid of the unkown.  They make your body cry out for you to quit, they make you hesitant to press on, while at the same time making you crave more.  This game did it for me, and I hope it will for you as well.In conclusion, Lone Survivor is a great horror game.  It's certainly not without it's flaws (which I haven't covered here, because they truly are minor), but will certainly not disappoint.			"

												Lone Survivor has excellent sprite artwork, decent background layout, and is an overall attractive presentation in terms of environment and atmosphere. Lone Survivor's story is lacking, both endings are very predictable. With only two possible outcomes, the game tries to pinhole you into a passive or aggressive gameplay style which in my opinion detracts from a proper flowing story and pace of the settings.You're buying this game for great sprite animation, and the atmosphere. The story is something you yourself probably have thought up in a boring math class. My suggestion is that you wait for a 50-75% sale.			"

												This one is not as good as everyone says.The protagonist is boring and lifeless, and I guessed the twist ending ten minutes in. The writing is competent but uninspiring. There really is nothing in the story department that you haven't seen before.Gameplay is repetitious. You'll spend a lot of time backtracking through the same samey areas over and over. Your character is in constant need of rest or food, which is more annoying than compelling. The food crafting system is bizarrely over-complex, and entails a lot of time spent struggling with the terrible interface. Speaking of...Controls are baffling laid-out. Presumably this is meant to make combat more stressful and convey that our character is not some bad♥♥♥♥♥super soldier, but in reality it just means looking away from the game at your keyboard to realign your fingers every time you need to do anything other than walk and look at stuff. The hotkeys are a total joke.If you get it as part of a bundle, it might be worth your time to try it out, but I cannot recommend buying this game. "

												Today at Great Games with Wolf (Issue #1) : Lone Survivor.""My name is....Doesn't really matter, I suppose.Used to know how long I've been hereNow I've got no idea.""great psicological adventure that dares the player to fight their most intricate fears and question its reality, As you embody the nameless survivor you must face the harsh world that's left behind after a catastrophic-Apocaliptic-esque infection.While this game uses very common horror concepts like a dystopic world ravaged by an unknown infection and zombie-like enemies it still manages to avoid the ""More of the same media"" Gap by throwing a really fragile (Both Physically and Psicologically) protagonist to the mix, the same character clearly suffers from a severe case of depression (given all the horrors he has faced alone) and manages to transmit that feeling to the player, The post-apocalyptic world is indeed a nightmare, Not a bullet-frenzy zombie killing spree that some other media has led us to believe so many times before.With intricate dialogue that usually includes personification of inanimate objects and self-loathing and some hallucinations the player gets to know the background story, It would seem unexistan given that it's not directly narrated but on the contrary, it's there, waiting for you to figure it out by yourself.As you progress through the story you will notice that the survivor will often hallucinate talking with a variety of characters, often passes-out and even finds himself unable to remember doing some things (like writing on his diary). as you struggle to find food, water and enough sleep while you evade the nightmarish creatures the horrors take it's toll on the survivor's mind making the setting all the more depresing.speaking about combat and scavenging, both dynamics are present and are a core feature of the game, you have to eat to stay alive, and not just ""Eat anything"". Eating rotten meat and rats will allow you to stay alive, but also have a higher negative impact on the character's sanity than taking the time to find and cook the ingredients for a propper meal (even when that meal canned beans). sleep is also necesary to keep you sane, and getting too much or not enough will affect your final sanity. The combat is Reminiscent of the golden days of resident evil, only in 2D. and while it lacks the weapon variety of the former it compensates by giving you the chance to clear the whole game without firing a single bullet, Using your wits and stealth to traverse the infected-filled streets.While the creatures in the world are few in variation the character stays human and vulnerable the whole game, Making the first enemy as deadly as the last one. nonetheless the game also pushes some interesting variations to keep your♥♥♥♥♥♥scared and some giant scary monsters to keep things interesting.My final rating: 9/10Brilliantly executed.

												Lone Survivor is a brave experiment: attempting to bring a visceral horror experience with a distinctive 2D pixelated graphic is not a common thing, especially because the game must provide the player with a lot of atmosphere to make the imagination replacing what such simple graphic cannot show. To achieve this goal, J. Byrne decided to add some rpg elements to a classic side scrolling adventure game, like the necessity to properly rest and eat/drink while exploring the spectral and dangerous city. Ammunitions and supplies are scarse, enemies are tough and numerous, but exploring rewards the player with useful items. Several characters can be met during the travel, they have sidequests for the player and they also help to put together the pieces of the puzzle of a very interesting story behind ""You"", the main character of the game. Unfortunately the game suffers of a certain repeatability which may cause some yawns in the second half of the adventure, and a confusing and rushed ending			"

												Pretty intense little game. The creator really did a great job of translating the psychological/survival horror genre into a 16 bit, 2D sidescroller. Also, the puzzles made sense and weren't arbitrary or random, a big plus in my book.I would really like to play it again, because you're supposed to be able to unlock different endings, but the action elements (gunplay, stealth) just were not fun. Trying to sneak around a monster or going toe-to-toe with your pistol was not exciting, just frustrating.			"

												A great game. Heavily inspired by Silent Hill, a bit of Twin Peaks, and a few references to Maniac Mansion. Ahead of its time. Definitely worth buying if you like your horror games to have actual horror in them and not just become another monster hunt.  Note though that it's a kind of tense, subtle horror that builds over time; there are very few (if any) jump scares in the game. If you are aware of this then you will enjoy it.			"

												It is an unwritten rule that the unanswered question is the one that will stick with you and that the less you see of a monster or evil bugaboo, the more frightening it is. So what if you rendered everything in ultra low resolution pixels, compressed sound clips, and navigate everything in side-scrolling 2D?You get pants full of human feces. Your feces to be precise. Allegorical and atmospheric. It's a privilege with every pair of soiled trousers.10/10 Would crap myself again.			"

												Ultimately I recommend this game but I have some issues with it. It isn't scary but it is just creepy enough to make you feel uncomfortable which is good. The controls function and the art works well with the story. But the story just kind of leaves me with meh. There are the hints of choice and consequence which is nice but there isn't enough to drive me to finish the game. I've set the game aside and I can't say I want to reinstall it and complete it. With that being said I am fond of the game and I do believe that others will really enjoy the game, but as for me, I'm good.			"

												Got bored with this game. The music and feel are spot on for Silent Hill fans like myself, but some of it's design choices are quite questionable. The map is a pain to use and gunplay is a little bit too complicated for it's own good. Also, the whole thing with upkeeping your character's mental and physical health is a little too needy for my tastes. Not a bad game, just has some glaring flaws that I couldn't get over to enjoy this games rather interesting atmosphere and story.			"

												This game was good from start to finish. The character has quite a realistic feel to him, like he could really be somewhere. As you progress through the game, you do really get attached to the character. Its best to keep his mental health at a high, for a decent ending (There are 5 endings.) And even though i got the worst possible end, I feel like playing it again, and not just to get a higher level. Eat well, sleep well, and dont kill monsters. Those are some things that will keep your mental state high. Be considerate of others, even those that arent humans. My rating is a 9.5/10 (Almost rated it 10/10.) I reccomend this game to everyone, but more highly to those who like survival or thriller games.			"
