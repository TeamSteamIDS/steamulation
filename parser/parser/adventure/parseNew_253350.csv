												Tiny Barbarian is an indie gem. The gameplay is hard enough to be challenging and engaging enough to keep you playing until the end!The music is top notch and the art direction really help make this game stand out.I have put a good 7-10 hours into this game before it made it onto Steam.I would recommend this game to anyone/everyone.

												What do you like doing with your time? Does it involve killing snake, bird and miscellaneous soldiers that probably had a famillies to go home to? Maybe while doing some solid platforming and pillaging their greatest treasures? Yes? Then Tiny Barbarian is the game for you! Damn right those children are going to have a terrible Christmas, you just murdered their parents! All in a day's work for a barbarian. I've beat this game at least 5 times before it made its way onto Steam, and everytime I do I feel a little more barbaric. Can you say the same? Of course you can't, YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT THIS GAME YET! Why not? Is it because of the murdering potential parents thing? Don't worry about that, you're probably doing those kids a favor. Now they can grow up to be masked vigilantes that call you their nemesis. Sounds like a win win to me. You get awesome masked vigilantes in the world and a new foe to vanquish, BEING A BARBARIAN IS AWESOME.Let's recap here, you platform in this game, you murder everything in this game and you pillage their greatest treasures. This is the most realistic and advanced barbarian simulation game I have ever played, just a little Tinier.			"

												The game opens with you fighting off a horde of monsters on top of a mountain until you are overwhelmed, and then introduces you to the main menu. I really enjoy the Conan theme and all the other sorts of high fantasy barbarian themes in this game. It's outrageously “old style”, not just in its graphics but in its design and gameplay too. Extremely simple yet fairly challenging, it brings back fond memories of playing those old classic games, but if you haven't played those and/or are immune to the nostalgia effect, then there isn't much on offer for you here.

												Somewhere in a desert wasteland, a tiny barbarian hangs crudely nailed to a tree. He contemplates the shifting of the sands, the hungry gleam in vultures' eyes, and the sweet brutal revenge he must take. Break free in as dramatic a way as possible! Your adventure begins!Within 15 seconds of playing, you'll have savaged the local wildlife, defiled ancient ruins, and most likely♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about a dozen evil warlocks just by being alive. A few steps later you'll already be discovering secrets as you bash through cracking rocks to uncover coins, gems, and... meat! Collect treasure for score, and replenish health by eating strange meats you find hidden in crevices, or even just laying on the ground! Fearsome barbarians eat whatever they want!Battle wizards and their beastly minions! Punch rocks until they turn into diamonds! Hack away at vicious armored soldiers intent on slaying you and taking away your totally sweet loincloth! Discover wondrous and deadly ancient mechanisms! Tame ferocious beasts! Flex your guns and pecs indiscriminately! Dangle from chains 1-handed like a true badass! Handle explosives with little to no care whatsoever! Dodge snake-based traps, the most fiendish kind of traps known to man! Experience love, lust, and loss! Followed by triumph! Possibly followed by even more lust, the most important emotion!All this excitement (And more! So much more!...eventually!) is packed into an experience just under 2 hours long, with 3 more adventures (episodes) to follow once they're finished and released by the developer. All future episodes will be available to you for free by buying this game (Episode 1), with the second coming very soon as of the time of this review (and I use the term ""review"" loosely!).If you can't wait that long because you're an impatient prick or have Restless Gamer-Finger Syndrome, this game includes an endless Horde Mode that strands you atop of a pyramid and pits you against an endless army of goblins, skeleton archers, and trolls! (Or possibly very large hairy barbarians, I can't tell, but they bleed all the same!) You might rage at the constant potshots the archers take, I find myself losing most of my health to them, but YMMV.Enemy variety is alright, we'll probably see different enemies in the upcoming episodes. I'm more annoyed that there aren't that many enemies hanging out in the main game's levels. However, the ones that are there are strategically placed for a challenge, and Horde Mode has all the mobbing you could want.Enough combat moves are available to keep you alive, but face it, all you really need is that badass Elbow Drop! Snake getting grabby? Elbow Drop! Need to deflect a barrage of arrows? Elbow Drop! Vulture trying to eat you? ELBOW DROP IT OUT OF THE SKYYYY!!!The other moves are your basic slash attack, a useful 3-hit combo that sends enemies flying, an overhead swing useful for crowd control and deflecting arrows, and a midair spinning attack that multihits (I find it hard to pull off, the timing is weird). Check the Steam Community Discussion page for more info on the attacks. The main game is easy enough to play through with just the basic attack and occasional 3-hit combo, the extra moves are more for Horde Mode survival.What else, what else... oh right, buy this game! The music fits the bill, the levels are well designed so they aren't monotonous, secrets aren't terribly hard to find thanks to the level design ""hinting"" at them, boss fights are entertaining, there are nekkid ladies, and that's about it. It's a simple and fun game that I'm sure is far from simple and fun to make, so throw your money at the developer so he can crank out those other Episodes.			"

												About 2/5 levels have been finished. There is very little content but it is really good despite how little there is.

Careful: This game is currently 50% finished (even though it is NOT marked as early access) and progress seems to have halted. The content that is finished is at full release quality and well done. The developer funded the game through a kickstarter. He said he asked for the most realistic amount of money and the game ""will be finished, it will be finished on time"". Estimated full game delivery date was Jan 2013. The update with Episode (level) 2 took one year. Episode 3 seems to be nowhere in site.I would rate this game as neutral if there was an option for that.Update #1, Feb 18, 2015: After more than a year Episode 2 is now available for free within the game. Hopefully Episodes 3 & 4 won't also take 1-2 years each.Update #2, Mar 25, 2016: Another year has passed and the game still only has level 1 and 2, no level 3 or 4 yet. If you buy make sure you're okay with the possibility that he might not release the other half of the game.Original Review Mar 19, 2014: Awesome game, currently only has 1 level with the other 3 promised levels MIA. Hang tight on getting this to make sure he releases episodes 2-4 within the game first. As it stands you pay full price and get a game that is not in early access but is missing 75% of the game content.			"

												Awesome game, and Three more episodes coming! To me it felt more like a hybrid of 8 and 16bit, as opposed to just an NES title, as many suggest. Really tight and fluid controls - I never died and screamed at my controller. Kickass music, some humorous scenes. Has Wallchicken. Has Epic boss battles.Honestly I wasn't impressed at first but it just got better and better. This episode took me about two hours, but I enjoyed it enough to want to go through again and see if I can raise in the leaderboards, maybe even do some Horde Mode. Even at 2 hours, with 3 more episodes it will hopefully add a good amount of time, and I'm actually hyped to wait for another.If you're an Oldschool Gamer, this is not a let-down.			"

												I love this game!Obviously there's tons of tributes to Conan, mainly the 80s Governator movie.  One thing by the end boss was really awesome!Still there's more to it than that.  Lots of other fantasy influences, most will recognize the thief and riding beast from Golden Axe.   I imagine the sorcerers who appear later in the game are a tip of the helmet to Tar'hai wizards from the ""Airtight Garage"".The game is brutal, punishing and at the same time fun and exhilerating.  It's perfectly designed levels, tons of playback such as finding all the diamonds, and has the control it demands.  Only two levels as I write this - found another incredible Golden Axe tribute part way through, a hidden area.This game is SOOOO worth the money and I hope they make more levels, but well worth it for one, certainly two.  The beginning mini-game ""Against the Horde"" is feature enough for some casual gaming fun!			"

												I'll give Tiny Barbarian credit for one thing, it has one of the best openings of any platformer around. Right when you start, the game pans up to a desperate mountaintop siege, you versus an endless horde of slavering monsters. The game proper starts when you inevitably die, but it's a great sort of free-form tutorial and a lot of fun on its own. It might also be the one truly unique part of the game, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable on the whole.Tiny Barbarian is a retro platformer that poses you as a Conan-looking fellow about the size of a Broforce character (flexing and all!) against many stages of monsters and traps. In your quest to vanquish evil and rescue your comely companion, you'll master a host of sword slashes and combos that can juggle your opponents in hilarious fashion. You can also hang from and climb vines and chains, and vault up ledges you can't quite clear. The controls are tight and the challenges the stages present give you some creative workouts with them.As a platformer, it hits all the right notes without being too terribly hard. You get a life bar of about seven hits before you go down, and death just puts you back at the start of the immediate area. There are two chapters to tackle, the first being a straightforward romp through deserts and caves to take on an evil warlord, and the second being a fantastic journey through jungles and on the backs of bees to save your beau. There's a jump in difficulty between the two that I didn't find particularly welcoming, but nothing that really turned me off of the game.That's pretty much the whole package, about two hours of quality retro platforming. Don't expect any big unlocks or secrets, just jumping and hacking away. It occupies a nice space between the likes of Volgarr and Shovel Knight, more accessible than the former and simpler than the latter. Supposedly there are two more episodes coming, but they've been coming for years now so I wouldn't buy with that expectation in mind. Tiny Barbarian is still worth a look though if you want a platformer that's simple hack 'n' slash fun.			"

												it's pretty good. Lot of flaws in this one but it's not bad at least. I would still prefer Shovel Knight over this one, and I'm really not sure who thought it was a good idea to make a simple platformer like this episodic. That said it looks good and has fairly good music. Doesn't stand out very much but it's catchy and good enough for the game. Strange thing about it though is the sound effects are awful. There's barely any to begin with and they're very simple and generic. It doesn't feel satisfying at all to combo/hit an enemy. Level design is mostly not bad but there are A LOT and I mean A LOT of parts where it's like you climb up something and do some platforming, but if you miss the platform you fall down and have to start a whole section over again. It's really frusterating and obnoxious. Bosses are kinda meh. Nothing to brag about and for the most part a little too annoying and trial and error. Not to the point I hate it but some of them just don't seemed design well. (aka the Donkey Kong boss when he throws barrels straight at you at the exact time you need to jump on a vine) The bosses are all pretty much ""wait for boss to stop attacking, and go in on boss at certain time"" overall it's good enough to at least try when its on sale. I got it for a buck in an indie bundle and I'd say it's really worth it for that price since it also has cards which will give me some money back. There's only two ""episodes"" out right now and they're only an hour long. If you like Platformers and have gone through most of your options you should try this flawed yet good enough gameoh also for the love of god turn on auto-grab			"

												Nifty little homage to old Castlevania/Goldenaxe/Sonic 2 era games (and those are the ones i recognized it cribbing from). Only has two levels right now, but they're both about an hour long, minimum. It's also extremely generous with checkpoints, and dying only sets you at the start of the current room.That said, the ledge/chain/vine grabbing control is a bit jank to do on a 360 pad.PS. ♥♥♥♥ Castlevania Birds.

												Tiny Barbarian DX is hands down one of the best retro platformers you can grab your hands on right now. Everything about it is just fantastic, albiet an extremly short experience.PROS - Levels never feel unfair, and check points are frequent enought that you won't feel cheated by death. - Jumping on platforms and slashing your sword feels tight. Chaining kills is satisfying as hell.- Boss fights require you to be patient and figure out how to use their attack against them. - The game's visuals are gorgeous, with multiple scrolling backgrounds with beautiful pixel art.- Horde mode to keep you occpied if the campaign gets too rough- AND ONE OF THE BEST CHIP TUNE SOUND TRACKS EVER TO HAVE GRACED VIDEO GAMES; THUMPIN ALONG AS YOU FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH THE GAME. SERIOUSLY JUST LISTEN TO IT: http://store.steampowered.comCONS- If you buy the game right now you only get 1 out of the 4 episdoes. The rest are included with the purchase but their release dates are all TBA.- Some of the vehicle levels are a bit tedious cause your GIANT CAT controls a bit floaty. But I guess that's part of the challenge. It's not impossible though, just take your time.- While the jumping is very responsive, grabbing on to ledges sometimes was hit and miss as i fell 1/4 of the time. This is a VERY MINOR complaint.- AGAIN TOO DAMN SHORT. I NEED MY TINY BARBARIAN FIX YO. Ultimately while not a complete experience (yet), this game is definately worth the price it's asking for admission. Episode 1 will take around 1-2 hours to beat, but you can replay it to get achievements and find secrets. You can also play the Horde mode to keep busy.Tiny Barbarian DX episode 1: 9/10			"

The game is a joy to play, especially if you can remember the heyday of the NES platform era. It also packs quite a challenge but remains fun throughout.

												I mean I'm not totally binning it, it's just for a barbarian game with a bunch of combos and elbow drops mostly what I'm doing is obnoxious platforming. A lot of good energy , solid and engaging look and animation but a bunch of little things feel off; I-frames feel like a roulette  , mantling is begrudging (kudos to the team making auto grab a feature though) , no blood spurt or animation to let you know you've killed an enemy mid combo so you can move on to the next one.Oh and a game with hack and slash elements but all enemys damaging you upon contact feels goofy and tedious. Like trying to juggle enemys and then you get hurt because you touched them etc.Just a lot of moments where it feels you got nailed and you didn't really see what you did wrong this time compared to the time before where you didn't.If you exit mid chapter and then continue checkpoints are not the same as the ones you start from after dying. There's less of them.Which seems really pointless? Is that a challenge feature? Really? Look if you like a lot of classic platforming*  and are okay with things feeling just a tad janky at times, it's a personable game that is some how is hard to hate.

												I wouldn't have guessed, if I didn't see the elbow drop, this is clearly Randy Savage simulator! Damn good and epic oldschool platformer designed with heart and care. Game starts when our protagonist, the barbarian (Randy?) is left to die in desert. There is only couple things in our hero's mind and they are treasures, revenge and babes! At the beginning, the game seems pretty simplistic, which it is, but the further you get, the harder it gets, so your thumbs better have good muscle memory! I beated the first chapter, but there seems to be four of them, the first one only available right now. First chapter felt like it was already the full story, it was so well done and it excites me to see what the other chapters will bring. Highly recommend for all oldschool platformer fans!			"

												It's really hard for me to recommend this game to anyone, but I will say a few things about it. Replay value isnt really big here, unless you absolutely love the game. One thing is that this game has 3 additional episodes planned. The first episode obviously, and the 2nd was just added to the game. So I really like that, but some people might be unhappy to learn they aren't all already available. The first episode, is rather short actually, took me about 1.5 hours to actually finish it from the start. Granted, it took me a handfull of angry tries before I actually finished it. Plus I havent even touched Ep.2 yet, i'll save that rage-fest for another date.This game is really hard. What makes it hard? Its all about timing, patience and knowledge. Taking damage not only hurts, but it gives you that classic knockback we all know and hate. I told my friend, only play this game if youre ok with pulling out your hair.The music is AWESOME. Seriously, this is my favorite part (besides flexing).			"

												I really am in two minds about this game.On the one hand I really want to like it and it's not like there isn't much on offer here. The game has an appealing aesthetic, lots of indie charme, surprisingly fresh level design, varied enemies and locales, multiple moves, combos, an old-school soundtrack - take your pick! I even backed this game on Kickstarter.On the other hand I have not walked away that frustrated from a playsession with a platformer in a really long time. So what's wrong? That's not so easy to pin down.Just for perspective: I have been playing platformers for half my life now (so in the realm of fifteen years and counting - yes I'm old, I know) and consider myself to be fairly able at it. Of recent fame, I finished Cave Story, Guacamelee and Shovel Knight. All these games contain more than their share of challenging platforming and boss fights, but have I ever felt that frustrated playing them? No.So: What wrong? Well first off the timimg of the controls and the game as a whole (as in how ""tight"" and responsive the controls are and whether a given level plays out deterministically in terms of when does which enemy fire etc.) seem to be really wonky. I cannot count the number of times I have taken cheap hits or deaths because some button press did not register or the ""pattern"" of the level just did not play out the same way this single time.Secondly, as good as the overall level design is, it sometimes suffers from the chosen aesthetic. Foreground and Background sometimes merge too much to support the amount of twitch apparently required. It also often takes the one step that makes a fun challenge into a more frustrating ordeal. Ample amounts of spikes at the bottom of an already challenging platforming section with enemy involvement (and wonky controls) are an example of this. It also sometimes feels like there is exactly one thing too much going on on the screen to be able to figure out the ""rythm"" or pattern of the level that is usually required to master it. I don't have the feeling this is possible in this game (especially given the wonky timing mentioned above). Might be that's not the kind of platformer gameplay envisioned by the devs, that's fair. But for me that is the heart of every good platformer: There can be a good amount of twitch, but if you really figure out a level, beating should not require big amounts of it.So can I recommend it? If it comes down to the most important question, namely whether I enjoyed playing the game, I guess the answer is ""No"" for the above reasons - as much as it hurts me, especially after having backed this on Kickstarter. I am not looking forward to playing the game again, although I likely will to finish it at some time.There is much good in the game, but given how frustrating it is to me, I cannot recommend it.			"

												Being a huge fan of Conan stories, ""Tiny Barbarian"" is a game I really wanted to like.What immediately captured me was the art style, the soundtrack and the varied level design. And then it all fell apart...As soon as the first enemies came, I slowly but surely came to detest the game. The combat mechanics always felt somewhat off, like I was never in total control. I would jump over that thrown spear and slash that guard, but then the next time I'd get hit, and I wouldn't know exactly why. Often times I felt the hitboxes were unfair. The bit that did it for me were the infinitely spawning enemies. Where the already extremely dissatisfying combat became even more so, and I gave up.I really like the theme, so maybe I'll give a go sometime in the future, but for now I'll stay away from it.			"

												Tiny Barbarian DX is a platformer with retro everything: graphics are like from NES era and the gameplay is tight and doesn't involve too many buttons but rather precise hitting, jumping and avoiding enemy projectiles. There are also boss battles typical to the genre and hidden gems to pick up for the Steam achievement. Tiny Barbarian isn't hardcore platformer in a meatboy or Spelunky kind of way and requires only little practising being a nice title for casual gamers too! It only takes about an hour to beat the first episode (if you're familiar with older platformers and their quirks) but you will receive the rest of the upcoming episodes for the same price. It's quite a short ride but you might want to enjoy it twice at least.			"

												Great pixelart and catchy soundtrack. Feels like Conan the barbarian was teleported into the NES area.Reminds me of the old castlevania titles before they went ""metroidvania"" ;-)Not as unforgiving as Super Meat Boy, AVGN Adventures or similiar plattforming games but still demanding on the skills.At this time only the first episode is playable. But with the game being available at Desura for quite some time now,I believe more chapters are just around the corner.			"

												Tiny Barbarian DX is an unabashed 80s nostalgia game, but it does it well. Good-looking pixel art and catchy chiptunes create a tone of fun sword-and-sorcery adventure. It plays a bit like Ninja Gaiden and borrows that thock-thock-THWACK combo from Battletoads. Boss encounters are varied and well-crafted, with an encounter with the Serpent Lord in a room full of moving platforms being the high point of the game so far.Only one out of four episodes has been released so far, and it took me about an hour to beat the first time. Looking forward to playing the rest!			"

												I wanted to like this game, but my experince with it has been a frustrating one, and not the kind of frustrating that makes your success that much sweeter when you finally beat the level.I should mention that for the most part I was playing with a controller, because I usually play action games with a controller if it's an option, and that make the experience a thousand times worse. I don't think I've ever played a game with worse optimized gamepad controls, if you do decide to play do yourself a favor and stick to the keyboard. I did eventually switch to keyboard and I was immediately happier.Pretty much the only thing about Tiny Barbarian that impressed me was the variety in the level design. Many of the sections feel very different from the rest.			"

Gameplay is fun, and smooth. with simple controls that work.the game itself seems to be a mix of old platformer games such as goleden axe, rygar, and many others, the graphics might be simple, but the game is well constructed, with challenging levels.Cons:Boss battles, while great, are way too easy to figure out.The game itself is too short, if it was even twice as long, this wouldn't be an issue for the price, I beat the game in about 90 minutes.  Probably won't buy additional chapters if they carry the same price tag and amount of gameplay.Grabbing ledges sometimes can be frustrating.			"

												This game is old school but is not too difficult.  I bought it once for myself and then again for my brother who shared the same love of snes and nes games.  It fits right into that kind of collection.  It's difficult and forgiving at the same time.  If you die you can start back at the intro to the screen you are in but the work to get through the screen may hold you up and if you want to not die at all then you will have to bring your A game.  There is a good variety of enemies, mechanics and methods to take them down.  I absolutely loved this game and think more developers should try and hone their games to the level this one was.   Oh one last thing, this game doesn't have a tutorial but it teaches through example.  To cite one example, there is a platform with a guy on it below you.  You jump and elbow drop the guy to kill him and break the block under him, discovering that blocks can be broken.  This kind of learning is missing from many games these days and replaced with tutorials.  I was very impressed with how natural it all felt and the level of exemplary game design.			"

												Tiny Barbarian is a game that some might rail against for being short, but for me, it's the whole package.  The music is glorious, the gameplay simple and addictive, and the pixel art graphics are very fun and surprisingly expressive, much like an early 80s arcade or NES game.  I backed this on kickstarter because I liked the original Tiny Barbarian and this game made me smile.  It's long enough to give you what you want, each episode being about an hour to an hour and a half, but not so long it over stays its welcome.  And I love the Conan the Barbarian parody going on here, which is very much underused in modern gaming.  I absolutely adore Tiny Barbarian and the creator is promising four episodes, none of which will cost after the initial purchase.  Two are out right now and they are a blast to play through.  I heartily recommend this game.			"

												It's a real shame that I have to not recommend this considering that it's got a great first episode and has solid game play, good music and graphics. At the time of writting this, there are only 2 episodes out and because of how different they are from each other, I will review them separately. Episode 1:The game begins with a very familiar and simple play style, small weak enemies come in low numbers and attempt to hit you. You can make quick work of them though. As you progress through the level, more difficult enemies are added and more challenging environments are present. There is even a few areas where you get to ride a beast like thing, it's pretty fun. Numerous well designed boss fights are included. Although it really starts to ramp up the difficulty at the later areas of the level, the game never feels unfair and with frequent checkpoints and 6 hits for a life bar, the difficulty is just right. More of this would be excellent. The final boss in this episode is pretty tough but reasonable enough. Although this episode is short, it's great and it got me really excited for more episodes. It really did impress me. If I had to give it a score, I'd give it a 9/10Episode 2:And than suddenly the game does a complete 180, changing everything about the design that made the first episode so good. At first, it's a slow paced platformer with very few enemies. In fact there aren't many enemies at all in this episode, at least ones that give points and are stationed through the level. As you progress through this level, you will face more difficult platforming sections, most of which will either send you to the beginning via vertical drops or instantly kill you through large areas of pitfalls. This episode also features riding an animal, this time it's a bee. This creature does not like to cooperate though. If you fall off, it will fly around you avoiding you as much as possible, though it stays roughly in the same area that you lost it. This can make it a huge pain just trying to progress through those areas as one hit will send you flying off the bee. Later on you have to use the bee in automatic screen scrolling sections where flight is mandatory. It's a mini bullet hell out of no where and the short range attack and instant kill from falling off the edge of the scrolling screen makes it infuriating. Oh and I forgot to mention that despite some bees being somewhat friendly, all the others will try to kill you and they spawn infinitely at the sides of the screen while you try to fly tightly crowded areas of spikes. The only other main enemy in this level are apes, these guys are very annoying. When in high numbers, these pests can cause a lot of trouble. They jump around the room and throw what I hope to be rocks at you. These rocks are high speed and perfectly accurate, if thrown while you are in mid-air, they are almost guarenteed to hit. There is also a giant ape boss, which is very difficult. Ironically enough, it captures a blonde and throws barrels at you. Sound familiar? It should. A reference to one of the most iconic and classic games of all time, Donkey Kong. Only this is no easy breeze jumping over simple barrel trajectories. These barrels bounce all over the place with high speed and they're the same size as the player. Incredibly challenging and will take you many tries to overcome, if you have the patience. After all that the level is still not complete, well over an hour now and you still have to keep going. The last sections I played were consistently frustrating. The auto scrolling of the screen which moved way too fast for me to keep up, killed me mercilessly. Not to mention the huge number of projectiles that fly at you. There is a lot of grabbing vines and ceilings reminiscent of some Shinobi levels, only the grabbing controls don't work all that well here. I died at least 30% of the time from the character refusing to grab a ledge or vine only to fall to my death. All of this combined created an experience that was punishing and sadistic. I'd have to enjoy the pain to finish this level. I did not.Conclusion:So to conclude these reviews, I'd say that the game has great potential. The first episode being a shining example of great game design, while the second episode takes all the worse elements of older platformers and throws them all at you at the same time. This leaves me very conflicted as to what I should rate the game as a whole. I also cannot understand the massive shift in design here. The first episode featured almost no instant death or pitfalls, while the second episode is full of it. The game goes from fun and fair to brutal and painful in a flash. It's a true shame to see yet another retro throw-back desperate to relive the ""glory"" days of punishing quarter-devouring arcade games instead of improving on any of it. In the end I do not recommend this game as I can't see the next episodes going in a better direction. Odds are they'll continue trying to make it harder and more brutal as they release the other episodes. It's not really worth the time and frustration for the average gamer. This is only for true hardcore platformer fans.			"

												originally posted on thatruled.com:Tiny Barbarian DX is a 2D action-platformer that was recently greenlit on Steam. You control the Conan-esque main character in his quest to…save a princess, I think? Hang on and let me back things up for a minute, this game just finished kicking my♥♥♥♥♥and I need a minute to regroup my thoughts.Tiny Barbarian DX doesn’t mess around. This is a retro style game, and it’s “NES hard”. Many games currently give you a “death count” while playing or upon completion (Angry Vdeo Game Nerd Adventures, Rogue Legacy, and Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe are three fine examples), and I died 35 times in the hour and 15 minutes it took me to get through the first chapter. Some of these deaths can be really frustrating and unfair, but luckily the game has auto-checkpoints every few screens. This isn’t “I Wanna Be the Guy”-tough, but it’s still pretty difficult.When you begin the game, there are no tutorials whatsoever. Unlike a game like “They Bleed Pixels” which has a fairly robust tutorial system, Tiny Barbarian DX throws you to the wolves. You know you can attack and jump, and pressing them in combinations with each other and with the D-pad does stuff, but…I still can’t figure out how I did a jumping spin attack. To be honest, the first time I started playing, I didn’t even know the game had started yet. Before you even get a title screen, you’re thrust into the action. A group of baddies are climbing up a mountain, all the while the camera is scrolling up to show you standing at its peak.PROTIP: This is where you start taking control.You’re now in a king of the hill type showdown, facing off against a never-ending horde of increasingly difficult opponents. After you’re eventually defeated (or if you just jump off the mountain), the game will begin proper. You have a choice between “Adventure Mode” (the main game), or “vs. the Horde” (essentially the same as the intro). Going into Adventure Mode you’ll notice that there are 4 chapters, although only the first one, “The Serpent Lord”, is available to play. The other three are not attained by unlocking them. They are still currently being worked on, and will be free upon completion for anyone who already bought the game.The music is chiptune-tastic. When you get frustrated by all the constant death, the music is there to keep you pumped and ready for action. A good example of this is my favorite track, “Rebirth”, which plays while you’re ascending a tower in a rudimentary elevator. I probably died in this section more than any other (the Serpent Lord battle being a close second), and it wasn’t so I could keep listening to the music. The soundtrack is available on Bandcamp, and is definitely worth a listen.If you want a fun, challenging game that’s low on story to the point of forgettable, high on action, and makes you feel like a badass for being able to get through it, check out Tiny Barbarian DX. And when you have gotten through it, just know that there are 3 more chapters to challenge you at some point in the future.			"

												Man I dig this little game for all its simplicities and charm. And ill be damned if I don't get that acheivement as the game starts. I've always loved my 2D side-scrolling platformers and this belongs right along with them. If you like this check out Vagante, which is another i find myself coming back to. I just wish this game was updated more often is truly my only complaint.			"

Pros:Fantasy-homage easter eggsSolid attack combo systemDifficulty is more often than not a result of good designVaried enemiesLast boss of the first campaign is Thulsa-DoomThulsa-Doom shoots snake arrows from a magic bowCons:Very poor mount controls. Though mount sections are few, the controls are frustratingly bad and deaths become cheapLazy/generic tone shift in the second campaign. Colorful snake temples are put aside for caverns and ruinsIffy camera can ruin many of the more difficult platforming sequences.Definitely one of the best platformers I've ever played. Issues are far outweighed by solid gameplay and Conan references. "

												Alright then...Right off the bat, you may believe that this game is just another pixel art indie game with no sense of style or substance. Well unfortunately, after spending about 2 hours playing this game, I can safely say that this game is 100% accurate to the barbarian lifestyle and a DAMN fine Run-And-Slash platformer. The overall presentation is immediately charming, with the first chapter starting off with a well implemented homage to Conan. From there, the game plays like a combination of golden axe and a low-fi rayman origins. You run, jump, attack, climb ledges (by the way, go into options, into config, turn on ""AUTO GRAB"" and thank me later), ride huge cats, get killed by rolling snakes. Y'know, the basics of any barbarian lifestyle.The game itself can be described as taking inspiration from classic arcade games like the aformentioned golden axe whilst implementing its own unique style to make it interesting. However, this game can be rather unwieldly at times, with one poor jump sending into instant death (VERY common in chapter 2), or setting you so far back in progression that you'd might as well kill yourself to start the screen again.The main aspects of this game that hooked me were the cute graphics, superb music and the simplicity of the controls when they weren't freaking out and getting me killed by gorillas and snake wizards.If I were forced to grade this game, I'd give it a 6.5/10. Nothing groundbreaking and the controls freak a little occasionally, but it succeeds in producing a satisfying experience with charming visuals and decent challenge that won't deter Noobs and Vets alike.P.S. The Manual (Check the library page) comes with a comic and an enemy and control breakdown. Nostalgia achieved.			"

												Tiny Barbarian DX is a very good game, but not quite a great one. Admittedly, only two episodes have been made available at the time of writing, but having played them to near completion I think I have a pretty good feel for how the rest of it is going to go as well.As a gaming experience, Tiny Barbarian doesn't put a foot wrong. The controls are simple to learn, a combo move keeps things interesting, and if you really want to you can flex your muscles in the middle of a life-or-death fight. The monsters are distinctive and challenging. The graphics and music design are pure retro 8-bit goodness (barring a couple of small anachronisms, like the floating Z's of the sleeping Barbarian). The checkpoints provide a way around the outdated lives system without taking away the sense of challenge or urgency, at least if you're aiming for a fast run or a no-death run.The thing is, there's a difference between a great game and a game that doesn't make any mistakes. For all the skill and care that went into the game and its presentation, the whole experience still feels inescapably...familiar. You aren't really going to see anything here that you wouldn't have in some other 8-bit platformer, or platformer in general. There's no real experimentation, no high concept, nothing more than a token attempt at narrative, and the Conan-inspired aesthetic is there as window dressing rather than as a means of informing gameplay. These things may change with subsequent episodes, but personally I don't really see the developer deviating from a structure which has served the project well so far.None of this is to say that Tiny Barbarian is a bad game - and I do recommend this game, because as an exercise in legitimate challenge it really is worth your time. It just feels light, even unnecessary - a throwback in an era which has already moved on. Braid has more interesting gameplay; Redder has more atmosphere; Fez looks better; Super Meat Boy is more exciting. This wouldn't be a fair comparison if Tiny Barbarian really were a retro game, but it isn't - it's an imitation of retro games, and ultimately it doesn't feel like anything more than an imitation.

												For some reason I waited quite a while before I bought this game. I don't actually know why. I'd read great things about it and so on. Well, then I decided to buy it and man how I love it!Like many good platformers, it's all about a great level design and controls and Tiny Barbarian DX won't disappoint you on that front. It's tough, but fair. Challenging, but never in a way, that you can't figure it out and execute your tactics perfectly. The levels have variety AND it has great boss battles also.The graphics and soundtrack are also top notch, some tracks being so good I noticed my feet tapping against the floor. :)If there's some critique, it would be the grabbing system, BUT fortunately you can put it to automatic via options. And I really recommend it. Don't worry: It won't make the game easy, it just corrects one thing, that's a flaw in this game (IMO).Some people are criticizing about the lenght of the game, which I kind of understand, IF you jumped on the wagon, when there was only the 1st episode out (now there are two already), as it is the easier of the 2 episodes out so far (but don't be fooled, it's not _easy_ ). Is it worth the money then? ABSOLUTELY. The two episodes already have a hefty amount of playtime (4-5h) and there are still two episodes to be released, which probably raise the playtime to roughly 10 hours. And like I always say: quality over quantity, and in this case it really once again is true.Oh, and I really recommend gamepad or arcade stick for this one.			"

												""Tiny Barbarian DX"" is just a good old-fashioned platform jumping beat-em-up, extremely (and deliberately) reminiscent of old classics of the genre like Castlevania or the original Prince of Persia, with deceptively simple but painstakingly polished gameplay and presentation. The controls consist of four directions, jump and attack; the only power-up is health. The graphics are pixelated, the sound effects minimal and the music pure chiptunes. The difficulty is unforgiving.AND THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.(Fair warning, there are also Goshdarn Bats. Endless streams of them, flying on those predictable yet somehow UTTERLY DECEPTIVE sine curve paths any old school gamer knows and HATES HATES HATES WE HATE THEM KILL THEM AAAAAAAALLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!! Ahem.)It does get frustratingly hard at points - the bats, OMG THE BATS!!! - but the challenge is always a genuine matter of skill rather than the game just being a jerk, always beatable with a little more practice and becoming just a little more badass than before. Personally, I find myself getting stuck quite regularly but every time I take a break and come back I seem to get another checkpoint further. That's real old school game design, right there. It builds character!Thank Crom for unlimited continues.Now, it may be that you don't care for old fashioned platforming goodness. In which case screw you, I just elbow dropped an eagle!			"

												It’s been a pretty solid year for side scrollers on the PC front this year so far; we’ve seen Dust, Ducktales HD, D&D Chronicles, Volgarr… it’s just been a good year!  And yet in comes Tiny Barbarian DX like it ain’t no thing.  While I can’t promise you will like Tiny Barbarian DX more than the other games that’ve come out this year, I can tell you I had a blast, and continue to have a blast.  This is the good news.The bad news is it’s not finished.  Not yet.  You can buy this on Steam for ten dollars, but a lot of people will get miffed when they “finish” the game in a bit over an hour for their first run-through and say “That’s it?” because at current count, the game is missing three more chapters.  If you want the rest of the game, you have to wait.  It’s being released on a “when it’s done” basis.  Updates will be pushed out through Steam when available (and the main man has already published a patch that fixed an issue with leader boards), but until then, you’re stuck with what you’ve got, which includes an hour-ish long Episode 1 and an Endless Horde minigame.With that out of the way, let’s take a look at the game itself.  The graphics are simplistic and stylized; too many colors to be a Nintendo game, but it’s definitely got a retro feel to it.  It runs at about sixty frames per second, and animation is fluid. The textures used for bricks tend to get old pretty fast (whereas, for instance, I didn’t really get that feeling when I was playing Fez), but enemy and character presentation is definitely solid.  Background details range from okay to “Oh, there were background details?”  You’ll find often you’re too busy focusing on the action to pay attention to the little stuff.Which is pretty telling about the game.  The controls are a snap, and responsive.  I was able to play with both keyboard and 360 Wireless game pad flawlessly.  One button jumps, the other attacks.  Holding up near a ledge will boost you up.  You stop pressing a direction, he stops moving.  Once you learn how your attack combos manipulate your movement speed when jumping, you’ll know when to stop and when to go… when to press an attack and when to hang back a second and wait for another time frame.  That’s good, because this game can get somewhat demanding as far as game mechanic mastery is concerned.  Timing on spell returns is fairly precise, and progressing through waves of enemies means you need to be paying attention with both hands on the controller unless you want to faceplant into the spikes below.  Luckily, even this isn’t an instant death.  The game is very forgiving, and has many checkpoints in each stage, and dying resets your health to full.  There are no lives; you play until you win, or quit.  I’ve done both.You play as the titular Tiny Barbarian, and you progress through five stages, defeating enemies and boss encounters in order to beat up a mage, save a girl and escape her prison.  No writing awards here; just tried-and-tired damsel-in-distress male power fantasy sexist piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥patch job.  As this game borrows heavily from themes presented by the likes of Conan the Barbarian and Korgoth, I wouldn’t have it any other way.  It’s supposed to be a romp through better times where you didn’t need a “why”, you just needed a direction (right) and a weapon to kill things with.  It works just fine.  Sometimes I did find combos not executing as planned (two short swings followed by a short swing instead of the three-hit combo) but I just chalked that up to personal fail.  It didn’t happen often enough to care.The music, as I have masturbated over in the past frequently, is fantastic.  I think I like it better out of context, but there are a few spots in the game where it matches up very well with the action.  Jeff Ball did very good work here.  Can’t wait to hear what the next chapters sound like, assuming he stays on board for them.  My ONLY complaint with the soundtrack is a half-compliment; this game has a theme which can be heard in several tracks.  It adds a continuity rarely ever heard in games these days, but at the same time it can become grating during your eighteenth death in the same stage.  The songs that depart from the thematic progression tend to stand out more impressively in the end.So I guess whether you buy this game is a matter of taste.  Clocking in at about an hour, this game can be speed-run at under thirty minutes.  That would take several playthroughs, but it’s possible.  Most of the play time in this game comes from the achievements, and leader board progression, which if you’re playing this game offline won’t matter very much at all.  Is an hour something you would pay ten dollars for?When I compare it to my Turtles in Time purchase back in the day ($60 for 25 minutes), it doesn’t seem bad at all.  The achievements are compelling, the game is challenging and was clearly designed with multiple playthroughs in mind, as there are plenty of hidden items and stashes you won’t find all of even on your third run-through.  At the end of the game, you are scored based on completion time, deaths and hidden gems found, so for once the scores in a game *aren’t* completely arbitrary if you enjoy seeing your name up on the leader board.It’s an hour game, with at least three chapters being worked on in the future.  And it’s fun.  And the music is great.  I have no problems recommending this to someone who still enjoys some Nintendo time and doesn’t mind a challenge.  Tiny Barbarian DX is worthy, and it’s incomplete.This is very good, when you think about it.			"

												originally posted on thatruled.com:Tiny Barbarian DX is a 2D action-platformer that was recently greenlit on Steam. You control the Conan-esque main character in his quest to…save a princess, I think? Hang on and let me back things up for a minute, this game just finished kicking my♥♥♥♥♥and I need a minute to regroup my thoughts.Tiny Barbarian DX doesn’t mess around. This is a retro style game, and it’s “NES hard”. Many games currently give you a “death count” while playing or upon completion (Angry Vdeo Game Nerd Adventures, Rogue Legacy, and Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe are three fine examples), and I died 35 times in the hour and 15 minutes it took me to get through the first chapter. Some of these deaths can be really frustrating and unfair, but luckily the game has auto-checkpoints every few screens. This isn’t “I Wanna Be the Guy”-tough, but it’s still pretty difficult.When you begin the game, there are no tutorials whatsoever. Unlike a game like “They Bleed Pixels” which has a fairly robust tutorial system, Tiny Barbarian DX throws you to the wolves. You know you can attack and jump, and pressing them in combinations with each other and with the D-pad does stuff, but…I still can’t figure out how I did a jumping spin attack. To be honest, the first time I started playing, I didn’t even know the game had started yet. Before you even get a title screen, you’re thrust into the action. A group of baddies are climbing up a mountain, all the while the camera is scrolling up to show you standing at its peak.PROTIP: This is where you start taking control.You’re now in a king of the hill type showdown, facing off against a never-ending horde of increasingly difficult opponents. After you’re eventually defeated (or if you just jump off the mountain), the game will begin proper. You have a choice between “Adventure Mode” (the main game), or “vs. the Horde” (essentially the same as the intro). Going into Adventure Mode you’ll notice that there are 4 chapters, although only the first one, “The Serpent Lord”, is available to play. The other three are not attained by unlocking them. They are still currently being worked on, and will be free upon completion for anyone who already bought the game.The music is chiptune-tastic. When you get frustrated by all the constant death, the music is there to keep you pumped and ready for action. A good example of this is my favorite track, “Rebirth”, which plays while you’re ascending a tower in a rudimentary elevator. I probably died in this section more than any other (the Serpent Lord battle being a close second), and it wasn’t so I could keep listening to the music. The soundtrack is available on Bandcamp, and is definitely worth a listen.If you want a fun, challenging game that’s low on story to the point of forgettable, high on action, and makes you feel like a badass for being able to get through it, check out Tiny Barbarian DX. And when you have gotten through it, just know that there are 3 more chapters to challenge you at some point in the future.			"

												A simple but very fun mix of sidescrolling bet 'em up with 2d platforming. Mechanically the game is straightforward and uncomplicated but still providing a challenge. What really elevates it however is the style. The game's art, from the gorgeous backdrops to the character design,  is heavily inspired by classic pulp fantasy that wouldn't look out of place on the cover of a Conan novel. Perfectly complimenting the art is the high energy chiptune soundtrack which made me feel like a montage was about to break out at any moment.It's simple, stylish, fun.			"

But you are not a young elf. Kromm laughs at the young elf! Our hero, the Tiny Barbarian, sword chops, elbow drops, and belly flops into waves of enemies and platforming gold.

The musical talent in this game is top-notch, and the sheer professionalism and quality of it pleases Kromm.Reader, I have never written a review before. I have no tongue for it. No one, not even you, will remember if it was good or bad. Why I wrote or why you read. No, ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT YOU STOOD AGAINST MANY. THAT'S WHAT IMPORTANT. BATTLE PLEASES KROMM.

												Let me just say that the rage that I felt while playing this game was much greater than when I played Volgarr. Especially because, of the eagles dear god the eagles. They come and then they hit you with their tricky talons and you would think with the amount you have killed they should be extinct but alas they are not.			"

												So a few years back I came along a demo of this very game, which I absolutly loved. I spent an hour to finish that and then went through it again with my much younger brother. So to then find over a year later that there was going to be a much larger game got me very excited. Well that was when the game came out and I can't lie, I haven't really played it since then. You see, back then when I baught this game I also started working full time and so the alure of AAA games at the time seemed better than a little indie game. But, I missed games with good pixel art, and saw this in my library, so here I am!  I've gone ahead and finsihed the first episode, which is great btw. It had me frustrated many times, mostly due to some of the hitboxs and timing of hits being a bit off. For example hitting a projectile had me attacking a bit in advanced rather than when is was at me, the former also resulting in a loss of health :(  Due to this and other annoying factors the last boss fight was a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Seriously though, I don't want to spoil it for you guys, but the game is hard enough as it is with out bad boss design. Okay, okay, not bad, but it could be better. However when you do beat that boss as well as the other hurdels the game throws at you, you get a certain level of accomplishment that more than makes up for the bad.Its always so easy to mention the bad though, so I'd like to touch on the good too. Music, the chip tune music is great, catchy and changes when it starts to get repetitive. Pixel art, supurb! I'm actually a pixel artist myself so I can really appreciate how long it must takes to make something like this, spicifically with all the limitations this guys put on himself. And overall gameplay is also good, even the mount felt good to use, even though I found the sliding a tad annoying, I know why its there, but still annoyying.Overall a good game, I look forward to episode 2! Which I'll get to once I recover from the last episode.			"

												Love it.  It's like making my own Conan comic story by playing a game... and talking to myself? Or whoever; I can talk for those in-game characters.You slash, you collect, you jump, you climb, you eat, you body slam, you find a hottie. It's a $10 classic. Plays like an NES game.			"

												This game has a smart old school nostalgic design that manages to revive the golden axe genre in an awesome way. The fighting part of it is pure fun and glory, while the platforming sections  are  pixel perfect sort of challenges. There are very little save points so be ready to get at it for a good session of 30 min at least if you want you checkpoint to be saved on next boot. Variety, cute design and smart level design makes this game a must try in a period where those kind of homages are very numerous and not always up to quality.			"

												Gameplay is addictive and pleasing. Content is changing right when you master something and always adding little more difficulty. Backgrounds are nice, monsters always new. Treasures are really hidden and you just don't know about them. It's a great game :)If you like Volgarr The Viking. You will also like this. But this is easier. That means difficulty here is normal, not nightmarish. :D You have more chances to fail and shorter periods between saves.Hint: In manual you can find guide to all moves (Manual is here on Steam on right side of Store page) .

												This is really cool attempt to recreate 16 bit games from late 80s. The game is challenging, sometimes really hard, that is good thing. We have been treated as casual players for a bit too long and this game reminds how it was to focus and play with your both hands. Satisfaction from finishing each level is enormous. You can come back to this game and have the challenge again. Music is great, graphics are brilliant, game play is fun, story is interesting. Really recommended!			"
