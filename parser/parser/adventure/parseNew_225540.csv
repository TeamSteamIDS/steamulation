												This game has a LOT of issues. Seeing as it's in the sale and there will be a lot of people considering buying it, I feel like I should outline the issues. TL;DR and specs at the bottom.- Performance, it varies from person to person but personally I have a medium/high-end gaming rig and still get stuttering and frame drops. I get smoother framerates on games with more graphic fedelity. On consoles it's the same story, constant frame rate drops.- There's a memory leak issue that is yet to be fixed. Instead of fixing the issue, the devs just raised the minimum RAM requirement from 8GB to 16GB and added a message for every time you boot up the game telling you that you have insufficient memory. Apparently getting more RAM actually fixes a lot of performance issues with the game, go figure.- The car handling in this game is so, so, bad. People says that Just Cause 2's handling was bad, but that game is a shining light of glory compared to JC3's habdling. And then just wait until you try a motorbike. The turning is horrid, it feels like you have no control sometimes. You hold down the button or move the stick to turn and there's a delay of about 1 second until your bike actually starts turning.  It's so easy to make them spin out and / or flip. Again, when the devs were questioned about this, they literally said ""We think it's fine!"" (can't find the link to the tweet but I'm sure it's out there).- There's no native way to change the FOV. There's mods that let you do so but then when you do change it a whole bunch of glitches appear, like terrain not rendering, animations ending, etc. I usually wouldn't mind, but the default FOV is so low to begin with, try driving a car, it's right up in your face and you can barely see past it. - Missions are creative until you realise that a lot of them are the same being repeated multiple times. Story is boring, I ended up ignoring it and just ♥♥♥♥ing around. Plus, at least for me, destroying bases got boring after a while because there's so god damn many. Just Cause 2 did the whole ""Chaos"" thing better. When you destroyed military vehicles, killed personnel, destroyed bases, etc. you would gain Chaos and once you reached a certain point you would unlock new items and missions. This worked great because you would end up unlocking things just by ♥♥♥♥ing around. Just Cause 3 however makes you liberate towns and bases, which are mostly just the same thing over and over again. Destroy these buildings, shut down this surveillance system, open this door, free these prisoners, kill there people. Over and over. It's very repetitive. As for Chaos? It's just a meanless stat. - The rebel drop system is stupid. In JC2  you earned money from missions and then used it to buy things from the black market, and you could also be picked up and quick-travelled to another province. In JC3 you have to collect flares from rebel bases, and then use those to call in a rebel drop. You have limited flares, but that's ok because you can just get whatever you want for free whenever you want. Right? Wrong, because there's ♥♥♥♥ing WAIT TIMERS. You sometimes have to wait up to 20 minutes before you can drop in a plane again. It's one of the most anti-fun things a developer can do and is often paired with micro transactions that let you reduce the wait, but JC3 doesn't even HAVE microtransactions so the decision makes no sense.Those are my main issues, but while I'm at it:- There's no minimap. Why is there no minimap. You can pause the game and look at the map from there to find things buy that's no reason not to have a mini map.- There's no sprint button. It makes Rico feel really slow in combat because you can't make him run any faster. The devs said that they want you to ""use Rico's other movement skills"" or whatever but JC2's sprint button was super useful.- Devs said they wanted to support modders but every patch completely broke most mod. I think there's still some mods that haven't been updated to the latest versions of the game.- Speaking of patches, there hasn't been one in months. You know what the latest patch was? DLC release. No big fixes. These devs charged us heaps of money for lackluster DLC and the worst part is I was idiotic enough to buy the first one. I'll give them the fact that have a booster on my wingsuit is cool but maybe they could use the extra time spent on DLC fixing the huge bugs in the game? Wait, that doesn't earn them money. Whoops, lol- WHY DID THEY RE-INVENT THE WHEEL AND BIND LEFT CTRL TO BACK. WHY NOT JUST USE ESC. YOU KNOW, LIKE EVERY OTHER PROGRAM AND GAME EVER PROGRAMMED LIKE EVER. WHY. TL;DR: Is this game fun? Hell yeah, I have like 70 hours on it. Is it worth full price? ♥♥♥♥ no. Buy Just Cause 2 in the next sale for like $3 and then play it for three years until Just Cause 3 is a similar price. Just Cause 3 could have been great given another year of development. But it's just gonna forever be that game that could have been ♥♥♥♥ing awesome but instead blowed and probably killed the entire franchise. Good job, Avalanche. Next time give the game to a competent development team.Rant over. Can you tell I'm still salty about a nearly 1 year old release?SPECS:i5-4460, 3.2 GHzGTX 970, 3.5GB VRAM (heh)8GB RAMaka way above recommended requirementsEDIT 25 NOV:This review got way more popular than I expected, so I thought I would fix a couple of things I said:1. The developers didn't actually bump the minimum amount of ram to 16GB. I thought they did, but I guess I remembered wrong. However, if you don't have at least 16GB of RAM, you still get a pop-up when you start the game telling you that your RAM is insufficient.2. I guess I was wrong to call my rig high-end, I've changed that to medium/high-end. While it's true that my i5 processor and 8GB RAM (the RAM particularly leading to the memory leak issue) aren't as good as an i7 or 16GB RAM, my gpu, a GTX 970, was one of the best cards you could get when this game released. Additionally, unlike what it seems like some people argue, i7's don't really make as much difference in games as they might think.I've noticed that the recommended CPU is actually an i7, but I feel like this further shows the performance issues with the game as you shouldn't need an i7 to run a game like this. Take, for example, GTA; a game that is arguably nicer looking and the recommended processor is an i5.EDIT 15 DEC:Looks like the game is on sale again, so a lot more people are reading the reviews. Try to be nice in the comments, it's christmas yo.			"

												3/18/2016 *SKY FORTRESS BELOW*My rating 7/10Pros:-Explosions-Removed a lot of pointless mechanics from JC2, namely pressing number sequences every time you wanted to hijack an enemy vehicle, or hack a terminal. Also like a 10 second cutscene everytime you wanted to fast travel or get a weapons drop-Heavy weapons that explode things in different ways-graphics are pretty-lots of collectables, one of them being audio tapes that give some backstory to the main antagonist's rise to power-The trains are awesome and I spent a lot of time causing crashes and derails. (WHY IS THERE ONLY ONE TRAIN MISSION? SO MUCH POTENTIAL THERE)-Rebel vs Army battles (only 3 in the game sadly) Fighting 10 enemy tanks in your own tank is pretty funThe leaderboards and challegenes are pretty controversial, mainly for being psudo multiplayer. (The JC2 multiplayer mod was seen as welcome addition and left people wondering why it wasn't included in the game.)It seems the devs just got bored and said ""players like multiplayer so lets give them arbitrary leaderboards""Cons-Liberating settlements is cookie cutter as ♥♥♥♥. For towns theres almost always a police station to liberate and a handfull of propaganda structures to destroy just like every other city in the game.-Enemy AI could use some work. For example if you hover in a helicopter near a cliff the AI will just drive off the cliff to their deaths trying to get to you.-Cutscenes, why not let me crash the evil missile instead of watching Rico do it in a cutscene?-Story missions are bland and really easy.-No cool landmarks like the night club balloon, the highrise cities, and the highrise towers in JC2. No diversity in what the towns and cities look like.-Only a handful of sports cars that go over 160 km/h-SAM trailers and bridges regenerate if you leave the area (more specifically when you leave rendering distance in a helicopter or jet, fly up too high and the bridge comes back)-Cool gameplay features like battles and the train mission are few and limited. -No tanks with tracks they all have wheels. :)TL/DR if you enjoyed JC2, you will feel right at home with this game. If you want a sandbox to blow everything up wait for the game to go on sale (and more DLC).*SKYFORTRESS DEE ELL CEE*3/10+Powered Jetpack/wingsuit is cool+???-A paltry 3 missions-Last mission is super easy with nuke launcher, like 3 shots and gg dlc over. Why even let me stand there and shoot the things if you want me to fly like Buzz Lightyear to shoot it instead?-3 drone types-4 challenges 3 wingsuit 1 drone killing-Entire DLC would take 1-2 hours to complete-new pew pew laser gun is super innacurate. spray is all over the placeTL:DRFor 12 dollars you get-jetpack-a crap gun-4 challenges			"

												Okay, so, I know I'm going to get a lot of dislikes for this review from people who disagree, but I want to help others decide on buying this game and I honestly don't want a rage review here. These are my personal experiences and opinions. If you so choose to get the game, either invest in the console variant, hearing it is more stable, or if this is not your thing, buy the game but use the Steam refund policy to test out how the game runs for you.Let's talk pros and cons, this is my first review here so I hope this will do.*pros* Amazing wingsuit. It's a great addition and I find myself missing it when going into Just Cause 2 now. (also: First DLC (Air DLC) Brings it to live even further) You're basically an Spiderman Ironman mixture. Awesome  The grappling hook got a massive update, plays differently, but it's just overall much fun and easy to learn. Massive improvements to the game world, it feels less empty. The scenery is awesome, and has a lot of variation.  The story, while everyone thinks it's bad, is actually good. It's an improvement, I'm stating this as a pro. Liberating is fun, but let's face it, we're all here for the bases. (At least, I am) I love the SciFi approach in this. While not everyone agrees and I'm likely one of the few, that like SciFi. And, it doesn't feel cluttered here to a point it becomes only SciFi.  The weapons, while some of them are overpowered, are fairly well balanced. But some should actually be buffed.  The graphics looked fairly great on my end, I could play the game at HIGH or sometimes ultra (given the game allowed me and the patch doesn't ruin it) at ultra 58 fps. (More on this in the cons and further down) There is a massive amount of eastern eggs, great! Explosions. EVERYWHERE. The user interface is great, very great even. I still miss my minimap at times, but I can get used to it.  Basic things like controls, achievements are great! Well done! The AI is.. silly. It's actually fun.Okay so, after reading this you probably ask yourself: But hey, then the game is fun, and good, why don't you recommend it?Well, here is where the cons come in.*cons* Performance  I know I said I said the gamed looked nice on my end, but this was in the past. Updates have serverely broken the game down on my end. The performance got worse over time. Just like my Samsung phone with touchwizz, but that's for another time. What. The. ****. You let me pre order, a YEAR before hand, (This was my choice I'm aware, but I was really hyped, read further) then charge me 10% off with the garbage ""Weaponized Vehicle Pack"" Which, quite honestly I tried and it is really bad. Then, right after release, you give it out to buy, which is fair enough, but THEN, it goes on sale where the entire game with the dlc is actually cheaper than when I bought it. Now, normally I wouldn't really care too much, but when the rest of the cons are there as well, you star to question yourself what life is. The bugs.. THE BUGS...... The glitches.... I can't express how annoyed I am. But let's keep my frustration as much away as possible. The water dissapears often, completely, causing me to restart the game. There's MASSIVE memmory leaks, which were there before hand as well. You get under the map ever single time you try to mess with the trains (which are.. actually fairly entertaining, for a while) and the amounts of crashes is over the top.  The games forced online. wow, this isn't my first point here, because I liked it for a while. But, when I told the game to go to OFFLINE MODE. I clearly want it to be offline. Now, why the bloody shish does it then, right when I open the map, go online???. My internet connection is really good, but even then, you manage to need to reconnect every single time Iopen the rebel drop and map, or switch to the menu? Why? The DLC/season pass/all other stuff. Now, I'm not minding DLC too much, and given the past of this games developers with Just Cause 2, I had high hopes in it being great. And, I was right, the air DLC blew my mind. Then, they released the land DLC and I was.. less happy but it was still yay, and then there was the last DLC.. The sea dlc.. And I lost my entire happyness and gave up on this game. Now, the DLC itself isn't bad, but you've charged me 25 Euros for a 3 weapons, 2 vehicles (of which one is a boat and I dont see myself in a boat in this game, sorry) and 3 new places to visit of which 2 are fun and 1 (the oversized oil rig) is just ... why. Mod support. (Hey, Floofershy, why do you even dare to call that a bad thing?) Well, simply because.. there's none.Modding tools aren't needed to give mod support, don't worry about that, Homeworld Remastered was an example of that at the start. But I'll be goofed, you break your so called mod support with every single update, which progressively also broke my game. Aside fom that, your so called mod support has caused the modding community to actually die out. If modding this game is your thing, don't go buy this. Multiplayer. I'm not a multiplayer game player and I don't play it all to often, but, given the price tag (Which is actually now below what I payed for it, well done), you would expect at least multiplayer to give a turn into the game. Now, I don't say this for myself, I say this for the many many people around me. You guys rely on us, the community to bring it to your game in the form of a mod. But, instead of helping, you break the mod support in a way there is not only no progress, there's just no fun in waiting for it anymore. Repettive. The whole game feels this way, from the stories to the bases to .. everything. They did well giving another look to each base for sure but it does not feel as rewarding and fun as it was in Just Cause 2.  THE DEVS..... Telling me to fix the game by adding more ram, upgrading my PC/Laptop isn't a solution. I'm not the only one with these issues, as a DEV you should actually fix them and not let me pay more money to get this game working.Now, about the latest Sea DLC:-----start sea dlc-----I was ignoring all hate on the DLC I read prior to playing it but I have to confirm it's severely lacking.. This has to be one of the worst things I payed for in a long time, the game entirely. I'm a long time Just Cause fan, and bough just cause 2 here on steam to support the developers. And then, bought Just Cause 3 including the season pass, knowing it would be good, I even pre ordered the game a year before hand.. I .. honestly think this is the worst decision I've made. It's a fun game, dont' get me wrong, it's just not something I can play as long and as much as Just Cause 2. And the bugs are serverely game breaking to a degree of being unplayable. And instead of fixing them, they bring out DLCs that.. litterally lack anything I hoped to have from the game.-----end Sea DLC----- I think I explained everything in my cons and pros, as far as I find needed. The game is great, for a while. Then it gets boring..Decide for yourself if the pros outweigh the cons, but for me I've lost faith.Note, it seems that performance varies per platform. so console performance is from what I hear better than the performance I'm personally experiencing. Any of you can decide upon that, if you wish to pick this up asap, I would reccommend looking into the console version.Will I stop playing because of this? No, of course not. Likely I get bored and start playing again, hoping the game doesn't die on me or becomes unplayable. But in no way do I hate the game to a degree I despise it. That said, I do think the cons I stated are serverely big given this being a Triple A game.			"

												**WARNING** Do NOT buy unless you have a PC with a minimum of 16gb RAM. Even the developers advise you this in their official statement:- ''It has been confirmed that the biggest perpetrator for all of the issues people are experiencing in JC3 is due to its memory leaking. The best ""fix"" you can possibly make is to upgrade to 16GB or more of system RAM''. This means the listed minimum specs of 8gb are incorrect and the devs know it. Just Cause 3 suffers some of the worst memory leakage ever seen in a video game which cripples performance on rigs that comfortably surpass the basic minimum requirements. The optimisation is utterly abysmal and the developers seem more content on farming out DLC instead of fixing the catastrophic problems that make the game unplayable for many. This has been going on since launch in December 2015 and it is clear these problems will never be fixed. The devs simply cannot be bothered and as echoed in their statement; only an upgrade to 16gb RAM will suffice.  I'd go as far as to say this is a far worse situation than Batman: Arkham Knight and if this was a bigger brand; it would've received just as much ridicule. It doesn't matter if you have an i7 with a GTX 970+ and run the game on low - the memory leaks persist if you don't meet the increased RAM requirements and you will be lumbered with constant stuttering throughout. The fact the developers published a statement that contradicts the specs on the store page but then wont ammend them, just shows a despicable level of dishonesty and disregard towards oblivious prospective customers. They've risked their reputation, community fury, and a huge amount of potential refunds for the sake of selling a game advertised on specifications that don't work to any satisfactory standard for a significant amount of users. When a developer has to sacrifce their integrity to appease the publishers for the sake of grabbing cash by any means possible; it further dents the credibility of the already dwindling AAA market but this situation is on a level of disgust you'd rarely see even from the usual modern day culprits of this industry. Avoid at all costs unless you have 16gb of RAM and enjoy extremely mundane and repetitive gameplay. The developers couldn't give a toss about their game and nor should you.			"

Not as bad as you may expectSeems JC3 has received some pretty much hate since release.But I just lowered my expectations, and took a leap of faith.No regrets yet.It's the most silly, mindless, unrealistic ride of destryoing things since ""Red Faction: Guerilla"" (which tried to be serious though).JustCause is to the FarCry-Series like ""Saints Row"" is to ""GTA"": It's its mad brother. You can't trust him, he's abusing drugs and hits on your wife (or hubby). But he's more fun at parties than accountant-brother.The good (what to love): It's just ""Just Cause 2"" but more of the lovely stuff, even less serious, and even more hillarious physics The new tethering-stuff is an awesome pool of crazy, twisted and even horribly mean fun The wingsuit/parasuit enable for nearly endless flying Blowing up stuff has never been so much fun. Place C4 at the right spots, detonate them, watch all come down.  Realism? Not in the slightest! Leaderboards with a very nice feature: Race the ghost of your friends (or others). You select someone else from the leaderboards, and start the challenge. It's like multiplayer but solo :-) Mods (though not officially and only a handful right now, but some more will surely come) Performs pretty well and still looks decent for 2015 (yes I know, seems I'm lucky here) Better (but still not perfect) car-handling Beautiful italian setting Large open-world fun Collectibles like audiotapes, cards, vintage-parts. Enough to keep collectors busy Want to punish your minions? Tether to feet and tower. Retract. Laugh evilish. If there would be any limb separation you could quarter them with 4 tethers :-)The mediocre (not good, not bad, but no show-stopper either): Challenges. You don't HAVE to do them, but if you want all those gadgets and goodies and abilities, you'll sadly have to do them. And win them if possible (5-Star). Funny for the first time but some tend to be frustratingly hard. At least for me :-) After around 15hrs I only had one bug where the car I was driving suddenly dissapeared. Been more funny than annoying though. Beside this I only had very minor glitches with the tethering. Stupid, unskippable lengthy intro. (Edit: Thanks to mods, you now can...) Animals are pathetic. One wrong look and they drop dead. Walked into a deer. Deer dropped dead. Walked into a goat. Goat dropped dead. The ugly (what to hate, may kill the fun): Enemies spawn. Sometimes you kill two guards on the 5m² top of a damn high tower, turn around and there they are again. HORRIBLE, ANNOYING and a real showstopper Season-pass-bullcrap again. Please stop this pandemic brainfart Killing EVERYONE does not matter at all. Kill a dozen rebels in front of other rebels and they still yell ""Yay! Rico! Make me babies! Prego!"" Though I can't complain at all, according to the mixed reviews and general critics, it has many bugs, flaws and runs crappy on AMD Can't remap controller but keyboard. Half-done jobRecommended?If you liked JC1+2 and enjoy the mindless, phsyics-defying destruction-rampage: YES.If you already found JC2 to be too silly, unbelievable and unrealistic: HELL NO!It may not be perfect, it may have some problems, but beside the spawning-horror and the more-or-less forced challenges it's a damn funny and mindless ride!I cannot understand the ""mixed"" ratings except they're mostly because of the technical problems it may have (which I cannot judge). It's a worthy successor in abeautiful environment and it ""upped"" Rico from a guy with a grappling-hook to basically Ironman without the suit. It sometimes even felt like ""Prototype"" :-)As far as I am in this game: Not one crash, no annoying glitches, no game-breaking bugs. Had expected much worse!According to other reviews, you may wait for at least the first patch if you own any AMD-Hardware though :(			"

Posted: December 8, 2015
My take after 5 hours... I would both recommend and also discourage people to buy/not buy this, but I could only chose one option so please read on to see why!Performance - Does it run?After an initial drama with getting it to run at my native resolution - the game crashed every time I switched res and eventually I had to change it in the config file to get it to load - on my machine yes it does, and very very well.. However I'm lucky enough to have just upgraded to the following:i7 6700k @ Stock 4.0GHzAsus Maximus VIII Hero Mobo16GB G.Skill Ripjaws V 3000MHzMSI GTX 980Ti Gaming 6GNow I realise this is at the upper end of the hardware scale, and if you're in a position similar to me you can expect to be able to play at a minimum of 100fps (average of ~130) on 1080p with every setting on maximum, so I'm expecting 80-90 on 1440p when I get a new monitor in a couple of weeks (will update with the actual figure).The game seems to be a bit of a memory hog and while playing it my system uses about 8.2GB with just the game and a few google chrome tabs open, so this could potentially be an issue for people with less.As others have commented, the initial game loading times are quite slow (using an SSD), however once the map is loaded in, the missions etc load very quickly.Gameplay / FeelI've only played 5 hours but this is my 2c so far..The game looks jaw dropping and if I'm honest is half the reason I bought it, to see what my new system was capable of. I messed around a bit with lowering some of the graphic settings and with a lot of them the quality of the game doesn't decrease too much and you can gain a few fps by doing this, so I wouldn't be worried about how its going to look if you play at medium etc - it will still be incredibly pretty.After getting over the initial oooooo this is pretty thoughts, the actual game itself is fun in the respect of being able to mindlessly blow things up and fly about like a super-spider-bat-man kind of combo thing (it's bizarre!) It's fun jumping in a tank and blowing up a petrol station, or in a helicopter that has infinite spammable missiles, or planting mines on a bridge, then causing a pile up before blowing the whole thing up etc etc...Regarding the campaign / story, well to me (admittedly a Just Cause noob) the premise is a bit thin.. a dictator has gone a bit mental and therefore we need to crush him and his minions by taking over towns, then more towns, and a few more, and then a couple more after that.. you get the point. These towns are all just clones of one another and there are only so many ""fun and creative"" ways to shoot, blow up, or pull down yet another identical red billboard or telegraph pole in order to take over the 100000th one.I know already I wont be able to stomach completing the story as its simply just too damn repetitive. The side missions to upgrade your perks etc are sort of fun, but really not challenging enough to take seriously.The cars in the game are HORRENDOUS to control, by either a keyboard or a controller, they just plain suck. The heli's are much more fun, but a bit too EZ-MODE. I've had the most fun just cruising around on my parachute & wingsuit (which is a good laugh when you get the hang of it) and getting up to random mischief - such as slingshotting people with the tether device combined with booster bombs and seeing how far someone can fly without a parachute! Again though, this will only last so long, and after it wears thin I probably wont log back in as it just doesn't have enough pull to keep me interested.Conclusion+If you have some decent PC hardware (that doesn't include an AMD gpu (sorry guys!)) then the game *should* run ok, and hopefully even better after a patch. If this is the case for you, you will be treated to a super pretty game with a MASSIVE world to go mental in.+If you are the type of person to roam about on GTA and just randomly cause chaos you will no doubt love this game, as nothing will compare to the madness you can create.+If you're the type of person who enjoys a good story with engaging, challenging and varied game play too, you should probably pass at least until its in a steam sale, as you will soon find it tedious and frustratingly repetitive for the £40 price tag!I hope this has helped at least someone! Please comment below if you found this useful, or alternatively crap! Please feel free to let me know what I could have done to improve this, if anything!Thumbs up if you like and down if you don't!Cheers.			"

No big deal. Just go borrow one from the army.They may shoot at you, but that's okay. They're helping you learn how to dodge bullets.Ever collapsed a bridge and watched a train fall onto hundreds of innocent civillians?I have. It was fun.Did I mention there was a wingsuit?			"

												The game is great... All the new additions are welcome, and it feels like a logical evolution of the series. However, there's a HUGE portion of the player base who haven't even been able to run the game since a patch about 2 months ago, including myself. Devs have said nothing and appear to be making no effort to fix it. Avoid this game until this changes.			"

												the Devs of this game are♥♥♥♥♥♥ i have a i7 and a GTX 970 4G and the game drops to 30fps or less whenever i blow something up (the whole point of the game). if you look at the forums you'll see that to fix the memory leak problem that the game STILL suffers from is to buy 16gbs of ram.  this is an OFFICIAL DEV FIX!  on the store page the min ram it says you need is 8gbs, they are basically lying.i have 16gbs so i don't get affected but that's really unfair to all the people who don't have that much and can't get that much. the game is fun when it works but it doesn't work often. and the Devs seem to be more focused on getting new DLC out than fixing these bugs that make their game unplayable. i've got nothing against DLC but when your game suffers from something as severe as a memory leak that should be your first priority. consider getting it on X1/PS4 or just skipping.

												Just 100%'d the game and here's what I think:If you're into mindless destruction as well as huge explosions then look no further this is the game for you.However, the aforementioned game is plagued with countless issues such as:- Extremely repetitve gameplay, minimal enemy variety- Shallow plot, forgettable characters- Performance issues, even on a decent rig- Poor vehicle handling, for instance bikes seem to have input lag which is frustrating to say the least- Unintuitive flight controlsEtc.So in conclusion, JC3 is essentially JC2 with updated visuals plus a wingsuit.

												This was supposed to be a great experience. It ended up being one of the worst experiences in my gaming life. The constant stuttering and the developers disregard for all the complaints make all this even worse.That's all i have to say. I can't even finish this game.(edit. Because people are reading my review, i think it's best i tell the community why i have issues with the game. My problem with the game is the memory, i think. Because i have 8 GB of RAM, the game kept using all my memory up to +90% usage, which made the stuttering and freezing of the game. I know this because the game actually got better for a little while when i cleaned the memory, it'd go down to 75, 80% usage, until it got worse again. For 52 hours i tried everything, i even endured the constant stuttering and freezing and for those brief moments when everything seemed fine, i actually enjoyed the game.)			"

												Steam really needs a one thumb up and one thumb down option. I love Just Cause, so I was really excited about this release. Especially when they talked about improving the driving physics and other tweaks to make gameplay better. JC has one of the most fun open world environments, and is a great destructive sandbox. Unfortunately in my small gameplay time so far, there are a lot of cons.1) You still move like you have one leg. As you turn you spin, in a 360degree fashion, not just simply turn. This makes for awkward movement when you need to face and activate an object.2)Driving is still a negative. While DRASTICALLY improved over JC2, there is still a lot of work to be done here. Instead of fast paced and moving on ice as in JC2, JC3 is a slowed down drive on sticky tarmac. Turning is slow at first then exagerated to the left or right very quickly. 3)Controller/keyboard controls. I have to use both. I use the controller for general movement and the mouse for aiming/shooting. Neither one performs exceptionally well on their own so I've found a compromise and use both. 4)The map is not very informative. Also, in doing the missions, you have to be close to your objectives if they are in white. (Things you need to do to control settlements.) Yellow indicators appear from any location and are easy to find your destination. Once you are there however, they become white, and are things you need to explode or activate to complete your mission, and can be a pain to find.5)Enemies seem to pop in out of thin air sometimes. Not from a great distance mind you one time it happened from 10 feet away. 6)The leaderboard function. Both a Pro and a Con here. Con is anytime logging in it takes a bit longer with this feature active, popups can get annoying. 7)It seems AMD users are having problems with some texture popin and textures failing to load. AMD users need to stay away until a patch is introduced for you guys.  I did not experience this with my Nvidia EVGA 980Ti SC ACX+Square_Jason has been active reguarding this problem http://steamcommunity.com/app/225540/discussions/0/485623406959941125/Pros1)Graphics. The game looks very nice. 2)Performance. Im running a single 980Ti in 4k@60 fps with absolutely no frame drops. It's a very solid performer. 3)The leaderboard function. Both a Pro and a Con, it's fun seeing what your friends do in game and trying to beat them. 4)Destruction. Very fun to blow things up still and very many creative ways of doing it, from grappling, grapple tether, guns, bombs, cars, planes, etc. 5)Open world sandbox. This is the bread and butter of Just Cause, and with 1000km2 of open world to explore it delivers again.SIDENOTE: The airstrikes the enemy calls on you are REALLY ANNOYING...they have amazing accuracy on moving targets. Use this to your advantage! Stand next to a target, let them bomb missiles on their own equipment! Rinse and repeat to take out settlements without firing a single rocket.SPECS: i7 4930k, 32g ram, EVGA 980Ti SC ACX+ , ASUS 4k monitor @60 fpsThese will get updated as I continue playing, and while there are a ton of negatives it is still JC and a very fun game to play. Despite all of these negatives it's a very fun game. 7/10 so far.			"

												This is a good game. Is it a great game? Probably, but there are a few issues.There are a lot of improvements from Just Cause 2. You're still raising hell on an island nation, but this time the ridiculous characters feel like they are entirely on purpose, and this time it's a lot prettier. There are a lot less collectibles and settlements this time around, but frankly, that's a good thing. Just Cause 2 had way, way too much to do, and not all of it was satisfying. Sometimes you could spend twenty minutes on a military base looking for that one last thing to destroy, the one insignificant little generator that you missed, that one crate that you didn't pick up. This time, once you start a settlement, you're told what you have to do to liberate it. Destroy the speakerboxes, destroy the propaganda vans, raid the police station and free the prisoners. It's fairly entertaining, the first few times, but after that it becomes somewhat monotonous.It is pleasant to watch a province side with you after liberating everything within it. That was something that was missing in Just Cause 2, you can easily and visibly track your progress across the nation this time around, much like you could in the original Just Cause.Then you have the various challenges, wherein you earn 1-5 gears based on your performance. Mostly optional, and although gears unlock upgrades for your gear and vehicles, you don't need to get five gears on every single challenge to unlock everything. Which is good, because some of the challenges require you to perform absolutely perfectly. I was stuck on one of the wingsuit challenges for a good forty-five minutes. Thankfully, I could have just given up and gone on to other things, as I had already unlocked all of the available upgrades, but I was determined and bored.So the challenges are hit and miss. Some of them are actually fun, and add a neat element to the game. The races are generally pretty decent, except for the occasional moments of flipping your car. The destruction challenges are fun, but most of them can be cheesed by using something else. For example, the boat challenges can be difficult because most of the boats are hot garbage. But when a helicopter spawns on the outskirts of the challenge map, complete with rocket launchers? Not even remotely difficult. For the most part, I enjoyed the wingsuit challenges. You follow along the predetermined route and hit the circles, aiming for the middle for maximum points. And most of them, you don't have to be perfect to get five gears. Some of them are obnoxious, some of them are downright peaceful.The story in the game? Meh. I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm happy that they tried. They didn't take themselves seriously this time around. I mean, not that they ever did. But in the first two games, it still bordered on sense. Things got weird on occasion, like the ninjas with the submachine guns, but they only popped up a few times in the entire game. This time, they have a cast of wacky characters, all of whom are entertaining, none of whom get any closure whatsoever when the story ends. And that's my only real problem with the story. I like that it's silly, I enjoyed when the main character punched a computer screen and said ""♥♥♥♥ you, missile"", that was just a good time. But when the game ends with no fanfare, it feels underwhelming. It is underwhelming. I completed every single challenge with max gears, I liberated every single settlement, I did all the DLC, and the game just...sort of peters out.On the note of DLC, it's fantastic. I picked up the Just Cause 3 XL pack on sale for twenty-five bucks. It includes three DLC storylines, each with new areas to liberate and a game-changing, almost game-breaking item being the reward for completing it. A gun that calls lightning down from the sky. When powered up with the gear upgrades, it is ridiculously overpowered. You can bring down a military base with the power of the gods. I ended up shelving that one because it was too much, and I wanted to have a touch of challenge. If I was going in for a second playthrough, which I will inevitably do, then heck yes I am going to use that to clear things out. It has some difficulties hitting aerial targets, as you have to make sure you're aimed right at them, and keep the cursor directly on them until the lightning comes down, or else it will blast off into the distance, destroying innocent trees. But for groundbound targets, it's pure death. This DLC pack also introduces the only boat in this game that is not a steaming pile of floating crap. The Loochador is a boat with a ridiculous amount of nitro boosting, high speeds and steering, and a barrage of rockets to destroy your foes.The one piece of DLC gear that I DID use, and use a lot, was the jetpack. Holy crap, is that thing awesome. Just Cause 2 introduced the infinite parachute that defies physics, gravity, mass, just about everything that you hold true in the universe. But who cares, it makes the game more fun. This time around you have the infinite parachute again (which is even jokingly mentioned in the game), and the wingsuit. But the wingsuit is only useful when you're high up in the air. You move faster, but you can't get much air back. Until you get the jetpack. Now you can propel yourself through the skies. Who needs a vehicle when you have a highly unstable bavarium jetpack strapped to your back? Add to that, the fact that it has both a machine gun AND a missile launcher, both with infinite ammo and a reasonable cooldown time. Plus you can upgrade it via a series of challenges similar to the wingsuit ones, but designed with the boost in mind, making them much more difficult and interesting. At any rate, this piece of gear made my journey across Medici a lot quicker. The only downside of it is that SAM sites now detect you as an enemy aircraft, and will fire missiles at you if you get too close. Which you can avoid, if your timing is good. But it does make life a little more difficult, which is probably a good balance for a device so utterly useful.The last piece of DLC equipment is a mech suit. Gun arm for the pew pews, and gravity arm for picking things up, throwing them, or just doing a devastating gravity punch and eliminating everything in front of you. Once you have the gear upgrades, which are, like the rest of the DLC gear upgrades, gained by completing specific DLC challenges, then your mech suit is a force of mechanical doom. You can pluck helicopters out of the sky, throw them at other helicopters, gravity punch entire waves of enemy forces, and pick out enemies with upsetting accuracy with the autogun mech. The other mech is dumb and I hate it. Also, once you've completed everything and have it unlocked, if you don't want to drive it you can call in a rebel in a mech suit to wreck♥♥♥♥♥♥FOR you.Each of these pieces of DLC gear are gamebreaking in their own way, which is kind of perfect for a game like this. They're not needed, which means the base game is completely unprepared for them. For my first run through the game, I only used the jetpack, and held off on the weapons it has, because they felt like I was cheating. For later runs, I have no doubt in my mind that I will use these mech suits and lightning guns to destroy my enemies so fast that the good general won't know what hit him until he has a lightning mech knocking down his door like the friggin' Koolaid Man.I like this game. I enjoyed it a lot. I had a huge grin plastered on my face from the moment I started the intro cutscene. I would definitely recommend picking it up, especially when it's on sale. For twenty-five bucks, it took me fifty hours to get through on my first playthrough. Definitely worth the price. My only issues with this game are the ending, which didn't wrap things up as much as I would like, and the fact that it crashed a few times. But it has a generous autosave feature, so I never lost more than a few minutes of mayhem.			"

												I was so excited for this game.  I loved Just Cause 2 and knew for sure its sequel was going to be a hit.I was very wrong.The pros:Updated physics and graphics, better grapple/parachute mechanics, the wingsuit, awesome explosions and destruction.  An overall beautiful game that has so much potential.The cons:-Performance is very poor especially for those on PC (unless you have certain Nvidia cards I believe).  The game was created as a console game and was not ported over very well.-Memory Leaks.-Gameplay is constantly interrupted when there's a disconnect with the server.-Devs don't appear to actively support or fix these issues.-No minimap-Car and motorcycle handling is absolutely atrocious.  They seem to have been made for just console controllers and wheels, then directly ported to PC.  The lag is huge between pressing a button to turn on the keyboard and the vehicle actually turning, to the point that you'll fall off cliffs, hit buildings, and spin out of control because there's no sensible way to make the vehicles do what you want.  It's not just a learning curve, or something to get used to - it's a design flaw, because the only way to control a vehicle is to possess Jedi abilities to see what's coming before it happens.  Only then will you have time to press the key and keep it pressed long enough for the car to respond in time.  I can't even get in vehicles in JC3.  I'm belaboring this point because vehicle chases and combat were such a huge part of JC2, and they're completely ruined by these shoddy mechanics that the devs still stand by.  They should, at the very least, give the option to revert to JC2 mechanics.The list goes on.  It hurts me to say, but don't buy it.			"

												I wrote a negative review a while ago for this game, saying that the game ""used to work but no longer does."" However, I got it to work, and it ended up being fantastic. The problem was my controller. If you have the controller plugged in when you boot up the game, you get about 1 frame per second. If you plug in your controller after you start playing, it works. Now that I have played it, I can review it correctly.The game is good.The campaign is much higher quality than that of Just Cause 2, and it is much longer. I did enjoy the characters, cutscenes, stories, ideas, etc. and there was even some good humor thrown in. The campaign seems to take itself more seriously than the one in Just Cause 2, which I thought was a great choice on Avalanche's part. For veteran Just Cause players, there are some ""easter eggs."" For example, in Just Cause 3, there is a big island in the top-right corner that replicates the one (in the same spot) in Just Cause 2 (although this one has no inhabitants). Just Cause 3's capital, Regno, has a sister city in Just Cause 2 called Bandar Baru Nipah, which I thought was awesome. In addition, just like Just Cause 2, a funny radio announcer will talk about the base that you just blew up to try to calm the dictator's people. Rico also has some throwback quotes.The destruction in this game is total. I was constantly in awe of both how much infrastructure Avalanche had created and how much I could destroy. Blowing stuff up in this game is amazing, especially with the unlimited C4 supply. You can be extremely creative, and there is a ton to do. There are functioning trains that you can ride up and down the mountains, and you can get cargo planes and put cars inside, then fly them high above the country. The wingsuit is very fun to play with and get better at, and the grappling system has been much improved.The music is fantastic, and rivals Just Cause 2's soundtrack. The country, Medici, is similar to Panau in that it is extremely diverse. There are beaches, forests, snow-covered mountains, and sea. This makes traveling around the world seem much less deja-vu than it could have been. The towns and cities are beautiful as well, making you feel like you truly are in Italy. However, I believe that Just Cause 2 has the better world; there are more cities, more easter eggs, and less of the ""filler"" land in Just Cause 3.Overall, as a huge fan of Just Cause 2, I feel satisfied with Just Cause 3. The expreience has been amazing, and I think I will continue to play in this beautiful sandbox. Just make sure to unplug your xbox controller until you start to play!			"

OverviewI’ve played about 45 hours of Just Cause 3. In that time, I’ve done 54% of the challenges, liberated all provinces, found all collectibles and beaten the game.It has had its ups and downs, but overall, the game works. Yes, it stutters. Yes, it’s beyond poorly optimized, but it’s still a fun, if overly repetitive, game.I played this on an i7-4790k with 8GB of RAM and a GTX 980 Ti. After about two hours, the game would get stuttery, and the audio would stutter as well. Simple solution for me (not guaranteed to work) was to alt+tab out of the game, tab back in, and it worked fine for another couple of hours. Only twice did I have to quit out of the game and restart it to clear any stutter issues.That said, if you’re still interested in the game in its current state (as of this review), continue on. If not, perhaps come back to the game after a patch or two and decide if it is worth it for you to buy then.ProsJust plain fun to blow things up constantlyBig open worldLots to do (races, frenzies, wingsuiting, etc.)Opportunity to create unique situations with physics and the upgrades available to youFairly lengthy, will take you a bit to finishThe world looks very good on max settingsMusic and sound effects, for the most partLots of collectibles which reward unique vehicles or weaponsConsStory is as bland as it can get, and been done countless times before; same goes for the dialoguePoorly optimized; beefy systems will stutterRepetitive; not much variety to the bases or towns aside from new things being added (early bases may not have monitoring systems while later ones will, for example)Main story and upgrades become gated behind the challenges, which make them necessary as opposed to optionalCharacter models are bland, and enemies all look alike (regular soldier looks like every other, armored one looks like every other armored soldier, etc.)SummaryThe game is not without its issues. You could have a powerful system and still succumb to sub-30FPS without horrendous audio and visual stuttering. On the flip side, you could have a mid-range system and not have many issues at all.Taken without its issues, Just Cause 3 is still a fun game. It’s best played in chunks, because the repetition will tire you if you were to play it for hours straight.Finally, I recommend Just Cause 3 because when it works, it’s pure fun. There’s something to be said for arcadey games in today’s world, when a heavy focus is on strategy and realism, and with its insane explosions and aerial traversing, Just Cause 3 has arcadey in spades.

												After a rocky launch i can finally give my full opinion on this game.Just cause 3 is one of the most fun games you are going to play this year. From almost the start you can do almost anything and go anywhere. Wanna explore a vast, beautiful vibrant world? Go ahead.Want to blow blow stuff up and cause chaos? This game was made for that!What i really appreciate about this game, is that they have listened to the community on what worked and what didnt work in JC2. They also implemeted mods from JC2 into this game, and have made JC3 better in almost every way. The gameplay is great. With a collection of unique weapons, you can wreck havoc on the beautiful island of Medici. Plus, the addition of the wingsuit, is now one of my favorite ways of moving around in any game. The story is somewhat lacking though, and i feel that JC2´s story is actually stronger than this one. The story missions arnt as great as JC2´s story missions, as they tend to feel a bit samy after a while, and i remember JC2´s story a lot more than i feel i will remember this one.The game also still have some problems, with occasional stutters, crashes and glitches, but not enough to really detract from the overall experience.All in all:Pros- Its fun to blow stuff up- Lots of stuff to do (Wingsuit, races, explosion-challenges)- Theather - Giant, open, beautiful world- Again, really beautiful world, fantastic explosions and effects- Music is good, nothing really special, but good- The physics engine opens up great possibilities Cons- Story is bad, not membrable- Bad launch, not big problem now, still have to add- Can become repetetive, depends on the person- Minor problems, gated upgrades(can be annoying), some ocational input lag, slight popin(Depends on PC)			"

												Summary: If you liked Just Cause 2, you will most likely enjoy Just Cause 3. If you're anything like me, you'll enjoy spending hours mindlessly dicking around with explosions, physics and stunts and this game gives you ample means to do so.My impression is good so far, I'm having a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to spending lots of time messing around. If you buy this game expecting a deep and introspective work of art, look elsewhere. If you buy it and are looking for a fun game to experiment with and show your friends, this is the game for you.Pros:- Beautiful graphics and map design (love the vivid colors, lush landscapes and the sea is gorgeous.)- Very fun gameplay (explosions, flying, and killing, oh my)- Lots to work towards if you are a completionist- Non-linear so you can progress past the missions or ignore them altogether after a point- Lots of Easter Eggs- Civilian cars can be captured and then ordered via black market supply drops- Lots of models of cars, planes, tanks, and weapons to use- Super corny voice-acting (JC staple)- Sound effects are high quality- Visual effects are stunning- The new Wingsuit navigates really smoothly and is very fun once you get the hang of itCons:- Occasional bugs (nothing game-breaking for me as of yet, but I've had to restart a few missions due to bugged objectives)- Physics are wonky as hell (can be a pro in some cases, it's more geared towards fun than realism but mostly proves clunky and strange)- Driving has some of the worst physics I've come across in any game (motorcycles are nearly impossible to drive)- Moving rico around can be a hassle and interacting with vehicles or items can be a pain- Not much depth story or character wise, but this is to be expected- Always online can prove to be a nuisance if your connection is spotty (constant reconnection attempts)All in all I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone considering it who knows what they are in for in a Just Cause game. I will update this review as I put in more hours.Specs:- i7-4790k- 16 gb ram- Nvidia 980- Windows 8- 7200 rpm HD- 1440p monitorPerformance:- Stable fps around 40-50 on very high settings @ 1440p- Load times take around 10-20 seconds per cut scene (not ideal but it isn't on my ssd so it's expected)Thanks for reading!

												How is it that DOOM runs flawlessly on my 8 year old computer with a GeForce 660 TI on high settings, but this game runs like Crysis on a Palm Pilot? Drops FPS constantly and when there are explosions (and a chance to crash completely). This is all on medium to low settings.Wasn't even worth the $30 bundled with Rise of the Tomb Raider. Wait til it's 75% off.			"

												I see a lot of mixed reviews on the store page, but I had a blast so far with my first (7 hour) run in this game.  The game runs smooth at 60fps for me and I did not encounter memory leaks nor noticable bugs like many reviewers have mentioned. I did see a few AI glitches when they are at pop-in render range, but other than that it's all solid and smooth. It is basically an upgraded more polished Just Cause 2 game with a few new gimmicks and features. I liked the K/M controls layout more in JC2, but I got used to the new controls pretty quick. The only thing I don't like with the controls is that your character can't fall off a roof anymore. If you want to get of a rooftop then you have to jump, you can't just walk of it. Overall the game is an improvement to JC2, but there are some design changes in JC3 that I do not like that much. Specially that they have now locked away upgrades behind 'challenges' is a bit annoying. The old way of upgrading by creating 'chaos' was a lot more fun and was not seperated from the game like these new challenge locations.  The graphics are nice too, it is more realistic themed (Italy) and the whole atmosphere looks more realistic than in JC2.  I definitely recommend this game, if you liked JC2 then JC3 is a nice addition to have in your library.			"

												Such a superb game, but I can't recommend this game in its current state. It's been out for a month now, and there is still constant studdering and FPS drops that make the game completely unplayable. I'm actually really sad about how this turned out.EDITProfessorHojo of Square Enix has recommended following these steps to fix these problems. These seem to fix it for a lot of the community;1.	Launch JC32.	Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Alt+Del)3.	Go to ""DETAILS""4.	Find ""justcause3.exe""5.	Right click, set priority to ""HIGH""6.	Continue with next tweak.1.	Resolution -> ""Set it to your default monitor resolution""2.	""Anti-aliasing"" -> ""OFF""3.	""Vsync"" -> ""OFF""4.	""Water quality"" -> ""MEDIUM""5.	""Shadow quality"" -> ""HIGH""6.	""Lod radius"" -> ""HIGH""7.	Everything below ""Shadow Quality"" -> ""OFF""			"

												Honestly, I don't get the hate. This game is easily the best game I have played this year, the amount of fun I'm having exploding stuff up and exploring is growing all the time! Considering I can't write a review, I'll do a Pros & Cons thing right here.Pros: - Awesome gameplay. - Amazing graphics. - The storyline isn't actually terribad! - Sound effects. - Massive amount of weapons and vehicles.Cons: - Small graphical bugs, but not too gameplay impacting. - Apparently AMD gpu's are having some problems... - The driving. Just... no. - Some of the cutscenes and voicelines seem very forced.Edit: Yeah, yeah. AMD users are having problems and that means ""the game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible."" They're fixing it right now and you can play the game at some point. :)Edit 2: Just wanna say they really made the weapon combat simpler from JC2. You can't crouch or roll anymore. But yes, there's ""precise aim"". xd			"

 Just Cause 3 is by far the best game in the Just Cause series, and an absolute must-have for open world fans. StoryIn the story of Just Cause 3, you play as Rico Rodriguez, some sort of Spanish Rambo. Rico's massive open world home Medici is suffering under the typical dictator, who is oppressing his people, and threatens the whole world with his bavarium weapon production. It's obvious that the CIA is looking to get in on that too. Only Rico is in the way.GameplayIn the struggles against the dictator you must support the rebels of Medici by freeing over 130 villages, cities, outposts, oil rigs, and military camps by wreaking havoc. In addition to that, you must deal with countless singleplayer missions, challenges as well as sidequests.For these tasks, you are provided with all sorts of weapons, vehicles, and gadgets. It's up to you whether you use a car, motorcycle, boat, plane, helicopter, parachute, wingsuit or your grappling hook for progression. The possibilities are endless.Sadly the leveling system of Rico is both limited and almost pointless, since he is already very good at everything, but still you can unlock ""upgrade-mods"" through completing challenges. These go all the way from target practice to racing.Pros:  Gigantic open world leaving the players their freedom of action. The story mode with 25 missions is done very well, and offers a variety of action. Lasting enjoyment in the gameplay thanks to the map's size, liberty of the player, the numerous singleplayer missions, Steam achievements, sidequests, 130 villages/camps, that are to be liberated, and tons of challenges. Phenomenal graphics, especially the explosions look amazing. Ideal handling with both controller and keyboard. You can bind all keys individually. Vertical movement. You can fly, drive, walk, swim or dive. Great! A great repertoire of cars, tanks, motorcycles, boats, helicopters and planes. Realistic sound effects. Funny radio hosts, and by now bug free.Neutral:  The released game was extremely buggy. Some AMD graphics cards didn't work, there were problems with processors and much more. By now all's fixed. The main character's supposed to be ""cool"", but his quotes are really just lame. There's barely any music in the game, but somehow it doesn't harm the gameplay, since there are radio hosts, evermore explosions and shootouts with amazing sound effects.Cons: Always online DRM isn't just annoying, because Steam often suffers from server issues. It also costs performance.No Steam cloudSadly no MultiplayerConclusion:Even if DRM is annoying, Just Cause 3 is a gigantic open world must-have game that mustn't be missing from any collection. This review was written as a valuation inside of its own genre.Total rating: 8,5/10If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												The downside: This game has some of the worst optimization I've ever seen.The upside: I get to blow up compounds called ""DRM"".The ironic side: This game has a really annoying DRM that randomly pauses the game when it loses connection.The painful side: Trying to steer a motorcycle is the hardest thing I have ever done in a video game. And I really don't feel like I'm exaggerating there. It's just awful. It single handedly made me give up on 100%ing the game.The serious side: It's not that different from Just Cause 2. Some improvements here, some downgrades there. Blowing stuff up was just as fun in Just Cause 2, this just gives you a little more freedom and a couple new toys. Unless you're dying for more, it's probably not worth the price.			"

It's at 60fps and then every ~30seconds, there are large frame drops and the game chugs so badly for 1-2 seconds.It's not just during action moments... simply standing still and spinning the camera (both quickly and slowly) runs into the same issue.

												The game itself is fun enough, but for 50 bucks, I expect a product to work properly.Alas, this game has too many bugs for my taste.First sniper frenzy mission ended with sniper scope being stuck, so the rest of the playthrough was in sniper scope vision, had to restart the game to get rid of it.Then at some mission I had to cross a bridge, bridge got destroyed, and mission failed because everyone drives down a broken bridge, restarts at checkpoint, everyone drives to their death again because the bridge didn't get fixed by restarting at mission checkpoint.After destroying a base, somehow the entire region stopped ""updating"", map refuses to increase resolution on zooming in. This wasn't just an issue with the map: also all targets from other bases look low res and can't be hit either, no soldiers spawned, everything was just dead. Again had to restart.And after another restart, keyboard and mouse stop functioning properly. Had to remove the gamepad and restart to get it working properly again.All in all, a bit weird to see these types of bugs this late after release. Also; the bloody login takes too damn long. But that's just a pet peeve.If you enjoyed the previous 2 JC games, and want to keep up with the next chapter of ""'splozions everywhere"", buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥when it's dirt cheap.			"

Pros :+ Open World, Freedom to do anything you want or go anywhere you want.+ Fun gameplay, Pretty game!.+ Graphics for me is good not bad.+ Huge map!, a lot to explore.+ Everything in game is destroyable objects!.+ You can travel by Grappling hook, Parachute, Wingsuit (wingsuit navigates really smoothly and is very fun).+ A lot of weapons.+ Grenades and C4 ( c4 never ending ).+ Amazing Explosions!.+ Sound effects are high quality.+ You can steal civilian cars.+ Lots of models of cars, planes, tanks.Cons :- Have no options to change camera Zoom & FOV, which by default is very bad, limiting your visuals significantly ( also when you're in car ).- The car handling is even worse they're not fun to drive, same goes for bikes ( bad physics ).- Drop fps sometimes.and i would say thanks very much for add arabic language, we appreciate it :)My Rating : 9/10 "

												Unlike Just Cause 2, the predecessor to this game, which was a very good game, ran very well, and had few stability issues, Just Cause 3 is rife with stability issues. It's evident that the game was developed on one of the home consoles, and then ported to PC, and that port was a halfhearted attempt at best. Despite releasing patches that should have fixed memory leaks, Avalanche's go-to answer for stability issues is still ""Upgrade your system to 16 GB ram."" Despite the fact that the recommended (not minimum, but recommended for optimal performance) specs are 8 GB of memory. And even then, upgrading to 16 GB will only ""prolong the period between crashes"".They seem to want to release all sorts of paid DLC, but seem to have very little interest in making sure the base game runs well before doing so. Because of that, I cannot recommend this game. Despite being what could have been the strongest entry into the franchise, the developers decided to make a console game, and then port it to the PC with a minimum of testing, resulting in one of Rico's most disappointing outings.

Posted: December 24, 2015
												This game feels like a beta... besides the optimization problem that's been posted thousands of time, the game mechanics are barely improvement over JC2. If you want a TL;DR, skip to the end.Improvements over JC2:-AI is a bit better than in JC2. They attempt to hide and call for reinforcement when all of his friends were killed. AI also spawn tanks now so you actually have to be slightly more aware when tanks are around-explosion. This is a huge improvement over JC2, no question.-aircraft. Instead of having 2 similar combat planes in JC2 that had a machine gun and rocket, the air combat is a bit better because there's a more dedicated bomber for those who love to drop bomb, and a fighter craft that has guided missile that hit both air and ground.-more traffic. driving around make you realize Medicci is more populated than Panau-wingsuit, one of the selling point of this game-multiple grappler hook that you can force it to pull. now you can just cause helicopters to crash with a tether or 2-a few more guns/weapon than JC2, a bit more interesting choice for weapons than JC2, but that's mostly because of the 3 super weapon(airstrike, EMP, and mini nuke) that you can choose later on as you progress through the story.-doge mode(look up on youtube for this easter egg). ""much 2nd amendment"". LoLwhat this game did wrong:-no minimap. Like what was this development team thinking? Often you'd have to open up you map to see where nearby things are at, this is very painful. Also the lack of minimap made the AI a pain, which lead up to my next point:-AI spawn, is a PAIN in the butt. Basically when they removed the minimap, they made it so you cannot see where the military reinforcement is coming compare to JC2, thus 9/10 AI spawns tend to be not where you're looking, so often when you're fighting 10 guys and suddenly you realize you were shot behind. You turn around and see a combat jeep with 4 guys just spawn, despite that behind you is actually a friendly army base.-air combat. Yes I did mention air combat was an improvement over JC2, but that's because JC2 barely had any air combat(not including multiplayer mod). In this game, besides the main story, where the air combats are all scripted in the story, there is no aircraft AI for JC3. Getting your self to level 4/5 heat in a fighter or a bomber, and guess what? The game decide to spawn tanks for you to blow up. The game won't spawn fighter craft to engage you. So you can keep your dream for air to air combat till at least JC4(or unless someone can create a mod this).-DRIVING require fixing, especially for motocycle. You cannot control the motocycle with a keyboard at all, PERIOD. Even when you're driving straight, the tiniest bump will cause havok and make you lose control. Also applying the nitro booster on a motocycle and you're asking for a traffic accident.-challenges. Basically challenges are just tiny minigames, usually involved with time trial/explosion highscore... etc. However they're not particularly exciting to do, and often you need to retry, but the load time isn't particularly fast, which makes challenges some-what frustrating. Also challenges are pretty much manditory to do, because you need to do challenge to unlock gear mods(gear mods basically modifies certain mechanics, like giving you stronger grappling hook, more grenades to carry, giving nitro booster to rebel drop vehicles... etc), and to get maximum fun, you need those gear mods. Challenges should have been optional. Best get a mod to give you all the gears so you don't have to do them.-rebel drop. Basically rebel drop is the replacement to your JC2 equipment/vehicle request that Sheldon deliver to you, and they don't cost any credit(aka free, but this game don't have credit either). However 2 problems: rebel drop require you to first pick up a beacon, and second once you dropped your favourite vehicle/plane/boat, it goes on a LONG timer until you can drop that same vehicle again. Often your plane dropped somehow ends up 99% damaged and so not only you wasted a beacon, but your favourite plane is now on a long 30+minute cooldown. There is gear mod that remove the timer, but like I said, they're not really fun to unlock and it will take you quite awhile to unlock it.-always online. Yep steam DRM isn't enough, apparently you need to be online all the time to update the online leaderboard(that isn't even a global leaderboard). This ""always online"" not only can time-to-time kill your save file(if you didn't install your JC3 to the same hard drive as your windows O/S), drop your FPS, get spammed with people beating your record, and makes your loading longer. A temporary solution require you to put a firewall around your JC3.exe.TL;DR/summary:Anyways this game is a slight improvement over JC2, but it still has many problems to fix. I would not recommend this game at its current state. If you really want to play this game, then get it on 50% sale at least.Edit: I like to mention this is a soft negative as in this game can probably still fixed, but until it is done, I don't fully recommend this game unless its on a good sale(or fixed).

												TL;DR - I loved and sunk hundreds of hours into JC2 across PS3 and PC, and it's still better than JC3 for me at this point. That game oozed character and polish; this one completely lacks either.  Optimization issues aside, it's an ""okay"" action game; it's not a great Just Cause game.2015-12-11 UPDATE: A week and a half later and patches still haven't fixed the performance issues, but having twice the amount of recommended RAM apparently helps a ton for some people. I bumped up from 8GB to 16GB and get a pretty steady framerate and the stuttering is gone. That's on a system with a GTX 660Ti, which technically is under spec, yet I'm flying around the game at 60fps on High settings (I even got JC2 and JC3 running side by side, windowed, on the same machine, with playable framerates in both after adding the RAM).  Also, user-created mods are starting to emerge that fix annoyances like bypassing the stupidly long intro video and giving you access to more supply/vehicle drops to play around with.The frustration with the issues below was magnified by the performance issues.  Having mitigated the latter, and having sunk almost 40 hours into the game, I've started to find workarounds for the unsavory design changes from JC2 that aren't intuitive or particularly user-friendly.  You just get used to it, but that doesn't make it better.  Being essentially an enjoyable 'Wing Suit Simulator 2015' aside, the rest of the game still has plenty of moments where it feels like a Gobot when you asked for a Transformer.  However, if you never played JC2, you won't miss what you never had.I still think JC2 has more polish and replayability for me, but if/when they finally patch out the performance issues, I'm on the fence enough at this point that I might change my recommendation to more favorable.  Optimization issues aside, it's an ""okay"" action game; it's not a great Just Cause game.  But for now, don't drop $60 on something optimized this badly.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Pros:Wingsuit is pretty cool for a couple of hours, then it loses its novelty.Causing huge train wrecks is kinda fun.Prettiest fire and explosions I remember seeing in a game.Retracting tethers to rip things apart is enjoyable for a while.Equipment drops have been streamlined from JC2.Reprogramming SAM launchers to fire on enemy choppers is nice.The game tells you which objects still need to be destroyed or interacted with to capture a settlement or base, and the last few will even show up on the map if you're having trouble tracking them down.The soundtrack is good at times, especially while using the wing suit.Cons:You can't remap the X360 controls in a game in 2015.  Please.The FOV is too low and needs to be adjustable.You can't skip the annoyingly long intro; noticed that RAM usage ramps up while it's playing, but there's still a bunch of loading even after that.The always-online leaderboard stuff is amusing if you're into that, but it should be OPTIONAL.  The amount of stuttering and connection problems and gameplay interruptions it causes are inexcusable. Firewall the JC3 executable to turn that off for good without crippling Steam in offline mode.In JC2, you had a shoot button and an explosives button.  You still have that, except that selecting C4 now makes you put your gun away. If you bring it back out, you auto-switch back to grenades, which is especially problematic once you unlock Glass Grenades because it's really easy to blow yourself up if you're not paying close attention to the stupid auto-switching of explosives they introduced. Grenades should be on a different button than C4 OR using a gun should not switch back to grenades.On more than one occasion I have intentionally disabled some of the skills I had unlocked because they were getting me killed more than they were helping. What kind of skill system does that?Objective and incoming fire indicators are small and hard to see against the background. This is exacerbated by the removal of the minimap to tell where enemies were in relation to the player.Crouch, run, dive, and the melee grapple-whip attack are gone.The acceleration and handling for most vehicles are slow and laggy.  Makes many of the challenges a nightmare to bother with, and you need those to unlock arbitrary ""upgrades"" that would be standard features in other games.There's no way to just ""drop"" from wingsuiting like you can from parachuting. You unlock the wingsuit air brake later, but they hard-mapped it to the same button as release tether, something you want to use to gain speed while wingsuiting. It's fundamentally screwy.Random frame drops and game freezing (presumably while loading...something) just make the vehicle and wingsuit handling that much more of an issue.  My 120fps will plummet to 4fps for no apparent reason, whenever the game feels like it.Descriptions for challenges can be misleading. I did better on a Sniper Rifle Challenge by stealing a helicopter and blowing everything up rather than actually, ya know, using a sniper rifle and shooting the absent-yet-hinted-at red barrels.  The description implies there's an intended way to do some of them when in reality you can just sort of screw around until you find a better way.Load times for some challenges take longer than the challenges themselves. This makes retries really annoying.Everything feels so generic and soulless and half-hearted. The missions are lame and boring and the challenges are repetitive and uninspired.The prerelease game footage is borderline bull-shots.  So many people are having massive performance issues compared to that produced footage.The gunplay feels stale and boring. Bullet impacts don't feel significant, and enemies just sort of slump over.  Some even get back up unexpectedly.I still don't know how to tell how many beacons I have for supply drops without simply trying to initiate one.You can drop C4 while parachuting, but you can't throw it while standing on the ground.  You have to literally be touching whatever you want to use it on.  Also, you can't set it off if you're inside a vehicle.  What?Finding tapes and shrines and stuff isn't as interesting because (IMO) the detector for those seems less sensitive and responsive than the one in JC2. I've circled entire city blocks looking for one more bar of ""you're getting warmer"" to just see it sit at three bars.Capturing every civilian car isn't interesting because the car handling sucks and why would you want to capture an underpowered Honda Civic to summon it for a mission?I miss the different factions of JC2. I've only seen one in JC3 so far, and they have zero personality.There is so little story leading in that I don't even really care why I'm here. JC2 had you hunting down an arms dealer and rescuing a dork from a casino in high explosive fashion. In JC3, I guess I'm just here to overthrow a regime.The damage model feels inconsistent.  I can take sustained fire from a chopper and walk away with minor damage, but take a couple shots from some random grunts at the wrong time and it's insta-death.  Similarly, you can wingsuit into a brick wall at full speed and shake it off, but if you zipline into barbed wire, insta-death.There are so many moment-to-moment annoyances in the game that it makes me actively angry to play it. There's a good game buried in here somewhere, but big fans of the finer points of JC2 will have to suffer to find much fun here.Conclusion:The whole thing is just such a disappointment after a) How great JC2 was, and b) The pre-release footage looked amazing and refined and polished.  The final product is none of these things to me.  Some of the more glaring issues might be fixed in later patches, but I don't know that I care to wait around to find out.  Give it a year of patches and about an 80% price cut, then maybe reconsider it.			"

EDIT:Other users have pointed out in the review's comments that they could play the game without any issue with only 8GB RAM. By my assumption, only people running a Radeon GPU will have this problem while Nvidia users tend to be running the game smoothly. Of course, this could be wrong - the point is that this game's performance is a bit of a hit-or-miss so don't base your decision to purchase this game purely on this review. Instead, do a bit of research first to determine whether or not Just Cause 3 will run on your current system.Below is the original review I wrote before it was mentioned to me that the issue wasn't present for all users with 8GB of memory or less.- - -8GB OF RAM IS NOT ENOUGH.This is the first and last thing you should know about Just Cause 3. The optimization is the worse.Do you know why Just Cause 3 wasn't delayed? Because the optimization was so bad that the game had to be launched on the same year as the infamous Batman: Arkham Knight so that the optimization would seem comparably good.All jokes aside, how. the. ♥♥♥♥. do you screw up the optimization a sequel to one of my favorite game of all times (Just Cause 2) so ♥♥♥♥ing badly. How. Where did you go wrong, Avalanche? Just Cause 2 was amazing. Sleeping Dogs is considered one of the best open world games out there, and I recently finished playing Mad Max which has beat any of my expectations by a long shot, and hyped me for the release of Just Cause 3. All three of these games had excellent optimizing and great graphics. Then what happened for Just Cause 3? Who was in charge of optimization for Just Cause 3, if anyone?I know that the developers are constantly working on improving the performance and fix issues with the game, but so far these attempts haven't been very convincing at all, with updates after updates doing a whole lot of nothing as far as I can tell, and as I try to deal with the constant freezing, crashing and frame drops, the game is still, unfortunately, unplayable. Why? Because you WILL have memory issue if you have 8GB of RAM or less installed in you computer. You WILL have poor framerate, you WILL be forced to reduce the graphics (which really aren't that elaborated, let's be honest here, I can play most games some of which have better graphics, on highest settings without problem except for Just Cause 3 – don't get me wrong, the game is gorgeous, or it would be if it actually ran properly on medium graphics settings).Top three issues with the game---""Crashing – Lack of RAM""So far, I have not left the game on my own even once. The game will kill itself eventually, usually after around 0.5 to 1 hour of gameplay. Hooray for modern technology, insuring that quitting a game is never necessary for PC gamers around the world.---""Freezing – Lack of RAM""Again; apparently 8GB of RAM will not be enough, because as soon as you attempt to open the Steam overlay in-game, your game will freeze. Your desktop will freeze IF you manage to exit to desktop. Your computer will freeze. Your mouse cursor's speed will be reduced to 1FPS, and you will not be able to do anything at all, except force a shutdown of your entire system.Yes, I did try Ctrl+Alt+Del, and no. Even that didn't work, because my memory usage was at ~35% in use and 65% modified (or at least, if I can trust AMD System Monitor (which I do). That's what happens when you don't have any free memory.---""You have been disconnected... again""I can't explain that one, neither why it happens nor if it just happens to me, but I keep being disconnected from the servers and requested to re-attempt login. And no, I don't want to play offline. Why? Because the online part of the game is a feature of the game which I expect to function correctly. I shouldn't have to disable a feature because it just doesn't work. It should work.With that said...“Is the game good?” I hear you ask. Well, I honestly can't say. Is it good? I couldn't really get a chance to try it thoroughly due to the awful optimization. From what I've seen so far, it is an amazing game, or should I say, it could be an amazing game. However, unless you have a monster rig of a computer to play the game on, forget about this game ever running properly. Unless you have 16GB of RAM or more, forget about Just Cause 3, it won't run, you will have wasted you hard-earned money. Get Mad Max instead. Same developers team, godly optimization. It may not have parachutes, wingsuits, grappling hooks and machine guns, but at least it's playable.I really hate to give this game a bad review, but as I've already repeatedly mentioned in this review, the game is simply too poorly optimized, and until the developers fix it (which I doubt they will), I will most likely not change my review. Sorry Avalanche.PS: The game is fun though. If you have a very good computer, it's probably worth it.			"

												I absolutely loved playing this game.  The game is perhaps not as good as Just Cause 2, but free roaming the island and destroying everything you find is a ton of fun.  Unfortunately, Square Enix chose to take the low road and released this so-called AAA game in an unplayable condition.  Players are reporting varying amounts of success getting the game running, but one thing is certain: the game will crash on you eventually, and when that starts, you're very unlikely to be able to continue.  My game survived a glorious 12 hours of chaos and destruction.  Now it crashes within 10 minutes of startup.  That's not enough time to finish a mission, so I am completely unable to progress the game.The game has several game-crashing bugs that make the game unplayable. Most notably is memory leakage that causes the game to slowly fill up all your available RAM before it crashes your entire computer. There are several other issues that cause framerate stuttering, flickering graphics, and save file corruption. Square Enix is aware of these issues, and has been for a long time, but is doing nothing to fix them. In fact, the most recent patch they released actually caused more issues.  I submitted a support ticket and all they did was accuse my system of being at fault.  My system is way above the minimum specs for this game, so I know it is not my hardware.  (That, and the fact that thousands of other players are reporting the same problem should be a clear giveaway that it isn't a hardware issue!)			"

												An incredibly bad port of the game that has not been fixed even though it's been out almost an enitre year. Has a memory leak issue which causes your pc's memory use to spike to 100% and will stay there till you reboot your computer. Game takes forever to load and the framerate is all over the place regardless of the graphics settings. Hitching and stuttering are near constant. My framerate would fluxuate from 0 fps to 120 fps and even standing still in one place made the framerate jump around from 90 to 35.Do not buy.PC Specs: i5 4590 @ 3.3 ghzGTX 980 (OC'd to 1500 mhz)16 GB DDR3 @ 1600 mhzWindows 8.1 pro 64 bit1920x1080 Resolution			"

												+ huge open world that you can explore from top to bottom with very little restrictions+ movement feels very fluid and fast+ tons of content with or without the DLC+ skill progression that's not tied to the story missions+ compares your scores, stats, and records to your friends+ hint system for finding all the hidden collectibles- Steam Overlay will eat your storage space as you play- very resource intensive, this game puts my 16GB of RAM to use- needs more weapons- challenges seem too hard at first, but are meant to be replayed after earning new skills (via the same challenges)The movement in this game is far superior to any other open world I've explored.

												Even with the 1.021 patch, I still get fps drops and stuttering that make the game almost unplayable in combat situations. Just wingsuiting around is fine at 60+fps, but as soon as I get into a firefight, the game will completely freeze for about half a second  every 5-10 seconds until I leave the combat zone. I'm running a 4670k with 8GB of RAM and an R9 290 with the latest drivers, this should and would not be happening in a well-optimized game. Until this gets fixed and the game becomes actually playable, I cannot recommend buying it.			"

												In terms of creativity this is a very successful sequel and a loving continuation of the Just Cause series. This game is totally gorgeous, fun and loaded with cool content. It’s just such a shame though, that there are some serious problems with the performance. The outstanding quality of the design work, makes it shocking, that it could have been released in such a poorly optimised state. As so much love and consideration seem to have gone into making it something special. However, it appears to be yet another example, of the economic side of things pushing the release date forward. Resulting in an incredible game with mediocre performance at best. The pricing and distribution of the DLC content also represents some shady business practises. Although again, from a design stand-point, this additional content is fantastic stuff.Following some tweaks which included making some changes in Windows 10. I managed to get it running, just well enough, to be able to enjoy myself. However I am still experiencing crashes, stuttering and poor framerate. I’m running it on a GTX 980, an AMD FX 8350 and 8 Gigs of RAM. Apparently it’s the RAM that’s the main problem, as there is a warning every time I start up the game, stating that my system memory is low. Typically however, my 8 Gigs of system RAM, is totally fine for gaming in 2016. Especially since I spent over 700 Euro to get a GTX 980 with 4 Gigs of VRAM. Basically, Just Cause 3 runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥and you’ll need a powerful rig to get it running even moderately well. I have read online that if you have 16 Gigs or more of system RAM, it helps a lot but that is not normal. I get how people are angry about the performance problems but this game still deserves a lot of praise.  I’m going to recommend it because it is an example of how amazing videogames can be in 2016. Even though, the corporate money making side of the industry, seem to be determined to ruin things with short term thinking. If you have a decent PC, you can probably still get it running well enough to appreciate how incredible it is.Edit: I got some feedback in the comments and it seems like some people might also get 'okay' performance, on low to medium end PC'S, with low settings. This seems to be a bit random though, so maybe you should do some research before you buy. I said in the comments below, that 'okay' performance for me would be something like 45-60 FPS with occasional crashes and stuttering. This shouldn't really be acceptable with my GTX 980 but I still think the game is worth playing. Anyway, just know that you are gonna be compromising on performance, one way or another. It also seems to be a bit more of a gamble when you are using a lower end rig.			"

												I don't understand all the negative reviews here, but maybe I am lucky to have a system where JC3 runs without hick ups, freezes, crashes or something like that.First of all I really liked JC2 but I played it on the XBOX360. This time I decided to go for the PC version because I was that much cheaper. And it was worth it. The controls are so much better with the Keyboard, especially when it comes to aiming (surprise!).I can only recommend the game for everyone who enjoyed JC2 as much as I did.The new tethering function of the Grappling Hook is fantastic and you ca do a lot of hilarious things with it.What I really like about Just Cause is, that it's my own decision how I travel from A to B. And most of the time I do that via Parachute, Grappling Hook and Wingsuit. The Wingsuit helps to travel large distances without the new for a plane or a helicopter.What I dislike? The cars! (That's why I don't like the GTA Series Games).But the cool thing in JC3 is that you don't need them, if you don't want to.----------------------------------Here are also my specs, hopefully someone can do something with that.

												After 20ish hours of destruction in the game, its safe to say that this game runs fine on my rig (see my profile for spec). Never crash but I am having some fps drop sometimes when flying, but not a big deal, it dips from 120 to 60-70 fps, but goes right up after a few seconds.Pro:- good graphic, especially the explosion- mods are available in justcause3mods- new gear: wingsuit, you are practically flying with this gear- new weapons and vehicles, EMP cannon and bavarium tank are fun as hell- the mech and sky fortress DLC is a must- the rest are pretty much similar with JC2- the tethering mechanic is fun and improved, you can tether 2 things at the same thrice, though I was hoping I could tether 3-4 things at the same timeCons:- the challenges are repetitive- driving sucks, controller is recommended for the challenges- online connection, but there is a work around using firewall setting- not enough things to destroy- cant sprint, Rico is a destruction specialist, but he cant run, WTH??Recommend this when its on sale, get the dlcs too, it adds tons of fun with the game.

												Really enjoyable game. Despite all the bug reports from others my experience was that it rarely crashed and with the SSD loading times were acceptable.Played the crap outta this game and could not stop until the end. If you like explosions and open world this does it better than any.I will say the driving physics are too much on the arcade side for my tastes. I would have prefered that there was more depth and realism to the driving.I also don't like to have to create/login to other systems for stat tracking. I really don't give a crap if some kid just broke my record. Option to completely opt-out of stat tracking and non-steam login should be patched in.None of my complaints made the game any less fun to actually play though.			"

												The message from the devs alone that was released on the 2nd of December started out with ""We received some great review scores"". This translates itself to ""We feel justified in what we did and we've, like, you know, made the greatest gaem evurr and gamers should just shut up""- loading times are awful even on SSDs- for a quite large player base, the game is simply unplayable due to the inefficiency and bad optimization- story is rather short. About 4 hours (with cutscenes) when you leave out the ""chores"" of having to liberate a certain amount of provinces. Cutscenes are fun, the missions themselves are boring- way too many challenges that are the exact opposite of chaos. Better yet, for 100% completion you need to do most of the 112 infuriating challenges twice, because you need upgrades to reach 5 gears. Hurray for repetitionI'll give them kudos for a) the beautiful world, which is often quite accurately resembling a mediterranean environment and b) the fact that collectibles and destruction objects are completable this time. In Just Cause 2, the amount of collectibles and destructables in villages/bases was just far too ridiculous.All in all, another AAA title released in a very sorry state, even if this isn't affecting all users (but a large portion of them). What do we learn? Business ethics in the gaming industry are still plummeting and a great part of that goes out to us gamers who time and time again spent money on darn pre-orders or day #1 releases for no reason. To clarify, I was gifted this game free of charge by a very, very kind person.Edit: (Dec 17th)In conclusion, it's a fun game. I kind of like it, enjoyed most of it, as I did with Just Cause 2 (over 50 hours there) What some people don't seem to get is that I simply won't give a thumbs up for pure mediocrety. Yeah the game's ok. But it's downright mediocre. And the poor release state, the excruciatingly annoying DRM and the fact that I'm expected to pay some 75€ for the complete experience - if I were such a customer - doesn't make me want to recommend this game. I will never support mediocrety and give it a thumbs up. And honestly, the reason gamers have put up with mediocrety for so long and have given their thumbs up to anything that was broken, uninnovative but well-marketed is one of the key reasons most AAA publishers are just declining in quality, support and simultaneously expect customers to spend more and more money.I can see some people disagree with me, but they're as entitled to do that as much as I am entitled to express my non-recommendation at this price point and state of the game.Get it for 15€ / $20. Then it's a good deal and worth a recommendation. Also, most bugs will probably be gone then, so it's an even better deal.As an AAA title asking me to invest 75 bucks? Nope. No. Never.			"

												I wish I could post a review with neither a thumb up nor a thumb down, because while it's cool and looks good, I still have a lot of gripes. There are some MAJOR problems that need to be addressed, but if not for them the game would be excellent and probably have a much higher average review rating. Since my experience with the crashes and problems that other users have been complaining about have been fairly rare, I'll be rating it positively, but considering how frequent they are among the playerbase in general I almost feel bad for doing so. -Pros-The explosions please my idiot monkey brainSome parts of the environment, such as walls, now crumble when explodedThe new grapple/wingsuit etc mechanics are niceThe game is very pretty, especially underwater (as long as you don't look too closely at anything, it's pretty jarring in cutscenes to see every thread on Rico's shirt while the fence he's leaning against is blurry and pixelated)-Neutral-Car handling is different than in JC2, but arguably not for the better- cars aren't slippery TNT rockets made of paper mache any more, but they're also much slower and their turning feels somewhat unresponsive until you're suddenly pulling a hard turn that almost flips you (or just does)I'm conflicted on Rico's new design for some reason. The change in his facial appearance, attitude, and way he talks- even though not changed on any fundamental level- feel like they've gone and replaced the original with a lookalike halfway through the film and expect us to not notice. Nothing meaningful, it's just a slight nag at the back of my mind during cutscenes that I just can't shake.-Cons- (starting from arguably the worst) People have been complaining about explosions crashing the game. This doesn't happen to me- instead, it crashes my entire PC every 10th time I throw a grenade. Even if nothing else is going on at the time.I have 2 GTX980s in SLI and even I can't run this game on Ultra at a smooth 60fps. Have to turn most of the post-processing things (motion blur, depth of field, bokeh, SSAO, etc) off-- and all of them at once, not just one or the other-- in order to jump from ~40fps to ~120. That's... not good optimization. EDIT: The game apparently doesn't even support SLI, hence the unexpectedly poor performance.The Online features can make it take AGES for the game to load at the start, in ADDITION to the annoyingly long intro video every time you playThere seem to be cutscenes every five seconds (at least at the beginning), and the directors have apparently never heard of changing camera angles without a complete fade to black between shots followed by a loading screen once the cutscene is actually overThe auto-snap on the grapple line is... annoying. It gets in the way and makes you frequently grab things you don't mean to.You don't have very fine control over your movement, turning around and around in order to get a context action to show up (get in car, press button, etc) is more frequent than I'd prefer.For a game all about explosions, they don't give you anywhere NEAR enough room to carry explosives.I'll update this review as I play more & depending on how frequently the developer updates the game. Hopefully the devs fix the game-breaking problems quickly so I won't feel so bad about leaving a positive review.			"

SummaryJust Cause 3 has all the gadgets and exploding objects necessary to be a fun game, but it's been made into a frustrating experience. All of the fun stuff is hidden behind tens of hours of completing infuriating challenges and liberating repetitive military bases and villages.ReviewJust Cause 3 lacks any enjoyment during the first 50 hours of gameplay in my experience. It is not worth paying for such frustration, especially at full price. It took me 50 hours to lift the limitations placed on the player at the beginning of the game.At the start of the game, I wanted to try exploding things in new ways, particularly with the new tethers, but they were disappointingly underpowered. The only way to improve tether strength and to get more than two of them was to liberate an ungodly amount of land. Eventually I unlocked the frustrating tether challenges. That took many boring hours. Although I now have fully upgraded tethers, I do not have the ability to enjoy them.Another way Just Cause 3 stifles enjoyment is the fact that the player never has time to set up crazy destruction. The player will be killed by Di Ravello's army before they are able to successfully set up some elaborate, insane way to explode a statue using a car, tethers, and rocket powered C4. The number of potential ways to explode things are brilliant, but the number of opportunities to are not.What really destroys the game's fun are challenges. They are how all gear mods are unlocked, from rocket powered C4 to multiple tethers. Gears are awarded based on the player's score, from one gear to five gears. The player needs a pretty high average score (3-4 out of 5) to unlock all gear mods in any category, such as car modifications.What I first search for in every challenge is a way to complete it ASAP with a better vehicle or weapon, but that's not always possible. Fortunately, most challenges don't take too long. Unfortunately, there are some that seem impossible to score highly on, even with all weapons and vehicles unlocked. The wingsuit and destruction challenges are particularly infuriating. The former requires the player to fly perfectly through the center of several rings, without missing more than 1-3 (depending on the course length). The latter sometimes limits the player to weapons that are not suited to blowing s#!& up in 90 seconds, such as sniper rifles. Being somewhat of a perfectionist, attempting to unlock all gears felt like a waste of my life. That's a horrible feeling to have in any video game, and especially Just Cause.The final modifications that can be unlocked for vehicles are the elimination of their cooldown timers, which is essential to have much of the fun in the game. Even the beloved wingsuit, an incredible method of transportation, has much of its functionality hidden behind challenges. The story and its individual missions are negligibly short, so it's up to the player to make their own fun with whatever Rico has. Without all of Rico's enhanced gadgetry, liberating the islands is a grind.One instance when I was actually having fun was actively discouraged by the game, another time when the game annoyingly told me what I can play with and when. I was trying to liberate a base before disabling its bavarium nukes, and unsurprisingly it was taking a long time. I was enjoying getting constantly blown up by nukes while trying to fight an army and destroy their infrastructure. Suddenly I was spawned kilometers away, at the nearest base I liberated, rather than by the fun nuke time. I flew back a couple times only to get nuked and transported a few kilometers away. I was livid.By the time I could use all of my gadgets and weapons with as much freedom as the game would offer, I was already 50 hours in. By that time, I had enough Just Cause 3. I did not feel like spending more time in its world with only a handful of different types of things to blow up that are arranged in many different ways. Maybe one day I will come back to this game and play it the way it should be, doing crazy nonsense.I thank whoever reads this review and recommend them to play Just Cause 2 instead. It's much cheaper and has most of the same explosions and non-physics, plus it never made me frustrated. I could mess around all day there, without making any progress in the game.			"

												Pros,First off, the game is all of Michel Bay movies combined only with more explosions somehow. It has really fun guns and vehicles to blow up anything in your way! Second, mechanics are different and fun I could wing suit and grapple all day and not even do anything else. lastly, I have a GTX 970, 16GB of RAM, i5 3.4, with Windows 10 and the game runs maxed out with 60fps. (One thing I noticed is you have to have 16GB of RAM, if you do not the game is going to run terribly)Cons,First, like JC2 it has little to no campaign. (I wasn't expecting one) Second, The missions are repetative but they encourage you to take different approaches on taking over bases. Lastly, the game will dip in performace by going below 60fps if there are many explosions going on at the same time. (Which is most of the time)My opinion, 8/10The game is really fun with explosions, great vehicular combat, and interesting ways to travel the huge map. The down side is that it has no campaign, and the performace will dip every once in a while. Overall I give it a 8/10 just because it is a fun mindless game that no other game has done any better!

												Great game!! Blowing **** up never gets old. Alot of peopIe say it's laggy, but I think you can take care of this with spending some time on the things that are making you lag. I had 20 fps in the beginning, but with some tweaking I got it to 40-50 (water has big impact on fps). You DO need atleast 8gb of RAM, otherwise it will lag hard, and that isn't fun ofcourse.For me this is a game where I always will come back to. I play this a game a few hours per week, and I still enjoy it. If its discounted, you should buy it!(My PC = GeForce 750Ti, 16gb RAM and i5 processor)			"

												So I've seen a lot of problems with people complaining the game is stuttering and crashing. Now me and 15 of my friends bought this game and not a single one of us has yet to have any problems. Two of us got the stuttering, but that's because they had their settings too high (they have quite a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GPU) and once they changed those they had no problems either.If you try to max out your graphics with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GPU you shouldn't be complaining here and try some lower settings first!Now I heard some people who had good specs also got the stuttering and crashing and stuff. And you seem to see those a lot.My experience is that most reviews written are negative, since people can't really be bothered to write a positive review anymore because they're probably too busy playing this marvelous game. So there might seem to be a lot of these reviews, but that's just cause (pun intended) people mostly only write reviews when they have a complaint or are mad.Now if you have an AMD you should probably not buy the game yet, since it seems that activision hasn't done a lot of testing with these GPU's and the game is probably badly optimized because of it.What I'm trying to say is that the performance problems aren't nearly as big as they seem like. Yes a lot of people have problems and yes they should be helped out soon with a patch. But the game is just simply amazing and is certainly worth buying. I've been having a lot of fun with it so far and the possibilities are just endless. The game is simply too good to just not buy, because you are affraid you might have issues with it (unless you have AMD, than you should probably not buy it right now)Hope this review was helpfull for you :)			"

												I was looking forward to this game, not only for the game itself but because of the mod support they mentioned before launch.A month or so after launch and I am still very disappointed with the game for many reasons.It is optimised so bad. I'm running on a very good spec computer (see my profile for my full specs) and with lowered settings I average at about 50fps, but it's not consistent, it drops all the time or shoots up high which makes it really hard to play. Also putting on vsync (which is a must for me because of screen tear) causes the game to lock at a low fps if I dip under 60 which is really annoying.The game itself is just horrible to play. The car handling is awful and the physics system is completely broken, everything explodes for no reason and things will flip about and act completely unnaturally. If you tether two things together then pull them in they will flip into the air, and the effect is seemingly worsened if one car is on fire.The NPCs are useless. I don't even know how to describe how bad they are but just watch gameplay, you'll see what I mean.The voice acting I've experienced so far is not what I would expect from such a big title, it is very amateurish and doesn't sound like it's from a professional game, it's quite immersion breaking when the game itself looks so good.Load times are insane. I'm running the game on an SSD to try and speed it up, but it still takes ages to start for the first time and load into the level. It's really annoying that when I actually can be bothered to try and get my money out of the game and put up with all the problems it has to play for an hour or so, I have to sit in loading screens for ages to get there.Finally, there is no official mod support, at least that I've heard of, so I'm not sure what they were on about when they mentioned modding before launch. Were they just implying that they were making the files easy to crack into to modify? If that's the case then that isn't exactly official mod support, that's just making a game using common formats.Please fix this game, it has such potential but at the moment it's a mess. I would really not recommend buying until it's fixed, if it ever is.			"

												Terrible effort on the part of the developers to offer a quality port to the PC.  As always, the PC should undeniably offer a definitive version of a gaming experience, and as nearly always, we PC gamers are sorely let down.  This game should have offered SLI support and should  have been optimized to utilize the latest-generation hardware available from nVidia (the graphics processor company directly sponsoring featured tech in the game) but I suppose that's just too much for the lowly consumer to ask.  I requested a refund and was denied, even though I can count on one hand the number of hours I spent playing this game.  Absolutely farcical.  Don't buy until offered in a Steam Sale of epic proportions.			"

												As things stand, this game feels like a PC Port gone wrong. It's prone to memory leaks and crashing with no warning, even with a fairly beefy system. I love the game, but the fact that I can only play it for half an hour to an hour before it crashes, I cannot recommend this game. Not before these issues are fixed.And I do not understand how this game is supposed to be able to run on the Laptop i got it with, when it's suffering even on my main desktop.Update: Possible fix that somewhat stabilizes the game. was found by seatching a bit around. Go to the Just Cause 3 folder, and set the file to run on Compatibility Mode for Vista(Service Pack 2). Fixed most issues for me, even on my laptop. Still cannot recommend the game due the hoops I had to jump through to get it to work.			"

												I love the Just Cause franchise sooooo much!!! It’s a game series that I can jump in and mess around without any rules stopping me and Just Cause 3 adds that exact same feeling to the series that i and many others love. But with love there also comes hate unfortunately.*I’m only reviewing the base game*Pros:-I personally loved the main story -The wing suit made me fall in love with it-The level of detail in the views is amazing -The Infamous dual tether mod is a main aspect of the game -You can upgrade your abilities instead of having everything handed to you in the beginning -Collectables like vehicles and weapon mods give me a bonus when I’m just messing around and discover a collectable is nearby-After all the settlements and bases have been liberated you can redo the hardest 1's in a different tacticCons:-I had to discover quite a few optimization techniques to make my game run smoothly (even on a good pc)-The driving of cars and bikes on a smooth road get their handling from fast&furious Tokyo drift -The main story missed out a lot of background info that many would like to know about even after getting the tapes which don't fill in a complete picture-The collectables in just the base game are too few for only a few items-I managed to finish the story, collect the collectables do all the stunt jumps, find and add all vehicles in game to black market, finish all but 3 gear mod challenges in only 14hrs spread out in the course of 1 week which was at 98% completion.(I decided to restart the game to resume the carnage XD) I could never hate the Just Cause series like many others do (for unknown reasons). I will buy and play any and all games that have that beautiful name ""JUST CAUSE"" attached to it.....why you may ask? .........just cause.P.S*If any Dev from just cause series ever reads this review.....keep up the good work and......... Try implement a multiplayer for the future games*Thank you    "

												56 hours played and I still have to downvote it.I really wanted to upvote, but it's the Developers who just don't deserve it.The game is amazing and on my PC it ran smooth, but that's on my pc a high end one.I know allot of people have memory leak issue's and the Developers are not fixing it.Also I posted suggestions, i posted about 1 bug that means I can't get 2 achievements and no reponse from the Developers.I saw how they also didn't respond on Facebook to me and others, so it's these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Developers who don't deserve a thumb up unless they sit on it.Now i will tell you more about the game, cause the game like I said is amazing.You play as Rico a professional badass :PI played Just Cause 2 and it wasn't perfect then, but had allot of potential thats why I bought Just Cause 3 without any research like I usually do before buying a game. They really changed it up with a skill tree, but it's for the better.The more you play and do sidemissions you can unlock upgrades, at first I couldn't even use the Wingsuit I would just fly straight into the ground, the trick is so hold S and pull up and not tap it like I did.At a certain point you will learn to use your Wingsuit with your Reel weapon and Parachute and then you can travel of the entire map very quickly without using any cars, the cars btw most of them drive really bad it's emberassing. (specially since you theirs racing sidemissions for upgrades) - this is the only good driving car

			Rico Rodriguez is the best Formula 1 driver in the world and a professional badass. Here is some Just Cause 3 F1 Footage, the car is Mugello Farino Duo and you can easily unlock it on the 3rd Island...		

But I love using my Wingsuit now and you use the Reel to pull yourself forwards more and thus build up speed not crashing into the floor you can come very far with that method.Just like in the previous Just Cause 2 you can take over city's or have to take over city's from a General Badass.It's allot more diverse now and it's allot of fun.For it not to seem to be repetive I'd say you take over a few city's take over a Region and then do some of the sidemissions and then some missions. - here is my beeing creative destroying an enemy base.

The map is very big and it had 3 Island each get bigger and harder per Island.It should last you up to 50 hours finish the game doing about 100% which is allot of fun and worth the time.I wish the game had more area's for Stunt flighting theirs only like 3 small area's you can do that like this one.

			Jet Stunts in Just Cause 3 are hard their's not much intresting spots. This base in Maestrale is the best place to do some fun stunting. Also an easy way to get the Stunt Pilot feat score.		

Storyline is alright, so yeah I downvoted the game because the Devs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and don't deserve any money.But the game itself is amazing and runs smooth on a good pc, might not run smooth on a lesser pc.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, I really did. When purchasing this game I recalled fond memories of Just Cause 2 and the shenanigans I was able to cause, then, when I booted up this game it felt, wrong. The cars are barely driveable, the things that they advertised that allowed you to have fun and cause more chaos were locked behind an extremely repetative grind. That's another thing, this game is extremely repetative. The game has all of these features that should allow you to perform the missions in a fun and inventive manner, but it seems to punish you for doing it in any way that isn't the most direct as possible. It got to the point where I didn't want to rescue another town or blow up another military base, which is sad, because this game had so much potential.			"

												Just Cause 3, the third instalment of the Just Cause franchise. A game about blowing stuff up and wielding just about everything that could make you a bad♥♥♥♥♥ But is this game worth your time and money?The pros:A MASSIVE map.Grappling hook, Parachute and Wing Suit to help you traverse the map.Multiplayer mod that makes the game 10x better.Plenty of challenges to keep you occupied.A few Easter eggs.Multiple tethers to tie thing with – big plus.The cons:Poor handling for vehicles.Not as many vehicles as Just Cause 2.Random lag spikes – worst part about the game.Repetitive and mediocre storyline.Not many explorable insides of buildings.So is Just Cause 3 worth it? I think so. Overall it’s a better version of Just Cause 2 (which is always good) and there is plenty of creative things that you can do. There is also the multiplayer mod which makes the game waaay better and broadens the possibilities of thing to do even further. So I would recommend this game, but make sure to get the multiplayer mod. "

Basic InformationTitle: Just Cause 3Genres: Action & AdventureDeveloper: Avalanche Studios (Mac & Linux)Publishers: Square Enix (Mac & Linux)Release Date: The 1st of December, 2015General ImpressionJust Cause 3 is an amazing game with endless hours of fun, leaving you entertained after any length of play. The story is set in Medici, a fictional Mediterranean island where the main character, Rico Rodriguez was brought up. Rico left Medici due to a military coup and is back to save Medici from an evil dictator.  The game uses its amazing gameplay mechanics and awesome action to guide you through a long story which spans the whole map, letting you explore and enjoy the game’s massive open world map. The map represents the beautiful islands of the Mediterranean. The map consists of 3 regions, consisting of cliff side towns, vast open waters, vine fields, small tree filled islands, huge railways, mining outposts and huge mountains. The stunning scenery and vibrant colors gives Rico more of a personality because it shows the player where and how he was brought up, also giving Rico more of a reason to free Medici from its evil dictator. The story takes you through all the regions but it feels open ended, because of the amount of freedom you get. You lose track of the story and explore the open world yourself. But the story does try to keep you hooked to help you unlock special items and vehicles. The story is much better than the Just Cause 2 story because he has more of a purpose. But Just Cause 3 was never really about the story. It’s all about the destructive open world action and adventure. Just Cause 3 has still kept its amazing gameplay mechanics from Just Cause 3, improved on them and added new ones making the open world experience better than any other I have played. There is always new ways to destroy a certain military outpost and the amazing explosions become addicting. Just Cause 3 never gets boring because you can always find new ways to entertain yourself in the huge expansive map with challenges and competitive leader boards with friends, such as who can blow up the most objects in 10 seconds! The only issue with Just Cause 3 is that it lacks variety in its enemies, weapons, vehicles and bases. Destroying bases can sometimes become repetitive but the changes in scenery help to compensate for that. Only a few weapons, enemies and vehicles feel different from the others, but most weapons feel that same and fell like they have no purpose. However the DLCs compensate for this beautifully, the DLCs introduce new enemies, vehicles, weapons and bases with amazing diversity. The latest DLC the “Mech Land Assault Pack” add 3 mechs with freaking gravity guns where you can basically pick up anything with physics and throw it. Perfect for deforesting! Even though the DLCs cost £10 each they are worth it 100%. They will leave you with endless fun. Once you have finished the story you can re oppress military bases so you can attack them with your amazing mech! The game has a few performance issues and in some cases people can barely run the game but if you can bypass those issues it is a great game. The audio is nothing special and the music is nice. I especially like the weapon sounds and general sound effects. The user interface doesn’t obstruct the game but it isn’t anything special and there are a few things that I would change. Such as you can’t click escape to get out of the menus, instead you have to click “back” with your mouse. The graphics are great, that is if you can run the game at max settings. The textures look at bit washed out at lower settings, the water takes a massive hit when going form max to medium and in general the graphics could be better at lower settings but are not noticed when blowing up and tearing down military bases. The game engine, well let’s say, almost everything in the world is destructible and has great physics meaning you can flatten bases and rip apart vehicles with amazing explosion effects. Overall the game is absolutely stunning leaving your jaw dropped at all points in the game, the amazing gameplay keeps you wanting to come back and blow up everything again. It’s just more of the crazy and explosive sandbox game we love, but even better!Positive PointsHuge, expansive map with stunning sceneryAn engaging storyAmazing engine and physicsCrazy, fun and explosive gameplayUnbeatable game mechanicsGreat vehiclesLots of different types of environments and sceneryMinimal user interface, doesn’t obstruct gameplayControls are fine and easy to learnSteam achievements keep you hookedNeutral PointsThey should add a massive battle mode in free-play where the rebels fight against the dictator’s troops across the map such as seen in the storyNegative PointsThe DLCs are very expensiveSome bases become repetitive to liberatePerformance is not that good needs better optimizationGeneral Ratings Feature Rating Graphics 85/100 Atmosphere 90/100 Audio 76/100 Music 78/100 Gameplay 95/100 Story 82/100 DLC 93/100 Content Quality 79/100 Content Quantity 81/100 User Interface 76/100 Controls 75/100 Engines 91/100 Mechanics 98/100  Price Tag 75/100 Personal Rating 93/100 "

												I'm not gonna go on about performance issues (because I had extremely few of them) and I'm not gonna go on about precious elitist SLI support (because honestly, who really cares?). I am however gonna mention the extremely short main story and the serious lack of content in this game.I've played through the entire game and it's WAY too short. Why create a vast open world then have absolutely nothing in it but a few main quests? Just Cause 2 felt like it was 5 times bigger! There's absolutely nothing to do after you finish the main story line. Sure, I could do a about a hundred arbitrary repetitive challenges but where's the fun in that? They're all the same. I don't think it's too much to ask that a game like this would be filled to the brim with side quests or multiple story lines/factions like in JC2.I think I wasted my money to be honest. Unless there's a huge cheap DLC for this within the year, this review is not gonna change.			"

												Unfortunately the game for me runs poorly, my specs are above the recommended and G-force optimises my game to high settings, but FPS drops and stutters are persistent. You should wait until they release a patch or 2 before buying. Or you could take a chance and hope your system is one of the random setups that runs the game OK.  Can't recommend in its current state,  it's disappointing as Mad Max run and looked amazing, not sure how or why this went so wrong for a lot of us. If you have issues don't wait, get a refund as it may never get fixed (Batman anyone?) And rebuy at a later date, if they fix it.  Or Console is also an option if you really want to play.			"

												Over all a good open world game, when you play this type of game you can't expect too much, because it's simply too hard to surpirse you when you played more than 4 hours into the game, you cap the same objectives over and over, you do the same exact mission times after times. And in the end there's no end game, there's no fancy side missions that Skyrim had, there's no online mutiplayer PVP like GTA V. So I set my standard low, I said, if This game can entertain me for the beginning of the game, which it did, I'll give it a 4 out of 5.On the other hands, I don't know what the devs are thinking, there are few things that really♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.The Challenges are WAY too hard for average players like me, if I were to play this game towards a casual standard, I'd really want to unlock all the cool stuff, upgrades all the ability, but sadly the upgrade system is tied to the challenge system, yes, you heard it right, usually it's all about lvl up, but the Devs really want's you to spend time on this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game and then practice then git gud. The DLC is poorly designed, Spoiler*: All it takes to finish off a mission, is use couples of nuke to clear out all the objective. Eventually it spams boring all over itself. OH, btw, the new wingsuit and the altitude system f**ked each other up, it cause the challenge for the new DLC in sky fortress constantly ends up with a s**t show.The selection of transport is HUGE, that's a thumb up, but the Weapon selection is poorly TINY. you only have one LMG to use and the third sniper rifle requires you to buy a $2.50 extra DLC for it.Alllllllmost forgot, I need to mention the Home-in missle for the jet doesn't work on PC, and this bug directly related to one of the main mission. One year from the game originally released, they still didn't fix it. Those devs just took the money and move on.Ubisoft sucks on networks, but at least they patches things, and that's why they are doing fairly decent nowaday.so yea, over all a good game but I still don't recommend it.

												Just Cause 2 set an impossibly high bar; I remember back in high school, talking with friends about how years from now, Just Cause 3 would be, like, the most fantastic game in existence if it ever happened. Imagine JC2 with even better hardware, and physics, and detail! Who'd ever need another game at that point?Alas, it wasn't to be. This isn't terrible, by any means, but I'm just kinda shocked I can't really recommend it. The gigantic map full of towns, cities, gas stations, and other such destructible things is now replaced with one that has lush, gorgeous greenery and beautiful coastlines... and huge empty spaces full of nothing. There's much, much less to destroy, which in a game expressly about destroying, is pretty damn sucky.The game's new additions are primarily locked behind boring, padding challenges that are best played by immediately ignoring their rules somehow. For instance, a challenge that sees you destroying an enemy harbor with a boat is most easily solved by setting up a ton of tethers and explosives, setting them all off at once, and, uh... never getting in or near the boat. Some of these are pretty fun, like the wingsuit challenges, but making them more mandatory than JC2's mostly decorative challenges made them far less enjoyable. It feels like busywork.The physics are phenomenal. This game is a magnificent tech demo. No pre-rendered destruction like before; every little piece crumbles apart. Water towers no longer simply burst in a convenient shower that masks the tower having its model replaced with a broken version, but now can be wrecked from any angle, including prying apart the individual supports until it topples to the ground. This level of detail is absolutely magnificent and I highly appreciate it. However, it feels like the game map is made so much more barren to compensate for this. When you're on a roll bringing down a base, you'll feel like an absolute badass like you should, and it takes skill and finesse now to pick everything apart during a firefight. Handily, those little extra pieces towards the end that are hard to find now get marked on your map.But despite so much of this feeling right, it feels like... I dunno. It feels like a tiny fraction of what Just Cause 2 was. Like it's not done. I have none of the DLC and that's really felt. You really aren't just, like, a tiny superhero in a massive playground of destruction. You're forced through a long degree of story missions, despite much of my praise for JC2 being, well, not bothering with that crap. Most of the game is story instead of sandbox, structured missions instead of whatever you want to do, exact sets of collectibles instead of general boosts. It's a game design step in the complete wrong direction from its magnificent predecessor.(And this is personal opinion, but I find the game's constant, agonizing insistence of Rico being a beloved hero that does no wrong ever to tug on my suspension of disbelief way, way harder than just accepting that blowing everything up is okay normally. You're telling me that the base I just nuked from orbit, wiping out an entire mountain, was only staffed with evil military dudes, AND there's a convenient repair crew that'll undo all the damage I cause, AND the police station I am very clearly walking into with a rocket launcher and killing everyone in is conveniently replaced by armed men expressly chosen by the general I'm up against, AND I can intentionally run people down on the street and nobody will even care... I have a much easier time believing Gamera is a friend to all children and nobody in Townsville dies.)I mean, there's a hell of a lot that's a positive about this game, but it's just structured badly and takes itself far too seriously, when its predecessor had neither issue. I would almost recommend it just to kill an afternoon or two, but the most damning thing here is that when I finish a game I enjoy, I tend to replay it again and again. I finished Just Cause 3 several months ago. I have not booted it up at all since. It's just not worth the time. Just Cause 3 had an impossibly high bar to live up to, and apparently it really was impossible, because it's this good and still just not good enough.			"

												..Get the settings right for your machine and follow the optimization guides properly, cross your fingers and hope for good fortune...and if you find that sweet spot....this will be one of the very best games in your collection.....The biggest and best free world action game there is..10 times bigger enviroment than GTA V, more destructibles than all the Battlefield games, more seamless action than Fallout and bigger explosions and with more chaos than all these games put together.....and I havent even mentioned the game mechanics yet which are superb...the run and gun style performs perfectly, the AI is smart enough to be a challenge, missions are varied and work well but its the sense of freedom in this game that set it apart from most free roam games.. from the beginning, the whole world is open to you and you won't break the story or disrupt the flow by exploring the whole place first.....What makes this huge and varied world so thrilling to explore..? What allows you to cause such destruction and escape unscathed like some Quentin Tarantino style superhero..?!! The grappling hook and wingsuit setup..!! It is absolute genius and works wonderfully well, incredibly fun and rewarding and it is worth the price tag alone.... you will want this combo in every other action game you play... to offset this tho is the driving mechanic which is weird to say the least.. this is not a driving sim but trust me, you wont wanna be stuck on the ground anyways....JC3 is currently on sale at 75% off...try this game..!! if you get it optimised in the 2 hours trial period you'll never look back...if not you can always get a refund....but you will always miss that grappling hook..))..One of the very best games in my collection.. 9/10....i7 6700k,GTX 1070, Gigabyte Z170x Gaming MB, 16gb DDR4, Windows 10....Ultra settings @70-90fps...

My PC has AMD 1100T x6 processor and 280X AMD GPU. I realized game runs smoother at higher res. 1920x1080 is more choppier compared to 2530x1440. GPU usage is like 55% and some places it goes up to 60% and all 6 cores are not used 100%. First core runs at 35 to 65% and sometimes all cores are at 65 to 70%. I have finished 65% of the game but really a nice game messed up big time thanks to poor optimization and poor car handling.			"

												In its current state, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to most players. Do allows me to outline my issues in a nice list below:      Major Issues:              Garbage Performance -- I, like many others have had absolutely atrocious performance in this game. To clarify, I do not have an AMD processor or graphics card and have been able to run JC 2, Minecraft, CS:GO, and Far Cry 4 on full settings without any lag excluding minor and infrequent occurences. On lowest performance this game will launch and can run, however, FPS is always pretty damn low, fuel tank explosions almost stop the game from working, and sometimes certain towns and bases give random unexplained lag in addition to the random crashes and unstable exiting of game              Repetition and tedious chores -- The repetition of towns and whatnot was a major issue in JC 2, something we all thought would be addressed in ""3."" While this game has more variety and beauty, it is hard to enjoy with the combined lag and I am forced to complete almost the same exact missions for Dimah to disable these ♥♥♥♥ing FOWs. After the first few missions on Insula Dracon the game becomes completely repetitive. Not to mention we are forced to complete missions to get certain equipment.                    Soldiers and AI: The AI is absolutely atrocious seeing as though it will drive flaming vehicles, think it can drive a tank on a cliff, and fly a heli with a minigun directly in front of a heli with missiles. The AI is absurdly bad at finding Rico and doesn't really do much but pat people down and stand around staring at Rico. The soldiers do eventually become absurd and prevent the player from really doing much with the resources they are given.      Pros of the game:              New weapons and tools: The tether, wingsuit, and variety of guns and vehicles are immensely helpful and more interesting than JC2              Potential in story: The story has a huge potential, include the Bavarium nonsense, but I still feel that it was relatively unexplored and made to be highly cookie cutter and repetitive. Something interesting could have been done with the story, but instead the devs oped for the typical ""we cannot let most glorious resource into bad hands, must kill bad guy and destroy. ALL YOUR BAVARIUM ARE BELONG TO US, SO WE CAN DESTROY AND HELP HUMANITY!"" Nevermind the potential benefits of such a material.               Destruction potential: With this game, we are given the tools to do absolutely amazing things and to have great fun. Unfortunately, the cons that I outlined above make this very difficult.             Better AI than JC2: Although sub-par, the AI in this game makes an effort to call reinforcements and is reasonable. In JC 2 killing any enemy or shooting anywhere got heat. Here, if you kill all enemies and prevent reinforcements calls, nobody comes and heat disappears. It is also apparent that I can shoot on a mountain now and not have the enemy airforce deciding that random trees are in need of protection.  The game appears, at first glance to be open and expansive, and it appears that the player can destroy anything, but it quickly becomes clear the player can only destroy certain bridges and chaos items. Only new items to be destroyed are fluorescent lights, speakers, billboards, and bridges. That being said, I appreciate the hard work of people at square enix, this game is a blast when it runs correctly. That being said, the performance and obvious shortcomings of the game must be addressed eventually. It performance alone were fixed, I would give a positive review, but the other minor issues combined with performance make this experience far less enjoyable than it should be. Still, I have faith that the dev team will attempt to solve many current problems and perhaps issue some updates addressing lag and perhaps adding more towns, items, destruction, and maybe even multiplayer.EDIT: I need to make note of several things: Military bases make no ♥♥♥♥ing sense. Surely each base should have some radar system for early warning, but bases have random stuff and aren't specialized. There are no giant radar arrays, or fuel refineries, or naval bases, or even major airfields, just bases with a random AM antenna and three identical doppler radars so close to eachother that they wouldn't benefit whatsoever. In addition, it still makes no sense that random distillation towers and fuel tanks are just sitting in military bases -- nothing is specialized, just random stuff. This game also seems to lack the ability to properly handle the objects it creates as RAM usage shoots up through continued gameplay. If I wanted stuttering and slow response times I would have turned on the presidential debates.			"

												Game is a blast to play, when you can play it.Almost 6 months past release and it still runs like trash. It also causes my PC to give me boot errors any day after I play it.  MSG:V and GTAV ran smooth as silk out of the gate for me, what is the problem here?If they manage to fix it, it may be my favorite game of all time. But in it's current state, using the wingsuit makes me want to throw my PC when it starts hitching.			"

												Bullets and missiles whiz past my head as I speed through the night sky, surfing on a plane. The artillery of a whole nation seems to be focused on my annihilation, while I fire rocket after rocket at the ground below. The deafening roar of the engines and the air-sucking booms of coutless explosions are my soundtrack. If this was a film, it would be the movie’s climax, when the hero does the impossible. In Just Cause 3, Avalanche’s latest destruction-obsessed action romp, it’s the opening scene.  For Rico Rodriguez, the game’s handsome, bearded protagonist – a professional racer turned tyrant-toppler – it’s just another day at work. He blows up military bases for breakfast, and for lunch, he tears down bridges while the army of an evil dictator – moustachioed cartoon villain Di Ravello – drives across. He’s a one man army, a superhero in jeans, and he’s done this all before. But this time, the explosions are bigger, the toys are more varied, and everything has just become a little bit more ridiculous. I don’t call Rico a superhero lightly. Avalanche’s third destruction sandbox is as much a superhero game as Rocksteady’s Arkham series, at least when it comes to the action. Our leading man can take down entire armies, fly across islands, and even survive the explosion of a grenade. Once, while minding my own business, gliding across a mountain range, I was hit by a missile. I got back up again and stole a helicopter, which I then dropped on top of a tank. I’d like to see Batman attempt that.With Just Cause 3, the writers have leaned directly into its b-movie comparisons. The story is a simple one, and is led by a host of zany, off the wall characters. Mario comedically  brings about numerous terrible ideasand spearheads one of the funnier missions in the game. Di Ravello is a compelling, but also by the books dictator. He hates everyone but himself, kills innocents, etc. For the most part, any type of cutscene in Just Cause 3 is forgettable. But I don’t think anyone is expecting a philosophical masterpiece from a game that begins with its main character hanging upside down from a helicopter.While little may have been expected of the story, it would be nice if the game built its story missions around using the strengths of the game. Missions often call for you to use your parachute/wingsuit combination in a variety of ways , but as the game went on, I found myself tiring of being forced to perform certain objectives. It felt as if I could do them by myself, without the help of the story, so there was no real reason to interact with them. The story feels like an afterthought to some of the more exciting stuff than can be found within Just Cause 3’s world.Possibly the largest thing you will spend your time doing in Just Cause 3 is liberating the many cities of Medici. These areas of interest will typically contain a list of things that must be destroyed or taken over, such as a generator, billboard, radio tower, or police station. Though numerous, watching them explode is never tiring. It’s clear Avalanche Studios wants Just Cause 3 to be the kind of game you can sit down and have mindless fun with and these cities are good examples of just that. There were numerous times where I would get in the rhythm of taking over Medici and completely lost track of time. It’s just a great way to have fun watching all sorts of things explode into flames.When you are not freeing the people of Medici, you will be probably be taking part in some of the many challenges strewn throughout the open world. These challenges are very reminiscent  to other open-world games and consist of car races, wing suit challenges, and the popular “blow everything up around you” objectives. For the most part, these side challenges are just another way to kill some time and relax. They never become too difficult or complex, they simply exist as a way to focus the player on one of Just Cause 3’s mechanics. These missions can be easily overlooked if you want, but they do provide mods that can be helpful at times.Just Cause 3’s new modification system adds some excitement to some areas of the game, while doing very little for others. As you earn more modifications for your grenades, you can have them explode on contact, or explode only when they connect with a certain object,be that an enemy, destructible object, etc.. The game also hides the ability to zoom in with weapons behind these modifications, but it is earned rather early on. While the mods available can provide some thrills, it does feel like there is some unexplored potential within the system.The controls are basically fine. I didn’t have any particular issues playing through on mouse and keyboard once I got used to the way everything worked, with the exception that vehicles (planes and the wingsuit, in particular) are a bit finicky on the keyboard because they really demand analogue controls. You might get a bit confused by the number of keys you need when swooping around – right-click to grapple, Space to open/close parachute, Shift to accelerate your grapple, CTRL to disconnect your grapple, E to activate your wingsuit – but I suspect that’d happen on a gamepad anyway, and I got used to it pretty fast.The graphics and physics of this game are what gives form to the carnage that Rico unleashes upon his enemies, and they are impressive. At max settings the PC version is stunning, with an enormous draw distance and incredible detail at distances both close and afar. The physics engine is remarkably stable too, considering the shenanigans that you can instigate with the grappling hook and tethers. It also allows for some amazing destructibility, although when things get too crazy, the frame rate can take a dive as a consequence.The game had network problems at various points in the time I was playing it. While an online connection is not required, you will always be logged in to Square Enix’s servers at startup. When the connection is lost to these servers, the game comes to a crashing halt for 30 seconds as it tries to reconnect, regardless of whatever it is that you were in the middle of doing. Also the game has horrendous load times. Just Cause 3 has the worse load times of any game in years. Gunplay in the Just Cause series has never been anything to brag about. That continues with Just Cause 3 as you never feel totally in  control when using a weapon.As for the actual gun selection, your options are varied. You can obtain all sorts of assault rifles as well as side arms. You constantly roll with a special weapon, which can range from your standard RPG to a gun that calls in airstrikes on whatever location you point it to. The variation in weapon sets makes destroying the many statues satellite dishes immensely satisfying.When you’re not waiting for it to load, Just Cause 3 is an incredibly fun game. Crisp visuals and a clever soundtrack bring all the explosions to life. Even with the violence and destruction, it manages to maintain a lighter tone than the Far Cry games, without sliding into the outright silliness of Saints Row. But, it’s still silly enough. Dropping boats on satellite dishes, tying enemy soldiers to exploding gas tanks, and grappling, wingsuiting, and parachuting the length and breadth of beautiful Medici, just to blow the crap out of it. Just Cause 3 is an absolute blast.			"

												Starting to get VERY fed up with devs releasing unfinished games. The game itself is brilliant, it just runs like a pig. I don't have a high spec system, but I can run SW: Battlefront on High at a solid 60fps. This turd is so unoptimised and poorly coded that it ran at 60fps on high last night, then tonight it ran ok but crashed. After restarting it cant even reach 20fps with the same settings. Even with everything on low or off it's still EXACTLY the same frame rate.The lip snch goes out on every single cut scene, then catches up, then goes again.The frame rate goes from 60 to 20 randomly for no reason, but during massive explosions and shed loads of chaos on screen, it mostly copes fine. I'd expect with this amount of stuff going on it will drop of a few frames when things hot up, but it doesn't do too badly. It just randomly slows down with no obvious reason.So dissapointed as it seems like a really good game.Just cannot recommend it until they've fixed it. But then I thought that about Arkham Knight...Just to clarify on a few points - My system exceeds the minimum specs. Why would I complain about a game that runs badly if I dont meet the minimum specs.....? As I said, I changed everything to the lowest settings and it still ran the same, whereas the day of release it was on high and ran fine.I do know whats involved with coding a game. What I also understand is that money men get int he way of deveopment and demand the game is released before its been fully bug tested. It happens all the time. A few games are managed really well and make it out the door brilliantly - SW: Battlefront being the best example I've ever seen. And no, I wouldn't say JC3 is any more demanding specs wise than Battlefront. Yes, JC3 has more explosions and is a tiny bit more CPU intensive, but have you seen Battlefront on high settings? It's flippin beautiful. But more importantly, this is a AAA game made by experienced devs a good few years into a console's life, and with previous PC experience, I expected more.As for the running like a pig similie - i'd look up the word first if I were you. It's a figure of speech. And yes pigs do run quite quick, but when did you last see them running consistently for a long period? Hence the fairly accurate simile....Also I never said it was easy to make video games. But DICE managed it without lousy code with Battlefront. Yes lots of games are released these days with game breaking bugs - I still cant play Fallout 4 in my native resolution due to a bug and Arkham Knight still isnt fixed. But this will keep happening if we all just keep accepting it and saying, ""Oh well, it'll be fixed at some point I suppose...""I did also say that the game itself seemed great. If they do fix all the bugs quickly I'd recommend the game wholeheartedly - I'm really enjoying what I can play of it.And lastly - no game should be released with this many bugs. Yes I understand that many arent having problems - but many are and it seems to be the code at fault - not many complaints can be put down to rigs not meeting minimumspec/driver updates etc.			"

												Just Cause 3 is great if you love Bollywood style action, a lot of freedom, and the ability to be creative with your explosions. I've sunk a lot of time into this game, roughly about 20 hours by my estimate (it's all been offline, more about that later) and I always find myself starting this game with another idea for something stupid to try. Like take a boat down a mountain and feel like you're in cool runnings, or try and build a catapult using the tether and some cars. The game is fun to explore, the movement system feels great, especially the wingsuit. The game is massive, and scaled appropriately to how fast you're going to be travelling most of the time. You could argue that the world is a little empty compared to some other modern sandboxes, but I think 'Spread out' is a better term. There's a lot to see in Just Cause 3, and if you find yourself driving a car at 200 km/h in a random direction, you're not ever going to have to backpedal to find something to do when you inevitably crash. The game is spread out in a way that you're constantly going ""ooh what's that on the horizon?""Performance-wise, I have trouble with v-sync only. Everything else runs like a dream, and that's with a GTX 960. I get almost constant 60fps, with the occasional stutter, though it's very rare. I'm always suprised at how well the engine deals with having hundreds of physics objects hurtling around at once.The story is there. It's funny in places, with some cool scripted missions. But all of the scripted missions do have the option to put your own flair onto them, nothing is set in stone. You need to blow something up? How you do it is generally up to you.The side missions are sometimes dull, sometimes excellent. The flying and boating eventually get very samey. Especially since you're always in one of the small selection of planes/boats that appear in the game. The frenzy missions are complete garbage however. You basically get 90 seconds to run around with the game's weapon of choice, and blow up parts of an enemy base (generally one you just finished blowing up.) There are never any enemies in this mode, and it's often boring. The difficulty scale is all wrong, some involve a sniper rifle trying to shoot down radio towers, and another might be destroying fuel tanks with a helicopter equipped with missiles. It's just a dumbed-down version of what you just did, except a lot less exciting. This game mode could have easily been fixed if it had been about killing enemies however. Generally in the main game you're not spending most of your time fighting bad guys, you're picking off a few that are in your way and then you're getting away speedily. But having frenzy be about fighting waves of bad guys with a specific weapon would be a lot more fun IMHO. It would make you try out more weapons rather than just going for the biggest kaboom. Plus it would be a good reason to fight the varied array of types of enemies in the game. rather than just whizzing past them on the way to the nearest generator.The wingsuit missions brilliant are on the other hand, often showing off some of the most beautiful parts of the game while you get to really hone your wingsuit skills. (This will come naturally, by the time you're an hour in you'll be using the wingsuit a lot!) And the Speed missions where you drive an exploding car towards a group of soldiers then bail out before it explodes are a more fun version of the driving missions. Which aren't races for some reason, just a time trial.The always online aspect is annoying, I would recommend starting Steam in offline mode to play this since there doesn't seem to be an option to switch it off. If you play online it WILL get in the way of you playing the game.Overall, the game is lacking in some respects. There aren't enough types of vehicles, or weapons, or missions. No submarines or scuba gear ( that I've found) despite a beautiful ocean just screaming to be explored. No multiplayer, which was one of the best additions to JC2 although it was a mod. And I can't help but feel like this is all being held back for future DLC.My conclusion: Just Cause 3 is fun, a lot of fun. The game feels great and looks great. If you enjoy making up your own challenges, having a beautiful world to explore and watching things explode and fly around, then this game is for you. I love it to bits, and I can play for hours on end and always have some other insane thing I want to attempt right before I switch off.But do I think you should buy it?Yes.But in a year's time. Wait for the DLC, see if the game is more full of content, see if they add multiplayer. See if they manage to optimise it a bit better! Next Christmas you'll pick up the full game much cheaper then you will now, and you'll have a blast with it. But right now, there's a bit too much missing content for me to recommend it for the price. If you can stand waiting, then by all means do.			"

												I have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ system (GTX680, I5 2500 K 3.30 GHZ, 8GB RAM). After reading through all the comments I expected that the game would run very slow - or not at all - on my PC. Now that the game is on sale I thought I would give it a try ....and it runs great, I am VERY suprised that my old system can display this gorgeous amount of detail...especially when something is blown up. And the game is so much fun! I saw a lot of people comparing it to GTA. Imo you can't really compare these titles apart from the fact that you can drive all sorts of vehicles in a open world, becauseGTA offers:A great story, great characters, awesome drama A VERY detailed and unique map, not a single spot seems to be looking the sameDecent driving physics, beautiful car modelsJust Cause 3 offers:Explosions, detonations, flames, people flying up into the sky all around you. THIS is madness. A huge world to explore...with always repeating patterns of tasks, buildings and landscapes (which can partially be nice if you just want to relax). The story will probably make you smile from time to time, but don't expect more.In case anyone else want to try this: I simply turned down the water and shadow quality to low, turned off motion blur, and changed the resolution from the (for my system) recommended 1280x780 up to 1920x1080. Then I started the game - and the quality of the effects left me speechless in front of my screen. Okay, if you would excuse me now please...just one more explosion. Just one more.			"

												Let's face it: the game is horribily HORRIBLY optimized. Even with my quite good build, I hemorrhage ram like crazy unless I turn everything down. As of right now it wont even SLI correctally. So basically, I play on low-medium settings so that I don't experience framerate issues, but even then I get sometimes some drops, and whats the fun in having a HIGH end computer to play a game (you havto pay moneys for) to play on medium.....Anyways:Pros1) The game, even if I play on low settings, looks good. It's colorful, bright, smooth, and the explosions are incredibly enjoyable2) The sounds are ok, and the voice actors are really funny and well done.3) I liked the music, even though they are quiet and you don't really hear them.4) The gameplay is fun and addictive. I love the wingsuit, I enjoy moving through the mountains with my gears, the shooting is fun. Though I had to remap a bit my controls because I wanted it to feel like Just Cause 2, it plays well, and it is fun.5) The explosions and the grappling hook... Nothing else to say, it's just well done. The game become somewhat a physics-based game with the ability to use your grappling.6) Huge map, a lot of places to blow up.7) The leaderboard thigie is neat (i dont care if im not as good as my friends)Cons1) You won't give a crap about the story/missions, as for Just Cause 2.2) The map is too big. Yes, I said it was a pro, but my main problem is when you try to go from an island to the other. If you don't have a jet, it'll take forever to crosse the water.3) I still don't get how the chaos work for this episode - might change this point once I figure it out.4) As stated above,5) the optimization,6) IS7) ABSOLUTLY8) POSITIVELY9) HORRRRRRIIIIIIIDDDDD10) Having to log into Square Enix servers for everything, so if their down the game props you every few minutes, or every time you open the map11) Initial Load times, the main menu--game start is dreadful, and yes i've heard of the SSD vs HDD12) Gets repetitive quicklyConclusionOverall, this game is a fun experience, if you like blowing things up and killing people like there is no tomorrow (which is my case so...). If you want deep story, dark intrigue, multiplayer mode or realistic gunfight, just ignore this game. I think that if you liked Just Cause 2, you'll like this one too. It's no where near perfect, it surely isn't as good as JC2, but it's fun, and it gives you explosion, so it's nice.			"

												Ah Just Cause 3, a good game? A bad game? A fun game? A boring game?...  If these were statements instead of questions they'd all be true of JC3. This is a game of systems and mechanics and what is there works great, however I think sadly there isn't enough mechanics to keep the game interesting all of the time.A typical play session of JC3 would be travel some where and blow everything up, then rinse and repeat. It doesn't matter why you're there and the context of your destruction, that is what it boils down to, explosions. Now nearly every game ever made could be described in such over simplified terms and I know that, but what JC3 fails to do is disguise this fact in a way that you don't realise that is all your doing.Now don't get me wrong, how you go about exploding everything around you is immense fun. Grenades, rockets, grenade launchers, high jacking Tanks, combat Helicopters, fighter jets, using grappling hooks to pull down structures, topple fuel tanks etc etc...  it goes on and on and it also looks really good too, the explosions in particular are something to behold. They have made this a spectacle and it is awesome to see, at least for a while.Like with any spectacle, it has a shelf life, you can't watch fireworks for 30 hours straight and not get bored, but in small bursts here and there... fireworks are great! That pretty much sums up the game for me, good in small bursts but it does get tired quickly over an extended play period.Does this make it a bad game? Not in my book, but it does make it a shallow game and sadly an imperfect experience. Difficulty isn't high (which I am fine with by the way) so the challenge will come from destroying things in the most spectacular way or efficient way you can think of.The story missions are ok and the final boss is an expected anti climax, but there is a narrative if you're interested. There is loads to do, upgrades to unlock, challenge missions that test your skills and collectables, you aren't short of content but like me you might find yourself asking if you *want* to do it all...  as I said,  you'll be more or less doing the game thing over and over again in a very noticeable way which at times felt like a chore.It is what it is, it never advertised itself as anything other than a fun explosive romp, so no complaints that it delivered on it's promise, but whether that will be enough for you or not, will boil down to own personal tastes.

												So much potential!Starting with the good, the game is gorgeous. The default keybindings are different, but in the end make for better gameplay. The story is also much better than the second game; no more factions that were identical in feel. A lot of the story missions are very cool. The addition of the wingsuit is a nice idea, but not useful for combat purposes. (I only mention this because it's very easy to accidentally engage the wingsuit during a fight because it's the same hotkey as ""Use"". Nothing like slamming your face into a helicopter instead of commandeering it.) The addition of the contracting grapple tethers is awesome, and is the only marked improvement over the second game unless you're a graphics snob.Now for the bad. If you like the second game, there's not enough to see here. The game is not optimized for PC at all. I spent 20 minutes dialing back my settings because after playing for 2-5 minutes, the memory leak causes the framerate to drop down to 1-5 frames per second. (Think Batman: Arkham Knight)Also, it's ironic that the enemy forces are named the DRM, because the game requires a constant internet connection. Even if you disable the Leaderboard nonsense, the game will lock up and give you a reconnection screen in the middle of your activity. (Keep in mind, this is a single-player game.) I even firewalled the game, which kept it from bothering me, but after a week, the game required me to be able to connect to the internet in order to launch.The game has 1/4 as much content as the second game in every way. Meaning, you will complete it in a quarter of the time that it took to play the second game. But it goes beyond that. As you fly over a road, there is rarely a car travelling down it, there are a quarter as many bases or interesting sites to discover. The landscape feels barren. It's a sprawling, gorgeous, Italian-like landscape, and yet there's very little to do in it. The second game had awesome discoveries like the giant satellite dish, the ski lodge, the huge urban city full of skyscrapers. This game has no surprises. The landscape has different climates, but the locales are uninspired, and rotate between 5 different types. The climax of the second one was so epic, with a huge showdown. The ending fight of #3 felt like it came out of a game 15 years old, and had very little going on at all.I wanted to like it, and I had fun playing it, but I'm feeling cheated. When you're liberating the populace, it's a blast, but then you fly over 2 minutes (miles and miles) of empty land to find something else to do. Such a shame. Did they want me to pump money into the DLC packs to have a complete experience?			"

												The game is quite frankly un-optimized, Having brought this game on release I think it's safe to say they will never fix this broken jutery mess. Frequent stutering and frame rates that spike down to as low as 10fps makes this game unplayable. I'm sure the game would be fantastic otherwise though a from waht ive managed to play it seemed ambitious!. If you have the perfect combonation of hardware for this game then give it a go. But if your one of the many that has a medium based machine, ie not a gtx 980 16gb of ram and a skylake core i7 then just forget it.			"

GTX 970 and i7 3770k not enough to keep a consistent framerate.If you're unsure about your PC handling this game, keep your money til they fix it.Even with the most recent drivers, the performance is rough.That aside,the game is a lot of fun. The parachute, grapple hook, and wingsuit are incredible. The driving is much better than Just Cause 2, aside from the awful camera. The gunplay is fun, but I don't find myself using it much with tethering people to buildings and other objects being sadistic fun (muahaha).For whatever reason, they removed being able to sprint, and there is no minimap nor health bar. Not sure why these were not included, as they are basic functions of similar games, but oh well.			"

												What the ♥♥♥♥ is this?  I have to disable steam overlay, go into offline mode, start EXE as admin even though my account has admin privileges, disable vert sync ingame because it locks at 30fps, enable vsync in control panel as well as triple buffering, and THEN I get stable game performance, if you could call it that.  The first town you liberate was a♥♥♥♥♥♥show, the planes on which the smoke is generated became solid at certain angles, so I couldn't even see below the roof I was standing on.  Considering how buttery JC2 runs, this is really unacceptable.  Almost wish I had paid full price from steam instead of 50% off from♥♥♥♥♥so I could get a refund.Even with motion blur and faded edges turned off, when you look at Rico's textures as he moves it's a blurry mess.  It looks like more than one Rico is being rendered and they're all overlaying.  Vehicles even 100ft away, while in motion, look like there are 100 of them copy/pasted on top of eachother.  I dont' know if the engine has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ native AA so they tried this weird blurring technique to remedy it, but it looks like a ♥♥♥♥ing BETA build in this state.  A really really polished BETA build.Don't buy it yet.  Wait for people with Minimum listed requirements to have a decent plug and play experience before you drop the money.Also, no SLI support, which is a huge slap in the face [yet again, thanks 2015] to consumers who opted to purchase 2 cards, is also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t since their last 2 engines had fantastic scaling.This year is the year I purchased the most preorders after GTA released so beautifully.  Never again, I don't care how many pip boys it comes with.EDIT 1:  Here is a video upload showing what I mean by ""planes on which the smoke is generated"" being solid:  


YouTube™ Video: Just Cause 3 PC Graphics Glitching 

			Views: 436		

			These are the issues I'm having with Just Cause 3 with Day One functionality. -AMD FX-8350 -Nvidia GTX 770 4GB Gigabyte Windforce -Nvidia GTX 770 4GB EVGA [idle, SLI not supported on another TWIMTBP...		

You can also see, as Rico takes the chopper, what I mean by the textures looking all weird and blurry while in motion.  Never finished JC2, probably go back to finishing that, hoping a patch comes out in a day or two.EDIT 2:  First of the new year, and they have yet to release a patch addressing any issues other than stability ones, which considering the types of CTD issues the first patch addressed it's arguable they should have been fixed BEFORE release.  Alas, nothing done to fix the nauseating FOV, which I've found a fix for here on the forums.  I believe user named Derp created it, haven't been notified for ""hacking"" since the program works like a hack, intercepting game data while it's in RAM.  Game is absolutely awesome with the FOV scaled from a verticle 35 [how the ♥♥♥♥ can anyone stand that???] to 55-64 degrees.  I can finally see vistas in a wider format, I can see the helicopter 10 feet above my head as well as the 3 dudes standing to my left right and slightly behind me, and when I parachute into a base there isn't a tower guard 5 feet out of view sniping me to death, because I can see the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.I still will have to restart the game in the middle of overthrowing a town because of the weird visual ♥♥♥♥ups like in the video I posted above weeks ago, but I've only had to do that maybe 5 times in the 40hrs I've apparently played this game [I spend a lot of tiem staring at the pretty].So, as it stands?  Get it on sale at green man gaming and apply the FOV fix.  For $30, I'd say it's just barely worth it, as it does become monotonous and finding out the only reason my skills haven't leveled up is because I haven't played minigames and devs refusing to add sprint to the empty binding that it used to be bound to [clicking L3 does nothing now, you used to run.  Now?  Nothing.  So stupid.] and regressive gameplay design is the bane of a good game.  Making things different just for the sake of change, or to FORCE you to use other means [devs say they want you to grapple more, so Rico can't sprint?] infuriates me.  The precedent has been set in the industry, Avalanche, so take note:  People who play open world, especially action games, like to have choices in their approach to problem and puzzle solving.  Also, the grapple sound gets a little annoying, would be nice to not have to rely on it to traverse a 20ft catwalk faster.  And, oh whoops, I accidentally missed the catwalk and grappled to a spire, GAWDARNIT!~!  Pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥os telling us how a game should be played, fudgin go tickle yourselves.Also, MANDATING that I liberate 3 Provinces in Insula Striate sounds all find and dandy, but those things are friggin' HUGE!  I've been pecking away at them the last few days because I get so bored after a couple hours of just constantly liberating town after town after outpost after military base.  It's tedious, I'd just like to progress through the story at a decent pace [like I said, 3 days pecking away at this stuff without getting to play any story line in that time] without having to feel like I keep coming to road blocks.So many frustrating aspects to this game, but it IS a lot of fun.  I mean, blowing stuff up from your wingsuit and tethering cows to windmills, how could you not have a blast?  Once I ran over a light post and my tank flew 200m in the air, so glitches can be fun or annoying, depends on you rmood I guess.EDIT 3:Sky Fortress DLC came out, picked up the season pass for cheap, so I figured why not.  The jet pack is dope, but the cursor is fixed and the camera control doesn't move it like with the jets and helicopters, which is strange.  FPS is suffering with latest update and latest drivers.  I now get 35fps while driving through the country, maybe 120kmph.  The dips are still prevalent, and it's still only fun for maybe an hour or two at a time, and the FOV is still not adjustable without mods, and the CINEMATICS of the DLC are this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cell shaded comic art, like borderlands.  Completely random and stands out agains the rest of the cinematics and art style of the game.  I mean, the art is pretty, but it isn't even as dynamic as Witcher 3 intro, which is of a similar approach.  It's really disappointing and lazy.Don't be like me, keep waiting for it to be $30 with everything and by then MAYBE they will have fixed the performance, thus making it a viable purchase.			"

												As much as I want to, I cannot recommend this game. I've played through Just Cause 2 mulitple times and enjoyed each moment of it, but this? This has been a horrendous mess. Before I go on, I should point out that i'm using an i7-6700k, 16GB of RAM, and a GTX 1080, displaying onto a 1080p screen (I really should go to 4k). Not even this could handle the s***storm that is Just Cause 3.I hadn't even started playing the game when I encountered my first problem. The game would crash on boot in fullscreen mode. A little bit of tweaking meant I could boot it in borderless windowed mode. After getting to the main screen I set everything at ultra and selected play, to which I was instantly greeted with 25 FPS constantly. I rebooted the game multiple times, turned down all of the settings, made sure I was on the latest video drivers, and even rebooted the system, yet nothing worked. A fresh install did nothing and i decided to call it a night.12 or so hours later, I decided to try again. Oddly enough, it decided to run at 60fps with everything on ultra. Happy with the outcome, I went through the intro again and began playing. 1 mission in and the game was already experiencing bugs. After the helicopter that was supposed to pick me up didn't arrive (which I actually found rather funny), the game decided to crash. I brushed this off and tried again, yet it crashed after an hour or so of gameplay. I gave up.Later that day, determined to play a game that looked so beautiful and so much fun, I tried once again to keep the game running. I opened all of my monitoring software up to make sure I wasn't running out of resources and began playing. Of course, it didn't crash for about 5 hours. When it did, none of the software was showing any problems with the computer, so it must've been the game.I continued to play for a few days or so, and each time it would crash after 4-5 hours of gameplay, which while it is annoying if you spend long periods of time gaming like me, wasn't as bad as the game running at 25 FPS. Several of the challenges I attempted within the game had a couple of bugs here and there, which was a pain to get around, especially within the crash bomb challenges as the bomb explosion is tiny and does very little damage for an explosion so big. It was only after the game crashed in the middle of a mission for the third time that i decided it was time to write this review.I will admit, there are some parts of the game I did enjoy. The wingsuit mechanic is very well done and while difficult at first, once mastered, does become a very useful tool for getting around the place. The upgrade system works well and the leaderboards feature is a great way of competing with friends and adds an extra challenge to the game to complete in your free time if you wish. The vehicle models and mechanics (well, maybe apart from the bike mechanics) were very well done and made me want to actually drive around instead of wingsuiting everywhere. Additionally, the character models and the scenery in general is beautifully done and really captured the mediterranean atmosphere.If you can look past the problems with the game and really enjoyed the previous one, pick it up, although wait for it to be on sale just in case you do have problems with it, as spending £10 on a broken game is better than spending £40 on a broken game. The problems I had will not be there for everyone and if you do pick this up, you may have no problems with it at all, but due to my experience with it, I cannot recommend purchasing this game.I will eventually complete this game and attempt to 100% it, but for now, I think I'm going to give it a break.

												When I first controlled Rico Rodriguez, the protagonist of the game, I felt ""What is this? Why does a 2016 AAA game feel so stiff? No proper movement physics and controlled like an old game."" After playing an hour I realised, he's just a pawn in this massive open world game. And the amount of stunts Rico can do is just too fun that you soon look past the physics mechanics. Game is repetitive but the most exciting kind of repetitive there is. Where the repetition comes from blowing up huge military bases, jumping from high up a mountain shooting RPG's into enemy tanks / fuel tanks, sky diving from helicopters, wingsuit flying, helicopter / plane flying, simply mindlessly running around like a jackarse, vehicle chases and escapes and whatnot. Great fun, game looks great while you're doing it. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, everything is purposefully B-grade, and what it does, it does best.			"

												Amazingly detailed, great physics, no locked frame rates (over 80 FPS), the storyline leaves things open for you to do what you want.I really like that they have taken the guesswork out of what you need to destroy in an area for it to be free by providing a list of things in the area to destroy and even their relative location.Definitely worth the time if you were a fan of Just Cause 2!

												Alright, here's what I think. After 43 hours and almost completely liberating everything in just under a week, I have to admit I like it and it's a ton of fun. It's everything I wanted from the next instalment in the franchise.I have heard some people complain that there's not much content beyond liberating bases and completing challenges. This is true, but then I think that Just Cause 2 was exactly the same, and everyone loved that.Next thing is complaints about stuff being locked behind challenges. Personally, I do not mind this, I already get more than what I got in vanilla Just Cause 2 (unlimited explosives, multiple tethers). So getting more is technically optional (although I do recommend it, it makes the game significantly easier). Just try to do the challenges. They may seem repetitive but each one is just about fresh enough in my humble opinion.There is *one* thing that bothers me to no end though and that is the  always online feature. It often disconnects me from the servers, making me often have to reconnect, sometimes it won't reconnect and I have to go into offline mode where it will try to reconnect me every 5 minutes when I pause the game as well. I know you want to keep your game out of the hands of those pesky pirates and I respect that but at least make sure that the people who do purchase it are not inconvenienced by your measures.That said, the game runs fairly well on my set-up with I7-4790K, GTX 770 and 16 GB of RAM. Running it on high and maintaining 60 FPS most of the time. FPS drops are present but rather rare.I personally would give this game a solid 8.5/10.			"

												Game is fun and enjoyable but it runs like absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥barely playable and crashes frequently how do games get released in this state? can't recommend in this state.Edit - I recently bought a gtx 1070 and thought i'd install the game again and give it a second go the frame drops are still very much there but they no longer bother me as my card is powerful enough to deal with them, however the game uses up 7.5+ gbs of ram and seems to run alot worse than before with micro stutters all the time.its clear this game needs 16 gb's of ram to run and yet the suggested amount is 8gb's which results in performance issues for many people.If you are bothered by frame drops, micro stuttering and other performance problems then definitely do not buy this game as it's riddled with them, if something like that doesn't bother you then get the game it's quite fun when it works and the human eye only sees in 30 frames anyway.

												I’ve read the bad reviews, I’ve read the good reviews. Thought ‘what the heck, I had so much fun with Just Cause 2’ and bought the game. There are some things that felt better with 2, there are some things that feels better with 3.  It’s not a big difference. This one feels easier and personally for me I would have liked it a bit harder. But maybe it’s because I have a lot of hours in 2 and I know what’s expected of me.  All in all it’s fun blowing up things, shooting the bad guys and completing the missions. I really like that you can compete with your Steam friends in a lot of challenges. You see their scores when you do them and they get a notice when you beat their scores. And there are a lot of them. It makes you retry them and it’s really satisfying after trying and trying again to beat their scores knowing they get a notice they’ve been defeated…….losers!.....  : )  Lots of hours of fun ahead and I just started. So in short. If you liked playing Just Cause 2 and felt sad when you ended it ‘cause of all the fun….here’s your treat.  By the way, I have no problems with crashes or gameplay with my Nvidia card. Everything works fine.  I’m having a good time and a lot of laughs so far and it seems that it’s going to be this way for a lot of days ahead playing this game. Play it, shoot me if I’m wrong.  "

												There's a good game buried under here somewhere, but it's not worth playing at the moment.I have an i7 4790k, 16gb of ram, and a 4gb R9 290. There is no reason for me to be getting a highly variable framerate that tends to hover in the low 40s regardless of whether I use maxed-out or lowest-possible graphical settings. It's like they didn't even test the game on AMD cards.I unfortunately bought this game on another site, otherwise I would have gotten a refund already. Performance issues like this are unacceptable. If I wanted console-quality framerate, I would have gotten it on console.Apparently people with nVidia cards haven't had as many issues issues, so you might be good to go if you have one. But if you have an AMD card, you're rolling the dice. Better off waiting to see if they fix their game.			"

												Today's Review: Just Cause 3First of all my Rig for those comparing with their pc for similar problemsCPU: AMD FX 6300 3.5 (4.1) GHZRAM: 8 GB DDR3GPU: AMD Radeon HD 7850 2 GBThis game was a really big letdown, specially because i was really wanted to love this game, that's why i bought it, i really wanted to unleash caos and flying arround, but at the end i cannot even do a proper review of this game, there wasn't any day 1 patch, so 99% of AMD users, at least those that have graphics cards, were experiencing several problems with this game, even those with 960/970/980 Nvidia graphics were also experiencing heavy stuttering making the game umplayable, so i've waited 2 months, they release 2 ""fixing"" update patchs and after 2 driver updates from the AMD side i was almost happy when i booted the game today, the game ran at 90 fps constant flying, driving and in firefights until i've died, then the stuttering came back and the game again became unplayable, honestly if you have a powerful rig this game is all fun and no story if you're into that, but if you have an AMD GPU i seriously advice not buying this game for any price, i've pre-order it and it was such a dissapointing game that in 1 month the game had a pretty big discount so, money wasted, i'm not gonna rate the game until the game is playable.

												I had heaps of fun with Just Cause 2 back in the day, even lately..   So like most of us, I was pumped for JC3, it looked like good fun.. and it would be (and i know this sounds like a broken record) if Square Enix didn't completely poo on their PC fanbase. I'm glad I bought this game off of a key site because it's barely worth the price I paid for it in it's current state. What a disgusting, feeble attempt from them to deliver a game that lags, takes ages to load, stutters and freezes.. and this is on the lowest graphics where it's borderline playable. I was hoping for an update by now, I can't even find a fix that works and I can't justify upgrading my rig just for this game. 9/11 GG Square.I do totally recommend it if you have the right PC to run it though.

Playing at max settings at 720p with my gtx 960 and getting 60-80 fps everywhere except that the framerate drops to ZERO when there are explosions or destruction of bricks/huts. Hell, it even lags when NOTHING is going on. Just running around on the ground makes the game lag sometimes. I can't talk about the game itself when the game runs so poorly.

Unfortunately, the PC version of the game was unable to be launched by 90% of computers with a sufficiently-powerful ATI graphics card. Somehow, they had failed to build or test their game for cards used by over a third of PC gamers at that time.So, I'll give Square-Enix and Avalanche this: I can launch this game.

												This game's performance feels like crisis on the average office computer that still runs windows 95.I will change this review to positive at some point; Avalanche is a competent studio and I hope for them to do what's right.  My issue is that the game lags like INSANITY.  Less than 20 fps no matter what.  Let's see what I did:1. Download all the new amd drivers2. Verify integrity of game cache3. Disable steam overlay4. Uninstalling and reinstalling5. Running in offline mode6.*Put it at ALL LOWEST SETTINGS*But it doesn't matter, because absolutely no matter what, the game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥  And before y'all come at me with torches and pitchforks saying ""IT'S BECAUSE YOUR CARD IS BAD..."" well, I have a radeon 6970, which isn't *quite* the reccommended minimum.  However, because I can run almost any other game maxed, I have a pretty big problem with the fact that this game, even at ALL MINIMUM GRAPHICS SETTINGS (yes, even including putting the resolution to 640x420p), the game runs at a frame rate that far surpasses the ""unplayable"" mark.I've been looking forward to this game since 2011.

												I like this game and it works nicely for me and I've tried it on 3 different PCs all with windows 10..not sure about the other people but the game is definitly graphically demanding and requires a lot of power even though it doesn't look like a game that would require a high end pc .. gameplay is great and leaderboard call outs are awesome but the story ain't that great so I'd give it a 7/10			"

												In front of JC2 this game is lacking. I remember the day I got both of these games and the aftertaste is uncomparable. In this game the Driving is horrible, it affects my gameplay because I like to do crazy stunts, thing is the driving is crazy hard and the stunts en up just being stupid. The DLCs look cool but im not getting scamed again, bad game, hard to control everything even the menu.There are a lot if issues that make the playing experience rather tedious than fun.Just wait for the next one, maybe, if they make it and it doesnt suck.

												Note:  This was a review from back in January, I am reposting it in hopes that more people see it.Runs like crap. And not just frames per second wise, there is plenty of crashes and stuttering to be had. Has some pretty insane memory leaks too.Forced online login. Worst. Decision. Ever. I have had to block JC3 in my firewall and run steam in offline mode just to be able to play ""offline"".Lots of little things missing like being able to sprint and crouch. This isn't an on rails shooter, why limit Ricos maneuverability to just the grapple and parachute? Yes, the game was obviously made around those mechanics, but given that it is an open world game, WE should be allowed to choose how we want to play. Those that don't want to sprint or crouch behind cover simply won't. Adding those are only a benefit to those that would enjoy it and you lose nothing.Bottom line: explosions are pretty, but the game play feels stale. Pick up JC2 with all the DLC and you will have much more fun.Edit April 5th, 2016: Couple of patches later, performance is a bit better but still not great. It is clear they put a sub par team into this game compared to the likes of GTA 5 which I can run just fine with extended draw distance which has a million and a half more things going on at once than in this game. Still not recommended, save your money.Edit August 18th, 2016: If you are STILL on the edge of buying this game, DON'T. RUN AWAY. Since my last update, they have done nothing in terms of supporting their game other than adding support for their constant line of DLC. They kept saying they were going to try and fix issues with the game, but they haven't.. its just been ""Uhh... err... weeell... LOOK AT THE SHINY DLC YOU CAN BUY!!""			"

												TL;DR?:simply: Square Enix & Avalanche Studios


YouTube™ Video: TF2: Money

			""Money"" performed by Jon & Vangelis, from ""Page of Life"" (1991). Maskless Spy: http://rebbacus.tumblr.com/post/46041314411/ Behind-the-scenes video: http://youtu.be/tnXDPobewNM Here's the list of...		

level/gamedesigner watched too much micheal bay films hoping badly made minigames would be fun to us even if we are forced to play them.and we are just forever waiting a patch.EDIT: 03/12/15the game is still full of sheet (if you know what i mean, thanks steam) still no day one patch, it's like we're playing on a high budget steam's early access video game.So beside the overall dumshit that Square Enix & Avalanche Studios decided to sell us i noticed more major flaws in the gameplay... To the level/game designers & game programmers: thanks to have really f@cked up this just cause title :,) remember the lame and horribly boring races we had in just cause 2 ? now you need to do them to unlock special abilities, i'd say the wingsuit ones are made to break your pc. Why, try to have the 5 ""gears"" to it, if you do, welcome in the hardcore try harding gamezone. let's talk about the races, the ones with cars... I had one with a freacking dead and rusty middle east type of cars... You'd tell me it's for the lulz, no, the level designer found it funny to have 2 huge laps with a car that can only go to 10 mph, GOD! so lulzy!i paid 50 euros for that and i played too much to get a refund... Dear lord what have i done? :,calso you have the destruction minigame, anything is going ok BESIDE the one you have to do EVERYTHING with your grapping hook... Level designers = genius.... Why? try to take down everything with your grapping hook under 2 minutes and without your grenades, well it's almost impossible (after i didn't upgraded my grapping hook... but i believe it doesn't really impact it since the levels just lack of barrils :) )then you have the shooting range which is ok... But please, again, let's make this boring as f-k, seriously, they make horribly hard wingsuit races ♥♥♥♥ and then shooting ranges needing 0% of skill to get all the gears...Also i love competiting with guys i haven't in my friendlist ""xX_♥♥♥♥ITER_Xx took the 1st place"" it's like we're on facebook, you don't talk to them, you don't know them but they remind you they exist somehow... Competiting with my friends is ok... But please... Not random stanger with dumb as f@ck usernames...Well i think this will be final but... it's a just cause... 50% ♥♥♥♥ed up.I still wouldn't recommend.  -------------------------------------------------------------------first critic-----------------------------------------------------------------Well what to say about this...Eager as ♥♥♥♥ as usual for a Just Cause video game, once again i'm shocked how the video game industry is turning a video game that was used to be released glitch-less to a video game that is now released full of♥♥♥♥♥♥come on!huge drops of framerate on an Nvidia 980 4GB.like how is this possible, it looks like ARK survival evolved on its realease... OH WAIT!Square Enix & Avalanche studios done that!seriously... Also multiple horrible sound glitches when you click on a button in the menu, when you open the menu, when you quit the menu.... Well a UI coded with the♥♥♥♥♥GG WP!anyway, let's get out of the ""Day one"" problems (and i'm waiting the update so move your @-ss SE.)Seriously about the game itself... It... Rocks? i can't tell with  all the glitches, the time Rico takes to get up, the difficulty of the game sometime, the loadings taking around 1-2 minuts, connecting to SquareEnix♥♥♥♥♥, the horribly annoying ranking system that they added attemping to make it multiplayer...Holy s--it multiplayer... Why did they bothered to create this dumb ranking system if you can't play with your friends!! it's like: ""look we can't do that, and since we are useless let's create an innovative multiplayer experience... Push notifications of your friend's action, so smart! so fun!!""It looks like they don't learn from their mistakes. Again we'll have to wait 3 years until some talented developper creates an online mod (""look we are so lazy we have to let the community create its own multiplayer, now brb i need to bang in my money pool"")i have to say i'm really disapointed, i'll kill it off, after all it's a Just cause, i'd lie if i hadn't major lulz in this... Yet i'm not impressed and i'm disapointed about the general looking of the game, 36GO, it's like i'm playing with 15GO which are corrupted.anyway, for now i wouldn't recommend it, seriously save your dollars, wait few weeks then buy it.ps: wingsuit, really? they tried in far cry 4, and look in third person it' still horrible to control.

												As big as the world map is, the actual game's content is very thin. So thin, they've gated every possible thing in the game via trials , collectables, and conquesting the world map. Instead of making traversal easy, its tedious. You haven't unlocked the fast travel node? Prepare to glide for 11 kilometers to the mission destination. You nabbed an enemy tank and want to capture it for future use? Sorry. You can't do that, you need to go gather 20+ collectables around the map to get any of the actual worthwhile vehicles.The destruction gimmick is fine, but this game reminds me of Red Faction: Guerrilla. You see everything this game has to offer in a very short time frame, and then are forced to wade yourself through the most tedious game padding imaginable to get to the next story beat. The story itself isn't compelling, the only compelling thing about this game is that it took up 50 gigs on my hard drive and I wanted to free up space.To go back on why this game reminds me of Red Faction: Guerrilla, it is because the gunplay isn't good, and the majority of the game, whether you want to admit it and regardless of how many gimmicks you throw in the mix, you will be engaging in this sub par gunplay. Previous games of this kind have done this better, I would recommend them over this. Particularly something like Mercenaries 1+2, where the gunplay was better, the destruction was more fun, and the gameplay loop was much tighter and more rewarding. Even the story was more compelling with factions that mattered with branching paths for story and multiple endings.  "

												This game is enjoyable. It's a good way to kill time. It doesn't have too much in the story department and it can get sort of repetitive. The combat system works well and it's fun to cause insane amounts of havoc.At the same time though, my rig has been unable to run it since the first patch dropped. It would run at about 5 fps and made my computer run extremely slow. I recently upgraded my card to an ASUS GTX 1060 OC STRIX and I can't even get into the game anymore. It locked my computer up and made it entirely unresponsive, to the point that I had to do a hard reset. I know my CPU and RAM are relatively old (i7-2600k and 16gb 1333mHz G.SKILL RipJaw) but I don't have issues with ANY other games. For this reason, I have to say that I don't recommend it.			"

												In it's current state, the game is LITERALLY unplayable.Running on a fairly updated system (by no means uncapable of running this game), the game cannot, no matter what, run at a stable 30+ FPS. Textures do not load, the game constantly stutters and freezes, loading times are ranging from 20 seconds all the way up to (in extreme cases) 5 minutes (I have experienced this already).As a huge fan of Just Cause 2, owning it on both PS3 and PC, Just Cause 3, in it's current state is quite literally unplayable.A genuine rating of 1/10 as I, and hundreds - probably even thousands - of users cannot even play the game due to the god awful ""optimisation"" this game has received, if you can even call it optimised			"

												I absolutely loved JC2 so expected to love this too as it was pretty much billed as JC2 with everything turmed up to 11.It perhaps could have been, but the performance issues detract massively from any enjoyment there could have been in this game. Many people have reported many issues across a host of different system configurations.There is a good game somewhere in there, but its has too many performance issues for me.One of the biggest annoyances for me was that after the ridiculously long loading time at the start of every session, you have to watch as a list of people you don't give a flying turd about flashes up on your screen because they have beaten some record that you didn't even care about, and there is no way of turning this off!!Overall as a fan of JC2 this was a massive let down for me, genuinely doesn't live up to its predecessor's brilliance. Not worth your money or your time, not until they at least fix the performance issues.			"

												UPDATE After Patch 1.02.So I tried running the game after the latest patch, and although it did improve the performance a bit the game slows to a crawl after playing for at least an hour. The most notorious sections are when flying with the wingsuit or destroying enemy bases, the stutter gets unbearable. The game also crashes immediately once I leave the game.I don't believe this is a question of my PC either as some suggest in the comments, it is way over the minimum specs, so I am entitled to complain if that is so. I would just also like to re-iterate that my experience may differ from the rest, and some people have been playing this game without issues.---- I really want to like this game, unfortunately the stuttering problems are so frustrating. I really hope they fix the technical issues, its unacceptable the state this was launched in.			"

												I'm disappointed, Avalanche.The game looks and sounds great - but poor performance (hopefully this will be patched) and lack of multi-GPU support is a big let down. Ridiculous loading times, even on an SSD - and I must be missing the option to skip the intro. Watching Rico blow up the boat in the distance was nice the first time but I don't want to wait a minute every time I start the game to get to the actual gameplay. I think this may be something to do with the ""online"" element of the game as it seemed to take a long time to login after this.I've been informed that the studio that made JC2/Mad Max (Avalanche Studios Stockholm) didn't make JC3 (New York) - so that partly explains the rift in performance.If you lose connection to Square Enix servers while ingame a big annoying message interrupts gameplay, asking you to retry connection or go to offline mode - why couldn't you just automatically go offline and periodically retry and just notify me in the corner?Rico feels like an OAP when he isn't in the parachute or wingsuit. No rolling or sprinting.Some elements of the HUD are poor - waypoints/objectives are hard to see sometimes (tiny white markers and text blend in with the background). What happened to the minimap?AI effectiveness seems to vary a lot - some are capable of sniping you out of a full speed helicopter, but get close and they can barely hit you. Enemies have tendancy to spawn right next to you without warning.On the upside - voice acting is a lot better (no BOLOOOO SANTOSIII), driving is slightly improved over JC2 (though still a bit iffy) and the writing gives you a few laughs. The improved tethering is a welcome addition and the wingsuit is great. The game also tells you what you need to do to liberate areas now which is a helpful addition.There is a good game in there but these issues are spoiling it for me.			"

												So like if you like just cause 2 you will like 3. It brings over some of the mods from 2 into 3 like the multi grappling hook and the turbo on a smaller scale. Most of the vehicles I felt may be kinda useless when most of my traveling was done with the normal wing suit. Oh and do the challenges as soon as you can because they really help you out in the game. Its beautiful and their are plenty of things to explore and EXPLOSIONS!  As for those complaining about how they think the game runs poor... well for one i have a gtx 970 and a i7 5690k with 16gb of ram  but here is the kicker, I'm running it at 1440p with 50+ fps  avg on the max settings on win 10 64bit on an ssd with out any issues. Now as far as the ram issue goes my system idles at 1.4 gb ram and playing this game it goes to ~4.5gb at an eyeball avg of 40% cpu load so....yea. And at least for me this has been constant performance from day 1 owning the game and I bought it maybe a few days after it came out. Game is rock solid performance even on my brothers 960gtx he runs 720p at  60+fps and never encounters slowdown on 4 gb of ram on an 4 year old amd fx 8000, heck this will work just off the apu in an i7 at low settings 30 fps. As far as Ati cards go the reason their so poor on this particular game is the way they handle mass textures like explosions  where as the nvida cards are made more in mind for sudden demand in memory and particle calculations so they have a much easier time with this game so i would blame it more on the manufacture for not supporting through software in such a way that it compensates for those cards weaknesses.   But just to let you all know sometimes it can be the reverse for other games and it's not all dependent on the engine that the game runs on but the support given to that engine by that company that makes the card, it's a 2 way street. Sadly it seems that ATI still is not up to snuff with their driver support for this AAA game that's been out for a while (witch the consoles are also ATI/AMD machines). Avalanche Engine only has 5 games on it their is bound to be less support for it where as games like DOOM are based of UE4 and almost all games produced with that brand new engine run really well on most cards and their is a lot more driver support for because of all the games ( https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Category:Games ) that's like +30 games in development on this one engine.Those of you having issues with the game their are a few steps you can takeStart the game in the lowest possible settings and slowly adjust them one by one up until you get a crash and report it to Avalanche.validate the files through steam if your getting crashesupdate your video card drivers>try the gameuninstall the game>restart>install the game>restart>try the gameuninstall your video card drivers>restart>reinstall them>restart>try the game If it was working at one point do a system restore by going to start>search>system restore>pick a time when you know it was working. hope this helped a bitTLDR: If you like 2 then your going to like 3. Only worry about the game working if you have an low end ATI card or a >$300 computer (console).			"

												Hello! I'm Rit. I'm no real particular fan of the just cause series, but I do enjoy sandboxes in general, and well my friend coaxed me into buying the game so I could play alongside him! As such. You can trust that I didn't have any 'hype' or bias to the game. I've had a vague interest in the game and initially didn't even want to consider buying it. Well, I did, and here is my review of it. I'll have to note that it gets ridiculously detailed, so I'll give the best shot at a Tl;Dr I can, then below I'll put the full details! I advice any developers who are reading this go through that section. I have a...lot to say.Tl;Dr - In general, the game is fun. It is ""Good"" but it has not impressed me. Perhaps the strongest part of the game is not exploding things, not blowing up entire bases or causing chaos. Nope. It's the wingsuiting. And I love that, I do, I spend most of my time wingsuiting. But unless you feel like doing lots of tedious challenges and doing the same repetitive takeovers of bases, then don't get this game. If you're into that stuff, if you're great at finding ways to blow things up in the next greatest way? Go for it. But I'm 40 hours in, and I felt like I've seen most of what the game has to offer. Save for 1 weapon, a couple of vehicles, and trains. I recommend it if you're buying it on sale, not for full price.Details here! It wouldn't fit in Steam![www.dropbox.com]So now the conclusion. And yes, the positives weren't as long. But eh. Honestly I don't have much more to say, I'm sure you already know about the better tether and the better explosions already and I don't have much to add to what most trailers and people already say. So...Is it a good game..? Yes. Does it compare well to JC2? It's a fine sequel, but that's all it is. As much as I'd like to say the slight improvements to the tether and bombs are all you need, and as much as I'd like to say that the wingsuit is a fantastic innovation that sells the game. But it's not. It's a great transportation system that occasionally leaves me just flying around idly, but I can't say it's the thing I've spent most of my time on. I personally think they took JC2, made a few improvements in some of the areas, prettied it up, then added the wingsuit. And that's about it. It's a better JC2 (Except for the driving) And that's the thing. I'm judging it so harshly because while JC2 was very unique and thus attracted lots of people despite the flaws. JC3 just feels like another iteration, only making 'safe' steps forward. ""Oh modders did this and it was super popular, we'll put that in"" It doesn't feel like any real risks were taken, and it doens't feel like they've added anything real worth it content wise to the game.So do I recommend it? Yes. Get it on the cheap. I got it for half price. $40 compared to Australia's regular $80. If you can get it in your regional equivalent for that price, go for it. It's a nice game for that price. I can't say it's good for full price though.			"

												It's a good game, poorly made.Having read reviews, and looking at the issues on the forums, I thought that perhaps the issues mentioned were being overstated. They were not. The online DRM is a big drain on resources, and the optimization is so poor that as soon as you move the camera (or cause an explosion) the game freezes as the engine struggles to keep up. Changing settings seems to have little or no affect on this.All in all, this is a shockingly bad implementation of what would otherwise be an awesome game.			"

												I love buying games for 60 dollars that are so poorly optimized that they aren't playable. I love that its been nearly a year since release, and they havent done anything. I love how Steam wont let me get a refund cause the game wouldnt close, and it thought it was running. ♥♥♥♥ing scam, dont buy.			"

												I *REALLY* wanted to love this game, and have never really been bothered by the the ""Always Online"" bullspit that companies throw out now and then - but now that the damn game stops me mid-mission because it lost connection TO THE DAMN SERVERS is where I've about had enough. I haven't even had to deal with 90% of the bugs, framerate drops, and other issues that I've read about others having, but it's still more than enough. I loved the ever living crap out of Just Cause 2, and have seen the shadows of glimmers of potential with JC3, but it all keeps falling apart. The game isn't fun. It's friggin annoying. Period. The ""challenges"" to get unlocks are annoying, the craptactular vehicle controls are annoying, the massive empty area to the north is annoying, and the fact that Avalache can't keep their own damn servers online - AND THEN PREVENT ME FROM PLAYING BECAUSE OF IT - well that's not annoying. That's just pisspoor and inexcusable. I will not be paying for any more games from Avalanche until they get their stuff squared away.			"

												Awesome game, so much fun and freedom gfx are great (gtx980) runs very smooth (i7 3.9ghz) would recommend the sea, air, land dlc's. As for alot of reviews about the driving being bad i disagree, i play with kb/mouse and found driving very fun/easy to control except 1, the motor bike riding is bad and hard to steer and i do agree that the driving in just cause 2 was way better.The only one thing i really dislike in this game is the stupid login all the time, can play for long periods without no login but once in awhile you would be in the middle of something like wingsuit flight and boom game pause's and tries to login again sometimes it logs in right away other times it just wont login and takes several attempts untill it logs online again and goes back into game.This login is not important anyways its only for leaderboard scores so you can choose to play offline mode without this rubbish interrupting you, other than that thumbs up.Gameplay  = 10/10Driving       = 8/10Story          = 9/10DLC S/A/L   = 10/10       S=Sea/A=air/L=landGFX            = 10/10Logging in while playing =  -1/10 "

												The main problem with this game is the graphics and character control.  The graphics are just plain bad.  It looks like it would be at home on PS3, which was great...eight years ago.  The character's movements, especially in combat, don't feel very up to date either.  It's one of those things where you can run around too easily while taking heavy gunfire from several enemies that don't move or take cover or act at all like actual people.  Driving and flying are also quite poor. It's basically identical to Just Cause 2, which was good in its time but that time has passed.Also my pc surpasses the recommended specs yet I still run into choppy gameplay at times.  I play several other games that were released recently on the highest graphical settings with no problem and they look a hell of a lot better than this, so I'm inclined to believe it's either poor programming or a collection of bugs.To throw some positive light on this poorly executed game I must say that the gameplay is enjoyable.  Who doesn't like an open world where everything can be victim to exploding?  Also the improvements with the grappling hook make for some fun and unique ways to destroy things and kill enemies.  All in all it's really too bad that the graphics and character control ruined what was an excellent idea for a game.			"

												Man, I am disappointed...To start with, the game is really cool, and deserves to be played by fans of the franchise.But, as of right now, the game is broken to hell. You guys remember the Batman Arkham Knight disaster? This is that all over.With game breaking stuttering and frame-rate drops everytime I turn the player around just ruins the explosion-fest / mayhem world that is Just Cause, and with that gone, what's the point?Plenty of bugs to be found here too, including my favorite, ""invisible water!"" 


The water effect is broken for me :D

												So what i want to say about that game? To my Rack: Im a proud owner of an Alienware X51.. I play most Games on Ultra, minimum on very high settings.. If u dont own the right hardware, dont buy this game.. Otherwise u will be disappointed at the moment.. For me, i w8 since JC was released to play it, so i cant say antything about the Game itself only how it behaves...Laggy, laggy, laggyDevs dont come out with infos, still postings news about DLC's.. But why i should buy an DLC for an unfinished Game? I do not understand how Avalanche can ruin such a big Trademark like Just Cause.. I loved the previous ones, but JC3 dont hit my espectations.. Its so freakin sad, that i bought the Game on Dec. 1 and im not able to play it in suitable way till now..So, choose for ur self if u want to pay a high price for an low budget Consoleroportation...As i say, check if u own the right hardware, before you buy and dont take a look on the Reqiurements released by avalanche... The didnt matchSry for my english, im a german dude, but i want to inform every1 about the state... "

Nvidia has a hold on the gaming industry with this gameworks crap and needs to stop.EDIT: 12/16/15  A new patch came out and broke the game even further. Instead of being able to play at 20-25 fps on low it now plays on 15 on low. Here we go with these patch on patched to fix bad patches. My specs are not the problem.

												Why? I bought this expecting it to run perfectly.The first run, I got onto the very first loading section before the Main menu. The game crashed with the loading circle 1/16 full.The second try, I set Steam on Offline Mode. Ditto.The third try, it loaded to the main menu. When I went into the settings and pressed something, the click glitched into a loop for 30 seconds. FInally, it de-glitched and I returned to the main menu and started the game. I got the audio for the cutscene, but no video, and after 30 sec of that, the game crashed.If they don't patch this game, and soon, I'm going to have to ask for a refund.Also, if they don't patch this game, I don't recommend buying this game.If they fix what's wrong, I'll change my review and reccomend getting this. Probably.			"

												I was really excited for all the explosions and crashes i could make.And i was not dissapointed as the game has spectacular crashes every time i try to launch the game.*Update*Some people seem confused.Because i have a sense of humor this review is somehow not truthful.Game crashes on launch fam. Unplayable.Thumb down stays. Its a rushed, badly optimized, broken game.Some also question my rig.SO here is the specs:Intel Core i7 4790K @ 4.00GHz16GB DDR3 RAM2x GTX 980TI Gaming 6gb SLIWindows 7 64-bitUpdate 2 SLI Edition (Pre Order Now):Here is the run up.When a game does not support SLI, It means only one card works and the game does not access both cards. It may cause FPS drops and graphical glitches, Not that the game crashes on launch in a hysterical mess of fire and brimstone. I have at least never seen a game that did. And if it did, SLI can be turned off and disabled. Which i have tried. And did not fix the issue. The issue is shared across Nvidia and AMD, And shared across different low-end, medium-end and high-end systems. I do honestly appreciate all the feedback to try and help myself and others with this issue and only place this here because a lot of comments seem to take up the ""It might just not support SLI yet"" Comments so people who don't read the whole thread miss it.Update 3: The UpdateningYes i have updated driversUpdate 4: Upgrade to Windows 10 Already!!11No. I'd rather throw my pc out the window.Upgrading to an operating system the first year its out is the sign of a fuccboi.

												This is the third Just Cause game out. I at this moment have been exploring Just Cause 3 for 5 or 6 hours.And like the first and the second the game is really decent and absolutely worth checking out if you love GTA type open world games..Also back for the third time were a lot of promises that have not used in the game but that is ok because every installment raises the quality bar for this series.Graphics look beautiful and clear and the soundquality is good and the games shows that a lot of love has been put in during development. A big downside of this PC version of Just Cause 3 is that if you want to play this game as it should without delays at a as high possible framerate (30 or 60 frames) When this was released there were not very many people who could enjoy this game because of that fact.I would at least guess that you need a higher end GTX 970, 980 or a GTX 1060, 1070 or 1080 to really have fun...If i'd have to give this game a overall rating then i would probably give this around 8,5 out of 10 points.RECOMMENDED!!!

												I love the Just Cause Series, I have all the games Including ALL the dlc for JC2.Ok so lets cut to the review.Pros:+THIS GAME IS AMAZING+Michael Bay's Go-To Game (im assuming)+It has a HUGE area to explore (Bigger than GTA V 256 km2, Like 4 times bigger and Just cause 2 and 3 is about 1000 km2)+This game is good Just Cause ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)+EDIT: It now has Multiplayer mod, Twice the explosions and Fun!Cons:-When i was playing when i got about a quarter through the game, for some reason my whole computer crashed and when i started the game up i had all my unlocks and chaos points but i had to start from the begining again. I did a bit or research and found out it is effecting windows 10 (probably 8) users. so if u use 10 (or 8) play at your own risk. Microsoft are trying to fix the issueEDIT: The issue has been fixedOne thing to keep in mind, JC3 occasionaly has weekend deals, and it is super cheap during major sale events.			"

												I've managed to finish the game. The first 12 hrs of game time this game would crash with D3D code 38 error after 1 minute to 1 hour of gaming. However, the thread on steam discussions about downclocking your GPU helped me(-37 mhz to core clock and -100mhz to memory clock in particular), which resulted in 19 hours of relatively normal gameplay.Behind those technical isssues you can see some proper storyline and enjoyful interaction with the world, which is pretty addictive. The game is on par with JC2 in terms of the Story, better in ""realism""(parachute and wingsuit mechanics) and the Rico's hook (which carries better functionality now), but significally worse in terms of technical perfomance. I say: don't buy it if unless there is a discount or you can escape from troubles within 2 hrs gameplay refund limit.			"

												Reasons why you shouldn't get this game:-Preformance on AMD is a sin against man and god. I have a Fury X (latest beta drivers) + a i5-4690k @ 4.1 Ghz and at 1440p, global illumination off, water tesselation off, med shadows, and no AA I still can't maintain a solid 60 fps... and that's in general gameplay, don't ask me how explosions fare. This year I've played MGS V, FO4, and Mad Max fairly comfortably at 4k, so to have so many performance issues with this game is just a straight up disappointment.-No multi-GPU support. They're hiding behind the ""engine won't allow for it"" excuse, which is just baffling considering Mad Max could manage just fine.-ALWAYS ONLINE (which causes stuttering). No option in menu to play in offline. I shouldn't have to edit the Windows Firewall or launch Steam in offline mode just to not have to wait 30 seconds for the map to pop up. -Intro and menus run like garbage. Literally the logos take 3x as long because they run at 21 fps for some reason.-I've had at least 5 crashes in my 2 hours with the game.It's so disappointing because the core of JC3 is GOOD, but these issues are too glaring to ignore. It's a travesty that Avalanche allowed their B-team to take their amazing property and bungle it so hard. Don't buy this game, until some miracle happens. Or just don't buy this game.			"

												This is a great game.  Coming from Just Cause 2, I found it interesting that the controls had changed, but I quickly learned the new controls and had great fun.  I haven't had many issues like others explain in the game.  Only problem I have is sometimes I am unable to exit a vehicle with both e and spacebar(parachute out right?) which leads to my demise, but it's pretty easy to catch back up to where I was.  I'm really enjoying flying around and all of the new weapons and vehicles.  Bought the game for me and got two other copies for my brothers for Christmas in anticipation of the MP mod release.  Was thrilled to find out how great single player is as I wait for the MP mod release.  The game is slighly addicting for me, so my wife is a little annoyed...			"

												It's a good game, and a fitting follow up to Just Cause 2 (one of the greatest games ever made - in my opinion) but don't get it on PC.PROS- Huge world which is fully explorable, via land sea and air- All new upgrades to Rico (most notably the wingsuit)- Taking over enemy bases never felt more fun- Story is more accessible than that of Just Cause 2- Great voice acting- Incredible detail, and a really good looking game (some of the best looking water I've seen in a while)CONS- World can feel empty (lots of areas that are literally just roads- When all bases are taken over, it can get quite boring- Terrible PC Port     - Constant FPS drops     - Low FPS in certain areasI think the worst thing about the PC Port, is that the game has been out for quite a while now, and these problems still persist, and the developers don't really seem to care, all they seem to care about is pumping out the DLC.In ConclusionI believe it is a good game, but not really worth a buy. If you have an Xbox One or PlayStation 4, then you should definately get it on there instead.			"

												Get Just Cause 2, and then get some mods. That is, to a degree what this game is but there are also some negative points below.Just Cause 3 is essentially a waste of time, its only selling points are its new desired game mechanics, vehicles, and weapons. The map is artifically made to look bigger but in the broad scheme of things its actually very small and under-populated with content.DRM, not only the name of the games antagonist (look at us we're meta!), but also the fact that it almost routinely forces you to go online in order to launch the game. I have almost no recorded time in-game because I try to run it in offline mode whenever possible. Ive actually beaten the game and put in at least 40 hours. Being online slows down the game and it's already a poorly optimized lump of crap. (I run a GTX970 btw).The Story itself. Meh, okay. I didn't expect a mastery of story-telling with a series like just cause. What I also didn't expect was a game with only a short afternoon's worth of actual story missions. In JC2 there were other missions that were offered between ""Agency"" missions, which gave the game a lot of content since these varied in type and depth. Perhaps stealing a car from a private island, or blowing up a satelite array, or hijacking a car with someone in it to kidnap them! NOT THIS TIME AROUND! No! Just LIBERATING TOWNS, over and over and over....and over. Far Cry 4 must have made a lot of money I guess, since its the common architecture for current games. Liberating towns in JC3 is fun the first maybe 15 times you do it, but it begins to get old quick. Then you want to return to the story and... HM NOT YET, GET OUT THERE AND GRIND BY LIBERATING MORE THINGS. Don't do a variety of missions that are almost equally as engaging as the story ones, no! Just go do whatever! It's your game remember!?!?Considering I couldnt even get into the game because ""square enix servers are not responding""I'm not so sure it is my game. "

												Inferior to Just Cause 2's gameplay in every meaningful way, and a complete technical mess.  While this doesn't make it an outright bad game - many games are worse than JC2 and still quite fun - there's a real sour taste of lost opportunity about it.Also, I have to say I'm incredibly disappointed with the ""how it looks vs how it runs"" ramp on this - whoever messed this up so badly that RTSS's frame rate OSD didn't work is a real genius.  It's NOT just ATI people running into problems.  I'm running it from an 840 EVO on a 4.5ghz 4690k and an oc'd 970 (359.06) and I think it absolutely stinks performance wise.  Just look at it - turn off the blending SMAA mode, set up a frame rate log and watch this thing choke to way below 60fps doing ... nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Between the pervasive stutter, mysterious performance drops, horrible mouse acceleration/negative acceleration (with everyone's favorite - mouse movement proportional to frame rate) double digit seconds loading times only to be placed right in the same spot after an in-engine cutscene or failing a challenge, it's hard to work out what it's burning cycles doing.  Barely capable of locking 60fps with most of the fancy effects turned off, and in doing so the overall image quality seems inferior to JC2.   "

I'll just say this again to re-iterate:Avoid this game if you do not have 16gb of ram.Avoid this game if you do not have 16gb of ram.Avoid this game if you do not have 16gb of ram.Avoid this game if you do not have 16gb of ram.Avoid this game if you do not have 16gb of ram.Avoid this game if you do not have 16gb of ram.Avoid this game if you do not have 16gb of ram.

												Just Cause 3 is probably one of my favorite games I played this year, I've had an amazing time playing it and I'm almost done with the story, and yet still will go finish off capturing the world. I recommend this game with a huge caveat. IF YOU CAN PLAY IT, you're going to have an absolutely brilliant time.    With that being said, I have an Alienware Alpha and put in 16 gigs of ram, and had no problems.  I did have 1 crash, and it lost my save game onces (A HUGE problem mind you, as I lost about 12 hours of progress, but got it back in maybe half the time).  It has a number of decent size bugs clearly. However when it works?  It works!  There's a base, I soften it up with a few strafing runs with a military jet I stole, til my plane gets shot down by SAM attacks.  I eject over the base, and parachute in, as my plane ""lands"" in a huge explosion taking out one of the many critical targets.  I continue to work my way through the base, killing soldiers and blowing up stuff, while an attack helicopter arrives to kill me.  Sadly I haven't hacked a SAM to be friendly, and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is shooting me often enough that I don't have the time to at the moment.  I go to the tried and true method.  I use my grappling hook to tie him to the ground, and have in reel in. Pulling him out of the air, making him unstable and down he goes, directly into me.  The entire time I'm laughing and having a blast, it's so much fun to just rain hell down on an unsuspecting enemy.    The tether gun is a thing of pure magic, you can take any two objects and fling them at each other with a ton of force, this can be two structures, a building and a guard, A guard's head and another guard's butt.  Just that one weapon would have made an extremely fun game. Some of my favorite moments are when I'm reloading, and I'm getting shot up, it's taking too long so I find the shooter and now have two choices, either zip line and kick him in the face, or tether him to the nearest object (bonus points if it's explodable) and send him face first to his death.   Waiting on a reload no longer is necessary. Then there's the wingsuit.  I started hating the device, thinking it was impossible to use effectively.  Within two hours I was flinging myself across kilometers of land without a second thought.   Grapple the ground, pull up, reel into the ground and slingshotting between points faster than almost any other object in the game.  The speed, the excitement, the rush.     The wingsuit is to movement, what the tether gun is to combat, a redefinition of an idea that every game thinks they mastered.There's so many moment, and there's a HUGE world to conquer in this game.   However there's a few caveats. The missions are a mix.  Some are absolutely amazing (There's a few where the player is doing stunts worthy of James Bond, or better)  And some are defend a point missions which are frustrating or dull.    The story alongside pretty much every mission isn't just weak.  It's bad.  I mean half the time I don't know exactly what people are talking about and the other half I just don't care.   The third Island has about three to four times the first two area's landmass (Note all islands are accessible at any time, so you can truly free roam from the first moment) But about the same amount of content, so there's just more open area. However none of that matters when you're ripping a base to shred with some wire, some guns, and a RPG, grenade launcher or any other weapon of destruction you can find, as enemies flail helplessly against you.  Overall I'd say if you can run it, it's a fantastic game.  You're going to have a good time destroying and toppling an enemy regime.  But ""If you can run it"" is sadly a bigger question than it should be.   If you have a computer that can handle it though, no question, hands down, this is a great game.			"

												Ya know... I have no idea what is up with this game.First off, when I started out with this game, I was using Intel Integrated HD graphics. And the game ran at a smooth 40fps.But then I upgraded to a Nvidia GTX 960 2GB Vram Card. And all of a sudden, the game sucks. Constant crashes, and when the game does launch it runs at 55fps, then drops randomly to 20. Then goes back up after a minute or so. Then after about 30 minutes of play time, it craps its pants and commits suicide (crashes). Do not buy this game unless the developers of the game come out and release a PC specific patch for memory leaks. Then, and only then, should you buy the game on sale.Buy GTA V instead, its way more fun and the driving/flying mechanics are better :D			"

Just Cause 3 ReviewSHORT: No the best Story.Good Gameplay.Amazing fun.Lots to do.Worth the money. Capable of playing multiplayer.Poor optimization.LONG:Rich (isch) story, it forces you to liberate bases before being able to do the missions which are actually challenging. Performance... Okay, the game isn't exactally the most optimized game ever made, it has sudden frame rate drops and it can be annoying, but it should deffinatelly not scare you away from buying this game for $15. Hell, I'd even pay $60 for it. My point is, just because it's a bad port, doesn't mean the gameplay isn't going to be fun. Game is really fun, has mods, and multiplayer mods too! + Good and very detailed graphics.- AI are dumb af. :D= reasonable good driving other than motorcycles, just.. no... whoever was incharge of motorcycle handling, pls go buy rope and hang yourself.+ really fun wingsuit.+ really fun and extremelly huge map to explore.+ also funny moments are everywhere so always have recording software up and running if possible. :P+ enjoable scenery.+ well made geometry.+ funny physics.- bad optimization.Great game, great graphics, great fun. +1			"

												Bought the game on sale and it started out choppy and laggy but I really liked the gameplay so I played through it thinking the devs would fix it.  That didn't happen, so I started looking online for fixes and found some that helped a bit.  Had to turn it down to 720p resolution just to be playable.  Then it stopped loading one day.  Won't get past the first initial load screen with the circle.  I found a fix that had me type ""bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOff""  into CMD and then restart, which worked for a few days (It sucked having to do that and restart any time I wanted to play though).  Now that fix no longer works and steam has denied a refund. Great. TL;DR: The game no longer loads and Steam denies a refund. It was barely playable from the beginning. Don't buy this shoddy console port unless you want to be robbed of your money.			"

												Don't even bother unless you have a high end Nividia graphics card.  And even then it might be hit and miss.I have a 770 which is JUST below what they ""recommend"", so I am way above minimum requirements and I should be in the zone where I can play at 60fps with slight drops expected with everything on Medium or High. However!! It doesn't matter if I put everything on Low, Medium or High.. I get the exact same situation - intermittent frame drops down to below 10 FPS for a few seconds (stuttering), then back up again.  This makes the game unplayable, as it is constantly momentarily freezing.Hope they patch this game soon to fix the optimization.  I can see now why they released a day-1 patch.  I'm not going to bother trying to play this game for a while.  The game itself seems good... just the optimization is garbage.			"

												Just Cause 2 is a really good game. I really want to love Just Cause 3, but I can't. It's probably my most regretted purchase of a game. The multi grapple is great, and the more detailed destruction physics are a blast. Aside from that, it is a much worse game than JC2.The controls are an absolute abomination, the vehicle and movement physics are atrocious, and the game has one of the worst cases of multiple-bound controls ever with no way to fix it despite having plenty of buttons on PC. Avalanche clearly knew this, because they made everything very sticky and semi-automated to try and compensate for it instead of fixing the underlying problems. The result is the most frustrating experience imaginable, spending most of your time stuck in animations or an out of control vehicle wishing you could do the simple, cool thing you want to do. Just go watch some youtube videos of someone blowing up a few bases and you'll get 95% of the fun of this game without any of the frustration.Possibly the single worst thing is that the one thing that does work right, the wingsuit, is deliberately gimped. Pitching up is extremely weak compared to all the other inputs, which eliminates the possibility for skillfully skimming just above the ground - especially combined with another ""feature"", where if you get REALLY close the the ground, you instantly dump your velocity and slow to a crawl. You wind up just taking easy routes higher up where you can't really maintain much speed, and just resorting to fast traveling everywhere since traversal is no fun.			"

												Definitely not worth it's price at 50 €. I'd recommend buying it one it's on sale with ~80% off. Then you don't feel sorry for your money and can ignore the major bugs. The gameplay itself is fun as an idea - it's meant as an action movie style game. I enjoyed JC 2 and looked forward to JC 3. But for a big company like Avalanche Studios this game's state is an embarrasement. I haven't played a game this buggy and glitchy for a long time. Most noticeable were the random crashes and sound problems where sometimes weapons sounds stopped working. The biggest fail was that if you had the ""precision aim"" mod activated, the auto-lock didn't work for anything that had that. Though every time, and it happened quite often, i enjoyed when the AI flew their aircraft into a wall or a bridge or a cliff - that was genuinely funny. For the gameplay part - everything was too prone to explode, though everything exploding was a part of the game style, it was poorly done - for example i was tethering a boat and i accidentally pulled it over a small rock and it got airborne for half a second and the boat exploded. I really needed that boat. As for the story part - it's short, like it's really short, though it's ""cleverly"" lengthened by the need to liberate provinces. It's fun, but gets monotone. The ending boss fight was boring and a huge disappointment, also the end itself. The end credits are unskippable and go on for a long time			"

Gameplay+ Wide number of vehicles.+ Big number of collectibles.+ A really big variety of equipment, specially fire-arms.+ Capturing areas requires more work now, a welcome change.+ A great sandbox in a way, due to much freedom many ways to experiment.+ The controls feel fluid, the wing-suit feels really nice same for all the other stuff.+ Aircraft's,tanks, helicopters all have unlimited missiles/machine-gun ammo, Wohoo.+ Unlocking special items requires to do some challenges now rather then just blowing stuff up, provides more challenge.+ You can now attach two objects together with your grappling-hook, this introduces many good ways to cause more mayhem now.- The driving can be seriously improved for the cars.- Many amount of bugs, sometimes there'll be always sun, sometimes always night.- The A-i can seriously use much tweaking, specially the friendly A-i its just pretty bad. - U-i is very seriously lacking, no health bar, no underwater breath bar, no time bar or anything like that.- Always online is a nightmare, just a bit of a disconnect, you'll get horrible stuttering as the game will start loading the textures and everything again.Combat has been more refined,the wing-suite is a great addition, and many new mechanics while car controls are pretty bad,much amount of bugs, and a very lacking U-i/Interface .Graphics+ Character models look pretty well.+ Water is one of the best looking so far.+ Aren't to bright and really pleasing to the eye.+ Most of the environment pretty lush and green, as well butterflies flying around just great.- Some textures look pretty bad.-  Many,many optimization issues, for some people it runs good for some people it runs bad. As well memory leak for many people.- Horrible,horrible stuttering many,many times. The only much of "" optimization "" they've done is just reduce the ( Draw distance ) ),that's not what you call optimization guys, come on.- Some graphical glitches like here, even after destroying this light it's still there that's an clear oversight by devsBefore

The character models easily one of the best specially for main character, environment's pretty pleasing lush and green, while a very bad optimization job, memory leaks,bad patching etc.Story+ A significant improvement from the past games, its actually really funny at times.Not too much to say here, its sure the "" Generic dictator story "" but a lot better than the previous game's. Sounds+OST+ Really calming and chill at times, ahh really sets the mood great sound-track.+ Really well gun/explosions/environment sounds really pleasing to the ear as well have a echo.Easily one of the most well-done parts, nothing wrong here just so pleasingConclusionWhile this genre of blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up may have gotten stale for many people specially after just cause-2, luckily this game adds much mechanics of its own and great welcome-changes, and the music and the sounds absolutely just incredible, while many bugs, and just poor optimization which is really ironic as just cause 2 was easily one of the best optimized games out there.In general you'll get more than 30 hours out of this until it just becomes to stale keep in mind.I recommend it picking up on a sale, and when dx-12 support and better optimization is there.===================================================================Click me and follow us as Curator "

												Just cause 3 is different to JC2. If you take that on board you'll have more fun!I really like JC3 although it does have flaws. The wingsuit is amazing, exploring the map is an enjoyable experience and experimenting with the mechics is endlessly hilarious. There's plenty of things to do and I found the game easily ate up 50+ hrs while liberating all the settlements, completing the storyline and getting all the collectables.Once you've done all that you're kinda left to your own devices. Unless you actively enjoy experimenting with the mechanics of the game, or happen to enjoy stunts there's not an awful lot left to do. You can reinstate individual locations and liberate them again but it's a little bit of an empty process with no goal. As a single player open world game this is a huge mistake not to add some kind of value to the game after it has been completed (DLC is on it's way but we don't have any idea of what content it will provide yet)This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to flaws. There's design decisions that leave me baffled: no FOV slider or choice of camera angles (I think they ran out of control pad buttons to use lol), assigning boost to different buttons depending on the type of vehicle you're in. The weird delay you get between stunt jumping on a vehicle and being able to grapple. The main island being virtually empty. The dumb AI. The crashing. The list goes on and on. The lack of keybindings. Jeez I could talk about the flaws for a LONG time as there are so many and they really do effect the expereince negatively.Having said all that, I'm a huge fan of the Just CAuse franchise and the possibilities the game yields. As such I'm ok with overlooking the flaws. I spend a lot of my time stunting or creating silly experiments in JC3 and it's easily been worth the money paid. Will you enjoy it as much? I'm not sure... I suppose it depends how you play games. If you follow the missions and complete the story before moving on you may miss a lot about what makes JC3 so unique and enjoyable. However if you're more creative with your gameplay then you'll likely get a lot more from the experience.Either way I'm looking to the future now as the DLC shall be here soon (hopefully with more map content) and the JC2MP Team are working on a multiplayer mod for Just Cause 3.... which will change EVERYTHING!

												First I must say that if you want this game make sure for 100% that your computer can handle it. We good? Ok. About the gameJust Cause 3 is a very fun open world action game with a huge map and very impressive explosions.In fact thats most of the fun, exploding everything in sight, or you could be setting up your own little challanges.The grappeling hook is way different than in JC2 as well as the heavily focused wingsuit in the avertisement.The game is very fun to mess around with and see all of the funy ideas and senerios the community can come up with.You can upgrade all of your items and vehicles by doing minigames, ranging from ""blow everything up with a (insert weapon or vehicle)"" to ""wingsuit from the mountain and get through all the rings"" and unlocking gears to get the upgrade, the upgrades can be turned on and off at will so its very nice incase you get something you dont want.Problems BESIDES IT NOT WORKING WELL FOR MOST PC Motorcycles, poor poor motorcycles. JC3 has some ok driving, it will seem fine and ok, but the racing challenges are when you will notice how bad the controles are especialy for the motorcycles. In some of the racing challenges they want very precise movement, but when you hit the turn button, even for a millisecond it has a 50 50 chance of either you not moving an inch or doing a 90 degree turn off a mountain and having to redo that whole 3 minutes again and again.Another problem some will find is that the enemy bases tend to have the same copy and past layout, now this isn't that bad because of all the ways you can destroy everything, but its still something that is very noticable if you go base to base liberating everything.The story also isn't very new or amazing, can't say much else about that.I would recommend this game to either diehard fans or people who can overlook these small issues, but I would really not untill the controle in the cars are fixed if you are the completionist type.

												Bottom Line - great fun but don’t trust the minimum specsThere’s four big things to do in this game: story mode, liberation, collectables, and challenges.The story mode really isn’t much, even compared to Just Cause 2.  Most of the characters aren’t very interesting and the missions really aren’t that novel but they do provide a break from the other parts of the game.The liberation is the big thing Just Cause has done for so long.  Basically, go in and blow up all the stuff with red paint on it.  But it ISN’T basic at all!  JC3 provides loads of ways to get that done from simply shooting at them to rocket launchers to tanks.  When you blow up all the red stuff in a base, your fellow rebels instantly swoop in at take over.  Liberating towns is a bit more complicated but only a bit more.  Every time you liberate a town or base, some challenges open up.There are several kinds of challenges from car/plane/boat races to handing you infinite ammo and seeing how much you can destroy in 2 minutes.  Depending on how well you do, you earn 0 to 5 stars (gears – whatever).  These are totaled up over different challenges to earn upgrades to your equipment like being able to hold more grenades or adding a nitro boost to vehicles you request.There are also many ad-hoc challenges that you can earn anytime just by playing the game.  These are things like number of kills without reloading, car jump distance, and distance travelled in a soap box car.  They will pop up in the upper right when one of them is getting near or above your personal best.It isn’t just your own score up there, though, and it isn’t every person that ever played the game including dozens of cheaters.  It’s your friends that have played the game plus a few random people (which will be replaced by more friends if they start playing the game).  I’ve enjoyed that quite a bit – it hit just the right mix of challenge and attainability for me.The collectables are mostly pretty blah.  I did enjoy collecting vehicles simply because some of them are a real challenge to get to the chop shops but the rewards for finding all the tapes/vintage parts/shrines didn’t seem to come anywhere near justifying the work you have to do to get them and there's not much fun in homing in on them or flying to a ? mark on the map.The game's grapple hook is hugely fun!  This is where your own creativity really gets a workout.  With the grapple you can pull yourself quickly forward, latch on to a car and pull yourself on top of it, latch yourself to a ledge and pull yourself up, and lots more.  You can also hold down the button after attaching and attach the other side of the grapple to something else, tethering them together.  Holding down shift then pulls those two things together.  It’s amazing what you can do with this simple mechanic!A word on the controls, which have been getting a pretty bad wrap.  The controls for the wing suit, grapple, and airplanes seem pretty bad at first.  The grapple just has a lot of functionality, though, and the wingsuit/airplanes are simply supposed to be hard to control.  You’ll get used to the grapple pretty quickly and some practice will get you flying well enough in the wingsuit and airplanes.There’s definitely some not-so-good stuff.First the specs.  A lot of folks with minimum specs are getting really poor performance.  If you’re anywhere near the lower bounds, keep your finger on the Refund button.  If you’re having performance issues you can try a few tweaks but don’t go over that 2 hour limit!For whatever reason the game makes you sit there for several seconds before it finally decides to get on with loading the game.  It’s nice in that you don’t have to interact at all to get into the game but why does it make you sit and watch Rico on the beach for so long!?  At least you've got time to go make a drink while the game loads up.There’s also just one and only one save.  If your save gets corrupted or you aren’t thinking and start a new game up… oops.  Be sure to go into the Documents\Square Enix\Just Cause 3\ folder and back up your save folder every now and again, just in case.There are some other nagging bugs but nothing too terrible.At full price the DLC might be a bit expensive for what you get but they are pretty fun and well worth it if you find them on sale.  (The XL version of the game includes all three.)  You’ll have access to them about a quarter of the way through the game and they’ll be a pretty good challenge at that point.  You might want to lay off some of the weapons you get, though, because they are devastating.  (Though it’s nice to be devastating from time to time.  ;)			"

												This game gave me a mixed bag of emotions.Firstly, the game itself is beautiful, I'm running it on a mid-spec PC and it gave me minimal problems.   The only problem with the performance are the loading times, a couple of minutes at least.HOWEVER, for all the vastness that this game promises, every outpost and town has a similar feel to them, and I felt like I was repeating myself after only 3/4 hours.   Despite this, the choice of weapons/vehicles/grapple skills allowed me to play this game through to the end of its lacklustre story.This game is nowhere near the £40 price tag it asks for, only pick this up on sale, and even then, only if you're a fan of the Just Cause series.6/10			"

												I am still in the process in playing Just Cause 3 but i feel like I have played enough to make a review. So far I am not enjoying the game overall, it is fun to play and can be fun but it has issues that make it hard to enjoy. It is a fun game but is not a great game. Pros:-Fun Gameplay-Neat Skill Tree-Epic Explosions-Wingsuit and other gadgets/movements are fun additionsCons:-Repetitive Gameplay-Many outposts that need liberating are repetitive and just tedious-Same story as JC2-Frequent Lag/Stuttering-Occasional CrashesOverall it is a fun game and I would suggest getting it on sale but be prepared to play a mediocre game that can provide hours of fun that also includes poor optimization and crashing.

												Do NOT buy this game in its current state. I would rarely give such strong criticism but on a technical level this game is broke as f*ck. I've been a huge fan of the Just Cause series for 6 or 7 years now, and JC2 was probably some of the most fun I've ever had in a game. JC3 takes everything that is great about the series and in most cases IMPROVES on it, with one catch: the game runs like absolute crap. Look at the thousands of other reviews here to see this is far from an isolated issue. I'm running on a GTX 760 (would be two if SLI was even supported...), getting a little dated now but by no means a terrible card. And yet with all graphics on the lowest settings there's still stuttering and FPS drops into the single digits every few seconds.It's such a huge shame because on the rare occassion that the gameplay isn't destroyed by FPS drops, horrible stuttering, or just flat out grinding to a halt, there is clearly an amazing game with dozens of hours of explosion-fuelled fun hiding underneath.I will update this review to positive when the devs actually do their job and release a game that actually works (I thought that was their job to begin with...?), however long it may take for patches and drivers to fix this broken game. Just another example of the sorry state of modern video games: release a sh*tty, broken game now; patch later.			"

												I really want to give this game a good review, I really do. When you can play it, the game is absolutely beautiful, with stunning vistas wherever you go, and the destruction (The main content of the game) is extremely beautiful and satisfying. However, you need to be able to actually play the game to be able to see all of this content, and since Febuary, I have been unable to log into the game in order to play it. There also seems to be a memory issue, but I cannot speak to that, as I already have 16Gb of ram. This game has so much potential, and it is really disheartening to see such a great game rendered unplayabe.Please. safe your money, don't buy this game, at least until they fix it.			"

												Sometimes, this game is incredibly satisfying to play.They way they've improved the grappling mechanics, and introduced the wingsuit, opening up a wide array of opportunities for intense takedowns and death defying stunts.But the game as a whole feels empty.Just Cause 3's brief half baked plot is riddled with needless cutscenes, which are beautifully rendered, and horribly written. Because of their graphical quality, they interrupt your gameplay with annoying loading screens which can take a minute or more even on a high end PC.Instead of being rewarded for making progress in the game, you are given less opportunities for gameplay. By the end of the game, you unlock amazing tools of destruction and mayham. However, you have also already cleared out all the game's military bases, and are unable to refresh them all at once. Instead you must refresh each individually. This detracts from an immersive experience and leads me to turn to mods to add features I feel are missing.Lastly the DRM is infuriating. If your internet connection is sub par, or if you wish to play offline, the game will periodically interrupt you, pausing your game and attempt to establish an unwanted connection.Just Cause 3 is an awesome game with a few problems so frustrating that they make me hesitate when deciding whether I want to play it again.

Awful story with crap character's. Boring world filled with nothing but open fields. Awful performance with bad memory leak. Runs bad on everything. Everything in this game is AWFUL. The challenges are awful, and some of the cool content is locked behind them.  They improved nothing over Just Cause 2 and it shows. The DLC is terrible as well.

												I REALLY want to like this game, but at the moment I really don't think it's worth 60 dollars. I've spent a little time with the game and I like some of the core functions of the game. It looks beautiful and almost every core function is an upgrade over Just Cause 2. Driving is much improved over the last game, but still doesn't hold a candle to the driving in something like GTA and I don't feel like there is a huge variety for land vehicles like there were in JC2. There are a lot of tacked on things that I don't enjoy: namely the whole gear and upgrade system. I feel like some of the game is essentially locked down until the player does all these gimmicky challenges that are pretty much bs. The rebel drop system has issues too, there are too many restrictions on it; you need to have a certain amount of beacons and on top of that, each vehicle has a cooldown. The developers should have implemented one or the other seeing as it's very common for dropped vehicles to just self destruct. The game also has some unsatisfactory performance on my system. I'm running an 8150 and a 780 which should more or less satisfy the requirements, however my gpu is under-utilized (running 60-70% gpu usage as shown by MSI Afterburner) and I get framerates anywhere from the low 30s to high 50s. My settings are mostly set to high, with shadows on medium, no AA and motion blur off. My advice would be to wait until someone makes a mod to bypass the challenges and maybe then consider the game. Personally I will keep playing it because I can't refund it at this point and the game is ok. If you see it anywhere for less than 40 bucks I think that is a worthwhile price, but I can't recommend this game at the full 60 dollar price.EDIT: I'ver found some mods that adress my issues with the gameplay: http://justcause3mods.com/mods/unlock-all-gear-mods/ http://justcause3mods.com/mods/no-rebel-drop-timers/ http://justcause3mods.com/mods/no-intro/ http://justcause3mods.com/mods/infinite-beacons/ . Game is still isn't perfect and I'm still getting some notably iffy performance, I still think it's not worth 60 dollars, but these mods make the game so much more fun to play.EDIT2: A ton of mods were broken last month including some of the ones I linked. Game performance is still meh at best. Don't pay the full $60.			"

												To make it simple, just cause 3 isn't as much fun as previous games, they have taken away a few features and now the game boils down to going from town to town ticking off a check list of things to blow up. If in 2 you enjoyed rooting around locations for the hidden boxs, that is all gone in this game, which have been replaced by unlocking mini missions when you liberate a town, these mini missions aren't fun either. the expoltions in the game are amazing and are awesome to watch every time they happen. The problem in that after a short amount of time there isnt anything new to blow up, each town has simular layout with the same looking buildings to take. Also a side note, dont know if this is just me, maybe some one could shed some light but the camera movement during flight is super amazingly slow, making fighting from a helicopter more frustrating than anything else. im going to put some more time in to it and try to like it but at this rate im going to go back to just cause 2.

												I really loved JC2, and have been looking forward to JC3 for a long time so I wish I didn't have to write this review/warning. After loading in and seeing a world made of floating triangles, I updated to beta drivers for my graphics card. The floating triangles were fixed, but now I was stuck constantly firing my weapon. Turns out having a gamepad plugged in was causing that, which was a shame because I like to drive with the gamepad. After finally fixing all these issues, I finally got to play a bit of the game. After driving round a few corners, the game crashed to desktop.Absolutely horrendous for a game that is supposed to be finished. I've played day one early-access games that work better than this.

												after about 50 hours in the game, it's time to write a review about it:In a year dominated by brilliant open-world games, Just Cause 3 still manages to make its mark in style. In a way, it’s the happy-go-lucky sibling of Metal Gear Solid 5, with both games following war-weary, bearded freedom fighters catching up with old friends, revisiting past glories and attempting to save the world just one last time. There’s no stealth, of course – Rico Rodriguez only has one volume setting, which is LOUD – and Just Cause 3 has no pretensions to art or cultural significance. It just wants to p.a.r.t.y. and cause a few big bangs along the way.This is GTA 5 without the clever script and social satire but with the destruction dial turned up to max. It’s the game Saints Row wishes it could be. It’s also the game that has more fun with physics than any game since Portal 2, and quite possibly the silliest, most overblown, most downright entertaining game of late 2015. It’s the Just Cause that you knew a Just Cause could one day be.a few words:i'm aware there is some big Fps drops in the game with AMD card specially, but if you have a good RIG, let's say a 980GTX, the game runs smooth at 50 fps ultra settings in 1440P.i had a lot of fun playing that game, i'm nearly at the end of it, i think 53 hours and the 100% is accomplished.Pros:- Hudge openworld game with endless possibility of Physic fun- New Game + , you can re-oppres outposts for endless destructions.- many Weapons, vehicles.- The world of JC3 has been put alive with animals and encounters.- Mutli-tethering with the grappleCons:- FPS drops- no SLI support atm... couldnt get the game run at 4K with the other 980- no outfits for Rico- handling of cars and choppers.... are bad... very bad for mouse and Keyboard..especially Choppers, maybe a good  Xbox One Controller will do the trick ( the game itself has been badly and simply ported to PC without changing some controlls...)I must say, i had a lot of fun in JC3, one of my favorite games in 2015 and i'll continue to play it just for fun for some amazing stunts.GreezDeacon "

												I love this game!Really, but coming from Just Cause 2 as a favourite all time sandbox.I just cant accept what this is.The only good thing this game has it going for itself are the god damn graphics! which arent even utilised well in terms of making a beautiful paradise-sic island.If you're here for the story, then you'll be disappointed, which is alright for a Just Cause game, because story has never been its thing.... Lets make it simple, in what this disappointment is compared to Just Cause 2. If you're expecting something like JC2 ofcourse.This SEQUEL, which is supposed to be an improvement, Gives you the following.Positives1. Wingsuit, For faster travel.2. Increased range for grapple.3. Good graphics. Really, they're amazing! Especially during rain.4. The AI is so much better, and this time they put up a fight.5. Physics, Everything has Physics! You'll love messing around with things in a more realistic way. (Thats a oxymoron with the grapple and all)Yep, those are the only improved things that you will LIKE in this SEQUEL, which is supposed to be an upgrade from the previous game.Its a sandbox game afterall.Lets talk about what a huge difference this game has between JC2 and itself.And trust me, these are all the negatives.1. Map is small, 1/3 of the map is ocean. Yep! Not like its a bad thing right? Wait till you see the wasteland up north, F**KING EMPTY! Everything on land looks downscaled OR upscaled, however you wanna take it. Why? Because everything is so frigging next to one another, the highway looks like some cheap rollercoaster and MORE than half the map is a f**king wasteland (You will understand once you play it) 2. FOV, its locked and its horrifying. I dont need to explain why and all of you guys that arent used to anything below 70 FOV. Going to have a hard time. Especially FPS Gamers.3. Progression. What the ♥♥♥♥ is that? Never heard of it in this game, Nowhere at all! Theres literally, NOTHING. To progress on, except for the fact that you can collect cars by driving them to garages. and the fact you can get them dropped for free. yep, No sense of management in this game compared to JC2.4. Villages and Bases. The BIGGEST disappointment is this! Villages are pretty F**king small. And REALLY, Small. The only big city you'll take over is the capital, and that too looks like a small village with a few big buildings, And every village has the same thing to destory it gets kinda repetitive, but atleast theres physics which you can utilise to make it extra fun.And the bases, Medici, is FULL of bases. There are more bases compared to villages in the town, it makes you look like almost as if its whole population is military personnel. And even in that, theres only a few Explosive items which you can blow up and some few new antennas, but this is nothing compared to JC2. really. It feels so stripped out.5. WEAPONS and VEHICLES! There we go, theres a handful of civilian vehicles and not a wide variety of weapons, at all. None!For vehicles, There are total 110 vehicles in JC2 if you own the DLC. (104 without them)While in Just Cause 3 ~80 Vehicles. Positive over JC2 is that they have better handling and design.1. You can not upgrade the vehicles in JC3 at all.2. ALL VEHICLES are speed locked. If you dive the airplane straight down from sky, it'll stay locked at its highest speed and wont increase any further for a massive speed dive.3. Vehicles explode if a pin is dropped while you're not inside For Weapaons, The catalog of weapons is cute in this game compared to JC2.1. 4 Assault Rifles, 1 LMG, 3 Rocket Launcher, 1 Grenade launcher. 2 Special FOW weapons. (Special strikes)2. No progression, at all! You cant upgrade these and they're as it is. Powerful all throughout the game.Thats it.... I know.6. Management and Airdrops, Theres nothing like this! In JC2, you had to get CHAOS and MONEY to have a drop at the cost of some money ofcourse so it gave you careful decisions you made. In this game, everything is free. you take over a base, you unlock it and get it dropped anywhere you want.Except theres a 40 minutes cooldown on tough military vehicles. I can go on more but these are the most critical disappointments one will face if you're moving from JC2.Other than that.This is a good game, except for the fact it faces a memory leak which gets annoying if you play more than 4 hours a day without shutting it down. (You can fix it by simply restarting the game)and you can find out you're having a memory leak with a weird stutter. Other than that.Game was damn good fun if i think of it as a stand-alone try-out instead of a Just Cause 2 follow up.			"

												Overall, the game is great. The scenery looks beautiful, the weapons look and sound better than in the previous games, the vehicles actually handle much better, and even the aircraft no longer have that stupid left banking tendency like in the last game. However, performance seems to be the biggest issue here (you better be watching, Avalanche). It still takes far too much just to get the performance to be smooth. You can't even run max settings on a stable FPS unless your PC build has something like an i7-5820k and an NVidia Titan. Most people don't have that kind of cash to dump into the game. I strongly recommend removing the DRM anti-piracy system for starters. Yes, it's good to prevent piracy, but the game and the sales are now suffering even worse because of that hungry system, all in an effort to prevent the studio from losing sales (ironic). Furthermore, I think the leaderboard system is something that no one really pays attention to. Avalanche, please remove that too and allow the third party devs of the Nanos team do their work. And please help them if you can. Do this, and your sales just got a whole lot better. If you have a decent enough build, I would definitely recommend this game.My Specs:AMD FX-8300 4.2 GHz16GB RAM (Kingston Hyper X @ 2.3GHz)EVGA GTX 960 SC w/ ACX 2.0 fansIMPORTANT UPDATE: Although Trix and Fkids are no longer working on JC3MP, another version of JC3MP is set for initial release this December, created by a team called Nanos.

For a game thats been out for nearly a yeah it surprises me that these issues are still present. If these issues were not present I'd recommend this game at a discount.Oh and the driving is just plain bad...especially on a mouse an keyboard, with a gamepad it a little better.			"

												TL:DRSadly, this game is a mere shell of its forming self.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the JC series since the original and I had high hopes for JC3 and I would have pre-ordered it myself if it wasn't for all the negative reviews, and to be honest - it really does warrent a negative and a not recommended review simply because of all the major bugs and issues which plague this otherwise *fun* game.Hijacking was one of the fun, and major elements to the previous games - thats been thrown completely out of the window and made USELESS here,  try to hijack and enemy helicopter and 9 out of 10 times, it'll end in death as either the pilot will seamingly commit suicuide by flying into the ground or some other stupid method to kill you,  or the ""2nd"" Helicopter will fire on the one your trying to hijack and again, often destroying it (and you) in the process - lets not forget, the enemies have a strange 90* degree firing arc for some stupid reason as well, because I've seen them facing one direction and rockets flying from them at an angle...go figure?   Then,  throw in enemy ships that are just insanely deadly into the mix..basically have to accept the fact they are going to kill you. Avalanche removed many features that made Just Cause 2 a better game,  such as the minimap - this was an important feature and you could actually see the enemies being rallied against you, so you had at least some time to mount a defence, or plan your attack better - this is just an unfair run and gun affair without any cover system, because frankly - the way the enemies have a near 100% accuracy against you...you need it.  Having enemies literally spawn just out of view...nearly constantly ruins the immersion and really makes the gameplay needless more difficult and frustrating especially once your chain stunned by shotgun guys, or being bombarded by helicopter or tanks. Pro'sFun with plenty of mayhemPlenty of Vehicles to driveLarge open worldGreat graphicsCon'sUnfair game mechanicsEnemy accuracy is too highSpawn rate is too highEnemies spawn behind youCan be hugely frustrating			"

												I liked Just Cause 2 and wanted to support Just Cause 3 -- a singleplayer game (a dying breed?) with no DRM, no forced social network interaction, and a good PC port.Unfortunately, it instead turned into my first ever Steam refund request.  The game has 3rd-party DRM, and even worse, it's hidden in the EULA linked from the Steam page instead of advertised on the Steam page itself.The game also apparently has some forced social / leaderboard messages that cannot be disabled.Lastly, it is not even a good PC port as far as I can tell.  Performance seems to be poor across a variety of machines, and there is not yet a performance patch that I am aware of.  It runs poorly for me even at the starting area(s) of the game after adjusting settings down.One last note -- the game starts with a long, unskippable menu screen.  No loading even appears to happen during this (no hard drive activity), AND since this is a PC game, restarting the game multiple times is to be expected while adjusting settings.  Having a huge unskippable menu screen is very painful in this regard.Just Cause 2 was a very pleasant experience in the above areas, and Just Cause 3 is one of my saddest disappointments I have ever purchased.  Hopefully the refund goes through.  *edit*  The refund went smoothly through in 1 day, kudos to Valve.			"

Just Cause 3 is a very good game. Its fun, enjoyable and almost a game genre of its own.Its its basically Just Cause 2, but they took everything bad about it out, and put better and more fun stuff in. It is no way realistic and you can clearly see it. Its an action, sandbox, story, explode everything game. Which I love!The story is far much better then in JC2, as I actually liked it this time, its quite short though, but expected from a non-story based/driven game. The map is huge, but I would say it feels smaller than JC2's as one third of the map is wilderness...I don't have anything bad to say about it really. Its fun and enjoyable. What a game is supposed to be. Even-though my game-play hours total is a minor % of my Just Cause 2 game-time. I still enjoy it.I kinda prefered Just Cause 2 more, but I would say Just Cause 3 is a better, upgraded game.If you enjoy killing and exploding things, as-well as Just Cause 2. Buy it.9/10 "

												Rico Rodriguez is back!First, I have to admit I am a JC fanboy, this game got me since the first installment. Dunno why but I found the gamedesign, phantasmagoric (ab)use of grappling hook in particular very entertaining. I spent dozens maybe hundreds of hours just flying across San Esperito or Panau if you like, setting on fire anything which could have been set on fire, destroying anything which could have beed destroyed. When JC3 was announced I was happy and was looking forward.I was very surprised when I noticed that reviews of JC3 are mixed mostly due technical issues, but it is understood. To be honest, there are no technical problems for me, I am the lucky one. After 60 hours of playing I have got just one single crash, that is it. Everything is smooth and rock solid. But I do not deny there are some issues just because I do not have one.JC3 story is bland but c'mon, JC has never been about the story, it is pure madness full of explosions and silly travelling across the huge map.Gameplay is what a fan of JC franchise could have wished for - grappling hook, explosion, some racing, shooting explosion again, grappling hook, missile ride, shooting, grappling hook, explosion, shooting, explosion, grappling hook... Oh, did I mention the grappling hook?I am not disappointed, this game is true JC as I remembe and love. For the fans of JC it is must have. For the others - well, I would say try JC2 first, if you love it you will love JC3 too. If not then hands off, there is nothing new except some small but handy improvements (wingsuit!).I hope there are still some nasty dictators in the virtual world who need to be overthrown by Rico in the future! :)			"

Rico from JC3 looks like a soccer dad. I want to like this game, but sadly, the only real cool feature is the Wingsuit. Which makes the game less disappointing. I will change my review if im wrong or if the devs patches and DLCs can add more appeal.			"

												TL;DR ""Where's the DLC I can purchase to get a stable framerate?""I want to recommend this game. I really, really do. The game itself at its core is just as fun, if not more fun, than JC2. When the game works, it is a very satisfying experience, and definitely screams I AM A VIDEO GAME AND I AM PROUD LOOK AT ALL THE FUN I'M GIVING YOU. But development priorities have been put on their Season Pass content instead of trying to optimize the game and plugging the memory leaks that have been plaguing the community for almost a year now. We can only hope that with the last DLC coming out just around the corner, the devs will try their best to help fix performance issues. Avalanche is not an incompetent Dev. But they're certainly trying to change my opinion at this point.			"

 Great game let down by lack of polish/patches Well I was one of the lucky few to avoid the performance issues, however in-spite of those, the game will still attempt to ruin your afternoon...Let me start on a more positive note though... The game can be balls to the wall fun, it is also a very visually impressive game and the 'air of the clone brush' while still present in JC3, is far less obvious than in JC2. I personally had a great time exploring and traveling around Medici. HOWEVER.  It was also one of the most frustrating games I have played in a long time, not in terms of difficulty, but rather from how often I would get proverbially screwed by the game in one way or another. Let me rattle off a bit of a list of common grievances I had with it (written from the games perspective):You touched your heli down on a slight slope? Yeah it explodes and you dieYou jumped out of the heli 5ft from the floor? Time for Micheal Bay! Kaboom it goes!Oh you have traveled over to another part of the map? Well I haven't realised you are here, nothing has loaded and you clip through the terrain. Better restart your game Hombre.There was a femto second I could not communicate with the Square Enix servers? Yeah I am just going to slam you on pause to inform you.Hey you generated heat? Here is a pro-tip every time the radio states more units are inbound or heli's are coming, just look behind you, I always spawn them behind you! It's not obvious I swear.Wow check you out, Mr.SpeedDemon, oh wait, what's that? You took your car onto a bridge, yeah screw you, it flips and explodes.Hey I need you to complete this objective... What do you mean you can't? Oh that's right I haven't actually spawned it in. Teehee.Hey look here is an optional challenge. Hey nice going you are nearly done.... Oh damn it looks like a civilian 20ft up the road was spooked, crashed his car and died. Innocent hurt yo, you fail the challenge!(This is my favourite one:) Here protect this convoy which contains a mission critical objective and blow the bridge up so they can't chase you across it... Hey nice going you did it! Oh wow look your driver in the objective truck just literally drove his truck off the bridge... BTW you fail the mission, better restart! *JustCause3.exe has stopped working*There was many more niggles and issues I had with the game but those are the standout and memorable of the lot. It is honestly a shame because when the game was getting going with explosions, chaos and the like. It was incredible fun, but then some aggravating annoyance would crop up and ruin it. Nigh on game-breaking bug: If you do buy this game and play it with a mouse and keyboard, there is a mission whereupon you need to protect a plane of one 'Rosa Manuela' now the game was not apparently tested by QA because if you play the mission with the precision aiming upgrade turned on, the homing missiles on your plane do not work. If it doesn't work even after you turn off the precision aim upgrade, you need to launch steam in Big Picture mode and then relaunch the game and it will work... Yeah go figure why that's a thing. If you think you will just dogfight manually... not an option I am afraid, all the enemy jets are way faster than you and will destroy the target before you can close the gap to the objective.  TL:DR	In short... Bargain bin. If you are lucky you will avoid the technical issues, but still be hit with annoyance and contrivance. Wait for a sale or play Just Cause 2			"

												Such a disappointment and thats sad cause it had some cool additions like wingsuit which is a perfect thing for this game.But some things are much worse than previous. It feels like this game came out too quickly, should have been in development for another year.  More things worse than better compared to Just Cause 2, one of my favorite games.Motorbikes are uncontrollable. I have to wait half an hour to drop another same type a vehicle? why?Now it is limited amount i can request a drop and i have to travel to get more beacons, pointless boring step added.Planes control worse. Map is not as varied as in JC2. Awful optimization. No side quest like JC2, instead boring repetitive challanges (except for the wingsuit one, liked that one). Main quest are not as cool as in JC2 also. Was really excited about this game, instead this franchise is getting milked. Meh.			"

You don't kill X people to unlock or upgrade something so you can passively progress, you go to a specific location to do a specific action over and over and over at infinitime, making it a chore.

												Generic, bland, repetitive, insipid... bascially after 4 hours, you have probably experienced everything the game has to offer. I liked just cause 2 but somehow, this game only imrpoved explosions and graphics and made everything else worse.			"

												I am loving this game. It has actually pulled me away, somewhat, from fo4. Im glad they didnt butcher it and its still the Just Casue games i love. Theres a difference between the other crybaby reviews and myself. The game sometimes crashes but I dont look only at that. I look at the amazing amount of work that went into making it and how fun it is. Im sure eventually the bugs will get worked out and Im ok with that.			"

												I am hearing a lot of negative reviews about performance and frame drops. I got a GTX 780, i7-4770K, 32 GB RAM and the game is running perfectly for me. Maybe it is not just your Graphics card but your motherboard, ram, GPU.  I am hearing people who have a GTX 980 or 70 saying that it is not running well. All I can say I am sorry for you all who have a technical problem.I like the game! The graphics are great, perfect FPS no drops, The story is ok nothing special but the action is more important and in General the game is good! I would recomend people who has a good PC and who love explosions and non stop action.Thank you all for taking your time to read this review and have a great day!			"

												CONS- you can't just enter a vehicle by pressing the interaction button, while within a specific radius of the vehicle, like in GTA, you have to look directly at the vehicle's door to enter it, which makes it difficult to escape a firefight before the vehicle starts burning/ gets destroyed (especially annoying when you found a rare vehicle, like a good chopper/ jet)- car handling is the worst- bike handling is even worse- plane handling sucks as hell- takes forever to login, especially when i can't login for some reason, it tries to, every f***ing time, that I pause the game,    which takes forever- game won't keep my keybindings, resets them everytime that I restart the game- bike/car handling is even worse when using a controller- vehicle physics suck as hell (you hit the curb with high speed then your car jumps 8ft in the air and performs a 180)- buttons to use your plane's rudder are 'x' and 'b', not 'rb' and 'lb' (xbox 360 cntroller) like in GTA V, for example, which doesn't make any sense at all and you can't change them- key to use nitro in planes is the same as the one to increase thrust (means that I have to release that key in order to let the nitro refill, which means that I'm slowing down, which sucks in plane races)- don't expect a vehicle handling like in GTA V... in Just Cause 3 it just feels like a massive input lag... whenever you are driving fast and you tip your 'a' or 'd' key, your car/bike doesn't react at all... but whenever you hold your 'a' or 'd' key, your car/bike starts turning like hell- grappling hook range is too low (especially when using a parachute/ wingsuit)- game used to stop detecting my keyboard whenever i changed my key settings after starting the game (I was unable to do anything, had to end the game)... SEEMS TO BE FIXED- key bindings system is annonying as f***, because some actions share the same key, e.g. reloading your weapon on the bike and firing the secondary weapon in your plane/chopper- you can't run- you can't go directly out of wingsuit mode, you have to open your parachute first, in order to land... I WAS WRONG...YOU CAN.. YOU JUST HAVE TO UNLOCK THIS ABILITY- have you ever tried to drive a truck or bus? you have to constantly hold you 'a' or 'd' key for a couple of seconds to turn your wheels, which makes its almost impossible to effectively use those vehiclesPROS- map is huge- game is fun (as long as you don't HAVE to use vehicles, as in races)(don't know if the following arguments are PROS)- boat handling is ok- chopper handling is okEven though there are many CONS, the game still is a lot of fun!But I hope that the negative reviews might get the developers' attention and cause them to fix some points.

												There's a lot to like about this game. Unfortunately, Steam Controller support is not one of those things.Initially, the game came out with no steam controller support, this meant that the game gave you lots of lag when you had a control scheme that mixed gamepad and keyboard/mouse inputs. They actually fixed it in a later patch, which made the game MUCH more enjoyable to play, only to break it again in a subsequent patch. Their support has no idea what's going on.I don't recommend this game at this time although I will change the review if they fix their steam controller support again.			"

Let's face it: the game is badly optimized. With my quite good build, I ram like crazy unless I turn everything down. So basically, I play on low-medium settings so that I don't experience framerate issues, but even then I get sometimes some drops.EDIT:Since the recent patch it's much better, as I can run it in full-medium settings (and 1080p) without any framerate issue, so that's a big plus.Now let's review itI'll do my usual thing, a pros and cons list.Pros1) The game, even if I play on low settings, looks good. It's colorful, bright, smooth, and the explosions are incredibly enjoyable2) The sounds are ok, and the voice actors (for the french version at least) are really funny and well done.3) I liked the musics, even though they are quiet and you don't really hear them.4) The gameplay is fun and addictive. I love the wingsuit, I enjoy moving through the mountains with my gears, the shooting is fun. Though I had to remap a bit my controls because I wanted it to feel like Just Cause 2, it plays well, and it is fun.5) The explosions and the grappling hook... Nothing else to say, it's just well done. The game become somewhat a physics-based game with the ability to use your grappling.6) Huge map, a lot of places to blow up.7) I don't have any problem with this leaderboard thing, I find it fine and a good thing, to compare yourself with other people.Cons1) You won't give a crap about the story, as for Just Cause 2.2) The map is too big. Yes, I said it was a pro, but my main problem is when you try to go from an island to the other. If you don't have a jet, it'll take forever to crosse the water.3) I still don't get how the chaos work for this episode - might change this point once I figure it out.4) As stated above, the optimization, it's still not great, but they are working on it.ConclusionOverall, this game is a fun experience, if you like blowing things up and killing people like there is no tomorrow (which is my case so...). If you want deep story, dark intrigue, multiplayer mode or realistic gunfight, just ignore this game. I think that if you liked Just Cause 2, you'll like this one too. It's not perfect, it surely isn't as good as JC2, but it's fun, and it gives you explosion, so it's nice.BEFORE ANYONE ASK FOR MY CONFIG:Intel Core i7 4970k quadcore 3.6GHz16Go DDR3 RAMNvidia GTX960 with 2Go GDDR5And I run on Windows 10			"

												JC2 vs JC3...In JC2, the military bases were so incredibly similar, that not one base was memorable. Every base take over became a test to see how fast I could complete yet another base take down.In JC3, base take overs seem a little different. The bases and cities are built on mountain terrain, which makes most bases seem unique. But now I have gotten to an area which seems to always have a base built into a giant hole in the ground.JC3 has enough challenges after taking down a base, that it mixes up the monotony. But some of these challenges became so mundane and hard, that you will find yourself choosing the F1 race car (DUO) on the first attempt. Or the wingsuit challenges you can get 5 stars (gears) on the first try, cause you are so good at it.The most fun challenge is over-coming your friend's scores, since they are human. Plus your friend's ghost can be fun to race against. -----Multiplayer is a mod.Currently, nothing spawns in the world automatically.But you can spawn many vehicles and guns. You have most of the unlocks already unlocked on you, even jetpacks!You can't tether two items together.You can type ""t"" then ""/tp volcano"" to tp to the volcano. Similar for a few other locations, like statue.You can destroy bridges.You can kill each other. A player respawns where they died, with 5 seconds spawn protection.We raced around the island on the train track, after flying planes into each other and running each other over. Actually, I tried to kamikaze my jet into my friend repeatedly while he tried to bazooka me with different bazookas.A real easy guide to mp:

												Although poorly optimised this game ís in my opinion better than Just Cause 2 from a completionist's prespective. In Just Cause 2 getting 100% completion was impossible and getting close was extremely tedious due to it having more than 1000 collectibles. This game is much more managable and much more rewarding in terms of completing the game because of fewer collectibles and indicators showing you what chaos objects still need to be destroyed in a base.Edit: The indicators showing you which chaos objects are yet to be destroyed will never straight up tell you where the remaining objects are. They will only tell you what kind the remaining ones are.			"

												Just Cause 3 - Square EnixHonestly, this game surprised me. I though this was gonna be another far cry 4, but the expectations I had were exceeded. Square Enix hired the best to turn this game into a bavarium supergame. (play the game) Di Ravello and Rico and every character has a deep background and lets you play through the game seamlessly. This is better than GTA, however the explosions could be slightly more realistic. A tank with bavarium does not just break, it explodes and makes it HUGE. But nonetheless, if you aren't a sticler for videogames being extremely realistic, you'll love JUST CAUSE 3. Also, if you want the reason why DiRavello is a true maniac, look for his audiobooks. They're extremely helpful.			"

												This game is worth every penny in my opinion! The map is pretty huge and has loads of content. I am writing this with about 17 hours of playtime (Was AFK for about 3, so let's say 14 hours of actual gameplay), and I have completed about 30-35% of the game, when you include all content (Hidden treasures, etc.)Capturing bases is a lot of fun, but it does get kinda repetitive with time. But one thing that never gets old is CHAOS. Yes, capturing one base after another can be kind of a drag, if you do it for 5 hours straight, but even so, the chaos you create is still awesome! This game is made for chaos only. And you can really feel that! Some of the weapons later are VERY overpowered and explosive (Hooyah!). The amount of bullets it takes to kill Rico is a bit over the top, but I believe it was made this way to ensure maximum uptime for destruction!So all in all, a very nice game with MANY hours of gameplay!

												There are few games I've really wanted to love as much as Just Cause 3, and even fewer that are as hard to love.Just Cause 3 is one of those kind of games in which the developer has absolutely no idea as to why the original game was popular, similar to Saints Row 3 for instance. What it leads to is a lot of changes no one wants that somehow makes it a massively worse game overall. Avalanche handing the game off to their New York based studio as opposed to doing it themselves is likely playing no small part in that.The game immediately starts off with a scripted sequence in which you stand around on a plane doing... A whole lot of nothing. This in itself sets the tone for all of the missions ahead pretty well. They can all be amounted to one of two tasks; you either have to protect something/someone, or you have to destroy something. It gets incredibly stale incredibly fast, and with them adding a lot of scripted elements into the mix for these too; it also becomes really unfun.Now if you thought just the game part of the missions was bad enough, you thought wrong, because there's still the atrociously bad story to take into account too. All the writing is just plain not funny or engaging in the slightest, and I think Mario might be one of the most obnoxiously written characters I've yet to encounter in a video game. He is the closest I've seen a video game come to making it's very own Jar-Jar Binks. Constantly in your face since the developers were oh so certain you would love him, and constantly incredibly unfunny. Thankfully, at least the developers themselves must have realized how awful their writing is, because they did have the decency to make it incredibly easy to just skip all cutscenes.That's enough for just the missions, as for the rest of the game and more specifically the gameplay it's something of a mixed but mostly bad bag. I will begin by saying that I really enjoy using the wingsuit to move around, it was a needed addition that does the game well. If the wingsuit itself was the welcome addition to the game, then the gear mod upgrade system is most definitely the unwelcome one. In an attempt to copy a lot of other modern games, they added a system for upgrading your tools to get a lot of basic abilities. All it leads to is removing the sense of freedom that Just Cause 2 had, in which you were always capable of doing everything at any given point.  Rico himself feels like he controls a bit more heavily, and the camera tends to be just a lot too zoomed in, too. All in all, the gameplay just completely lacks the freedom which Just Cause 2 had. Which is, again, an example of the developers completely failing to understand anything about what made it good.On first glance, the map and the activities around it seem a lot more interesting, but soon you realize there's not actually a whole lot to them. They are all pretty same-y and quickly stop being fun. Activities almost all amount to you needing to fly/drive through rings or destroy some stuff. Probably the only creative ones are the ones for upgrading the tether, in which you use the tether to attach a ball to your car then drive it around collecting rocks. Yet the gear mod system I mentioned earlier is directly tied to them and how you do in them, so you have no choice but to continue doing them in order to get the most out of your various gadgets. These activities are also how they try to compensate for the much, much smaller map than that of Just Cause 2, but with how monotone they quickly get it just does not work at all. The settlements themselves are a bit more fleshed out than those of Just Cause 2, but the amount of fleshing out does in no way compensate for just how much less content there is.Oh and on a quick footnote, the PC port itself is absolutely horrendous as well. Terrible performance on systems that should run it just fine, and memory leak issues causing frequent crashes. It's an absolute joke of a PC port and it makes me sick that it's been out this long without them having done much to fix it.In conclusion, or a tl;dr for those not interested in this wall of text. Just Cause 3 is an incredibly disappointing game both as a sequel to Just Cause 2 and as a game of its own. It does very little right, and very much wrong. I can't possibly recommend it to anyone at all, even less at the price they are currently asking for it. It's just not even remotely worth it.			"

												Unfortunately, it seems that the overall optimisation wasn't that great (as of the time I've written this review)I have to say, my PC isn't a beast, however it is not crappy either.I run Win10 64bit, With a  Geforce GTX 650ti, CPU Intel I5 3330 3.00GHz and 8Gb of Ram.Yet, I have to run the game with the lowest settings and get some intense Lag spike (sometime it' just unplayable)I've been playing games like GTA 5 or The Witcher 3 with higher settings without problems. But, The game is fun. I can't say otherwise. It's really fun to play. Maybe it's just my PC which is getting old. I do want to recommend this game, it's really fun to play. Even though I run the lowest settings, the Game looks pretty good. It's a very enjoyable game when it works. It's fun to mess around with the world.  I love destruction and I was very hypped by this game.If it wasn't for the performance loss,  Id give this game a good 8/10Buy the game if you have a powerful machine.Buy the game if you want to play on Console.It's really fun.However, I have to give this game a 5/10.PROS:Huge map! Seriously, It takes a while to explore. I haven't seen everything yet.Loadings Well. the only long one is the startup. There isn't any other loading except for the cutscenes.Though Rico Rico is hard to kill.  Unless you get hit by a dozen of people nonstop, you won't die easily.Destruction The game offer some very good destruction physics. I love blowing up bridges.  It's certainly not perfect but it's really nice.Creativity It leaves places for the players's creativity. There is many ways to blow up things. trie them out.CONSLAG! I often ended up under 30FPS which makes many of the challenges very difficult.Repetitive, Well, If you don't like blowing up stuff, that's basically all you will do. The only way to find a way around this is to use your creativity to find different ways to take out the enemy bases or cities.Missing Basic controls Ok, so that might just be me, but I wish there was more options for Rico.  I can't seems to cover myself, Crouch or even Run.  That would have been very nice.			"

												As I write this review I currently have played 53 hours over the past week since launch, and I believe this is enough time to make an accurate review. First off I would like to say that it is a great game and despite the many performance and technical issues people are having I believe it is a really good game. I myself have no had any issues to speak of besides the occasional crash, which is to be expected in a game less than a week old. In my setup currently I have an R9 290x with the latest drivers an FX 8350 and 16gb of ram. I run this game maxed out and get 60fps most of the time except during explosions which I believe is due to my CPU. When buying this game I had hoped for a game that was similar to Just Cause 2 but just had more features and was overall a better more polished game. It did not disappoint, the addition of the wingsuit is enough for me to want to buy the game. Nothing beats soaring through the skies or gliding across the ground in a wingsuit.  This game brings all the great things that we all loved from Just Cause 2 and more, I cannot reccommend it enough.  Although the story may not be great, for me the game isn't about the story I play it for the free roam and base liberation, the story to me is more or less just a side mission. Overall this is a great game and has many amazing features that solidify this game as my favourite game of the year even taking top spot over the Witcher 3: WIld Hunt. Even though many people have had performance issues my game runs as smooth as butter. All in all a fantastic game. I reccomend.			"

												Triple A game that still runs like hot sh*t 2 weeks after release and a patch. If you use AMD, don't buy this game (as of now)Edit: There has been another patch. I still get ~ 3 fps while looking at the ground. 30 fps max, and only in short bursts. 3 weeks from release now, and still unplayable.Edit # 2: I have upgraded my computer and am now able to play this game, coinciding with a patch that I cannot testify to, but the release of this game was so awfully handled that I cannot change my review now. As for the game, it is fun and looks pretty good when playing, but it is very shallow gameplay. If you're just looking to blow stuff up and you have an above average system, then maybe I can recommend it, but for the majority of people, I think this game would be a bad investment.			"

												JC3 basically takes the same formula from JC2 and turns it up several notches. The wingsuit is an absolute treat to fly around in and the new grapple mechanics give you an incredible toolkit for destruction. However, several of the notches are undoubtly placed backwards. Vehicle handling is questionable at times; you can hit a pebble and spin wildly out of control (this is even with a controller). Motorcycles are terrible compare to their counterparts in the previous game and are not worth using at all. Medici is a vast and gorgeous place but portions of it are completely devoid of content. For example, the entire upper half of the largest island is nothing more than scattered villages and outposts.There's no awe inspiring capital city to speak of and a complete lack of more interesting and unique locales like the previous title. The game tries to pass it off as part of the backstory but it honestly feels more like a rush job. Unfortunately the game is also riddled with constant crashes and memory leaks. Hopefully these get resolved in due time. Recommended but with some reservation. There are some performance problems and some questionable design changes but they don't dampen the core gameplay that is Just Cause. Blowing stuff up and creating chaos in a sandbox is still some good, chaotic fun.			"

												First time I've played a game in the Just Cause franchise, and I'm very pleased. Rico has a lot op potential to cause chaos and destruction. Also adding the wingsuit is nice. I think this is one of the best games that passed in 2015!Pros:- Explosions and more explosions!- Wonderful map and game world.- Wingsuit nice addition.- Upgrades-systemCons:- Technical defects.- Story could be better.- Some wingsuit missions are really hard to get 5 gear mods.- Online server issues are annoying.9/10			"

												I would love to say that Just Cause 3 is the best action and epic game ever. It's so enjoyable. If you are an action game lover than you should definitely try this game. This incredible thing is full of epic actions. After all, i got a super game as my own taste. I bet you'll sure love it. Such a vivid colorful environmetal game. Mostly sea area which covered with shiny sunlight. The aqua blue color of sky just scattered on the water which makes environment more tasty. That was hella fantastic feeling when i was flying like a bird in the sky above blue water.Well, There is nothing to explained about combat in this game. Just shooting with tons of skills you earned and you learnt. They featured so many types of weapons and vehicles. Those are badass. Especially blowing up vehicles and machines seems stunning tho. But the sound of explosion was so much real and remarkable. We can use grappling hook for stunning epic actions as always. I use it all the time for better action which makes it beyond epic scene. There is many more things about to explain. But it would be better if you try it yourself.Wait wait wait, there is one more unique thing i have got that is Rebel Drop. Well, it's a app what we can use by collecting Beacon. We can choose our desired weapons and vehicles for Rebel Drop. But it depends on your Rebel Drop slots. It can be applied by just throwing beacon on any place. Then after a boom blast, you will get your gears. You can find those Beacons around the Medici.The open world map of this game is 4X bigger than the map of Grand Theft Auto V, They just putted the entire world in this game. Every state of it's map is full of side missions for unlocking story missions. You can't play story missions if you don't conquere the world. Fina Story Mission gonna be unlocked after conquering 100%. So you can't ignore it. By the way, you have to unlock fast traveling way by completing few tasks. Then it's gonna be bit easier than before for traveling the world far quickly.I have to say Just Cause 3 is quiet optmized game. Um playing on Ultra High settings smoothly as hell. My rig's Intel Core i5 4690K, RAM 8GB DDR3, R9 Vapor-X 290 4GB GDDR5. Also um not getting any kind of Lags, Bugs, Errors and Crashes. But sometimes it took so much time on loading screen when i start the game. But after that, everythings perfect as hell.Pros :::1. Best action and epic game ever2. Massive open world map with tons of side quests and activities3. Remarkable graphics quality which shines gorgeously at day time4. Quiet amazingly optimized5. New amazing unique features for better gameplay experienceCons :::1. Sometime takes high time on loading screen when i start it2. Graphics quality seems bit disappointing at night.Question you may ask :::1. Is it well optimized ?Ans : Yep it is2. Did they fix the vehicle driving physics in this one ?Ans : well, it's still bit hard to control cars but it's far better than before3. Can i just play story missions then i will complete side quest time by time ?Ans :  Nope, you have to complete side quests to unlock story missions.4. Did you get any crashes like JC3.Exe stopped working ?Ans : Nopps. it was fresh and clean game for me5. Do i have to stay online all the time to play this game ?Ans : No, you can play this offline also. But it's quiet enjoyable to play online for your gameplay record and scoresRatings :::Gameplay : 10/10Actions : 10/10Graphics Quality : 8/10Story : 7/10Optimization : 9/10Open World Activities : 10/10Locations : 10/10Features : 10/10Overall : 9.2/10So this is what i can say for now about it. Will provide you amore infos time by time. Thanks to all. Have a thrilling weekend with this fabulous game.			"

												The Just Cause series is great and this game has continued the trend. For the most part I really enjoy playing it however there are a few improvements which would make the game even better.Pros:- it's beautiful- wingsuit is really fun- movements are very fluid and intuitive- hilarious gameplay and dialogue- infinite supply of bavarium explosives (basically triggered explosives from JC2)Cons:- no minimap or healthbar- requires a fairly new graphics card (I could play Just Cause 2 on max settings but I can just barely run JC3 on minimum settings)- the camera always gets too close to your vehicle if you crash into something or fly off a cliff, makes it annoying to drive- you can't unlock gear mods by just using your kit in combat... you HAVE to do the challenges or else no mods for you- storyline is repetitive... starts feeling like you're doing the same missions over and over again (even pointed out in dialogue that you've done the same exact thing before)			"

HAVING TO LOG IN EVERY SINGLE TIME I START THE GAME ON A SERVICE THAT COULD HAVE USED STEAM. not a complete deal breaker but it still takes ages,its just cause, the gameplay is explosions and huge and it is fun, I would reccommend it (but I might not say the same for people with amd graphics cards, havent played it with one (nvidia right here) but people have said it isnt great)			"

												I. Love. This. Game.I loved Just Cause 2 with all of my heart.. but now Just Cause 3 has stolen that love.Why? Because this game has better graphics than real life! It kind of makes me want to blow up a large tank filled with gas or whatever just to see what it actually looks like. Not just the graphics make me love this game though, the grappling device is probably the greatest game idea of all time. I mean how can you go wrong being able to pull down large objects and watch chaos ensue? Or maybe string together multiple enemies and drag them behind your super sport car, or you could be nice and help old ladies across the street... quickly... and violently. I also like the gear mod idea but honestly, will probably just get a mod that unlocks them all lol. Oh yeah, the map is very very very large. Even with a cool wingsuit to get around, the map is still so big, and it's all Rico's too destroy.10/10 will continue to destroy Di Ravello's hopes and dreams one military base at a time...			"

												I Really wanted to love this. Since the first trailer I was overwhelmed with hype, however, here it is.Ill start by saying, this game is beautiful, graphically speaking.Again, HOWEVER, the pc port is porely optimised, and I was getting huge frame drops, on a  GTX 970.Though the wingsuit is a GREAT feature, I found myself getting bored, as the story missions are locked behind repetitive liberations, where you blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up. BLOWING♥♥♥♥♥♥UP IS GREAT, especially in a game about blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up, you'd expect it to be. sigh, HOWEVER, the novelty of blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up quickly wears off, and the story becomes increasingly stale.It lacks an FOV slider. cmon, guys, there is also no ability to remap gamepad controls. wtf?I decided to go for keyboard+mouse, and remap the controls to jc2's. big mistake. for the controls to properly function you need to dive into the games files, and remap them there, otherwise there is overlap, that can't be changed. (I'm looking at you, ""F"" key.)This game has, without a doubt, the prettiest explosions, and prettiest world, in pc gaming for this year. (excluding GTA V), props to avalanche for that.Aiming in requires an unlock. And spriting is gone aswell, I'm going to overlook this, as the game has a lot of controls, and it is supposed to be a console game, at heart, but seriously.Like i mentioned at the start, I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE THIS, but it's fallen flat on its face, compared to Just Cause 2. 5/10. perhaps a patch can solve a few of the issues, performance wise, if so, ill bump it up to a 6. Verdict: Buy it, play it for a bit, see if you like it, if not, refund it, like I unfortunately did. Have Fun.			"

												This is one of the best games that i have ever played, if not the best.But should you buy it? Short answer. Depends how well your computer can perform, and how much money you want to spend. This is a great game, very stunning, this includes the vehicles, Rico himself and just the world.  The weapons are great, flying around is fun, pretty easy to get used to the controls. Some downsides to this game is that it is very short, it is easy to finish and liberate all of the areas. Also the motorbike controls are horrible on both keyboard and controller. Back to the main point, should you get this. If you have Just Cause 2, then yes, it's a good sequel. If you don't have Just Cause 2 and you are not sure if you will like this seris, then get Just Cause 2. If your computer sucks, then Just Cause 2. But if you have the money and a great PC, then i highly reccomend you get this game, it is fun to mess around and beat your friends on the in-game leaderboard. "

												Got no idea why the reviews are this harsh. Just Cause 3 is an amazing game to just chill out to. -----* Positives:* Amazing graphics*Great storyline, colourful characters* Huge map* Lots of vehicles, weapons* Explosions are amazingNegatives:* Luckily you'll be able to grab quicktravel later on, because even though flying is amazing, traveling can take a while* Controls, especially driving, take a while to get used to. Driving feels wonky and some vehicles are tough to control alltogether. You'll be fine once you're more used to it, but still.* I don't enjoy the grinding to get better 'mods' (upgrades), but I think that's personal.Overall, great game.

												TL;DR: I really like this game for it's simple yet satisfying gameplay and pretty colors.This is a very fun game. The game is based around the grappling hook, wing suit and parachute, and these mechanics alone allowed me to sink hours into it. Just flying around is very satisfying and relaxing. The gameplay apart from that is crazy, you blow stuff up in different locations, which pretty much describes the entire game and its plot. The game doesn't take itself serious (only briefly in the end for some reason), and that's what I like about it. It's just one big pile of explosions and flying around.There's also cool challenges that you can complete around the world. What I liked about these are that they integrate with the massive open world nicely and smoothly. Speaking of the world, it's beautiful and colorful.The game is not too challenging to complete, although it gets harder when you progress in the story (or by liberating more settlements?). Only when I tried to liberate the central commands had I any chance of dying.In my eyes the game is perfectly enjoyable, except for a few issues: The game tries to promote the use of vehicles a lot, but there's no reason to use them as flying around is faster and more flexible. I only ever stole jets for blowing up bases more easily. The other more serious flaw with the game is the framerate. I have a decent setup (120 fps in GTA V), but for whatever reason the fps never really reached 60. At times the fps looked like it was capped at 30 too, and dropped frequently during that period. The game could do with some optimization in that aspect.			"

												Another great game from Avalanche Studios that can make even Michael Bay feel jealous!This time the action takes place in Medici, an archipelago with a mediterranean look where everything seems to be latinized. The voice acting of most characters is done with an italian accent and sometimes they sound funny. Even the PSAs that you hear on the radio after liberating a base are hilarious.The game doesn't take itself too seriously. Story is generic, just as expected, but you are here for the action and to blow stuff up - and that is where the game shines. Explosions look awesome with nice particle effects and Rico Rodriguez, the one-man-army, has a lot of creative ways to make things go BOOM. You can use a wide variety of guns and vehicles, but some of your best and most fun toys unlock later in the game. The open-world is filled with optional activities and collectibles, but there is some grinding involved if you want to unlock all the mods. Although the open-world is huge, there are a lot of useless green areas like forests or fields that make for long travelling times between objectives (until fast travel is unlocked). Unfortunately the game is not very well optimized for PC and the physics engine acts unexpected sometimes. If you are hoping for another Mad Max then you'll be disapointed because this game requires a high-end machine to run smooth. There is an always-online component that makes the game stutter. Also, found one game breaking bug in a main story mission so I would suggest to wait for further patches that will hopefully improve optimisation and fix all issues.Overall: I had a fun time with Just Cause 3 and I recommend it if you like open-world action games. Viva Medici!			"

												For the very short time I've played (may or may not contain spoilers) I've tested new technology, hijacked helicopters, hijacked tanks, blown up entire towns, tied people to the back of my hijacked helicopter along with a goat, and sucker punched a deer. 10/10 Wouldpunch deer again. Now on to a little more serious review. This game did not have a much needed hype, because this game is amazing. The scale of the explosions and just the pure destruction you can rain down on your enemies is pure awesomeness. Plus you can carpet bomb enemies with unlimited Mines while parachuting. I'm not gonna go into anymore detail right now, just get the game and discover.			"

												Just Cause 3 continues the franchise with the same mindset as the previous titles: To deliver over the top, loud, silly, big and fun action. There are many fun and practical additions to the game, however, it cannot top its predecessor in terms of scale. Rather, it focuses on a more dense, vivid and varied world located in the waters of the sunny mediterranean with another despot for Rico to topple.Sadly, it is plagued by performance issues that keep many players from enjoying the stunning visuals of an otherwise good game. As of now, not worth the full price, but definitely worth it if discounted.			"

												Fairly decent game, ran well on my PC - though many people report bad framerates. Nice graphics, huge open world, but if you're going to get it, get the XL version because getting around is a painful process without the jetpack. Easy to mod and download save files and the new Just Cause 3 MP mod is gives a new life to the game. I recommend getting this game, but only if it's discounted, as the non discounted price tag is far too much to ask for considering this is a game from 2015.			"

												Much as I loved this game when I first started playing it (got 45hrs on it at the time of writing), I have to say my enthusiasm's starting to wane a bit now due to some of the glitches and design decisions. That said, hopefully the patch, when it comes, will address some of these...1) If you're used to the parachute controls in JC2 and the JC2MP mod, you're going to find the parachute handles very differently in JC3. Whilst it feels a lot more realistic, it's a lot slower and less responsive in its handling in JC3, so I find myself having to crunk my way around, which is tedious by comparison to JC2's parachute handling. I know there's a wingsuit, but try flying very tight turns between city buildings in the wingsuit and staying aloft.2) The land vehicle handling has been commented on by other posters - slow to start turning, then turns very sharply. I know JC2's vehicles had very sensitive handling, but at least it was fairly linear, so you could get used to the sensitivity after a while. The overall handling in JC3 is also less responsive, less fun as far as I can see.3) The failure to respond to control input which dogged JC2 and the MP mod is still apparent in JC3. Some of it is because Rico's busy doing something else with his hands (reloading, etc), but I've had plenty of times where Rico's just completely ignored the first two or three button presses while doing absolutely nothing else. The worst instance is when trying to place C4 on the underside of a chopper that's airborne - on one occasion, I had to hit the mouse button about 10 times to get him to finally place the explosive.4) Some of the missions are really quite badly put together. Again, maybe a patch would add a bit of polish, but as one example, having to push one of the NPCs 25 metres to persuade them to get onto a chopper so the mission could end isn't hugely impressive.On the plus side:a) Even on my crusty rig (i5-750, GTX 750Ti, 8GB RAM and an SSD), the game looks pretty good with some of the settings turned down, and it runs well in terms of frame-rate (though there are occasional slowdowns and the odd crash to desktop).b) The wingsuit has a steep learning curve, and the handling still needs work IMO, but it's a lot of fun :-)c) There's a good choice of weapons, and the tanks are great for shooting up bases from nearby hillsides without even being detected :-)I like JC3 a lot, and I'm optimistic the patch might help improve things further, but after more than 400hrs on JC2, and more than 900hrs on JC2MP, I still think it could have been better.

Still, it crashes after about 5 minutes of gameplay. I've been reading a lot about having to underclock your CPU or whatever. This is not something you should have to do in order to make a game run. The fact that this has been a problem for MONTHS makes me think that the developers won't fix it.Do not purchase, at least not now.			"

												I was skeptical starting the game because of the middling reviews. Initially, it was awesome, loading times were fine, it wasn't breaking down, it was playing normally, which should not be an achievment in game design. The game released should work. After about 25 hrs, bugs started showing up. The game would crash on loading everytime and require me to exit steam then relaunch, which fixed it. Then it started to struggle with on screen activity, large destruction caused some temporary freezing and stuttering. If the gamepad was on when the game launched, it wouldn't recognize it, and I had to turn the controller off then on to get it going. Eventually the freezing locked the whole PC up an required a restart. One session, the left trigger on the gamepad wouldn't work, so I couldn't fire rockets. And I tested the controller on multiple games, and its a problem specific to Just Cause 3. Its a bummer to put in time and watch the game play worse and worse, especially on a larger release like this.			"

												Just Cause 3 is enjoying in terms of gameplay.  I would give the game 5 stars for that.However, the amount of techinical  problems on a game this old is ridiculous.  I've had multiple errors, but most frequently is a DirectX error.  Every variety of error has resulted a CTD.  These are not Nvidia or AMD specific issues.  Boards filled with a wide variety of system types report multiple errors.  Even on Steam, one reviewer claims you need 16GB plus of RAM.  I have 32GB of RAM, and that is not helping anything.  If you are considering buying - I can tell you the current state of this game is horrid.			"

												Just Cause 3 is kind of a mixed bag, honestly. In terms of gameplay, it takes all you like on JC2 and adds some more 'sense' to the orgy of destruction. While you basically could destroy most of the infrastructure of Panau in JC2, it was totally pointless. There was no liberation of the cities, soldier stayed where the were etc. Now there's actual liberation. Also the missions are better in my opinion. There is no more 'go somewhere, protect the technician, mow down everything with the minigun' anymore.Generally speaking, the difficulty is higher and you die more often (sometimes because the controls are not as smooth as they were in JC2).I could totally live with that....what I can't live with, are the technical aspects of the game:it crashes on a regular basis - you can't play two consecutive missions. While I don't suffer from the graphics issues of other players, the game crashes after about 20 minutes of play.My system (i5 3570s/2*4GB DDR3-1600 Corsair, Intel DH77EB, Sapphire Radeon R9 380 4GB, Samsung 850Evo SSD, 450W 80+Platinum PSU, 24 inch screen@1920*1200px, Win7 Pro x64, running latest drivers, Windows patch level and BIOS).Long story short: I want to love this game.

												Crashes. Crashes. More crashes. The game is fun if you can get it to run for more than an hour or so. It's the only game I have where a recommendation to fix issues is to ""buy more RAM"". I don't have issues with any other game that I can think of. After all this time they should have addressed the crashing issues with this game. Instead, they release DLC. I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Early disclaimer, I have not played the game for more than a few hours after just buying it.  However, much of this is due to the latest patch which screwed up the ability to retain keyboard bindings.  This makes it necessary to reprogram your keyboard controls every single time you fire up the game.  As a result, I have quit playing the game and seriously regret spending the money on it.  My first impression of the actual game is that it isn't much different than Just Cause 2.  It is still fun blowing things up and running around an open world, albeit boring and the same everywhere.  But, the keyboard binding issue is a show stopper and I do not recommend anybody purchase the game until a patch fixes the issue with programming the keyboard.  If it is never fixed, never buy it.  I blame myself for not reading the reviews before pulling the pin on the purchase.  My bad....			"

												Really, it's a disappointment.Nothing awful. It isn't eye-schorchingly bad, it isn't going to offend you, but it also just isn't fun. Avalanch Studios found a way to make blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up not fun.See, in Just Cause 2, this wasn't a problem. The game was a lot more open, and bases were smaller and designed better. If it was red, you were supposed to shoot it, and it would explode. Do this abot 5 times, and the base was liberated. Add in some combat as a natural obstacle and make traversal generally fun, and you've got a good little set up. Everything in Just Cause 2 just worked.Just Cause 3 is a different story entirely. Vehicles are sluggish, the wingsuit is thrilling at first but you'll tire of it quickly. The combat is fine, nothing more, nothing less. The base liberation is outright boring as hell. You have a laundry list of small doodads you have to destroy, and the base isn't liberated until you've gotten them all. This wasn't a problem in JC2 with the crates you had to collect, because it had indicators and a minimap. Here? No such luck. If you want to know where stuff is, you need to open the menu which just trashes the pacing. Destroy a thing, check the map. Walk across town and have some boring combat. Destroy a thing. Check the map. Finally, you finish off the town by flying over the walls of a base, pressing two buttons, then going to the center of town and pressing another button to raise the flag. Repeat with slight variations (like in the powerplant, where it adds time limits to press the buttons for added pain) for every base so far.This really stings because the game has a lot of good stuff in it! The combat is close to being good, I love what you can do with the wires now, the graphics are just gorgeous and so is Medichi. With another year in development, this would have blown Just Cause 2 out of the water. Sadly, it's a bunch of super cool mechanics (and a few not-quite-finished ones, like the driving, the combat) floating in an awful framework. I couldn't even make my own fun. My helicoptor raids ended in me getting quickly shot down by the F-YOU SAM sights, and my planned assault on a city with a tank ended with the tank bugging out of existance and me rage-quitting.Oh, bad PC port too. Not terrible, just bad. You can't re-bind F without it still doing something else, it doesn't like to be in fullscreen, and you literally can't skip the opening FOV with the company logos unless you have a controller. This might be a good game to play with the Steam Controller honestly.Hey, maybe it gets better. Maybe the missions later are really good, or the chalenges that I didn't try were fun, or something. But the fact that I have literally no desire to keep playing the sequel to just cause 2 says a lot. Give it a miss, play JC2 instead.			"

												I am only downvoting due to performance issues with the game and the lack of support from the devs regarding the issues.I have a mid-high end PC. GTX 1070 & FX-8320.The game ran with a beautiful 80+ fps in some areas when flying around the scenery.The game ran with a gorgeous 25-60 fps, usually around 30-40, when you are taking a base or in one of the many fps ""Dead Zones"". It's kind of like a 4G connection, some places in the game just don't have it, while some do.Other than the fps issues, I loved the game.-GameplayThe wingsuit is badass.The explosions are badass.The map is absolutely gorgeous.I found myself almost never using the fast travel feature, just because of how much fun it is to traverse the map.Taking down enemy bases is badass, but gets far too grindy after the 10th or 12th base.-StoryThe story revolves around Rico creating a revolution against the big bad baby di ravelo.Rico is basically the master chief on steroids, with a wingsuit and explosives.Di Ravelo is a guy you really want to see dead, because he's either ♥♥♥♥ing annoying or a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Seems like it would make for a pretty good outcome right?Nope... The ending is garbage.The boss fight is easy as hell.Then you are forced to sit through the credits............ whyThe best part about the conclusion is the radio guy that comes on in the menu after the credits.-Should you buyIf you have a beast♥♥♥♥♥rig, then yes.This game is a must have if only to traverse the land and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up.If you have a beast♥♥♥♥♥rig and want an amazing story driven experience, nope.This game's story is lack luster at best and only shines in 5 or 6 moments when you truly feel like a badass.

												Fortuntely for me, it seems I dodged the bullet and I have been able to run the game at max settings without any issues that some players are experiencing.System Specs CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K Processor @ 4.40GHz CPU Cooler: Corsair H100i GPU: GeForce GTX 970 G1 Gaming Memory: Corsair Vengeance 16GBNow, onto the game itself. If you have played any previous entries in the Just Cause Series, you will be immediately familiar with the gameplay. Rico makes his usual ""subtle"" arrival to the country of Medici, which has a Mediterranean theme to it. As usual, there is a dictator to be deposed, and in order to do so Rico (you) must loosen the dictator's grip on the land by causing as much chaos as possible.For those new to the series, causing chaos is essentially destroying the dictator's assets by any means necessary, so shooting up Fuel Tanks, driving cars into Power Generators, and pretty much just wrecking everything however you see fit. Some new mechanics are in place for those familiar with the series, but a few new additions change things up for the better.Your grappling hook gets a few snazzy upgrades right off the bat, such as being able to manually ""reel in"" tethered objects allowing you to winch items, as well as the usual making the dictator's forces just ""hand around"". Another upgrade is that you can now have more than one ""pair"" of teathered objects.Something new to the series is that challenges are now required to upgrade various things, with relevant challenges tied to each upgrade. For example, Explosive Challenges upgrade your explosives, Air Vehicle Challenges have air vehicle upgrades, etc. The upgrades range from new gadgets to cause chaos, to improved ammo storage, and even things like nitrous for vehicles. The grapple also has upgrades, so that the ""reel in"" is stronger for when you want to topple a statue quietly, or even one where you can have even more teathers for making some interesting combinations.Another change up to the series is that you can secure areas as you go along by clearing out all of the dictator's assets in a specific region. Doing so unlocks various challenges (to earn those upgrades), as well as a few other perks. Hidden Packages are still present, and if you clear out an area the locations are revealed if you do not want to search every nook and cranny beforehand. Some of those hidden packages range from parts to collect, to backstory tapes, and the like. Liberating a settlement also can unlock new items to call in, as well as open up a garage to bring vehicles that you can then call in later. For example, that sweet motorcycle you found can be turned in to make it available anywhere, and you can turn in aircraft, cars, and even boats!Overall, the game does not try to take itself seriously, which is never really has. While it has its ""serious"" moments, the characters are usually over the top, and a one liner is usually not too far behind any major plot points/discussions. While some might find it to be groan worthy (as a Dad, we're talking like dad caliber jokes here at times), there are some clever gems here and there. My only real gripe here is that the voice actors from 2 are somewhat missed here, but the current ones are growing on me, so perhaps that is a good thing.So, I would recommend this game if you are into a game where over the top action gameplay is your cup of tea. There are plenty of ways to cause chaos, and the world is quite large so you won't be running out of things to do anytime soon. Of course, I understand that some people are having issues with performance, but at this time I was not one of them, so I cannot comment negatively about something I never experienced. Like I said in my opening statement, I am running the game at max settings and I have not had any problems yet with crashes or slowdowns.			"

												-Discussion front page are all pinned threads, more than 50% of them are about technical issues; bug reports and tips in bypassing the horrible performance happening to your PC when playing the game. I don't have to disable certain graphical options in the menu, I don't have to turn off my anti-virus, or Firewall or any other applications open when playing this game. My specs are easily over the recommended specs besides the 8GB RAM so I shouldn't be doing ANYTHING to just run the game. Rubbish.-Game requires 16GB RAM and not 8, after NURMEROUS evidence supporting this statement (memory leaks that they aren't even touching). Yet, they aren't changing it on the store page. Insubordination. It isn't that hard to just times that one number and problem solved. You aren't misleading people.-Game hasn't been out for half a year and ALREADY, the store page is STACKED full of DLC bonus content. $2.50 for a weapon that doesn't stand out to the other rifles in the game? A game bundle? A vehicle that is equivalent to a golf cart? That isn't any different to the other DOZENS of sweet sport cars, trucks, tanks etc. How is this unique? All this is fine with me, DLC and all I am usually fine with it, but these DLC SUCK! And CLEARLY there is still Mixed reviews about this, and although 15% are trolls, the majority actually have problems with this game and the fact that they aren't stabilizing the game and instead just shoving all these bonus content down our throats is insult to injury. FIX YOUR GAME SO THAT IT EQUATES TO THE $60 USD PRICE! Right now, it's at $30 USD I reckon. With 8GB of RAM you have to stop playing after a few hours or it still start stuttering like it has Parkinson's Disease. -You can have a PC that is just below the min specs and still have a blast. You can have a super strong PC over the recommended specs and still have a blast no problem. But it is vice versa. 980 ti? Peforms horribly. R7 200 on all lowest settings? Peforms well, so long as you have more than 8GB of RAM. Every computer has millions of different things going on that makes this game a gamble to play on. Thank god I got this for only $20, but I am leaving this as negative to♥♥♥♥♥♥off fanboys and that I'm a bit salty they have so much DLC trash already in less than........December........now it's March........4 MONTHS! Without even looking into the major issues of the game and also not updating the specs to 16GB not 8.			"

Originally posted by Avalance Studios: With over 1000 km² of complete freedom from sky to seabed, Rico Rodriguez returns to unleash chaos in the most creative and explosive ways imaginable.  Maniacal Madness With a Side Of Explosions After a rocky launch, to which the game has still not completely recovered, Just Cause 3 serves as a worthy successor to the excellent Just Cause 2, being what I would define as a true sequel. Story gets more serious, voice acting that isn't terrible and gameplay that allows for both high-octane action and player-creativity all adding up to a worthy addition to the Just Cause franchise. It still does need that mini-map. Gameplay: 10/10  Story: 6.5/10  Sound: 9/10  Voice Acting: 8/10  Characters: 6.5/10  Graphics: 9.5/10  Multiplayer: Unavailable  My Verdict: 8.8/10 Unmissable for action open-world fans, assuming you have a PC that can run it.

All they really needed to do was copy+paste that game into next-gen with shiny graphics and some neat new features like the wingsuit....but instead we get a fairly empty world with boring samey locations and the same outpost over and over, no minimap, no dodge (or sprinting), AWFUL controls (just the worst), and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI spawns. Honestly, I could forgive the cut-paste locations if the controls were barable, but they're easily the toughest ♥♥♥♥ing enemy to struggle with in the game. Not fun. :(			"

												I've had a lot of fun with this game but the further I get the less I enjoy itThe voice acting is awesome. The story is awesome. It looks really good, stable fps at max settings. And of course tons of ""Just Cause"" momentsAt some point during the story they switch to using NON-ANIMATED CUTSCENES. What a cheap cop-out. Very dumbEnemy spawning is terrible!! Things instantly *poof* into existence right next to you. Behind you. Above you. I've lost SO many choppers because they spawn enemy ones right next to me in the middle of the air. Just instantly. It's really badBoats are really killing my fun as they are hard to deal with. If you don't focus the AI boats, their machine guns will cut you down with perfect hitscan bullets from ANY LOS possible. Even through weak cover sometimes.What's worse is the movement mechanics on a boat are stupidly clunky. You walk very slowly, like sneaking. And finding the door from anywhere except being grappled to the helm is awkward because of the bad movement mechanics. Further, if AI calls reinforcements from a boat then the icon will sometimes get stuck. This entirely blocks view of the boat and the baddies. Stupidly frustrating when that happensHere's a boat ripping me apart from ~250m away. It's really not fun to experience this and it happens ... alot. It's a map of islands after allhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/89345971223120666/8BB51024A866A33B4726A0E3CD0CAE1AC7D0D400/And here is the stuck reinforcement iconhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/89345971223126252/91454B50A2379B162F90504ED8BFA0D0D445A001/Lastly, I have my experience CONSTANTLY interrupted by server disconnects. It's a single player game so that's obviously frustrating. You can choose ""offline mode"" but as if to add insult to injury, the game will periodically FORCE attempts to reconnect! I don't give a crap about JohnnyNobody who beat all my feats 4hrs ago ... when I choose ""offline mode"" it should do/be what it says ...Opened my map? Better check online stats  Popped my chute to climb? Better try to check online stats  Got a lucky headshot from a long way away? You better be damn sure it wants to check online statsAny other of a few dozens triggers? Better check stats!NOT ONLINE? FORCE THE RECONNECT, OBVIOUSLY! And what happens when it fails to reconnect? You have to choose ""offline mode"" again and start this cycle over. Really, really breaking my experience with this game			"

												Specs:I5 6600k, 16GB DDR4, Nvidia GTX 980TI 6GB DDR5Expectations: Over the top open world action game. Possibility of performance issues on launch (like every friggin' game released nowadays) Reality:I played this games for 5 hours straight. You have to know that I'm not easily entertained by games lately and gaming sessions over 2 hours are a rarity. This game is truly amazing. Unlimited possibilities when it comes to destroying things.  Do you want to explore the entire map instead of doing the main missions? No problem!! It is possible that after a while the liberating of settlements gets a bit repetitive, but that time hasn't come yet. Pro:-Action, non stop. -Massive map-Looks awesome -Genuinely fun to playCon:-Might get repetitive after a while			"

												I personally love Just Cause series. But this one is totally unstable!I dropped all configs to low or off just to be sure that the problem isn't my hardware. I have a video footage if the devs are interested.I run any game on ultra with this rig. No reason for Just Cause 3 to run poorly like that.Neil Gortz announced on march 4, that a fix for these stutterings will be released within a week. I'll wait until march 12 for this issue to be resolved, or I'll get a refund and wait for the devs to fix that in order to buy the game again. I want the game, but it's actually unplayable. I just can't pay for a game I can't play.My specs:i5-46902x4GB DDR3 1866MHzASUS GTX 970 Strix (4GB VRAM)Windows 10 (Windows 8.1 Pro before)Game settings tested:- 1920x1080, all maxed out.- 1920x1080, all low/off.[EDIT]Also, forgot to say: it takes 627 days, 3 hours, 5 minutes and 8 seconds to launch the game, and 315 more days to load the game and resume your save.And when you quit the game, it LOOKS like it has crashed, freezed and repeating the clicking sound of button for about 7 seconds until it closes.And I repeat: no other game has this bad behaviour. And be sure: I have games pretty much heavier than this one. Best example for this situation: Rise of Tomb Raider. Square Enix game, freaking heavy, but works perfectly.[UPDATE]I've updated to Windows 10, for upcoming DirectX 12 games, and I figured out that the stutterings on this game are gone. The problem of really long load and launch time are still the same.Waiting for a fix![UPDATE]Nooo! The stutterings are back! Even on Windows 10! >:(I just don't understand why this happens... It's freaking horrible.[UPDATE]Started having connection issues to Square Enix servers, and then, having my game paused some times (still not constantly, as reported by some users).Also, the game is now crashing very often.I'm preatty disappointed with Square Enix and Avalanche Studios. The game would be awesome without all these horrible and senseless stutterings and crashes.Pause making DLCs and fix this game!

												My impression is good so far, I'm having a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to spending lots of time messing around. If you buy this game expecting a deep and introspective work of art, look elsewhere. If you buy it and are looking for a fun game to experiment with and show your friends, this is the game for you.Pros:- Beautiful graphics and map design (love the vivid colors, lush landscapes and the sea is gorgeous.)- Very fun gameplay (explosions, flying, and killing, oh my)- Lots to work towards if you are a completionist- Non-linear so you can progress past the missions or ignore them altogether after a point- Lots of Easter Eggs- Civilian cars can be captured and then ordered via black market supply drops- Lots of models of cars, planes, tanks, and weapons to use- Super corny voice-acting (JC staple)- Sound effects are high quality- Visual effects are stunning- The new Wingsuit navigates really smoothly and is very fun once you get the hang of itCons:- Occasional bugs (nothing game-breaking for me as of yet, but I've had to restart a few missions due to bugged objectives)- Physics are wonky as hell (can be a pro in some cases, it's more geared towards fun than realism but mostly proves clunky and strange)- Driving has some of the worst physics I've come across in any game (motorcycles are nearly impossible to drive)- Moving rico around can be a hassle and interacting with vehicles or items can be a pain- Not much depth story or character wise, but this is to be expected- Always online can prove to be a nuisance if your connection is spotty (constant reconnection attempts)All in all I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone considering it who knows what they are in for in a Just Cause game. I will update this review as I put in more hours.Specs:- i7-6600k- 16 gb ram- Nvidia 980ti G1 Gaming- Windows 10 - 7200 rpm HD- 1080p monitorPerformance:- Stable fps  75 all maxed @ 1080p- Load times take around 10 secs "

Real entertainmant and alot (and i say ALOT) of fun.The game has a huge map and tons of missions, over that it's fun just to explore the world.In short words, BUY IT!

												I try launching it, this takes forever, the loading screen is extremely long, so I wait for a while, it doesn't load, I close the game and try re-launching it, steam freezes up, great, steam crashes. I open steam up again, I launch the game, and steam just flat-out crashes.This is all happening on a computer built in April of 2015, a very expensive computer built in April of 2015.Edit: It's been almost a month after the game's release, and these issues are still not patched, it's fun when it does want to work, however.Edit 2: It's been more than half a year, they still haven't put out an official fix that works, awful devs.Edit 3: I just came back to say that Avalanche is absolutely deplorable for this and deserve to be shamed			"

												DO NOT BUYThe game is designed to be always online. If you cannot connect to the servers you will have wait for about 10-20 seconds on a connecting screen then be asked if you want to retry or go offline. Once you go offline, every few minutes when you enter a menu it will try and reconnect, forcing you to sit there for 10-20 seconds while it tries to connect.I haven't had many technical problems with the game except for a few annoying crashes on the map screen but hopefully those will be ironed out.The game itself isn't too bad, it's basically Just Cause 2 but with some new weapons, gadgets and vehicles on a new map. The controls for mouse and keyboard aren't too bad for the most part, vehicles feel a bit clunky and I've had some issues rebinding controls but other than that mouse and keyboard seem ok.If you really want to pay £40 for practically more of the same but with bugs and unbearable 'always online' features then go ahead but if not, wait for them to remove the annoying reconnection issues and get it on a steam sale.

												These are the desperate times where I regret saving money on my graphics card by putting in an AMD card, instead of a NVidia card.As you probably know by now, people with AMD cards are having a lot, and I mean a LOT of trouble running this game. I updated my drivers which removed some of the lag but messed up the beautiful landscape with it's graphical errors[puu.sh]. So naturally, I updated my drivers to the  AMD Beta Driver's[support.amd.com]. That made the game playable... I guess.  It runs at 40-60, drops down to 30 when there is a lot of AI involved and ♥♥♥♥♥ itself whenever there's a big explosion.You might be wondering how, despite all this, it gets a positive review. And that is, because this game is so ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, I can't stop playing it. The wingsuit is fantastic and the game feels increadible.If you are a Just Cause fan, get this now. If you aren't, get this now. If you can't afford it, get a job. Pay debt.			"

												Cannot play oflfine, forced DRM is a real ♥♥♥♥♥.  I tried to run this game behind a firewall (I have a portable computer that I can update at home just for this reason).   This game will not launch without an active dial home... So even if you are online, but games are filted by a firewall, forget it.   I was on the fence about recomended this game or not, that DRM kills it. Pro:ExplosionsFlyingGrappeling things to things - You cannot have more fun than hanging enimies in a jeep from a cave roof. grappling a helicopter to a huge rockCons:Limited varity - every town liberation is the same basic thing.No reall stand out locations.   There is some varity of terrain, but nothing to say you are in X city or Y port.  Each city and port could be swapped out and no one would  notice.No challange - Rico is a god among men, with a pistol and using none of his other abilties he can take on an army.  Add in the grappler, wing suit and drops, the enemy should be giving up.   I tend to die most often from SAM sites respawning or de hacking themselves more than the actual AI.   In fact the time I am most at risk is trying to take a helicopter, as for some reasons SAM's aim at you while hanging outside of one too.Unlimited flying - Seriously between the parachute and the wingsuit you never have to touch the ground.  it is faster than a car, and always availbe... outside of long trips over the ocean all vehicles in this game are just toys with no purpose.TL:DR - If you truly enjoyed the random explosions and chaos of JC2, this game is worth a look (I'd wait for a sale).   If you want anyting at all more than that, keep playing JC2, this game is a mild upgrade to it.			"

												If you liked JC 1 and 2, this is a must have. If not, then it depends on how much you like destruction. If you liked red faction guerilla then you're probably going to like blowing up military facilitys in this one. And this game is all about that. Also about finding new creative ways of entertaining yourself with grapple... wait, that sounds kinda dirty. Anyways, the game is amazing, huge detailed map, graphics are very nice, the only two letdowns in my opinion is not the best performance and bikes handling.			"

												Pros:Fun blowing up cities and military bases and creating chaos in general.Wingsuit is nice new mechanic for getting around the map.Cons:Constant crashes.Very slow startup time.Controls are sluggish. Vehicles are undrivable.Missions get in the way of the game more than furthering the game.Despite having checkpoints in missions, if the game crashes mid-mission then the mission must be restarted.While easy enough to remap, the default key for the grapling hook in JC2 is the default key for throwing grenades in JC3 "

												Before I start this review, if you have at least 32 gigs of ram, buy this game, go ahead. It's a genuinely good game. But the disgusting scummy devs are what prevent me from giving this game a positive review. I'm a diehard just cause fan. I've played the second game and I played the hell out of it on PS3 and I even repurchased on pc because I wanted to relive the nostalgia of blowing up♥♥♥♥♥♥ However I really wanted to play just cause 3, it was on sale for a really nice price, I bought it, but what I didn't know was that I was getting cheated, the scummy devs of the game haven't bothered to fix a MAJOR fps and stutter issue that's been in the game since release. There have been thousands of cries like mine throughout the game community which these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs have completely ignored, and instead of easily fixing these issues, the devs add expansions and dlc. Disgusting. Broken unplayable game, cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ developers. Do not buy this game!!			"

												Wow, when I saw the announcement trailer for this game I did not really think much of it.But now, I've played it, I LOVE IT!Just Cause 3 is a game about the island of Medici that is being overruled by a tyrant and dictator named Di Ravello who is harvesting the element Bavarium to control the island, you and the rebel alliance try to over throw Di Ravello and capture Medici.You may be thinking, so what? Sounds exactly like Just Cause 2. in Just Cause 2 theres an island that you are trying to take back from a dictator and tyrant called President Panau, pretty much the same game. No, its not.The level of destruction and freedom in Just Cause 2 is tiny compared to what you can do in Just Cause 3. You see a helicopter, grappling hook it to the support of a bridge and reel it in, this not only blows up the helicopter it will blow up the bridge, if you are lucky enough to do this to a railway bridge as a train goes over it, the train will fall off of the bridge and explode, honestly its great!

Posted: December 3, 2015
												So, i've been waiting years for this game to come out. I was a huge fan of JC2 and went all in on JC3. JC2 did a lot of things well, and JC3 looked to build off of that. But there are definetly issues, and I would not recommend this game to anyone until they are addressed. 1. The game takes forever and a day to start. and THEN it has to ""login"", which also takes forever. I clocked it at 1min30S to get to the ACTUAL menu that lets you start the game. 2. they want you to submit support issues to a terribly designed, unusuable support portal. what a joke. I'm happy to communicate issues instead of write a bad review, but their support portal is truly terrible and is more a hommage to support, like its an obligation, than a portal that is serious about fielding support and feedback. Needlessly beurocratic and specific, when all you should be giving me is a big textbox. That raises questions for me about how serious they are about making this a great game and listening to user feedback; because it's the same kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥you'd expect from EA.3. Its 'E'  to get into a vehicle, but good luck figuring out how to get out of a vehicle. maybe it's apce? maybe it's W, or A? one of them seems to do it eventually, but it's not at all what i would normally expect or do. 4. the tutorial system, meant to clarify how to use the game, manages to be confusing. JC2 had one too, but it was a good one. It's unconnected from what you need to do, not clear, and more annoyance than helpful. really really wish this was better, because they've done better in the past; which makes it so frustrating. I don't know how you could create this and use this and think its overall a good idea. 5. can't `esc` to exit map. MUST hit tab again. boo. can't 'esc' to exit menu, have to hit...CTRL??? who designes this nonsense?6. 'F' used to be grapple in JC2, now is explosives. have made that mistakemany many times. Perhaps more an annoying learning curve, but equally its annoying that keybindings would change so much between versions; makes going between JC2/JC3 painful. But, its not like the change is illogical; grappling is now considered a primary action, in place of the weapon switch. 7. GET RID OF THE SOCIAL. I want MULTIPLAYER not some nonsense leaderboard against people I don't know or care about. If I can't play with my friends, it's a single player game. Who thought this was a good idea? Really? because they should be fired. 8. No way to start the game in offline mode, or skip login, or anything. i never want to be online with this game! If/once the above issues are fixed, I can recommend the game, because it is otherwise a good game. They focused on fun and not restrictions, and it shows. There's lots to love, to be honest. But, the above issues are not nothing, sans #6. They improved the drops so you can airdrop a few things, which I definetly wanted in JC2. So, they aren't just making a JC3 to milk the fanbase, but they are going to need to release fixes and patches to make this game better than JC2. Which, it can be, if they address the issues. If/when they do, I will update my review/recommendation.			"

												Before I begin I have a few things to say.1. Excuse my grammar im not a good speller :P2. Here are my computers specs:GeForce GTX 760 (192-bit)Intel Core i7-4770 CPU @ 3.40GHz8.00 GB RAM (7.92 GB usable)1920 x 1090, 60hz monitor resolutionMicrosoft Windows 10 Home3. Here are the Just Cause 3 Recomended specsOS: Vista SP2 / Windows 7.1 SP1 / Windows 8.1 (64-bit Operating System Required) Processor: Intel Core i7-3770, 3.4 GHz / AMD FX-8350, 4.0 GHz Memory: 8 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 (3GB) / AMD R9 290 (4GB) Storage: 54 GB available spaceAs you can see my specs aren't dramaticly worse than the recomended specs, yet I still can't run this game on LOW settings with everything turned off. I have tried a couple of things to make my FPS better including not allowing online services, and even setting Taskmanager priority to high. Why didn't I give this game a bad review then? Well, with the 11 hours I have played with 10fps I've actually been able to have a good amount of fun, I know this game is definitly amazing if you have the computer to run it. I'd just make sure you have A LOT better than the recomended specs. I currently have a support ticket in with Avalanch Studios to see what I can do to run this game better.Hope this helped,PolarBear			"

												Lets start off by saying that I am NOT going to compare this game to JC2. In my opinion, this is an entirely different game. Of course it has elements from JC2 but I like to believe that the developers wanted to give a completely different angle. JC2 was awesome but in my opinion, JC3 is too.The environment is absolutely incredible. It gives a real feeling of being in a Mediterranean country and I have been playing this game for around 25 hours now, and haven't even been to ~3/4th of the map.The vehicle system is a lot of fun. The fact that you can bring cars, motorcycles, boat and even freaking planes to a garage so that you can drop them anytime you want is awesome. I have to agree that the handling of some vehicles can be troublesome, but it makes me love the variety in vehicles even more.Some say the hate the fact that there is no sprinting, no crouching etc. Forget about that. The possibilities are endless with the amazing upgraded grappling hook you get right from the start. And lets not forget that you can use a two handed weapon from the sky with your parachute and pull yourself towards enemies to stomp their faces in. No need for crouching or sprinting.The detail, on almost every part of the game, is extreme. For example, I was driving an F1 and a small rock hit my front axle, what made the front wheels shiver a bit. You may call this stuff a pre in a game, but I can see a lot of effort went into it in this game.Did I mention a modding system INSIDE the game? You can complete challenges to get gears and with gears you can upgrade everything. Literally everything: Plane, Car, Boat, Weapons, Grenades and even your grappling hook. You hate repeating races, destruction etc? Not with this feature ill tell you that.Now the last part I am going to discuss are the graphics. Which are of course, amazing. I know there have been some optimization issues, but if you meet the minimal requirements you will most likely be able to run the game fine. I use a GTX 780 combined with an FX-8320 AMD processor and 16gis of ram, and I run the game on max, max and max without any optimization issues. If you are worrier about all the loading times everyone has been complaining about, it was fixed last patch.So if you are actually still reading this right now, whats the matter? Just ignore the freaking 64% positive reviews and buy the game to find out for yourself! "

												Just Cause 3 had some glitches in the beginning. They made some patches and it had cleared up some of the issues. I recommend this game to anyone who has enjoyed the past Just Cause games. In my personal opinion, I like Just Cause 2 better. I don't know if this is becuase that was my first experience with Just Cause, or if it was truly a better game.Either way, its a great game!			"

												Not at all what I was promised.

The bland story and characters don't exactly help either, nor does the games overall performance. My 980 struggles to hit a steady frame rate and drops from 70 to 30 very often.

												I quite enjoyed this game at release, never had any performance issues but it is clear that quite a lot of people are suffering from them. The gameplay is what you'd expect from a JC game: fun, insane, lots of explosions and mediocre vehicle control. Story is not that great, better than the second game though. It is all a bit over the top but I'm glad they don't go way too far like most devs do when they get into that mindset. I received the Sky Fortress DLC from a friend and I'm glad I did not invest in a season pass or bought it myself. What an utter dissappointment for 12€. Story is bland, worse than what I've seen from JC2 and 3. The wingsuit is a bit more fun but I'm of the opinion they should have added that content in the base game.I did get about 60 hours of fun out of the game and it ran well so I'm going to recommend it. BUT...Keep in mind that you are taking a gamble due to the performance issues that surrounds this game. Also: the DLC isn't worth much... get it through the inevitable Game of the Year editions or some heavy discounts.			"

Product received for free
												I purchased this game on Playstation 4 eariler this year, and got almost 300 hours out of it, and I loved every single bit of it, and when I purchased my CPU and got Just Cause 3 for free with it as part of a promotion, I couldn't wait to play it at the highest settings at 60fps, compared to the poor framerates I experinced on my Playstation.  However, this port is terrible. I have a GTX 1070, i5 6500, and 16gb of Ram, and the game won't stop crashing, is locked in windowed mode, stuck at 720p, and everytime I hit a loading screen, the game crashes. This is a trash port, Avalanche released the game, all broken and never bothered to fix the ♥♥♥♥ing game, and focused on making more money for Square Enix by releasing the DLCs and complelety ignored the issues with the port. Like I said before, I enjoyed the game, but it is almost unplayable for me with it's constant crashes, resoultion issues, and the poor fps.			"

												Bought this on sale because it was a great deal and I'd been wanting to play it for a while, however after (attempting) playing for about an hour I had to give up. At the loading screen, I waited a few minutes to get the game started and when I finally got into the main menu so I could adjust my graphics settings, my RAM maxed out (16GB with nothing major running in the background, skype and discord maybe) and I couldn't get back out of the game as it froze my computer. After rebooting, the game seemed to work, though hitchy, for a few minutes. I thought maybe it would iron itself out after those few minutes and it didn't. For reference I would be running 60fps for a few seconds, then it would drop to 1-2fps for a few seconds, then back up to 60fps. I tried to drop the graphics settings down relatively low and produced no better results. I would have loved to play this game, but if developers can't get their games working right I will definitely spend my money elsewhere. The game doesn't seem to run bad on all systems though; it seems to be the ""wrong"" combination of equipment, whether it's not the right processor, gpu, RAM, etc. System specs for anyone troubleshooting planning on buying:i5 6600kGTX 1070Corsaire Vengeance DDR4 2x8GBWD Blue 500GB HDD (Windows)Seagate Barracuda 7200.14 2TB HDD (Games)			"

Posted: December 2, 2015
												I don't know where to start. I've been waiting for this game since it was announced and was happy to purchase the game with no problems. This is where the trouble begins. Let me preface this by stating my system specs, and I've tried this game with multi GPU setups as follows:Intel Core i7 2600k @5.0 Ghz8Gb DDR3 RamMSI R9 380 in CrossfireWindows 102nd test system:Intel Core i7 2600k8Gb DDR3 EVGA GTX 970 SSCWindows 10So upon release and unlocking the everything went smoothly if you can get over the fact that it has DRM up the wazoo and it asks you to sign up your email for an account, the typical 2015 move game devs do. All of that aside the menus and everything were smooth and jumping in the game was a breeze. My first setup with settings on High to very high results were terrible. Frame stuttering, frame rate drops like crazy and everything was just unplayable. Let alone the frame rate issues but there were bugs and part of the map were invisible and didnt load. I installed the ""beta"" drivers everyone seems to be doing but with no results. The AMD beta drivers have done nothing and pretty much gave me the same results. The game DOES NOT use crossfire so I disabled that and got the same crap resutls. It was time to move onto the Nvidia system.Jumping on the nvidia system and playing the game proved that this game was incomplete and broken. I was getting higher frame rates but everytime I shot, got shot at, or blew something up there was huge frame drops. This affirmed my decision to refund the game after about 20 minutes of play time and fiddling around with graphics settings, details, driver updates and so on. Avalanche really messed this release up and it looks like hard working customers are punished yet again. Don't buy this game until its fixed and honestly its not even worht pirating. Dont give these people your money and put it towards an indie developer who really cares about a game. Buy Rocket League, give Psyonix your money and not these plebs over at Avalnache and Square. Terrible, buggy, and shoddy release.			"

												I cannot reccomend this game.  I wish I could.  I want to . . .Yet it is clear that while prettier than Just Cause 2, this is really a major setback, in lots of ways.From the much smaller map to the lack of compelling things to do, to the horrible voice acting . . .First off, the acting really bothered me.  Never mind that our intrepid hero looks less like Tony Montana in Scarface and more like Nathan Drake in the Uncharted games, they seem to have found a different voice actor that for whatever reason can't seem to hit on Rico's vibe.  The voice acting is so terrible and flat that one cannot say ""it's so bad it's laughable"" because it isn't.  It is just horrid. It sounds tired and worn out, the one-liners stilted and about as light as a helicopter with a missing rotor.   You to will be if you go through the motions in this lifeless game.I am not going to comment on the memory leaks or the stutters or even the flickering textures.  Plenty has been said of that elsewhere.  What I will comment on is how lazy the writers got with this game, or how poorly Avalanche seems to remember who Rico was from the first two games.  My feeling was that Rico was a from Central or South America and was a graduate of the School of the Americas . . . replete with exploding cigars for Castro and brutal interogation tactics.  In the previous game he reminded me in look and sound of Al Pacino's Tony Montana, espeically at the end of the film when he yells out, with abandon, ""Say hello to my L I T T L E Frriend!!!"".  Now he is apparently the ""Most Interesting Man Alive"" and selling beer, while wearing Nathan Drake's face . . .The game feels off from the get go.   There seems to be no cover mechanic.  I think it's time he had one, you know, in this day and age.  At the very least give us the old fashioned CROUCH back.  Even worse still, Rico cannot run, Stunt Jump is gone, and his dive move is also missing, leaving the player nothing but strafe as a gunplay option, which blows.  I cannot believe that Avalanche could mess this up so bad.  Such a basic thing!  EDIT:  Recently Avalanche expressed to the community that crouching, sprinting and any sort of cover mechanic was INTENTIONALLY elminated from gunplay to ""encourage"" players to use Rico's Aerial Moveset.  That's like telling someone that is behind a shipping container to instead run out into the open and take the RPG to the chest because ""your aerial moves are freaking cool!""  Come on!The bad acting is apparent right from the beginning, so that sorta lent to that ""huh?"" feeling.  And then Rico's relationship to this island feels completely off too.  He talks with such gusto about destroying the place that I actually said, out loud mind you, ""what about the civilians?""Early on, other problems become apparent:  In the middle of a mission to complete the capture of a town, I recieved two different, apparently random, protection objectives, one including stealing a car . . . while I was attempting to raise the flag and capture the town.  One would think that in a main storyline mission, random missions wouldn't just pop up requiring your attention.I am not having most of the problems others have with this game, so I cannot comment on those, except there are curious texture issues and some stuttering.  Everything else looks very pretty.  It just doesn't play that way.I am so frustrated with the performance issues and the attitude of the developers that I am no longer interested in Avalanche's future projects.  Last time I get burned by a developer.When it comes back on sale, grab Just Cause 2.  It is more than worth anything that you pay for it, I just cannot say the same about 3.			"

												Game is great, better then JC2 atleast (slightly).Other then that well..typical Avalanche life story. Full with potential yet so empty. Mad Max was ""open world"" game where all what you did was driving and destroying with some fight. Map felt completely empty so those limits were actually okay.This game feels like huge empty space where you either glide or you get chopper/airplane to fly over map. Cars and people in towns feels kinda unimportant comparing to lets say gta. I do understand that its happening because map should be almost unlimited but its kinda pointless when you dont see anything new.If you hate my comparision with gta, imagine that map and features in gameplay of prototype games where climbing on building actually looks like you do something.It just feels empty..full with potential yet far from satisfying.For those with tech issues its individual problem. I never had problem with Battlefront drivers, 60-70fps on gtx970/i7 4770k everything maxed out while with new drivers I get 70-80.Recommended but its repetetive. Lets say this is older brother of Mad Max.			"

												The only 2 bad things that I've found with this game is that the Car Handling sucks (I have the feeling they did this on purpose, so that players could learn the Wingsuit, parachute and grappling hook) and that the game slightly studders a bit, but it's always noticable. Although, usually it's still acceptable. The storyline...Well, I don't really care for the story on any game, But the storyline is probably good. The idea of liberating area's is also pretty good, and it's my favourite part of the game.			"

												It seems like a fun game, lots to explore, plenty of content to check out but with the poor release as well as the repetitive missions and objectives..makes a very unappealing game. Will still play it to beat it but will be done after story. I can not recommend this game due to poor AA(jaggies are almost appearent on many shapes),frequent crashes, poor graphic options that do not work(resolution change for me), and to take the cake..they clearly did not care about AMD users. Check my profile for my specs..I use Nvidia and intel but they seriously dropped the ball on this one. It is not fair for developers to be able to release broken games or games that detract from a users experience. Not to preach for Fallout 4 because it does have its problems being a massive game but with many many many more users had a succesful launch while Just Cause 3 boasts that there was a lot of users in the world but the person count is extremely low compared to Fallout 4 or even Black Ops 3. I only added those games to make a point on what Just Cause 3 developer said. Save your money and wait for a discount.			"

Although, I am running a GTX 980 and a i7. But Just Cause 3 is a ton of fun. There are barely any limits to this game and you can have a blast if you just wanna mess around and do awesome stunts. I'm really hoping for mod support and maybe even a multiplayer mod in the future.Just Cause 3 is THE game to play if you're bored.If you're still uncertain about this game, wait for a price drop. But there is a lot of fun to be had in this game. Absolutely not the best game ever, but it really let's you experiment and have your own fun.			"

 ""I really like this game, as it is open world, adventurous, and has a nice feel to it"".	Playing it over again, just becuase it was so fun. Pros	 Open world with an absolutely gigantic map (you will not live to see all of it) Feels really good to play, as of how free you are to move around in speed through the air Lots of things to do, will keep you occupied all the time for days or maybe weeks (challenges like races and                                                   kamikazes) You get to blow up EVERYTHING Cons	 Not that many missions (as someone who plays alot) Some of the challenges are hard AF Camera is a little close, and you can't change it  Controls for veichles are ♥♥♥♥ed up (exept boats and helicopters)The game runs fine with my GTX 980 4GB with 16 GB of RAM, i7-6700I recommend buying it on sale, I bought it together with Rise of the Romb Raider in a double discount pack.

												Has some glaring optimisation problems currently, but given Avalanche's pedigree, I am sure they will be able to fix it soon. This gamee is exactly what you should expect from a Just Cause game, you get to blow some sh*t up! Pretty generic shooting mechanic, but extremely satisfying destruction. One fault for this game could be the handling for ground vehicles is spectacularly bad. Its a real struggle to drive at times. The map is extremely large! Plot is kinda meh, you need to save a country from a dictator... by blowing stuff up. Overall I would probably wait a bit for some better optimisation before picking up this game. That being said, you know what you are getting with this game, which is pure destructive fun!			"

												It took me 60 minutes to get into game. Supposedly. Cutscenes were extremly slow and they frose frequently. When I got to the gaming part I lost all patients, and tried to alt f4 out of the game. The cutscene to game sequence was REALLY slow and then frose. I had to bring up the task manager and WAIT for it to come up in the screen. And I had to wait a little more for it to shut down the game, because it wasn't responding. All of those who were hestiant to buy the game - you didn't waste your money, like me. I'll see if there will be any patches to optimisation. Until then - NOT RECOMMENDED.			"

												Definitely do not recommend this game, I am a huge fan of JC2 and play it more than I do the current version, JC3 is amazing, but I am not happy with the developers neglecting AMD completely, crashes every 30 minutes or so and constant FPS drops (I have a graphics card more than capable of running games like GTA V at max at a steady 100 frames. Don't buy this until they fix EVERYTHING... They released a game that is 75% complete. They are racking themselves a bad name, 30% of JC3 copies via Steam have been refunded, I understand why now.

												I have a few hours in this game so I guess I can give pretty honest review:Pros:-30 hours of gameplay, more with mods-Mods worked on previous versions-Explosions-My laptop now works as a toaster tooCons:-Most mods don't work anymore-Unoptimized-(serious) Network issues-Way too expensive, dlc should have been free-Not enough content (JC2 had more), not enough variety-Bad and short story-Map seems large, but is mostly unused forests and water-Motorcycle handling-There is not enough airtraffic, so no awesome hijacks as in JC2. Also AI can't really fly-Overall boring experience, I smiled like onceIf you desperately want it, don't pay full price. Maybe 20€. Or less.			"

												Just Cause 3 is like to have an unfinished intercourse with a fake A$$ ♥♥♥♥♥...Seriously this game is so repetitive that after awhile makes you feel sick.The military bases are all the same, the landscapes are iterative, weapons are kind of fun but still not so diverse.cars are kinda useless because when you have wingsuit (which i think it's one of the best things in this game) you won't get near any car.I was looking forward to see much better graphics than this so even graphics disappointed me,i guess just cause 2 set the bar too high.anywhay draw distance and explosions are still amazing.. Gameplay is so smooth and fun with wingsuit,grapple and parachute you can add some diversity to the game but even so it gets repetitive after awhile.About story there is absolutely nothing to say.I know this is a just cause game and u cant have high expectations about story but still this is way worse that i had in mind.The moment i realized that the game is finished i was like ""Whaaaaaat Seriously?"".I really thought to myself there has to be more but unfortunately there was'nt...At the end i was really looking forward to this game but it left me disappointed.

												It is hard to not recommend this game hence the thumbs up. The game is awesome, improvements over JC2 all over the place, but, now this is a huge BUT, it is a beta. Ok they have released it as a full game but there are still way too many little things and bugs for it to be a full game, don't get me wrong, I have maybe been luckier than some as I haven't seen any game killing bugs, such as memory leaks and severe artifacts in the graphics like what some players have said, the game runs fine, although I do have a fairly high spec system, i7-4770k(OC4.2), 32Gb RAM and a GTX980Ti, the problems I see are really obvious beta issues. For instance; after completing a section of the game a street band starts to play, I know they are a band as I can hear the music and indeed see them playing their instruments, but hold on, they are really, really good instruments because they are invisible, they much have cost a fortune. Yep they are going through the motions, playing a harmonica and I see someone playing a guitar but the instruments are just not there.I have shot someone, they are dead, I know they are dead because I shot them in the head, I even got a ""Head Shot"" counter. But after a few seconds, he got up and started shooting again, hell, zombies get everywhere these days.I was driving up a winding road, when there was a bit of a traffic jam, I over took, as you do, to find a bus reversing down the mountain, he crashes in to a car and knocks the car over the side, of course the car explodes, this is Just Cause after all, but then the bus then drives forward, on the wrong side of the road and just continues like that. Now I'm english so I'm used to driving on the left but I thought we were meant to drive on the right in Medici.You will also see other kamikazi type manoeuvre, in other words, although it is very funny it is quite poor AI.So as you can see, although the game is completely playable, well is for me, it is far from finished. I assume it was rushed out for the holiday period to get the sales. I fully expect some huge patches not far over the horizon.Lastly I would just like to say that even though it has some bugs, it is still very enjoyable and it is also huge, the map is absolutely massive and with lots of small expansions already coming, it really is worth getting, just maybe give it a little while for the 1st patch. Hope this helps, thats why I wrote this. Now I'm off to drive my car backwards all over town. It's the way its done on Medici after all. :)			"

												Main quests are fun and exciting, but the rest of the ""1000km^2"" with a sh*t ton of stuff to do gets repetitive and boring. You also have to complete a fair amount of the side quests to unlock the main quests. This meant that during 70% of the gameplay, I found myself considering uninstalling the game.Edit - So i did end up finishing the game. I am saddened because i really like the what the Just Cause franchise tries to do, yet regret buying this game.			"

												Update:While this game has improved in playability, it is still a vast let down in the quality of content it has. The main island has almost nothing on it, the vehicles handled terribly and the menus still have controller icons on them in places.Dev's have said they'd address what the community has said - well I'll believe it when I see it.----Day of Release Review:I'll continually update this in the coming days but for now, day 1, the game is pretty below par. Why are we not allowed good day 1 releases? Where was the QA/testing? You don't sell me a car on release and then tell me the stero doesn't work until you patch it in a few days, or a toaster that will burn my toast for the next week because you couldn't work something out in the thermostat controls. Common Square Enix, I paid you $70 NZD for a game and I can't even get a stable day 1 play!Cons:- Driving, while better than JC2 still feels like you're driving a concrete block with wheels. The cars do not feel any better, sure they feel different than JC2 but not by much. This is my biggest dissapointment to be honest.- Motorbikes, they have like a .5 second delay between when you hit the key to turn and the bike starts turning - its horrible and means you overcompensant everything and spin out... just wrong.- Helicopters, from what I can tell feel okay but theres something wrong with how they move too ... maybe that concrete block just grew rotors?- Jetski, try holding the reverse key and watch yourself spin in circles! For added nausia, hold the reverse and left or right key to make yoursellf projectile vomit in all the directions. This pretty much just makes you spin really fast in circles - bloody weird.- Story, again Square Enix manages to do the whole 'throwing you into something with no backstory or character development' just take this gun, shoot those guys grapple here and drive here and meet her - sweet, heres the black market oh I mean supply drop grenade. Have fun. While Rico might know these people I certainly didn't see a familiar face from JC2 (except Sheldon). SE I thought you would learn from JC2.- Derp eyes on Rico during one of the first few cutscences when you're having supper and talking on the fence. Just saying.- FPS, oh how it hurts. VSync off and spin around - watch your frames go through the floor. Blow that building up? Heres you 0fps for 5 seconds reward! Yeah, the FPS is stable when you look forward... without any sudden movements (so forget keeping it stable during combat or driving and shooting!)Pros:- When the frames are stable, the game looks good; even on medium everything it looks really nice.- Crash models are vastly improved over JC2.- Wingsuit is fun (when you get the feel of it)- Still has that JC2 feel in a new location (huge map!) and lots of cool explosions and shooting and stuff. If you liked JC2 like I did I think you'll like this - but that damn list above the pros needs fixing ASAP.Again, I will update in a few days after some patches come out - but unless it improves on these points this review will be sticking negatory :\			"

												Just Cause 3 is poor game.- Very bad vehicle controls- Very bad in-game camera- Map is too big with not much in, just copy & paste assets.- No international airport (I think)- Same gameplay over & over ""raise the flag""- ugly terrain- Poor main carater. Rico is just bad Borat.- Stupid wait 60mins to call in another tank drop.- The guns feel very weak. I don't think you can upgrade them like JC2.- AI bad guys spawn in every 2 secs with unlimited spawn in's. Just very bad.- Your helicoter will get destroyed in like 3 secs.- Aiming in a tank is horrfic when riding ruff terrain- tanks have wheels not tracks- Dev team only carared about the dlc packs when the core game was left to rott with no patches.- no sprinting- no crouching- no stunt jump feature like in JC2- no in-car radio- the wing suit had a turning circle of the moon.- the game was frustrating, make me very mad.I spent over £50 for the XL and got let down big time. All the time they wasted making the dlc packs made the core game suck. The dev team have avrage skills trying to play AAA game.--- JC 4 JUST GET IT RIGHT ---			"

												If you played JC 2, don't bother with this.

This game still needs some patching and optimizing,altho it runs 50+ fps on my rig.I would really recommend this game for those who has very large imagination.and boy there is action ALOT. depends how you make it.Falling is more forgiving, i like it, you dont die easily from odd falls.Devs have hinted that there will be Multiplayer in near future,as Patch or DLC,But i dont care much, i have always loved JC singleplayer.Only minus is driving,but you dont have to use vehicles to get somewhere,thats why you have wingsuit 8).Challenges are very good add,more better you play,fastest you get the modparts.

												EDIT:Developers told us to wait for the patch to fix stuff which is good, but its odd that they did release the patch just same time when the 2 weeks are gone and you cant refund the game.I did try to refund the game after the patch and i didnt have 2 hours played, but i was stupid since i did trust on the devs and waited for patch which did fix nothing, for some of the players i did work and the patch did ruin it and they wasnt able to start the same, same issue that me and many others had at start.So, what did i learn from this? Never trust any dev on that they will fix the game and just refund the game asap and look for patch news and forums if those patches fixed anything.Cant recommend the game or the devs, way too large mess with odd patch release date, be it intentional or not.EDIT: NOW THE GAME WORKS BUT TOO LITTLE TOO LATE, cant recommend these devs overall plain bad support and patching.

												I'd give this game a 4 out of 5 stars, here's why:Pros:- Car handling is harder but seems more realistic like I'm actually driving a vehicle that weighs over a ton.- New grapling system is amazing.- Don't get me started on the wingsuit! Its AmAzInG!- The explosions are beautiful.- I like the leaderboard thing, although I don't understand who I'm competing with.- The graphics look much better.- So glad there is a spedometer.- Blowing up a lot more stuff and having the explosions cause more explosions.Cons:- Drifting can be a pain.- Combat seems too weird and not captivating.- Story is pretty stupid.- The missions aren't great.- Default control scheme is weird.- Minimizing the game nearly breaks my computer and causes me to have to restart the game.- Graphics issues. (970M)- loading screen takes way too long.- No nice cars being used by AIs.- Frame rate is all over the place.- Menus are frustrating and laggy.Side note: how do I get rebel drops?			"

												Utterly bad optimized. No SLI support. Runs just poor on a quite good PC (i7-4770k, 32 GB RAM, 2x GTX 780, Samsung Evo Pro 850, ...)It's fun of course but having my frames going from 60 to 30 (stay there for two secs) and then going up to 60 (vsync) again, makes it not quite fun to play. The graphic isn't that good that one could accept such performance issues.Advice: Wait until it is patched and check out the reviews in one or two months.Edit: Switching off vsync helped and increased my fps. No more dips to the thirties. Playing in offline modus gave me a constant boost of about 10 fps. Nevertheless, after playing the game for 2 hours one has to restart it otherwise your fps monotonically decrease over time.------ Additional review after playing 14 hours ------Let me just say that it is very very very very repetetive. After having ""liberated"" the two isles and half of the big one, the fun is squashed away by repetitive taks. Even the mission become repetitive. It is a nice sandbox but that's it.			"

												Hey do you guys like playing Just Cause 2?  Then go play Just Cause 2.  Just Cause 3 is a bait and switch.  Pure and simple.  With controls still grafted for a controller and not keyboard mouse, to the fact that the game feels completely empty despite the fact they brag that the game is even bigger than Just Cause 2.  Plus lock all of the fun graple mechanics behind some stupid upgrade system and you have Just Cause 3!  Yay!  Enjoy doing all of those mini events just to be able to reel in your grapple gun while your parachute is deployed...... which was what made starting out in Just Cause 2 fun to begin with.So yeah the map is bigger, but having a map made out of (what feels like) 90% water doesn't mean the map is big and amazing.  It makes it a giant water wasteland.  Enjoy amazing things like a lack of interesting enemy bases, no huge sprawling cities, and no airport!Yeah the game looks pretty, but the game itself isn't worth shelling out full price for.			"

												I have a fairly decent systm that allows me to play many other games such as Fallout 4 and ARK at full settings with no issues. This game on the other hand had a number of graphical issues and bugs that render the game almost unplayable. The graphics that did work did not seem to be that  what was represented in screenshots and video and I can not condone paying a premium to beta test something. I returned this product and do not plan to repurchase.			"

												First off, those who are complaining about the performance in this game, be sure to use the recommended system requirements and not the minimum. This game eats RAM and i recommend at least 16GB minimum for smooth performance. The lowest GPU i would use would be the gtx 960 and even then maybe something stronger. Now, the game itself is amazing. The graphics are really crisp, the physics are fun to mess around with, and you can't ever run out of things to do!			"

												Before I write my review I would like to say this game crashed constantly for me on Windows 10, I set the compatibility mode to Vista SP2 in the .exe properties and it hasnt crashed since.This is the most fun ive had in a single player game since forever, they really made the game free and fun like a super hero game mixed with mercenaries game. The negative thing about this game is there are a few game breaking bugs that they didnt care to fix, the driving is a bit poor and there's a lot of superficial/unrealistic content. The story and writing are laughable but its a game, I don't recall many games having good stories anyways(who cares). The writing is a bit comical and I feel its better acted than what ive seen from JC2. This game really has a bad rep and I dont feel it deserves outside of bugginess. The graphics are great, the physics, the explosions, the wingsuit, the scale, the battles, the mechanics just make this game incredibly fun and addicting. I really reminds me of those fun open world games you played when you were a kid.			"

												I noticed that there are quite alot of bad reviews for this game, the game isn't perfect but i think it deserves a little more praise.I am gonna be honest here, when i first started the game i didn't like the way it played. The controls are very weird for a third person shooter, the physics in the game seemed bad and i also did not like the characters. However when i played some more i noticed that the problem i had with this game is that i took it seriously, that was my mistake. Just play the game to have fun, create chaos using the unrealistic physics and fly/jump around the map. That is where the game shines.Also the graphics and the sounds are great if your pc runs it well. This is probably the biggest problem of this game, alot of people seem to have trouble running this game on their pc. This is not the case for me, i run it perfectly on max settings 1080p at minimum framerate of 90 and average around 110 fps. (on a 980ti, i7-4770)All in all based on the experience i currently have with this game i would rate it an 8/10 (this is if your pc runs it well).			"

												I know that this game has been getting alot of negative reviews mostly because of ram and performance and stuff like that, and i even get performance issues sometimes as well, but for that all you need is just a compter that is compatible with this game. So besides all of the fps drops, and bugs and♥♥♥♥♥♥the actual point of a review is about the gameplay not the performance and the gameplay is great for me and this is my type of game. You get over the top explosions, plenty of bases to liberate and a gigatnic map (like holy♥♥♥♥♥♥the map is big), So here are my cons and prosCons:a few fps dropsa bit of bugsand some times the gameplay gets a bit repetitivePros:lovely ♥♥♥♥ing explosionsGreat gameplaya huge♥♥♥♥♥map that will never get oldand you can literally shoot your own action movie			"

 I give Just Cause 3: 6/10  SPOILER FREE! Just cause 3 is a very good game. It has many pros aswell as flaws. Just cause for me has been a great franchise, Its one of my childhood favourites. I really got into Just Cause when Just Cause 2 demo dropped in 2010, gosh I played that demo over and over again even though it was 30 minutes. Just Cause always been a game where its a sandbox full of explosions. Now let's get into the games pros and cons. Pros  The best feature is the map. The map is beautifully designed, with a range of different places to visit. Just cause 3's map from 2 isn't bigger, but it surely is more vivid and alive. The combat in the game is very good. It's really fun to blow up stuff depending on the location you shoot e.g if you shoot the top part of the speakers, it blows up faster. The graphics are amazing (when they're isnt any fps issues) The game feels much more alive instead of having weird NPC standing around like in JC2. Combat transport. There is a great variety from tanks to OP helicopters. Cons  the worst thing about the game is the FPS performance. It doesn't matter if you have a high-end PC or a low-end PC, JC3 is just really bad at keeping the performance steady. The story itself is so bad. JC2 story felt alot longer and more serious. I feel like in JC3 all you do is go around blowing up stuff with a few epic moments here and there. Don't get me started on the deaths scenes, none of them were emotional at all. The story is really short. You can literally complete it in a day. Public transport is really bad. Driving mechanics are so bad, motorcycles do random 180 turns if you turn slightly and cars dont turn at all. Character development is really monotone. There isn't any progressing towards any of the side characters to make you feel attached to them.I hope you have enjoyed my review of Just Cause 3. I was NOT going to recommend it however, there are things such as the map that is so beautiful it has to be a 6 instead of a 5.  Story Graphics Performance Soundtrack Enjoyment Overall   5 9 3 7 8 6.4   "

												Yes there it is horrible having to log on to crappy servers every 10 minutes. Yes it crashed on me about 10 times. Yes limiting the amount of fast travel is very annoying. Yes the initial load time is about 5 minutes. But its all worth it. The amount of fun I get from creatively blowing things up and running away from the authorities keeps me going. There's such a satisfying aspect to liberating all the towns. I feel like I really earn my upgrades when I complete the challenges to get 5 gears.Overall, you're going to have to deal with a lot of bull crap, but the game is amazingly fun, and hopefull they will eventually patch all the bad things out.

												Having Played Through the entire Campaign, Both DLC Expansions, and Liberated the Entire Map, i Would have to say Just Cause 3 is a blast from start to finish, becuase unlike other Games which try to go for more ""Realistic"" Approach to getting a job done, Just Cause goes for the Rediculous, Just Cause is built to be played how the players want, Blowing things up and Tearing Stuff down, And thats what sets it apart and makes it worth the 60$ (On regular Sale) Price it is. Quite Simply, Just Cause 3 is a game built from the ground up for the player to play, to enjoy and to have fun with, as apposed to other game titles which simply aim to get the player to play.			"

												I am only 3 hours in and sorry I can no longer get a refund.I cannot recommend this game so far based on performance and gameplay issues. Until a major patch is released, containing combinations of both stability fixes and options/settings which should have been standard on day one, this game is best left unpurchased.How is a 'modern' shooter relased without any ability to adjust FOV?! Where is borderless window mode? Why Is V-Sync destroying performance? What happened to make the driving controls so slow, stiff and unusable compared to previous Avalanche games? I recommended Just Cause 2 to so many people, and was so excited for this game. You guys are getting beat up on this release and you really earned it.Barring a major overhaul Just Cause 3 is NOT recommended for purchase, and Avalanche has a lot of work ahead of them to regain my trust as a game developer selling products on Steam.

Performance isn't very well on my PC, a bit stuttery every now and again, but that's probably because I only have 6GB of RAM and you hopefully have more than me. Don't expect a very rich story, but who cares about the story when it's a game all about action, and the story missions are pretty cool!

												    I loved Just Cause 2, so despite all the mixed reviews, I decided to give 3 a try. Unfortunately, the poor optimization and stuttering during firefights, or explosions completely ruins the experience. three or four enemies shooting will make the game stutter every few seconds, for a second or more. This is after I spent literally hours changing settings (underclocking card, admin mode, compatability mode, and every other fix i could find online) so the game wouldnt crash during the opening scene (which i attempted to play through no less than 2 dozen times). My rig isnt the best (I5 3570K with 8 Gigs Ram and a GeForce GTX 760 with updated drivers) but i easily surpass the ""minimum"" Recommendations for the game. I wish I could get my money back for this game and try it again in a year or two for $20.    From the small amount of time i got to play the game, it seemed like it would be a lot of fun so if you have a better rig/different graphics card/ or lots of time on your hands to troubleshoot and money to burn, good luck!

												The very first car I got into was surrounded by wreckage and on fire.  Shortly after it started to move it exploded.  That's this game in a nutshell.  While Just Cause 3 is fun if you can get it to run at a playable frame rate, if you loved Just Cause 2 and don't exceed the minimum requirements for JC3 you'll want to play that instead.  JC2 is polished, well designed, the controls are sensibly mapped out, and it runs like hot butter.  JC3 is none of these things, and should be avoided until the developers have had time to get the performance - and hopefully the interface - up to snuff.			"

												A fun, if repetative game. The DLCs while short, add such massively game chanign items that it's not worth playing the game until all the DLCs (Land, air sea) are out - Land adds mechs, Air adds the ability to be a jet fighter with unlimited homing missiles, jet pack and machine gun... Sea: Well who knows because that DLC is MIA, but if you want to be able to use whatever is in it to play the main game you're going to have to wait, or be in the situation of having completed JC3 and then being handed a really cool toy that would have been usefl 40  hours earlier when you gave a tinker's cuss.

And I have a Rig that sure as hell would be able to run the game!As I searched for answers on the world wide web I stumbled over a forum thread which seem to focus on the fact that this game leaks memmory. So basicly If I understand it correctly (Anyone is welcome to comment and correct me on this) if you have 8 RAM capacity in your rig, it doesn´t matter cuz the game will still require the double amount. So Avalanche or Square Enix? What will you do about this? It´s almost been a year now, and you guys do nothing to sort this problem out?I tell you I got so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that I demanded a refund. Which is a first time for me in my entire life as a gamer!			"

												Just Cause 3 is worth getting just because the destruction and free playing of the game allows for different ways to approach a situation like you could in Just Cause 2.The game plays out a lot like Just Cause 2 with some minor differences.Con's- Jets and Piloting planes is a PAIN with the default controls.- Not much in the way of the story to really grip you but you, ended on a good note for the story.- Controls for the game could have been better planned out, but I spent a little time remapping my keys.- Side missions and Challenges unlock weapons and equipment upgrades.Pro's- Buck Hunting with a Grappling Hook- Helicopters may have been simplified like Just Cause 2 but it was nice being able to actually dog fight in a helicopter.- Large Map- Plenty of collectables to keep you busy if your a collectable hunter.- Challenges and leaderboards to see if your number one against your friends for challenges and stunts.The game does leave you sorta wanting to make some adjustments into the mechanics or controls, but it might be just me because I have gotten use to the flight controls of GTA V for a keyboard setup. But all in all I had some fun attempting all the challenges and being challenged attempting to free the entire map.I did this game with out much of the DLC its not really required but some of it looks like it wouldn't hurt to get if your really interested in getting it.

												This is a disappointment. The story isn't great, which it really isn't supposed to be. The online connections suck and you can't turn them off as I can tell. The Air land and sea pass doesn't even give you all the weapons, or the special wingsuit and parachute. Hell you can't even change his outfit! Customization is minimal to none, and the weapons are either weak, or too powerful. The controls, made by Helen Keller, are barely usable, hell you cant even zoom in for sights until you unlock it! Not like it would help anyway the camera doesn't even ♥♥♥♥ing work, especially with the wingsuit and parachute. The skyfortress DLC is too damn short too and has no ♥♥♥♥ing content. except the wingsuit, the fortress, and the drones. The story has a few short missions. That's it! That's all! Not like the wingsuit is even fun to use. The camera ruins it and you can't use the weapons on easily because the camera is drunk and the weapons go off of the angle Rico is at. The is stupid considering that the camera is usually pointed at his side. Good Job on that one! Again with the wingsuit if you fall, you can't get back up until he is done ♥♥♥♥ing hurling, because he looked at the damn camera! The bavarium wingsuit's evade is♥♥♥♥♥♥too, you have to press whatever the hell you have it set to, with w,a,s, or d, at THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING TIME! and you barely have a warning sometimes and it takes a while for it to actually work. Same with the take off from the ground. Hold E for 30 minutes and you might take off! The gear collecting isn't as good as collecting the boxes full of parts in the second one. Then you basically have to do them for some things you should already have! This is probably my most hated game.			"

												Got the XL version on the 75% off sale for $20. Had been waiting for a while to get this game after seeing fun gameplay clips online. With a relatively high-end setup, I had to go seriously low quality to get a playable framerate consistently - WAY lower than anything of the likes of GTA V etc... Also, the driving and combat physics just felt very stiff and not easy to control like many other games... so I got a refund within 2 hours of gameplay.TL;DR: Looks fun, but lacking in control and performance -- try it out for yourself and refund if it's not good enough within 2 hours!

												First off, those who are complaining about the performance in this game, be sure to use the recommended system requirements and not the minimum. This game eats RAM and i recommend at least 16GB minimum for smooth performance. The lowest GPU i would use would be the gtx 960 and even then maybe something stronger. Now, the game itself is amazing. The graphics are really crisp, the physics are fun to mess around with, and you can't ever run out of things to do!			"

												Yes there it is horrible having to log on to crappy servers every 10 minutes. Yes it crashed on me about 10 times. Yes limiting the amount of fast travel is very annoying. Yes the initial load time is about 5 minutes. But its all worth it. The amount of fun I get from creatively blowing things up and running away from the authorities keeps me going. There's such a satisfying aspect to liberating all the towns. I feel like I really earn my upgrades when I complete the challenges to get 5 gears.Overall, you're going to have to deal with a lot of bull crap, but the game is amazingly fun, and hopefull they will eventually patch all the bad things out.

												Semi-unplayable due to massive glitch. One so far I've discovered.Large chunks of  not-very-close land is sharply geometric, usually hundreds of triangles make up the land instead of a textured landscape. There are photos of this occurence elsewhere on the net so I won't bother trying to screencap my own.Close to me, land is normal, but textures can even shift from fully detailed to N64 quality, and back, depending on how you work the camera. Based on these currently unsolvable bugs I can't recommend this game would be fun for anyone else, because I can't say that it works properly.			"

												I kinda liked Just cause 2. Although the story was rather forgettable, I found the whole freeroaming faffing-about gameplay to be rather entertaining. I would have liked it a hell of a lot more if it wasn't for the absolute mind-numbing chrashes every 20 minutes (The exact time varied from 10 to 40 min, but almost all of them occured just when I was about to have fun.).In short, fun game held back by absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥bleedingly annoying technical issues.Is JC3 any different?Well the gameplay has received a significant amount of polish. Movement is much more fluid and entertaining (especially with the addition of the wingsuit), and combat feels like an actual part of game instead of an afterthought. Another major improvement on its predecessor is that the characters are actually suprisingly well written and  voice-acted this time around, meaning that you actually give a toss about them. The technical aspect however, still makes me want to repeatedly slam my (or preferebly someone else's) head into a desk. Although crashes are no longer as frequent as they were in JC2, they still have a tendency to occur at the worst possible moments. However there is a much bigger problem. Initially I expierienced some minor framedrops, which seemed only logical since my PC isn't that great (i5-6400&GTX 750ti), so I turned the graphics down a bit (from high-medium to low). However, as time went on, the framerate became a lot worse  to the point of it being uplayable after 6 hours, even with all the graphical settings turned down the bare minimum. I know it is very common for games to suffer in performance as time goes on, but I've never experienced such a ridiclulous dropoff in performance in such a short timespan. Apparently  the game has issues with ram usage, but since I got 16 GB of RAM I would find this highly unlikely. So then I tried running it on a more beefed up (although a bit older) rig (i7-3500&GTX970) to see if that would change anything. It did. For six hours at least, after which the framerate became so un-♥♥♥♥ing-bearable I had to turn everything down to minimum AGAIN in order to maintain an average of 50 fps. And remeber, this is ONE FULL YEAR after launch. I heard this game had some performance issues but I expected it to be resolved by now. All that happend after launch was the devs releasing DLC instead of actually fixing their bloody game. I know some of the blame lies with the publisher, since the western branch of Square Enix is quite agressive when it comes to pushing potential profit over game quality, a key example being Deus Ex: Mankind Divided with a quite frankly cartoonishly evil pre-order scheme, splitting the orginal game into 2 parts, and some ridiculous one-time use microtransaction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also, Steam cloud sync doesnt appear to work properly for me with this game, dunno whats up with thatIn short, if you have a PC that actuallly can run the ♥♥♥♥ing thing, Just Cause 3 is a pretty fun game. Otherwise, don't buy it.			"

Most complaints, seem to stem from the fact that it doesn't add anything new to the Just Cause formula. Which tbh, is exactly what I was hoping for. The game performs alright on the 980ti, though I wish it had SLI support.			"

												I have been a huge fan of the Just Cause games since the second I probably gave in about 800 hours on the xbox 360 i went through 2 xboxes playing Just Cause 2 and even the first. This game was a true addition to this series, fun, good story in my opinion and most important gameplay. This game serves very well in all departments but driving. Like seriously you woud expect a AAA title to have good driving mechanices like GTA or Just Cause 2. But nope the driving is♥♥♥♥♥♥ its funny how the got a very respectable title of gaming the Burnout people to help create driving in JC3 but no they failed. Failed very hard with that. Along with the mini games ie, scrapyard,wingsuit, and♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. They suck as well and the worst part is you need to complete those in order to unlock even cooler stuff but you cant because its hard as ♥♥♥♥ because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics.Id give the game a 8/10			"

												I've played for about an hour so far, I'll update this review in future if I feel I need to. I have to say so far that Just Cause 2 is more fun. This game is constantly online and pops up with ""you drove faster than this many people on your friends list"". Totally immersion breaking, no one cares. Overall this game is fun but is also horribly optimized. In the hour I have played it has crashed three times and I can't keep 60 fps on a GTX 1070 and I7 6700K. I also encountered many glitches like falling through the map and AI running into walls. It's a shame because this game has the potential to be great. Buy Just Cause 2 instead.			"

												With just about an hour of game time in, It's really easy to see that this is a terrible PC port. The game itself seems very fun and enjoyable and I would LIKE to play more of it as soon as possible. But the preformance is all over the place. My game struggles to keep a stable 30 fps even when artifically capped by external software. My set up is medium to high range with a GTX 970 and an i5, so I shouldnt be expriencing these issues. This is about Arkham Knight level of bad.... With that said, I'm feeling a strong sense of buyers remorse and I just warn anyone looking at this game to realize that you'll need a super rig to play this game at a stable FPS. Hopefully updates and patches fix this mess...			"

Just Cause 3Gameplay:I really liked the game, finished story and really enjoyed it, explosions and physics is awesome, beside of this story also very cool.

I usually play all game on ultra graphics, so i was really wondered when i was needed to set it to low graphics and play it on 30 FPS on serious drops.

												Just play Just Cause 2 instead of this one. With mods, you'll be able to acquire most of the new features (and definitely the only one that matters, the wingsuit), all with a bigger island, without forced online, and without abysmal optimization.I know my account shows less than an hour of play, but after assuming my PC just wasn't up to snuff, I bought it and played it through on PS4. Turns out the optimization is even worse there, and the rest of the game isn't anything to write home about compared to JC2, so buy that instead.			"

												Why I bought Just Cause 3. A tale told by P.E. :I'll list some of the major reasons why I bought it:#Wingsuit: Like many others, I was fascinated by the idea of flying faster than in that big ol' parachute. The controls are....well you have to take some time to learn then, but then its fun.#Cargoplane: This was one of the major reasons why I bought it. Yes. Because of a plane.Now whats so special about planes I hear you asking. Basically, alone the size of this beast, you may need to look around for an hour till you find a suitable airfield. Also, you can go inside the cargoroom and open the ramp. It fits 6 cars or 3-4 tanks. And they stay perfectly safe while flying. You can literally drop tanks at your opponents.#DDboat: As with the plane, I liked the fact that you can have a boat, where you can load in vehicles and other stuff and drive around with it, I just like vehicles with more options then just to drive em' in general. #The map: Bigger than in Just Cause 2 but still with much effort in detailsMoutainbases, oilrigs, smugglercaves, a whole new world as some famous disney actor would sing. #The mods/challanges:Nope not the multiplayer ones unfourtunatly. I mean the idea of not just finding some crates to upgrade (like in JC2) but making them'' challanges have a use!Every skill has a ""skilltree"" and each skill in theese trees is unlocked via gears which you get (1-5) by completing challanges. But not only the good ol' land-/air-/searaces. No! New wingsuit courses where you might end up hitting the ground a bunch of times till you make it top score.Grapplinghook challanges where you have to use a magnet to take raw materials to a pit. Sounds lame? It isnt, because there are enemy cars ramming you. Bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Destruction challanges where you have to make as much chaos (with one type of weapon/vehicle) as you can!The one challange which name I dont remember, where you have a bomb in your vehicle and you have to make a jump to hit the target and destroy as much as you can (I cant explain that one so well sry)#I liked JC2. Yes I love'd it. Just the idea of destroying stuff all day long.#The story: I understand that it's by far no blockbuster plot, but I enjoy(ed) it.A evil dictator which knows rico since his childhood? Rats? A scientist whose face got burned up because of her reckless experiments? I've played games with a better story less then Jc3.#The enemies: I thought there wouldnt be so much different enemies. (you might consider the next lines as spoilers, but its no storyones) .There are for instance: Normal soilders with assault rifles, pretty weak. Snipers, they can hit you prettty hard if you dont move out of their sight, but also weak. Soilders with kevlarchestpieces and helmets, they can take a bunch of bullets if you dont aim precise. Special soilders with freaking gatlings, ye they.....I dont like em' ^^And ye, its a bit longer than expected and forgive me if I wrote some words wrong, Its been some time since I wrote that much in English and I dont see that good without my glasses^^Hope that helped.

No idea. The game is unplayable.Bottom line: This game should not have left beta stage for another couple of months.

 If Michael Bay ♥♥♥♥s with Peter Parker and Bruce Wayne, the baby would be this game.Okay, so i just finished (read: 30% of the game) the main story of this game and i decided to do a serious review.Please note that this is not an exaggerated review. This is a honest review.If you don't want to read the whole review, here's the quick version of my review:Is this game worth $40? YES, IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.Only took me 5 seconds into the first mission to realize this game is directed by Michael Bay.9/10.RatingDescriptionGameplay: 9/10The gameplay is purely amazing and really fun. The devs are like, ""♥♥♥♥ real life physic, we will create a game with bollywood-physic."". There are so much places to explore, freedom, destructions, creative way to kill enemies, and chaos. The map is waaaay bigger than GTA V[www.gta5cheats.com]. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's so amazing that i can't describe it with words. If you wanna experience the gameplay, play the game yourself. Don't watch others play. As for multiplayer, currently, there are no multiplayer yet but the people who made JC2-MP are currently working on JC3-MP[www.jc-mp.com], so the multiplayer will be available soon (and it's free! ). You only need to wait.Performance: 8/10.This game runs smooth 60 fps on medium-high setting on a GTX 960. Only crashed once in 24 hrs of gameplay. But i've heard AMD users got a terrible performance in this game. Honestly, this game deserves an Overwhelmingly Positive review. Almost all of the negative reviews are about AMD poor performance. So, if you are an Nvidia user, this game is massively recommended. Graphic: 8/10The graphic is quite good, it's a bit photorealistic. Sometimes, the graphic feels so real and it's easy to immerse yourself into the game thanks to the graphic and soundtracks. The explosions are amazing, probably this game has one of the most beautiful explosions. But there are only 3 (Correct me if i'm wrong ) Anti-Aliasing method in this game. FXAA, SMAA, and SMAA T2X. But the aliasing can be easily ignored since this is a high action game.Story: 7/10.The story is about an evil, cruel, and oppressive dictator. The story is ok, But you don't need a The Last of Us grade story in Just Cause, trust me.Soundtrack: 7/10.The soundtracks are ok.Overall: 9/10 The game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Do you like explosions? Do you love to cause a chaos in a video game? Do you love to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up for♥♥♥♥♥♥n' giggles? Do you love grappling hook? Do you love flying? Do you like epic action-movie-like game?If yes, then i HIGHLY recommend you to get this game. Do yourself a favor, buy this game "

What I dislike about the game is that you can't skip cut scene some of you might like that but I don't. The other thing I don't like is that it takes forever to go places if you don't have a car you are going to take forever to get to places or a plane or any type of automobile.

												The game is honestly great, but it's hard to appreciate due to the mess they did and never bothered to fix, how it runs so poorly and manages to look worse than Just Cause 2 released all those years ago. Getting it for 19 bucks with the sale slightly compensates for it but I still can't recomend buying it when they refuse to fix anything and still release dlc bits like it's a f2p.A real shame. Buy it during a sale at your own risk, or don't and save yourself the frustration that comes with it.			"

												The game is honestly great, but it's hard to appreciate due to the mess they did and never bothered to fix, how it runs so poorly and manages to look worse than Just Cause 2 released all those years ago. Getting it for 19 bucks with the sale slightly compensates for it but I still can't recomend buying it when they refuse to fix anything and still release dlc bits like it's a f2p.A real shame. Buy it during a sale at your own risk, or don't and save yourself the frustration that comes with it.			"

												Look it's a fun game. If it doesn't crash on you before you hit the 10 hour return policy, and you get it 50% off, pick it up. Sometimes they release updates that make it more stable, other times they release updates that keep me from being able to launch the game... yeah it's a hoot.			"

												I kinda liked Just cause 2. Although the story was rather forgettable, I found the whole freeroaming faffing-about gameplay to be rather entertaining. I would have liked it a hell of a lot more if it wasn't for the absolute mind-numbing chrashes every 20 minutes (The exact time varied from 10 to 40 min, but almost all of them occured just when I was about to have fun.).In short, fun game held back by absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥bleedingly annoying technical issues.Is JC3 any different?Well the gameplay has received a significant amount of polish. Movement is much more fluid and entertaining (especially with the addition of the wingsuit), and combat feels like an actual part of game instead of an afterthought. Another major improvement on its predecessor is that the characters are actually suprisingly well written and  voice-acted this time around, meaning that you actually give a toss about them. The technical aspect however, still makes me want to repeatedly slam my (or preferebly someone else's) head into a desk. Although crashes are no longer as frequent as they were in JC2, they still have a tendency to occur at the worst possible moments. However there is a much bigger problem. Initially I expierienced some minor framedrops, which seemed only logical since my PC isn't that great (i5-6400&GTX 750ti), so I turned the graphics down a bit (from high-medium to low). However, as time went on, the framerate became a lot worse  to the point of it being uplayable after 6 hours, even with all the graphical settings turned down the bare minimum. I know it is very common for games to suffer in performance as time goes on, but I've never experienced such a ridiclulous dropoff in performance in such a short timespan. Apparently  the game has issues with ram usage, but since I got 16 GB of RAM I would find this highly unlikely. So then I tried running it on a more beefed up (although a bit older) rig (i7-3500&GTX970) to see if that would change anything. It did. For six hours at least, after which the framerate became so un-♥♥♥♥ing-bearable I had to turn everything down to minimum AGAIN in order to maintain an average of 50 fps. And remeber, this is ONE FULL YEAR after launch. I heard this game had some performance issues but I expected it to be resolved by now. All that happend after launch was the devs releasing DLC instead of actually fixing their bloody game. I know some of the blame lies with the publisher, since the western branch of Square Enix is quite agressive when it comes to pushing potential profit over game quality, a key example being Deus Ex: Mankind Divided with a quite frankly cartoonishly evil pre-order scheme, splitting the orginal game into 2 parts, and some ridiculous one-time use microtransaction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also, Steam cloud sync doesnt appear to work properly for me with this game, dunno whats up with thatIn short, if you have a PC that actuallly can run the ♥♥♥♥ing thing, Just Cause 3 is a pretty fun game. Otherwise, don't buy it.			"

												Everything with this game seems to come with a downside. Besides the third party DRM and technical problems:+ There are more guns...- but most of them are trash, and replacing trash with good stuff comes in lieu of an upgrade system.+ The wingsuit and new grapple are fun...- halfway through the game, once you've unlocked their essential functions.+ Detpack rocket boosters allow for creative jumps and improved projectiles...- but detpack placement is imprecise and finnicky for non-stationary or non-rectangular objects.+ Parts of the game are more dense than Just Cause 2...- at the expense of any biome diversity and a very empty third island.+ There are more enemies, some of whom have better survivability due to armor/dodging/shield mechanics...- but they won't get spawned outside of specific bases or missions, so regular gameplay is still too easy.+ Large-scale skirmishes have finally been implemented...- as one-time events rather than a game mode or activity the player can seek out.+ Destruction physics are neat...- where implemented, which is limited to bridges, some walls, and rapidly evaporating towers.+ Some bases have special reinforcements like air strikes and paratroopers...- but being in a ""Combat Zone"" turns most of the standard reinforcements off.There's a great game buried under here, and mods are slowly mitigating or fixing the flaws, but we're ultimately left with the ""potential"" for a great game in an otherwise half-baked lump. Wait for 50% off or skip.			"

												Why I bought Just Cause 3. A tale told by P.E. :I'll list some of the major reasons why I bought it:#Wingsuit: Like many others, I was fascinated by the idea of flying faster than in that big ol' parachute. The controls are....well you have to take some time to learn then, but then its fun.#Cargoplane: This was one of the major reasons why I bought it. Yes. Because of a plane.Now whats so special about planes I hear you asking. Basically, alone the size of this beast, you may need to look around for an hour till you find a suitable airfield. Also, you can go inside the cargoroom and open the ramp. It fits 6 cars or 3-4 tanks. And they stay perfectly safe while flying. You can literally drop tanks at your opponents.#DDboat: As with the plane, I liked the fact that you can have a boat, where you can load in vehicles and other stuff and drive around with it, I just like vehicles with more options then just to drive em' in general. #The map: Bigger than in Just Cause 2 but still with much effort in detailsMoutainbases, oilrigs, smugglercaves, a whole new world as some famous disney actor would sing. #The mods/challanges:Nope not the multiplayer ones unfourtunatly. I mean the idea of not just finding some crates to upgrade (like in JC2) but making them'' challanges have a use!Every skill has a ""skilltree"" and each skill in theese trees is unlocked via gears which you get (1-5) by completing challanges. But not only the good ol' land-/air-/searaces. No! New wingsuit courses where you might end up hitting the ground a bunch of times till you make it top score.Grapplinghook challanges where you have to use a magnet to take raw materials to a pit. Sounds lame? It isnt, because there are enemy cars ramming you. Bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Destruction challanges where you have to make as much chaos (with one type of weapon/vehicle) as you can!The one challange which name I dont remember, where you have a bomb in your vehicle and you have to make a jump to hit the target and destroy as much as you can (I cant explain that one so well sry)#I liked JC2. Yes I love'd it. Just the idea of destroying stuff all day long.#The story: I understand that it's by far no blockbuster plot, but I enjoy(ed) it.A evil dictator which knows rico since his childhood? Rats? A scientist whose face got burned up because of her reckless experiments? I've played games with a better story less then Jc3.#The enemies: I thought there wouldnt be so much different enemies. (you might consider the next lines as spoilers, but its no storyones) .There are for instance: Normal soilders with assault rifles, pretty weak. Snipers, they can hit you prettty hard if you dont move out of their sight, but also weak. Soilders with kevlarchestpieces and helmets, they can take a bunch of bullets if you dont aim precise. Special soilders with freaking gatlings, ye they.....I dont like em' ^^And ye, its a bit longer than expected and forgive me if I wrote some words wrong, Its been some time since I wrote that much in English and I dont see that good without my glasses^^Hope that helped.

												Just play Just Cause 2 instead of this one. With mods, you'll be able to acquire most of the new features (and definitely the only one that matters, the wingsuit), all with a bigger island, without forced online, and without abysmal optimization.I know my account shows less than an hour of play, but after assuming my PC just wasn't up to snuff, I bought it and played it through on PS4. Turns out the optimization is even worse there, and the rest of the game isn't anything to write home about compared to JC2, so buy that instead.			"

												I've played for about an hour so far, I'll update this review in future if I feel I need to. I have to say so far that Just Cause 2 is more fun. This game is constantly online and pops up with ""you drove faster than this many people on your friends list"". Totally immersion breaking, no one cares. Overall this game is fun but is also horribly optimized. In the hour I have played it has crashed three times and I can't keep 60 fps on a GTX 1070 and I7 6700K. I also encountered many glitches like falling through the map and AI running into walls. It's a shame because this game has the potential to be great. Buy Just Cause 2 instead.			"

												With just about an hour of game time in, It's really easy to see that this is a terrible PC port. The game itself seems very fun and enjoyable and I would LIKE to play more of it as soon as possible. But the preformance is all over the place. My game struggles to keep a stable 30 fps even when artifically capped by external software. My set up is medium to high range with a GTX 970 and an i5, so I shouldnt be expriencing these issues. This is about Arkham Knight level of bad.... With that said, I'm feeling a strong sense of buyers remorse and I just warn anyone looking at this game to realize that you'll need a super rig to play this game at a stable FPS. Hopefully updates and patches fix this mess...			"

Walking, driving, etc. just does not feel realistic at all.* Graphics are buggy at best (and generally look horrible even when working)* I have to start over from the beginning each time since the save function does not work* Control mapping has no logic to it* Is the story any good? No idea. The game is unplayable.Bottom line: This game should not have left beta stage for another couple of months. If even alpha stage.I really wanted to like the game since I enjoy Square Enix's other titles. So shame on them for releasing unfinished games.			"

												I absolutely love this game!!But I am getting ahead of myself. First of all: I did not play the first two games in the Just Cause series, so I can't compare this one to them (so I wont). But what I can say is this:Just Cause is a game to have fun with. The entire game is designed to be as ridiculous, funny and explosive as possible. The Wingsuit is the best, most awesome way in a videogame to traverse (okay, second. right behind the Arkham series) and though a little rough to steer at the start, you get used to it really fast and from that point on, it is pure fun. ""But Cap, flying in videogames often gets pretty boring pretty soon"". Well, due to the fact that you have to constantely grapple to the ground with your grappling hook, we will come back to that later, to maintain speed, you are always in danger of hitting the floor with Ricos beautiful face; Or as Nerdcubed put it: ""They made geting around the place amazing.""The parachute, for me, is more like a link between wingsuiting and walking, you will now what I mean when you play the game, but it can also be a way to unload your bullets on the enemy without them being able to do anything against it. Well, unless they have a ac♥♥♥♥ (anti-aircraft-gun), that is... or a sniper... or a chopper with missiles..... or a tank... thinking about it, maybe you should not do this in a big base (of which there are many in Just Cause 3).But the grappling hook is the mechanic that makes Just Cause 3 to a Just Cause game. You can use the device in several ways: you can use it as a way to move around the place, which you will do quite often, since Rico can not sprint; you can use it to get enough speed to use your wingsuit or parachute; you can use it to maintain speed during parachuting/wingsuiting, you can use it to latch on to enemies (or friends ;D ) and kick them Batman-style; you can connect to objects and pull them together; you can tear down Watchtowers or pull Containers onto soldiers...the possibilities are nearly endless.Of course, you dont have to be creative while killing. You can also use the ""normal"" ingame-weapons. There are many types of weapons. From small semi-automated pistols over to grenade launchers with 5 grenades to literally a nuke-missile. And if you like DLC there is also a laser-guided missile-launcher and a few more toys.Speaking of DLC: I bought the day-1-edition, so many of the additional contents i have were cheaper or free for me,so I will now try to review them while having the money in mind.There are 3 big DLCs and a few small ones. the latter contain said missile-launcher, a semi-automated assault-rifle with explosive ammo, a buggy and boat with miniguns, a sportscar with missiles and a few other things.The 3 bigger DLCs are the Skyfortress DLC, the Land Mech Assault DLC and the Bavarium Sea Heist DLC. The first one adds a Helicarrier, a drone that rico can use, a new machine gun and a Jetpack for the Wingsuit which basically turns Rico into Iron Man (including missiles and guns). The second one gives you a new set of Islands in the North-west of the map and 3 Mechs (one of them is controlled remotely) with Force-powers (yes, the Jedi-sort of Force).The last one adds a Seabase and a rocketboat with 10 heatseaking missiles.I will say that I think the first one is a must have, although it sometimes is nice to disable the Jetpack and go back to the roots of wingsuiting, the second also is very cool and the third one is...meh...not worth the money, altough still really fun, since it adds the ability to boost with the wingsuit underwater.Another important aspect: the Story. Sadly, the story of the game is nothing special and very short, and the missions are pretty repetitive. But I almost think thats on purpose. Avalanche did not focus on the story, because the game itself is more than enough fun. But if you are a story-guy, or gal, maybe you should reconsider your choice, or just lower your expectations for this one.To come to a conclusion; Just Cause 3 is an awesome, fun game with severyl unique and exiting features and mechanics. It is a game that does not just give you the fun you want (except for when a NPCs car crashes into the oncoming traffic next to a petrol station and...well, just find out for yourself), you have to get the fun you want, meaning YOU have to do funny stuff and explore/experiment, but if you do that...boy, are you in for a treat. Though the story isn't nearly the selling point, the sandboy aspect, which is quadrupled after completing the story, more than makes up for that.So, if you like explosions, chaos, fun, exploration, eastereggs, more explosions, carnage, more eastereggs, action, even more explosions, Michael Bay, gigantic Maps (I honestly believe it is the biggest Map of a videogame, yes bigger than Witcher 3 or Skyrim) and firepower, this most definetly is not a game for you, but THE game for you.

												Its so beautifully presented and what a sequel should be... bigger and better than those before it. The graphics are a major step up from JC2, each location is unique (unlike the 3 or 4 different types of JC2), the bases are simply incredible and rebel drop/pick-up system negates the need for hours and hours of travelling.I've never had an issue with it, (though I did recieve it on DVD) and every time I play it I still have a blast. The only gripes I have with it are the handling of the land vehicles, and the wonderfully detailed, yet empty, underwater areas (I have an inkling though, that there'll be something soon, with the rate of sizeable DLC packs coming out). It really comes down to what you want from your games. This is the anti-Hitman Absolution, if you like.- Want a deep and serious story or gameplay? You'll be disappointed.- Stealth mechanics? Sorry. Thats too highbrow for Rico.- Physics engine? You're joking.- Want to cause chaos and just make things go BOOM! in a beautiful setting? Ohh yes.- Teather a government soldier to the back of an explosive rocket-powered cow, salute as they disappear into the sky? Hehe, yep.- Take a nitrous injected F1 car screaming down a coast road, off a jump, bail out with the parachute, watch it explode on a colossal satelite dish, pull out a quad grenade launcher and just... lay waste from the air? Yup yup. The Bavarium Wingsuit of the Sky Fortress DLC makes moving around a bit easier too!			"

												★★★☆☆JC3 is an open world explosion simulator.  While lacking JC2's artistic style, it keeps most of the fun.  JC2 is probably the better buy at this point, for alot of reasons.  + Hackable SAMs+ Large open world+ Destruction physics+ Dynamic scoreboards+ Mini encounter events+ Zone and vehicle names on screen+ New objective types and rebel interactions+ Unique radio message for each base destroyed+ No more annoying QTE when trying to steal a vehicle+ The new heat (enemy agro) systems work well, enemies can be stopped when calling for backup, and you have to stay out of sight to lose heat+ Destroying the world is much more rewarding this time around, instead of just a completion % for the sake of %+- Rico's voice reminds me more of Ezio+- Weak story, if you can even qualify it as one+- Vehicle collecting, but vehicles are kinda pointless+- Toggleable passive upgrades, unlocked in a preset order+- Fast travel and supply drops are basically limited to once per life+- Ziplines and infinite remote detonators makes destruction objectives straightforward.  - No minimap- Wingsuit faceplants- No multiplayer/coop- Bad vehicle handling- Limited grapple distance- Can't sprint, crouch, or roll- System resource destroyer (memory leaks?)- Have to manually select story missions on the map- Aiming in vehicles is so sluggish its barely functional- Boost doesn't recharge if you continue to hold the button- No graphic presets and most graphic options are simple on/off choices- The game starts with an escort quest, can't think of a worse possible way...- Most weapons can't ADS, even after you get the ADS unlock, its just a minor zoom with no actual sights- DLCs are crazy pay2win, have animated-comic cutscenes, and interfere with main story progress- CoD style HP regen.  Die for many stupid reasons (usualy related to the wingsuit), but never to combat- Controls are terribly mapped by default, things like closing menus with ctrl, capslock for remote mines- Online DRM-ish (likely just for scoreboards), while there is an option to play offline, this doesn't seem like something that needs to inturupt gameplay- No borderless window mode.  The game loaded up in 720p by default, changing the resolution caused the mouse to register wrong.- Graphics.  Anisotropic filtering is an option, but doesn't actually improve textures.  Jittery shadows.  No real AA.  Some distant terrain looks awful...  - Multiple crashes, almost bringing down the entire system.  To make things worse, these crashes happen after clearing objectives, causing the reward screens to be missed.			"

												I enjoyed this game rather thoroughly.  It has its positives and negatives (but all games do).  Here's a quick breakdown.***Positives:- Voice acting.  Especially in Rico's case.  The chosen voice, in my opinion, is  huge improvement.  Additionally, the phrasing doesn't seem like it is being read from a piece of paper, like the previous iteration.  I swear I heard pages turning in JC2 at times.- Things to do.  There is a lot to do in this game.  I initially went through and took over all of the bases before actually doing the storyline.  There are also a lot of additional challenges to keep you busy, if you are into that.- Controls.  The control scheme is a lot better in this than in the previous iteration.  Using right click for grapple and holding right click for grappling things together is much better than a keybinding.  It allows you to easily run away from the helicopter you just grappled to the ground, before it slams into your face. - Physics.Things are much more smooth in this iteration than the last and there is a lot more fun to be had with the new grapple and other gadgets.  Plus you can use multiple grapples.  For instance, try grappling an enemy truck to a windmill for good times.- Graphics.They are pretty intense and the engine is optimized enough to where a lot can be going on (explosions, people flying away... etc), but not have a huge impact on overall performance.***Negative- Random crashes.It only crashed twice for me for the 50 hours I played it.  Kind of annoying, but it could have been a lot worse.  Other triple A titles have crashed more than this and were far less impressive.- Challenges. These can be fun, but they can also be pretty annoying.  I found a few types to be fun, but the rest ended up just annoying me.  So I avoided them.  It was no problem, though.  I think the main campaign was design for a play through without any unlocked skills.- Introduction screen.Why would any game do this?  Unless you install a mod, you have to wait a good 2-5 minutes before it even starts loading.  This is especially infuriating when the game previously crashed or you just want to pop in for a few minutes and blow stuff up.  Thankfully, there is a mod that skips the intro screen.- Enemy AI.As usual in games like this, the enemy AI is not the smartest.  Actually, they rank closer to idiotic.  If I'm in a helicopter bombarding your base and you cannot see me, then there's something wrong.  A lot of the bases could easily be captured with a heli or a jet within a few minutes.  - Mission bugs.This only happened twice as well.  Two missions randomly showed ""Failed"" for no apparent reason.  The targets were still at full health and I did the thingy, but I failed.  The positive side to this is that, in both occasions, the game's checkpoint put me past the point of failure.  So it wasn't a constant repeated failure.			"

												I am a massive JC2 fan so you'd expect me to like JC3 as well.The game is perfect in every way; apart from one thing; that is the most imporant thing of a open world game.It's the MAP. Don't get me wrong, it looks epic! The problem is, it's unbelievably badly placed out.The south of the map is quite cool with all the islands, but the lack of roads makes it hard to roam with vehicles. Then we have the northern part of the map that is an island about 50% of the maps size. It's just open forest and with an army themed population spead thinly over the island. Due to this it's an incredeble dull place to roam in. The payable area feels very small compared to JC2.Overall JC2 is a better game than JC3.			"

												Background: I didn't play the first Just Cause. The second one I purchased from sale and played through a few times with a good amount of time spent collecting things and doing random sandbox stuff. This third one I bought on launch day and just recently reached 100% completion with around 45 hours of playtime.The game really shines in its audiovisual department with explosions having a decent amount of low frequency sounds and flaming visuals to make them feel impactful and blowing stuff up is just as fun as it was in the previous game. The wingsuit is a nice addition to the movement techniques once you get used to it and how it is different from the familiar parachute gliding.You now have more tools at your disposal to wreak havoc with, most of which you have to unlock doing challenge missions and a few that come with progressing in the story. To me, the most notable addition to the core gameplay is that the standard grapple hook tether wires can now be retracted between objects to make them crash together. You start with being able to shoot 2 wires, but with full upgrades you can have 6 with pulling force strong enough to lift cars. There are also rocket booster explosives that, along with tether wires, are the main tools for doing sandbox-y things.However, there's not a lot of variety in the general gameplay at moment. The enemy AI doesn't really pose any threat so you kinda have to enjoy the core mechanics and be good at figuring out creative ways of causing destruction. The challenge missions could've used at least a few more different categories. Though technically optional, the challenges are scored based on completion time, amount of destruction, accuracy etc. depending on the type and you can get 0-5 gears from each one. The gears unlock equipment of the specific challenge type, but once you have seen all the different types they start to feel a bit of a chore to complete especially when going for 5 gears.The random collectibles seem a bit tacked on as well, though I'm glad that compared to the 2nd game there is a reasonable amount of them and, unlike in some sandbox games, they actually unlock stuff like access to unlimited fast travel or additional weapons and vehicles. Unfortunately the guns don't have a lot of differences in feel between them and some of the vehicles (especially the motorbikes) are really wonky to control.Like most of the other reviews have pointed out, there is a forced online leaderboard system that tracks your efforts in various different feats such as longest headshot distance, highest elevation gained with a parachute or longest distance drifted in a land vehicle. It's a cool idea on paper, but it should work more seamlessly in the background and include an option of opting-out of it or at least hiding the displayed messages that pop-up when someone manages to best you at some feat.In conclusion, the game is pretty much what I expected from the 3rd installment; It has the same campy feel to the story missions, base ""liberation"", stunt driving, vehicles that explode like a pile of gasoline and matches from smallest of bumps and so on. Although the list of negative things I listed is long, there really are only a few major annoyances that could and most likely will be patched out in the near future. I'm hoping there'll be some worthy DLC packs to expand the list of available activities currently in the game.Would I recommend it? Yes, but with an asterisk that in its current form you might find it repetitive and thus not lasting long enough to justify full-priced purchase.			"

Posted: January 6, 2016
												Initially I preordered this game, got terrified by initial release and got refund for it (which I don't regret, since I saved money on DLC this way, which seem to be quite useless now).After patching game runs nice and smooth on my rig (i7, 16 GB RAM, GF970 4 GB, SSD, @1920x1080 almost max setting (AA wasn't maxed for sure, it looks great anyway even like this)). There were just few random freezes (for 1-2 seconds) during intense fights with lots of explosions, perhaps some texture-related issue. Game also takes quite long time to start, but I can cope with that.Gameplay is expectedly repetitive: generally all you do is flying around and blowing things up in most efficient and spectacular ways possible, using explosives, guns, rockets, fixed turrets, boats, cars, trucks, tanks, helicopters (2-4 helicopters that arrive to take you out while you rebranding another military base make nice projectiles for taking out those huge radar dishes), barrels, enemy soldiers and whichever other stuff you can find lying around. Though I must admit, it's not so boring as in Assassin's Creed or other famously-repetitive series, maybe because of nice sea views and that general feeling of warm sunlight and fresh Mediterranean air mixed with heavy smoke from burning fuel tanks and gunpowder.Story. If you want a good, deep storyline with bright characters, smart ideas and food for thought - get up from your cozy chair and get a book, this game is all about explosive destruction democratic liberation of small countries oppressed by vicious self-worshiping egomaniac, nothing to look at here.Not a good thing is that devs are pushing players to play challenges to get any upgrades - you don't get any XP or ""gears"" for completing storyline, liberating areas, etc. Side activities should be just side activities, not compulsory part of gameplay, IMO.On-foot controls feel better than in JC 1&2, though vehicles aren't so good. Cars mostly feel like a brick making its way trough a sandpit (Batmobile from ""Arkham Knight"" feels much better compared to this; you'd better get a car which has more or less responsive controls and make sure it's in your drop list, just in case you'll ever need a car in this game), though it's not that bad since you'll most likely be driving those cars only in missions or challenges. Tanks/APC have camera synced to turret rotation, which turns around slowly, so be prepared to make lots of moves with your mouse if you don't use gamepad (haven't actually tried gamepad in tanks though). Helicopters are not bad way to get around, but aim controls and again synced with camera and also with turn/pitch, so it may take some time to get used to and shoot thing efficiently without being a sitting duck for SAM sites. Airplane controls are simply stupid: who would place yaw controls on Z/C keys?! Maybe someone who has additional fingers or tentacles somewhere in the middle of the palm, I guess. It's really lame and gamepad controls aren't any better - controlling yaw with X/B isn't that convenient, especially taking into account that there seem to be no possibility to remap gamepad controls. So I would recommend this game to those willing to spend several evening on destructions frenzy without any morals or complicated storyline. Also don't forget to check hardware requirements, since game is focused on visuals, you won't get much satisfaction if you can't run it on high enough settings.			"

												Gameplay is fun when it doesn't lag like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but after completing the story there isn't really anything new to do. Too few settlements to conquer and they are all quite similar.The biggest reason why I can't recommend the game are the performance issues. I don't have a top-end PC, but can run most games at medium-high settings. Not the case with Just Cause 3. I was able to barely play for a few hours straight with 60fps on the lowest possible settings, but after the DLC's I can't run the game at all anymore. The problems have existed since day one and all this time we have gotten promises that fixes are coming, but the community has really been let down with Just Cause 3.Only buy it on sale if you have a ♥♥♥♥ing beastly PC.

												Just Cause 3 is a great game that always makes you feel like you're in an action movie. Driving off of cliffs after being in a car chase, climbing to the roof of your vehicle and then leaping off at the last second to grapple onto a nearby helicopter. This game was a lot of fun and exhilarating to play. Taking over bases can get repetitive if you don't change your tactics or vehicles and weapons you're using. But overall a would recommend game.

												I posted a similar review on the Bavarium Heist DLC page, but then realized it wasn't the proper page. Here it is for all to see.You know how devs tend to release the memory requirements of the game they maake, as well as each additional DLC? Well, this game is no different. Only, unlike most developers, when you see the game needs 8 gigs, and each of the DLC require the same, what they actually mean is you need 8 gigs PLUS an extra 8 gigs for each subsequent DLC.But, when I actually CAN load my game up, I'm greeted with great visuals, hilarious moments, and a relatively glitch-free environment. That only lasts for about 2-3 hours before this absolutely trash of a game crashes my system with a day-one memory leak that STILL hasn't been patched. Even worse, it doesn't filter out of your RAM till you restart your PC. GG Avalanche.But wait, there's more!As of this latest update, I can't even load into the game! That's right, this game is absolutely, completely, utterly busted to s--t. As much as I want to love this game, I can only love something that I can actually PLAY.Not to say that I haven't had fun times, I've completed Air Assault and was slowly progressing through Land Mech Battle (that's about when my usual 20+ hours of playtime before the leak set in dropped to a lowly 3-4 hours before dying on me), and I loved the mechanics. The moments were epic, the combat was furious, there was plenty of non-combat activities (cows with thrusters ftw) to keep me occupied for a long time, and I used that to justify the holes and ♥♥♥♥-ups in the game. But now that it's entirely unplayable, I don't have any excuses left, so I'm pulling out all the stops.Just Cause 3 is utter s--t. Like holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ fix this game. I want to love it. I just can't.If anyone who filled out a positive review of this game has similar issues, I urge you to change it around ASAP. Reviews are NOT set in stone. I implore you to show Avalanche this... The hard way.Oh, stats:GTX 980 Tii7-6700K16 GB DDR3-13337200 RPM HDDAKAMore than enough to play this asspit of a game.			"

												Quite disappointed with this game. Maybe i expected too much having played just cause 2 but this game was buggy when i got it and a few things still annoy me. For starters there is the initial loading screen when you open the game. Seems trivial but when the game crashes on you it rubs salt in the wound booting it back up. Then you get to the chore of taking over the outposts and bases which in my opinion takes the fun out of destroying everything and could be better implemented - for example having to look round a base to find the last fuel tank or satellite dish just makes it a grind and takes the pace away from the game. Then the dlc. For starters the sky fortress is ok but the final DLC was a joke that barely took half an hour to complete. The mech dlc being a bit meh to be honest aswell.Those being my major gripes a few things stick out aswell for me but maybe not others. Im not too keen on the upgrade system requiring you to do challenges all over the place and i think it would have been better with a level based system with the challenges giving you better weapons or vehicles. The lack of many weapons in the game seems strange considering the vast amount of vehicles in the game and annoys me especially considering the add on dlc weapons that help flesh it out a bit.Finally the good bits. The game is fun still regardless of its flaws it is still enjoyable and you will sink the hours in - that being said id just get just cause 2 if youre not fussed about graphics. The map is massive and it looks good.All things considered i feel this game had big boots to fill and unfortunately didnt meet up to expectations in my opinion. This game could have been so much better and im dissapointed it isnt therefore i cant recommend it unless it is on sale. Get just cause 2 anyway its amazing.			"

												Audio - Effects : 8/10Audio - Music : 5/10Visuals: 8/10Gameplay : 8/10Overall: 7.5What was for me probably the most anticipated title for the end of the year. I must say I wound up lowering my expectations towards the released date of the game as I had stumbled upon mixed impressions and some harsh criticism from some reviewers. Needless to say, the game was brilliant and was an improvement over an already decent Just Cause 2, however there were a few niggles, some of which annoyed the living daylights out of me.The game brings an impressive load-out of playable missions, objectives, side challenges. It's a vast open-world, with a hefty sequence of campaign missions that will span over the four peninsulas. The physics are brilliantly done. Tethering a chopper and an enemy soldier is somewhat amusing, or putting thrust grenades and watching him disappear into thin air. All I can say is that being Rico for a bit is a load of fun, the wingsuit, grappling hook and parachute combinations are arguably one of the strong points of this game and provides something unique.The good stuff:Explosions on tapA grappling hook, need I say more?Destructible terrain, the usefulness of the grappling hook becomes evident when you need to pull a chaos object to the groundLeader boards - There is no multiplayer, Avalanche has included an in-campaign challenge leader board, certain objectives are compared with those on your friends list and globally. You can also choose to invite others to compete in challenges. It's not something I've seen before, but it works. Visually an impressive game. But not quite GTA V level, but close. Rico is a badass. The wingsuit, grappling hook and parachute can be loads of fun, and an easy way to traverse the terrain Large open world divided into peninsulas. Provides an array of different terrains from seaside villages to mountainous military zones.Wide variety of military hardware at your disposable. Most of which is obtained as you progress through the campaign, in turn reducing the monotony of the missions.Mediterranean / Italian themed - It brings something a little different to the table.Vintage weapons, achievements and collectibles strewn throughout the map. Good luck picking it all up though. There is a lot.Mods are availableThe Bad:I'm so sick of liberatingVehicle handling - Cars in particular have handling that can appear sluggish at first, then suddenly whoops you're on your roof. A controller would probably fix this, but for those stuck with keyboards, car handling is not a strong point. GTA V nailed this.Introduction skits that are unescapable. The number of times I've been pulling out bits of my hair waiting for the cut-scenes to end definitely can be counted on more than one hand.Enemy spawns - Countless of times I've wiped the enemy towers and command posts in front of me, only to discover additional enemies have respawned in them. It's game tech from the noughties. Stupidity - My goodness, the AI bots are incredible thick, I'm partly thankful for this as the reason I actually managed to finish the game. They get stuck behind walls occasionally. They are often dumbfounded by carcases of vehicles/choppers and seem to get stuck. Pedestrians have very little road-sense, often not stopping or aimlessly walking around infront of your vehicle, this makes car based challenges borderline annoying.Locating enemy bases and outposts can become a tedious task later in the game as you head to larger sections of the map, guessing where they may be becomes frustrating especially when it takes you 5 minutes to fly a jet (at 350kmh, very fast) to the other side of the peninsula.

Note, I haven't finished the game yet but I feel like I've put in enough time to make a few points.Pros:- The movement system is fun and works well most of the time, yes not being able to sprint can be a little frustrating but it does force you to chain grappling into parachuting. - Finding creative uses for the tethers and rocket bombs is a bunch of fun. Some of the tech is hit or miss but there are some real gems.- You'll be able to pull off the crazy stunts you see in all the gifs. Once you're comfortable with using the tethers it's pretty easy to amazing moments happen.Cons: - Vehicles are awful. All vehicles have serious problems but I'll focus on planes and motorcycles since they're the worst. Planes are essentially useless because they're so unresponsive. Roll and pitch work alright but yaw might as well be non-existant, it doesn't matter if you're in a jet or a prop plane lining up a target is more frustrating than fun. Motorcycles don't work, seriously they don't work at all. Since the vehicles are so bad you'll be sticking to your grappling hook, parachute, and glide suite < more on that later.- Story. Look I'm not expecting more than action flick level writing from the game but it's worse than just cheesy writing. You'll regularly feel like you missed an important cutscene when the story jumps from one section to another with no explanation. I thought that I'd missed something within the first couple of missions so I checked online to catch up on the cutscenes but there really was nothing there. It's a shame because the characters really are great but the storyline just feels broken. The loading times don't help either (I'm running this off an ssd as well, god help the man that runs this on a hard disk). - Bullet spongy enemies. Some of the enemies take a lot of bullets. That's not to say they're difficult, just frustrating to clean up, you'll end up just grappling them to some distant item and flinging them into an abyss. Rinse and repeat. - Repetition. Eventually you'll find yourself doing the same thing over and over. Sure it's fun to blow up some enemies with a tractor but it takes so much effort to set it up correctly that it's just not worth it. Since the vehicles are so broken you're going to be stuck grappling, parachuting, and gliding everywhere. The same goes for fighting, it doesn't take long to figure out the optimal way to take down the different enemies and using anything else just becomes frustrating. There are a ton of challenges but just a handful of types, gaining points for upgrades just becomes a grind. Conclusion: There are better open world games. It can be fun at times but you'll probably find yourself getting burned out after a few hours.  "

												The wingsuit challenge is driving me crazy, but the else parts are good.Crashed once before, the only problem is that everytime I open it, it will randomly shuffle between windowed and fullscreen, and sometimes when I jumped out and then went back to game, the window became weird with the taskbar being visible.Run under 1080p with 970 and 16gb ram, so the leaking is not a problem for me but could be a problem for the others.

Looks like its a good game, sure doesn't run like one. I remember having tons of fun playing Just Cause 2 years ago when it first came out so I was pretty hyped when I got my hands on Just Cause 3 since it looked like it improved on everything that its predecessor had to offer and then added some more content. I heard it had some problems at release but I was hoping that by now they would have ironed out some of the issues.Unfortunately I've only gotten the game to run smooth for a little under a minute before dropping down to 5 - 10 fps whenever I try to do anything other than walk around and when I actually managed to get a decent framerate it was stuttering like crazy. And that was AFTER I set everything to the lowest possible video settings, including the lowest resolution (something like 640x480 I think), and windowed mode. The final straw was when I rebooted the game to try some new graphics settings and the game crashed and essentially softlocked my computer as soon as I got into the car that spawns next to you when you first load in.I've got a Nvidia GTX 960, 8 gb RAM, and an i7 4790 CPU and while I was trying to find solutions I read many posts by people with higher end rigs having similar issues. If I had to guess it's most likely the RAM for me but the weirdest thing is my friends that have lower or similar specs when compared to mine can run the game smoothly without any issues at all; one of which has a lower end graphics card, lower end processor, and only 8gb of RAM as well. I guess the game just picks and chooses who will be able to play it and I got the♥♥♥♥♥♥end of the stick.Perhaps I'm just unlucky but I can't recommend a game that won't let me play it. If you really want this game and you're feeling lucky, buy it on sale.			"

												It's a good game, as in, what it does, it does pretty well.And if your rig is half decent, you won't have much trouble running it.However, don't get it at full price. The 50Eur price tag doesn't warrant the lack of content you receive for it :/Even for 25Eur, (As of today) i'd only suggest it if you really liked just cause 2, or you just like dynamic explosions. Because you won't be seeing much of anything else .-.			"

												Pros: - Fun as hell.- A-lot of badass moments.- Beautiful graphics.- Huge map.- Can be hilarious at times.- Feels a-lot like just cause 2.- Unbelieveable EXPLOSIONSSSSSSSSSSS- The wing suit is for me the best addition in a game, EVER.- The grappling hook is way more fun than JC2. Cons:- A-lot of frame drops.- Terrible stroy (with Horrible 4th grader's jokes).- Bad physics.- BAD BAD BAD BAD driving (but who drives when you have a wing suit).- Meh shooting.In between:-Can sometimes be very easy and you end up not feeling satisfied, and can sometimes be so hard, you'll throw your computer off the window.-Sometimes the jokes in the story will make you giggle.In a nutshell, it's a very very very fun game. BUT. The bad framerate is very noticeable, and will maybe drive some people nuts. Altough for me its still very playable (GTX 970), and without the framerate thing, it's an AMAZING game.			"

												Overall this game was a great game to purchase. It's been 8 hours now and none of the game has become boring. Over all the game was fun for its creativity and dramatization of violence.Pros:1) Hours of fun.2) Had few bugs from my experience.3) I bought it during the steam winter sale for 75% off.4) The game turned out to be more fun then it looks.5) The game runs greast on my build, never dipping below 60 FPS for sure.Cons:1) The game does not have that much costomiaztion toward perspective that you play from (FOV, distance...ETC).2) Crashed once only at around 3 hours of playing.3) The loading screen at the beginning when you start the game is long and annoying.4) The winter XL sale did not come with all of the DLC, missing around three of the nine dlcs of the game.

The game has crashed a lot and there are a few missions that glitch in really annoying ways (homing missiles won't lock on, commanders not registering as dead after you kill them so you cant progress.)   I bought this on the steam sale and have managed to get 40+ hours out of it, but the glitches are stopping me progrissing in the story.  for all out carnage and and a bit of fun I would recomend it, But the completionest in me cant recomend this one.

												Overall - 7.5/10 - Great , still has problems.Pros - * A NUKE SHOOTER - My life is complete.*Mods*Fun *Grappling *Wingsuit*The Guns are fun*Graphics are pretty*The map - HOLY CRAP IS IT BIG! It is also very varied and fun.*The bombs and destructible enviroment has become an addiction , I have a compulsion to blow up bridges and outposts.*Vehicle choice - While driving is meh , the choice of cars can redeem things.*BOMBS & DESTRUBILITY - Michael Bay's wet dream couldn't match this.In the middle -*Gunplay - Usually good but can be frustrating FOR ME. I might just be bad , saying that I have completed the game.*Driving - I usually glide , but driving can be slidey and stupid. It isn't THAT bad. I can pull off some cool stunts sometimes.*Story - forgettable and meh, I gave up and just blew up some trains. Cons - *DRM - Ahhhhh DRM oh how we love you. Oh wait ... no we don't . We hate you. Don't come back. I once had to install a mod to fix that♥♥♥♥♥♥ I couldn't play until I went offline mode. I know it is Denuvo anti-tamper and it did work. But DRM is an anti-buy repellent for many.*Optimization - While this is mostly fixed  I still get a fps drop every now and then when there are a bunch of explosions or in a city. OR BOTH. But lucky a GTX 750ti was good enough for 60 FPS 1080p. Lucky the game looks good at low otherwise I wouldn't play it that much. Conclusion - Great for sandbox play, open world exploration , mindless destruction , awesome stunts , amazing moments of walking away from explosions. If you have a low end pc. Stay away. If you have bad internet. Consider carefully before approaching. P.S If you don't mind a bit of modding I believe there is a multiplayer mod in the works. So bear that in mind.			"

												Sadly, I was one of the unlucky ones in terms of performance with this game. I didn't get low frame rates, I got UNBEARABLE stuttering after playing for about 30 minutes which progressively gets worse and worse. Even when doing everything I could which includes buying more RAM for my computer to get it to work, which after doing that extends the progressive stuttering by about 15 minutes.But, as you can tell by the total hours I have and the thumbs up, I still liked the game. I personally don't think its as good as 2, I think the physics engine let you be a bit more creative and chaotic with the cars and boats in 2, but there are some improvements here, but there aren't enough and there are some downsides to it which make it miss the mark for me.Of course I still reccomend the game, it is great fun. The missions were a lot more fun (despite there not being too many and in total there is about 5 hours worth of main missions) than in Just Cause 2, and the chaos was FAAAAAR higher than 2. But those are the only things that this one does better. Don't get me wrong, I still reccomend the game, I CANNOT stress that enoguh, just be wary that your performance may not be too ideal. Oh, how I wish the team that brought Mad Max to PC were responsible for this... *Sigh*Also, the unlocking system I was not a big fan of, it required too much busy work and completing boring missions in my opinion, which were not helped at all by the stuttering I was experiencing. But again, I WAS UNLUCKY. You might have better performance, and if you do, then awesome. Like I said, as you can tell, the negatives don't put me off reccomending it. But if you want to play it safe then get the console versions if your PC is similar to mine.Specs:AMD FX 6300GTX 96012Gb RAM1Tb HDDWindows 10+CRAZY action+Missions can be absolute chaos, in the best possible way. - Busy work to unlock stuff- Physics engine was more enjoyable- Optimisation could/SHOULD have been better from a game brought to you by the team who made the amazingly optimised Mad Max			"

												Possibly my favourite game of all time and I only bought it last weekend :DPros- Destruction is amazing, no other game can do destruction as well as Just Cause can- Graphics are nice, visuals are bright and vibrant.- Attention to detail is very good, e.g. when you run over sun flowers in their fields in a vehicle each one individually gets flattened- Extremely fun! Finally a game that pretty much just focuses on pure fun, messing around and nothing else- Progression is very enjoyable, upgrade your wingsuit/other gear and slowly take Medici settlement by settlement, also store every vehicle that you can find in the game to have it delivered to you in a rebel drop whenever you like (This includes F1 Cars, Sports cars, Jets, Tanks, and the huge cargo planes)- Every limitation is removable! At the start of the game you may notice that some annoying limitations are added to stop you from immediatley getting lots of jets and other things in rebel drops and destroying everything on the island. There are of course legitimate intentions for this as it would not be very challenging if they did not have these limitations but every single one can be removed later game as you progress and unlock more things.- Literally limitless possibilities! Drop 2 buses out from a cargo plane onto one of Di Ravello's bases, or create your own home made mortar strike using dual tethers, a ramp and random passing by cars. Anything you can think of is do-able in Just Cause 3 :)Cons- Some hardware issues with the game - apparently does not work on a lot of different systems which could be worrying for some.- FPS drops are often. I run this game on high settings with some set to ultra. I have a Gigabyte GTX 970 graphics card and an AMD 8320 3.5ghz processor with 8gb of RAM. My FPS usually stays at a straight 90 but can sometimes dip as low as 17fps.- The game crashes fairly often. It is usually when I get into helicopters or any kind of airborne vehicle the game sometimes crashes - roughly once every 2 hours- Load screens take a long time to load- Is perhaps a little repetative after a while, but this can all be fixed with your out of the box thinking and creativity on how to complete tasks!NOTE: Make you sure you have manually updated your windows to service pack 1. I went through the hassle of reinstalling Windows TWICE before figuring out that all I had to press was one button to get my Just Cause to work. R.I.P :(			"

												1st of All I just want to state that this game is amazing and I love it to bits. However I am right now getting very strange frame drops(my guess is it has to do with the lod or explosions taxing my graphics card to much... I have a 770 for those asking and for most of the game I get around 80 frames a second, but then sometimes at random, sometimes when I make half a base go boom in 1 sec I get a frame drop to about 7 frames or less for about 10 sec. Needless to say this is making the game unplayable right now.Please note I have tried turning all the settings to off and low to try and fix it, but all that does is increase my frames... I still get the random drops in FPS[to about 10 fps and bellow instead].(which I think is linked to lod and particle effects) When this is fixed its a 10/10 until then its more like a 3/10.			"

												Ok I know a lot of people are disliking the game. First off I find this game to be more like a good time killer and relaxing blow em up type. The new wingsuit is my favorite way of getting around and now it is equiped with weapons!!!The game is actuallt pretty easy for the most part, my biggest complaint is unlocking the gears. These are challenges that when completed gives you boost or allows ou to use less energy. The problem is they are so boring and you usually have to do the same challenge multiple times to get all the gears unlocked.That said I really enjoyed the game and I think it would be fun if we can start a new game with gears already unlocked once we complete the game. I would do a replay except that I have all gears unlocked and I really don't want to do them again.Also please note if you start a new game you loose your old game unless you back it up in the save folder, there is no multiple save slots you have been warned.I do recommend it though if you want a good time killer that is fun.

												Just Cause 3 is a hard game to recommend. Yes there's lots of good action and the world is huge and the explosions plentiful. Yes there is some fun gameplay to be found here. However all of this comes with some giant caveats that I might as well just list out:game is kinda crashy with lots of weird scripting bugscampaign missions are poorly scripted and some just plain awful. The last boss is maybe one of the worst I've ever seenside content is required to advance main story and is repetetive as all hellminigames are required to upgrade your equipment not that you'll ever really need the upgradesthere's zero penalty for ever dying which makes everything feel easy as helldifficulty curve is nonexistent. The first town or base you take over is the same as the last 20 hours latermotorcycle handling is so bad it feels brokenthere's a strange lack of weapon unlocks or customization of any sortthe game just feels kinda low budget and lifeless compared to Just Cause 2 and Mad MaxAlso by far the BIGGEST sin of Just Cause 3 is that Avalance removed the WHOMP WHOMP WHOMP sound of your vehicle tumbling end over end! What the heck guys.This isn't the worst game in the world and I hate to say ""get it on sale"" but this is a perfect sale game if you want some mindless violence. Just don't go in expecting anything new or super good. It just feels...old.			"

I knew I had to wait because I really had been looking forward to this game for quite some time but I've read so many poor reviews on it I couldnt justify buying it at full price.. So I see it onsale and figured what the hell.. I read a few ""fixes"" for it and figured I'd try my luck.I buy it, DL it and start it up.. Okay.. Trying to get in the game takes a while because I have to watch a stupid cut scene of the main character sitting on the beach.. No no.. This is where the game is trying to connect to servers.. smfh.I boot up the game.. ♥♥♥♥♥ going crazy everywhere.. Its running like trash but I figure.. I""ll wait until I get through this ""action"" opening scene.. Finally get to where I can just stand and look at overall performance and yea, still runs like crap.. Skip 2 hours later after researching alot of ""fixes"" I find that the reason the game runs like trash is because its trying to contact the servers at all times..I really couldnt believe that this would cause such an issue but I figured what the heck lets give it a try..LET ME TELL YOU... It improved performance 90% I was floored.. So I was happy I beat the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance boss and now could start playing my game. Skip several hours of game play.. Was having a blast.. I wake up sort of early this morning to play a bit, get my coffee going.. Sit down try to boot up the game..Now IM GETTING A ♥♥♥♥ING ERROR MESSAGE TELLING ME THE GAME CANNOT CONNECT TO SERVERS.♥♥♥♥ YOU!!!!!!!!Now I cannot play my game, because the fix that I found was to block the servers.. TLDR;-Game runs like potato because it connects to the servers.-No sign of them fixing this issue as the games been out since Dec.-Games fun if you can play it.-Principal of forcing you to play online makes me want to punch babies.

												Since I have an Nvidia card, I haven't seen any problems with performance, though it crashed on me once.I really like this game, it took the good bits of Just Cause 2 and amped them up to almost perfection, and it left all of the bad stuff from JC2 and didn't include it. This game is like a much more polished version of Just Cause 2 with better characters, missions, gameplay and pretty much everything else.			"

												I guess i dont really have a right to comment case i actully havent played that much. But i will warn you now if you get this game expect heaps of bugs. I cant even get it past the start screen because it always crashes. The most its gone is 3 minutes into the beginning of the game. I know its a new game and all but its either it works and its totally worth it or it crashes everytime you try to play and you have wasted like 70 dollars if you willing to take that risk be my guest but dont say i didnt warn you.

												I really wanted to be one of the few where this game worked well for me.  But I was QUICKLY disappointed.  Yeah I only played the game for a short while because it keeps crashing!  It crashed when I ran it the first time and all the other times.  Maybe if I had more ram I'd have more luck, I don't know, I can't instantly upgrade right now.  JC2 was one of my favorite games ever, it was beautiful and ran great with game mechanics of simple fun, which I was hoping for from this game too.  Sadly aside from the crashes, the little bit of the game that I've seen the vistas just look dull and not as vibrant and beautiful as JC2.  I do like some of the upgrades to the visual interface such as showing the kills so fully on the reticule and the alert system being right and obvious on the screen.  I hope someday they actually fix this game rather than just pumping out addons.  I'm going to ask for a refund and frankly, it saddens me to do so.  I hope I can get this game someday when it's fixed.			"

												I've been reinstalling this for several months to check if they've fixed it, while happily playing other games with zero issues. They haven't fixed it. The game crashes every 10-15 minutes of gameplay for me, from day 1 until now. Nothing has changed. I would have refunded it long ago, but unfortunately it was a physical copy. My specs: i7 4790k, 16g ram, 780 Ti, Win 10. Performance, for me, is fine. FPS is a bit unstable, ranging from 40 to 90, but nothing too annoying. It's unplayable due to the crashing though. It might work fine for you, but you'd be taking a big risk, seeing how many people seem to be having all sorts of problems with it. Try it and refund it? Your call.			"

												Solid gameplay, great improvements coming from Just Cause 2. Open world now feels satisfying rather than a boring repetition as it was on previous games. Tons of side activities, good missions and weapons/skills.The only major problems are that the performance still isn't optimal, but the patches have made it better. Driving still is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for common vehicles (it's ok for some military vehicles though), the map variety isn't as impressive as Just Cause 2 (specially the lack of a proper desert and deeper jungles, but hey there's a volcano). Oh and stupid Ubisoft-tier optional collectibles scattered around the map.And the biggest problem, that shouldn't really be one for most players but the story is VERY disappointing, even for Just Cause standards. JC1 and 2 ended with great closures hinting towards next game or just seeing what the characters are up to now that the evil dictator is dead. In JC3, as soon as your mission is done and the dictator is out of scene, it goes straight to credits. No bonus scene, no party/celebration like in 2, it just ends.But overall, it is a very fun game and you should definitely pick it up on sale(along with 1 and 2 if you don't own them yet). I haven't got the chance to try out the DLC yet but I've been told it makes the game even more fun, so there's that.			"

												After over 225 hours playing Just Cause 3, I think I am finally worthy of writing a review for this latest installment in the open-world explodathon franchise. I saw the gameplay trailers back in June 2015, and I was excited for this game more than I have been for anything in a long time.I charged into this game on day one at MACH-6, and I love it. But, know only this: Much has changed since Just Cause 2, and JC3 is a very different beast. Despite this, it is heavily built upon its predecessor, so I reccomend you go and read my JC2 review if you don't know what it is.Before launching into the review proper, first let me say that I can run the game with minimal crashes or major performance issues. I have 16GB of RAM, and that seems to be key to running this with its yet-to-be-patched data leak, so if you don't have that, you can waste £40 and join the Negative Review Spam Salt Camp (NRSSC).In essence, the game is an improved and tweaked JC2. The ""story"" once again follows Rico Rodriguez going into a corrupt island nation to destroy things - however, the twist this time is he's parachuting into his homeland, the mediterranean paradise of Medici, which is being controlled by your typical sociopath dictator, Brigadier General Sebastiano Di Ravello. With Just Cause's running history of throwaway plots you'd be forgiven for not thinking much of this, but it changes the flow of the game quite a bit. Rather than just annihilating everything, you're fighting on the side of a genuine revolution, and every military base you cripple and town you free is occupied by rebel forces. This has far-reaching implications for gameplay. First off, while the ""chaos"" meter is still present, and while it still fills when you destroy things, it is NOT the main gauge for progression. That would be liberating provinces. Yes, gone are the days of meaningless villages and randomly sprinkled bases you complete if you feel like it; now you make progress by kicking military forces out of large areas of land. If there's one complaint I have about JC3, it's that it focuses heavily on liberating settlements rather than allowing freeform destruction to be the player's compass.That said, this time around you have an unimaginably amazing array of impossible and unrealistic tools to help you ""liberate"" things. First of all, there is the famous wingsuit, which allows you to glide around at any time and propel yourself with the grappling hook, a la 2's parachute slingshot (which is still here but the parachute is quite a bit slower). The wingsuit is quite possibly the greatest navigation feature in a videogame ever, and it lets you truly appreciate the utterly beautiful islands. There's also Rico's upgraded grapple, which lets him deploy up to six incredibly strong tethers, which he can manually retract with unbelievable force to bend physics objects to his will. Other additions and tweaks to combat and general gameplay include infinite C4, so you're never unable to blow something up, expanded heat so strong combat helicopters and tanks are sent in at higher levels, and hijacking vehicles without having to do quick-time events (THANK GOD).It's clear Avalanche took inspiration from 2's modding community, from jumping and boosting cars, to multiple tethers and rocket booster C4. But isn't it a bit overpowered to have all this at the start, you may be asking? Well, that's because they're progressively unlocked. Unlike the scavanger hunt for weapon and vehicle parts from JC2, gear mods in 3 are earned by completing challenges. These are... eh. They range from races, to wingsuit courses, to ramming explosive cars into enemies or obliterating chaos objects in bases as fast as possible, and while they can be fun, a lot of them are just irritating. And you HAVE to do them to get the good sh*t - the aforementioned six super-tethers are a timid two okay-tethers at the start of the game, and to upgrade them you have to do a challenge that involves tethering a magnet thing to a car and collecting minerals lying around for deposition in a big pit. Yay?A running theme with JC3 seems to be going off on a tangent from 2's philosophy of rewarding the player for doing whatever they want. Many things are annoyingly mandatory, and many have gone straight into the game fresh out of JC2, only to find, many hours into blowing things up of their own accord, that they missed crucial story missions and were denied incredibly powerful tools. Not the least of which is the Rebel Drop, which lets you drop any car or weapon in the game you have either driven to a garage or unlocked by, you guessed it, liberating bases. All this makes JC3 seem positively linear compared to 2, even though it offers the same amount of freedom, if not more; the structure just doesn't advocate you exploiting it. Another thing I find not really annoying, but disappointing, is the lack of variety between areas of Medici. JC2's Panau had jungles, deserts, a sprawling metropolis, snow-covered mountains and clear open meadows, but Medici remains firmly deciduous woodland throughout. The closest to a desert it gets is the dusty badlands around strip-mined hills. Unless I'm mistaken, there is a grand total of TWO bases with snow on the ground; one is an outpost and the other is Di Ravello Central Command, which is virtually impenetrable until late in the game. There just isn't the charming variety of locations there was in 2, like the airborne brothel Mile High Club, or the giant satellite dish PAN MILSAT you could drive cars around in. It's almost sad.But with all its flaws, I just can't stay mad at this game. The bases. The explosions. Oh my god, it's glorious. The destruction has gone from entertaining B-movie to all-out AAA magnificence, with fully destroyable bridges, dynamically disintegrating cars, physics-compatible everything and so much firey glory. There's even different flavours of explosions this time around, from the light smoky electrical fires to the blue-tinted ferocity of explosive supermineral bavarium. Speaking of bavarium, there are also tanks and helicopter with forcefields courtesy of this macguffin rock, and a host of other clever destruction methods, like every car being a bomb on wheels and shotgun grenade launchers. Last but not least is the expanded variety of explodables, from the classic fuel tank, the humble generator, the entertainingly fragile doppler radar, the house-of-cards radar tower, to massive SatCom dishes and colossal mineral excavators. Now, let's talk bugs. This game has them. It might have less than JC2, but when they show up, you bloody well know about it. Trains doing backflips trying to cross bridges. Cars disappearing into thin air as you drive them. Soundless explosions, aetheral chaos objects, Rico having a seizure after landing from parachuting, or soldiers spontaneously combusting, JC3 has a small cast of weird and wonderful bugs, that are either very entertaining or extremely annoying. On top of that are the reports of game-destroying crashes and framerate issues under certain circumstances, so beware if  you're trying to run this on potato-grade computers.In conclusion, Just Cause 3 is not a perfect game. If that is what you're here for, go away. But if you're here from the same bandwagon as Just Cause 2, or just an explosion lover from elsewhere, this game will delight and entertain you for many hours. If you want intense gunfights, hilariously unrealistic battles, a plethora of explosions, and an utterly breathtaking and gigantic open world to do it all in, and you can put up with a few bugs and imperfections here and there, then this game is for you. This game truly does justice to Rico and the spirit of Just Cause - at least the chaos part - and I cannot reccomend it enough for connoisseurs of destruction such as myself. When I was shown Just Cause 2 for the first time, I thought open-world gaming couldn't get any better. I was wrong.			"

In short: The game is lots of fun, a lot of destruction and insane Hollywood action. Some things like the side activities and maybe even the missions can be a little repetitive, (especially if you want to complete it all,) but the main focus is the freedom to do what you want, and that is what this game is very good at. It provides you with a huge sandbox and lots of awesome tools so you can have lots of fun in every way you imagine.And the long:Apart from the optimisation issues which the game currently has, the HUGE, beautiful open world is full of towns and army bases and outposts that need to be liberated and destroyed. You can do this in every way you want! With all sorts of weapons and vehicles and of course, the beautiful tethers! The game is again, huge and full of content to see and do. Just going from A to B is lots of fun with the new wingsuit. The wingsuit is extremely awesome and feels amazing to use.With the tethers you can be extremely creative by tethering things togheter and retract them. You'll get awesome chains of destruction with everytime another outcome because of the physics based destruction.However, some side activities you'll need to do in order to unlock new gear mods, are a bit boring. And because you want to have all those awesome gear mods to do even more insanely creative action and destruction, you have to complete them, a lot of them.The vehicles are improved compared to Just Cause 2, in some ways. The jets and helicopters are better, even though the jet controlls are a bit odd at default, and the ""Increase thrust"" and ""Nitrous""  is set to the same key on jets which can't be changed. The cars however are worse compared to Just Cause 2, they first take quite a time to get used to and secondly don't crash that awesome like they used to in Just Cause 2, and that is what this game is all about, awesome crashes and explosions everywhere! In Just Cause 2 when you shot a tire, the car made a few rolls and/or flips and made that action-movie wooshy sound and then exploded. In Just Cause 3 however, it just rolls on its side and explodes. Also throwing a car of a cliff isn't as cool anymore like it used to be.The weapons are awesome, it's fun to shoot them, or shoot while reeling into an enemy, and are satisfying to use. With quite an arsenal to choose from.Graphics are really good, even on the lowest settings the game looks good with an amazing view distance. The world is beautifully crafted and looks amazing with lots of beautiful places to see and go to.This time the story is a little bigger, the cutscenes look really good and the missions have a lot of freedom to do them your way. However, the missions are somewhat the same after a while.That's all :)			"

You'll get awesome chains of destruction with everytime another outcome because of the physics based destruction.However, some side activities you'll need to do in order to unlock new gear mods, are a bit boring. And because you want to have all those awesome gear mods to do even more insanely creative action and destruction, you have to complete them, a lot of them.The vehicles are improved compared to Just Cause 2, in some ways. The jets and helicopters are better, even though the jet controlls are a bit odd at default, and the ""Increase thrust"" and ""Nitrous""  is set to the same key on jets which can't be changed. The cars however are worse compared to Just Cause 2, they first take quite a time to get used to and secondly don't crash that awesome like they used to in Just Cause 2, and that is what this game is all about, awesome crashes and explosions everywhere! In Just Cause 2 when you shot a tire, the car made a few rolls and/or flips and made that action-movie wooshy sound and then exploded. In Just Cause 3 however, it just rolls on its side and explodes. Also throwing a car of a cliff isn't as cool anymore like it used to be.The weapons are awesome, it's fun to shoot them, or shoot while reeling into an enemy, and are satisfying to use. With quite an arsenal to choose from.Graphics are really good, even on the lowest settings the game looks good with an amazing view distance. The world is beautifully crafted and looks amazing with lots of beautiful places to see and go to.This time the story is a little bigger, the cutscenes look really good and the missions have a lot of freedom to do them your way. However, the missions are somewhat the same after a while.That's all :)			"

												Solid gameplay, great improvements coming from Just Cause 2. Open world now feels satisfying rather than a boring repetition as it was on previous games. Tons of side activities, good missions and weapons/skills.The only major problems are that the performance still isn't optimal, but the patches have made it better. Driving still is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for common vehicles (it's ok for some military vehicles though), the map variety isn't as impressive as Just Cause 2 (specially the lack of a proper desert and deeper jungles, but hey there's a volcano). Oh and stupid Ubisoft-tier optional collectibles scattered around the map.And the biggest problem, that shouldn't really be one for most players but the story is VERY disappointing, even for Just Cause standards. JC1 and 2 ended with great closures hinting towards next game or just seeing what the characters are up to now that the evil dictator is dead. In JC3, as soon as your mission is done and the dictator is out of scene, it goes straight to credits. No bonus scene, no party/celebration like in 2, it just ends.But overall, it is a very fun game and you should definitely pick it up on sale(along with 1 and 2 if you don't own them yet). I haven't got the chance to try out the DLC yet but I've been told it makes the game even more fun, so there's that.			"

												No SLI support of any Kind, and poor performance with most GPU's/CPU's Regardless of the brand. No Performace change on any quality settings.Do yourself a favour and don't buy this game, at least not in this state.Some people have gotten lucky and can run this game perfectly. It Honestly is a hit or miss. If the issues dont get fixed in less than 3 days I'll be returning it.Triple A titles shouldn't have so many issues at launch. Thats the point of triple A titles.			"

												JC3, like JC2 before it is one of the most indulgently fun games I've played in a long, long while.  Freedom, beauty, and curiosity run rampant through this game experience.  Everywhere you look there's some vista to appreciate, some distant target to explore, some military base to attack, or some wacky challenge event to participate in.  It's everywhere and the size of the world is so vast that it will take you a long, long time before you've fully exhausted what's on offer.  More on that in a moment...Since JC3 is a single-player experience it's nice that the cast of characters are expanded upon both in number and in depth.  Seeing Rico walk about and chatting it up is so much more entertaining than before and lightyears beyond a mute Gordon Freeman just receiving dialogue from other characters.  There's a tremendous amount of fun in listening to the banter between characters and the sly nod-and-a-wink to the more outlandish aspects of the gameplay.  If I had a gripe about the characters and storytelling it's that there's often a tonal clash between the gravitas implied in the mission and liberation scenarios and the utterly ridiculous ways in which you dispatch the opposition.  Nobody bats an eye if you load up a cargo plan with tether attached cars and explosive barrels and crash it into the enemy base, or hook-shot your friendly militia soldiers and throw them into other explosive chaos objects (the game scores you on distance even!) and when the dust settles an encouraging radio broadcast from your revolucion compadre announces that the People's Will is UNLEASHED and a GLORIOUS NEW DAY APPROACHES!One of the greatest clashes occured when I freed an entire province and then discovered one of the missions took place there.  SUDDENLY(!!!) there was a terrible conflict erupting and the might of Señor Bad Guy was out to harm the rebels.  The cinematic scenes dutifully showed military power in grand form waging battle with my people... and THEN BATTLE WAS JOINED and... I just floated along from a little skirmish here and there mopping up puddles and strolling past the patrol posts and fortresses I'd already vanquished.  Huh.  I guess he's not so tough after all.And there you go, that's the #1 thing I have to get across: there's no challenge for this game.  You are ludicrously powerful and nothing even closely comes to match your devastating potential.  It's rare that I ran out of ammunition for the basic weapons but even when I did it was dirt simple to re-arm from dropped weapons or storage racks.  All vehicles have unlimited ammunition and tanks are armored enough that you can kill a whole base easily.  Even if you DO face some challenge from sheer number and die you come back into the game with those previously accomplished objectives still credited, so you can just whittle away at your pleasure.  As you progress you gain access to some weapons that kill anything instantly, and you can nuke things from orbit just to be sure.  Take a helicopter with rockets overhead and at a distance and then enemy won't even see you as you lob high explosives on everything of value.  You will have to invent your own challenges for this game if you want it in combat.  The game makes up for the lack of combat difficulty with the sheer AMOUNT of opportunities for combat.  There are other side-challenges you can engage in to beef up your awesomeness and those are fun time-wasters, though the rewards are somewhat dubious:  who needs auto-tracking grenades when I can call on a portable nuclear rocket launcher with more ammunition?  Why do I need turbo boost on a car when it's so much more fun to fly with the wingsuit?OOH, the wingsuit.  That's a nifty thing.  The wingsuit addresses my chief complaint with Just Cause 2 which was that the infinity parachute and parachute thrusters were so useful and necessary that you'd never want any other combat vehicle, but it made for slow traveling if you really wanted to get around.  The wingsuit lets you ballistically travel all over with the force of gravity on your side and it's a beautiful thing to hurl yourself through the air and then gracelessly faceplant in front of your rebellion bro-hards.The DLC add-ons are fun, but kind of light-beer experiences.  There's very little explanation for what this Black Hand Army is and the fact they don't have a presence in the general storyline makes their DLC presence seem haphazard and random, like some sort of training opponent rather than some genuine foe you can understand.  The payoffs for the DLC missions are the toys you unlock: the super battle-boat, the jetpack wingsuit upgrade, and the floaty mech-tank.  Unfortunately while it's fun to use those toys they don't have much use in the long run.  The shooty-boat is left to be forgotten because so little of the game takes place on water, the mech is terrifically powerful but not really any more so than a tank or helicopter you can easily get access to normally.  The jetpack wingsuit is GOLD however and once you equip yourself with that you never really need another vehicle again.  I did like that the DLC shook up the gameplay with mech and sea combat, and the aerial fortress was probably the most interesting diversion.  I tell ya though, if you go after the DLC missions early enough in the main game then your massive overkill potential increases even further and you just slam-dunk the opposition effortlessly.So what do I say ultimately in review?  It's incredibly fun to be an unstoppable vengeful (flying) spanish god and I would have liked the game to stop talking to me like I'm an above-average mortal soldier.  I do think the gameplay wears out it's sense of majestic freedom long before it's run out of things for you to do.  Paying $60 for the game + expansion packs will let you feel like you're getting your money's worth and any price below $30 for everything will surely be a bargain.			"

												A competent execution of the sandbox-of-destruction concept.  It has some significant quality-of-life improvements over Just Cause 2, reducing or eliminating the frustrations and slowdowns that interrupted the game flow of it's predacessor.  If you take the easiest approach to every scenario you will be disappointed with this game.  If you are willing to experiment and get creative, it can be a lot of fun.  There's no real consequences for failure, so there's no need to play it safe.  Some of the structured side-misisons can be a bit of a drag.  The destruction missions involve blowing up an empty enemy base that you've already destroyed once with a single weapon, and range between repetitive and frustrating.   They are neccesary though for some of the weapon and ability upgrades that make the rest of the game more enjoyable.			"

												Re-purchased on the summer sale...  Game is still extremely resource intensive, but RAM makes the difference.Currently running on high with all settings on across the board on the following:- i3-4160 3.6Ghz- 16GM RAM - GTX 750ti 2GB OC Edition- No SSD- Getting 60-70 fps averageBuddy of mine has same CPU, Mobo & GPU, but only 8GB of RAM, he's getting 33fps average on absolute minimum settings. The point is, ""8GB recommended"" is a lie. The game idles on 10.9GB used. Faffing-about-creed 3 is one of the best games I've played in a very long while though. Would recommend.NOTE: Buy it, try playing it, if it doesn't work properly, get a refund immediately. The developers WILL NOT care about you being unable to play. Some high-end machines can barely run this, while some fairly low spec(like mine) machines run it perfectly smooth.			"

Yeah, I get it's an open world game, but there's just so much that keeps me from playing it.  It looks great, it runs great, just the controls interface is so damn confusing.  Every FPS has fairly standard PC controls, yet these developers decided to screw you into learning their bizarre choices.  I guess I'll come back in another 6 months and see if anything is better, but having owned this since Day 1, I highly doubt it.  The videos do look fun, unfortunately that's not really the game you get.			"

I played 20 hours, felt like I've seen and done everything worth the time, and freed up the space for incoming sale games.  The combat is unsatifying and the driving just plain awful. However, the wingsuit mechanic was a highlight. I loved flying around. For that, I'll say this is the best superhero game ever made.			"

												Unfortunately I have to give a thumbs down on this one.I don't have performance issues at all. Game runs smooth with all on Ultra High and 1080p graphics on my PC, however I have 16GB DDR4 ram, the new generation CPUs and an Nvidia GT970 JETSTREAM. It's not the best of the best but it runs the game really good maxed out so performance is not an issue for my thumbs down as seen in most reviews.The reason is the game itself. ITS SO BORING. Have you played Mad Max? Well - it's the same game but instead of driving the car and fight in Batman Style with 2 buttons on your controller - you shoot guns and fly. It's all the same - you have the map, you have the bad guys taken over the map and you ""liberate"" the cities by destroying the white/red thingies that are all the same everywhere with some story missions in between that make you drive a car or a plane - something you will never do otherwise since the parachute and the wings are way faster and you know - free ... the gam is so repetative ... The good thing about this game is that it's a Just Cause game - so you have the Grapling Hook and the phisics with it - and it's even more awesome. But thats it. I guess the enemies absorb so many bullets - and you absorb so many bullets in this game is so that you can have time to think about how to use the grapling hook.It's a shame that the first Single Player game that is Uncrackable by any hacker group is this one. It don't deserve it's price. Don't buy it unless it's in a bundle with something that is worht your 1 euro. If you like the Just Cause games before it was because there were no other games with great graphics, phisics and open world, but now we have the Batman games, GT ♥♥♥♥ing A, Skyrim and so many others waaay way better open world games than this.I am sorry Square Enix. I still repect you as developers and publishers - you make awesome games and JC3 is also pretty good game - however you really need to work on your ideas because the first city you liberate is basically the whole game. You just do this for few more hours and you are done.I'll keep trying to suck out some more enjoyment from this game and have some fun bringing chaos and playing with the grapling hook, but damn it's repetative ... at least give moding tools to the people wo did the JC2 multiplayer mod - they can bring some fresh ideas and things to do in this game ... For now - people reading this. Don't buy this game unless it's for 1 euro in a bundle with something that is worth it ...			"

												While I didn't have to contend with technical problems, the game itself is a little bland and repetitive. I played 20 hours, felt like I've seen and done everything worth the time, and freed up the space for incoming sale games.  The combat is unsatifying and the driving just plain awful. However, the wingsuit mechanic was a highlight. I loved flying around. For that, I'll say this is the best superhero game ever made.			"

												Unfortunately I have to give a thumbs down on this one.I don't have performance issues at all. Game runs smooth with all on Ultra High and 1080p graphics on my PC, however I have 16GB DDR4 ram, the new generation CPUs and an Nvidia GT970 JETSTREAM. It's not the best of the best but it runs the game really good maxed out so performance is not an issue for my thumbs down as seen in most reviews.The reason is the game itself. ITS SO BORING. Have you played Mad Max? Well - it's the same game but instead of driving the car and fight in Batman Style with 2 buttons on your controller - you shoot guns and fly. It's all the same - you have the map, you have the bad guys taken over the map and you ""liberate"" the cities by destroying the white/red thingies that are all the same everywhere with some story missions in between that make you drive a car or a plane - something you will never do otherwise since the parachute and the wings are way faster and you know - free ... the gam is so repetative ... The good thing about this game is that it's a Just Cause game - so you have the Grapling Hook and the phisics with it - and it's even more awesome. But thats it. I guess the enemies absorb so many bullets - and you absorb so many bullets in this game is so that you can have time to think about how to use the grapling hook.It's a shame that the first Single Player game that is Uncrackable by any hacker group is this one. It don't deserve it's price. Don't buy it unless it's in a bundle with something that is worht your 1 euro. If you like the Just Cause games before it was because there were no other games with great graphics, phisics and open world, but now we have the Batman games, GT ♥♥♥♥ing A, Skyrim and so many others waaay way better open world games than this.I am sorry Square Enix. I still repect you as developers and publishers - you make awesome games and JC3 is also pretty good game - however you really need to work on your ideas because the first city you liberate is basically the whole game. You just do this for few more hours and you are done.I'll keep trying to suck out some more enjoyment from this game and have some fun bringing chaos and playing with the grapling hook, but damn it's repetative ... at least give moding tools to the people wo did the JC2 multiplayer mod - they can bring some fresh ideas and things to do in this game ... For now - people reading this. Don't buy this game unless it's for 1 euro in a bundle with something that is worth it ...			"

												Just Cause 2 I loved, and I thought JC3 would be better. But in order for them to release across multiple platforms I guess they forgot to work on the actual game. The game has been buggy since release, the game runs like rubbish, the skill tree is tedious and annoying to unlock abilities that you should already have.I really wanted to like this game but ended up hating every single moment I played, especially the overly explosive cars. I mean are all the people driving around with c4 strapped to their cars with the trigger on their bumpers or what?!?My son of 7 years, loves this game... so I guess that's something for the devs, you've killed this player set off but at least you might have the next gen hooked...

												Performance issues aside, the game still is not that good.Driving is a nightmare. When your car decides to stick to the ground, a terrible camera system with low FOV and terrible physics.Combat is decent at best, with 1995 style force fields popping up way to frequently and the enjoyable chaos of just cause 2 vanishing. Car chases are way less entertaining as well.The progression system is trash, the black market system got replaced by something that also barely works. And in the end, it still runs like trash. Under all that somewhere was an awesome game based on the silliness of Just Cause 2, but I can't bring myself to dig deep enough to find it.			"

												The negative reviews for this game are pretty much all due to performance issues with some systems.I can't speak for those people, because I've not had a single crash or a single instance of unbearable fps even during the time in which my PC was rather mediocre in comparison with most others.I actually felt the game was optimized fantastically.If you don't have problems running it there is a very high chance that you will have heaps of fun with this game, but there is one core problem with the gameplay.It's rather repetitive.Now if you're able to make your own fun and push the sandbox to its limits in trying to find out what kinds of stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥you can do with the impossible armory at your disposal then that shouldn't be a problem.If your goal is simply to do everything in the most efficient way possible then you'll become extremely bored extremely quick.tl;dr: Be prepared to make your own fun using the fantastic sandbox JC3 gives you.

												I've had no technical issues beyond one graphical glitch that was resolved on restarting, but even though I can get the game to run, there are a number of problems that unfortunately do not end at technical issues. Number one on the list are upgrades being locked behind extremely tediuous and strict challenges that are a far cry from the rest of the games free-form chaos. The main gameplay is centered traveling from base to base with your grappling hook, parachute, and new to the series; a wingsuit. The traveling is superb, and nuanced. It's not just fun, it's something you learn to get better at as you play. After you liberate a base you unlock challenges that unlock new toys to play with, which creates a cycle of gameplay. Fly to a base, liberate it using your arsenal of weapons and gadgets, unlock challenges, complete challenges to unlock new weapons, gadgets, and upgrades. It would be a perfect cycle if it weren't for the challenges. The infernally designed, boring, at times controller-breakingly-frustrating challenges. Some of them are just fine. Not fun, but not frustrating. Others, such as wingsuit challenges, can be so incredibly strict that IF you happen to get all 5 gears (the equivalent to a score rating, and more importantly the way you unlock upgrades), it winds up feeling more like luck than skill. Some of the challenges took me upwards of 20 times to get 5 gears, while a couple took me 2 trys. Neither instance was fufilling, neither instance felt like I got the score I did due to my personal skill. There is so little room for error, and certain challenges feel outright broken. One wingsuit challenge has you choosing what paths to fly through, each going a seperate way, which I thought was a brilliant way to solve the issue of how strict these challenges felt, until I went through one pathway perfectly, and still didn't get a high enough score to unlock all 5 gears. Was I supposed to choose a different path? Is there a specific combination of paths that is correct? Even if that is the case, that sort of trial and error gameplay is hardly compelling. This all may seem nitpicking, I mean these little distractions are hardly why anyone plays sandbox games, but this is HOW you unlock upgrades for rico's gear and vehicles. It's LITERALLY the only way. That changes these otherwise ignorable mini-games from being distractions to being neccesary to complete if you want to get all the upgrades and unlock all the potential the games main destruction-based gameplay has to offer. Even if the challenges had been tons of fun, this game does not add on enough or change enough to warrant buying it over Just Cause 2, not for the difference in price. Yes, the wingsuit is fun, yes the tethering system is fun. Are the new features worth $45? Absolutely not. Especially considering how Just Cause 2 has a much better system for unlocking content, I would just stick with the second one for now.			"

This is one of the most unoptimized PC ports I have ever played. The lack of SLI/Crossfire is unexcusable. I am playing at minimum graphics at near 720p and it still runs bad. I have a good SLI laptop (SLI GTX 765m) but since there is no SLI support, this runs awfully. Please, add SLI support, and optmize the game.Overall8/10Once they fix performance, I will change my review. If you are looking for another game to play until the performance improves, pick up Rainbow Six Siege. Its really fun.			"

												**Warning: This game contains MICROTRANSACTIONS in the form of 2 euro DLC per item**The driving in this game sucks. The action is fun,  but liberating towns gets repetitive. If you are looking for a game like this, get GTA V. Same or better price now, free DLC (cars, boats, cosmetics etc.), much better graphics, a great story in single player, has multiplayer and no MICROTRANSACTIONS. You are charged a full tripple A price for Just Cause 3. In my region that is 55 CHF(+- 55 euro).That I then have to pay 2 euro extra per car or boat that they released as DLC, I find not acceptable.

												Game runs fine and looks good, the gameplay is just dull.    Another ""open world"" this time mostly lifeless with bases here and there filled with mindless idiots who run to get killed.   Yet another ""tech demo"" that looks great in a gameplay video and gets repetetive after a few minutes in actual gameplay.Mind you this is just my take on ""open world"" or ""sandbox"" games.  I like structured gameplay not meager infantile attempts to create a ""lifelike"" world with idiot tourists walking around.   Although the writing/banter with the main characters can be amusing, I was not drawn in by the overall 'vibe' of the gameworld, i.e. a place filled with idiots, whether it be vacationing tourists or mindless ""soldiers"".   I guess I just wanted something on a more serious note.On a positive note, the vehicles are well done with good driving physics as well as the locomotion, i.e. grappleing and parachuting around.Everything I love about Mad Max, the other Avalanche produced title seems to be missing from this one.   Whereas Mad Max is oozing with style and atmosphere, this is just a farce.			"

												I'm 20 hrs into Just Cause 3 and I'm having a blast! (Pun not intended)I was wary of getting this game because of so many reported fps issues, but since Steam stands behind our purchases I was confident that had anything gone wrong, I'd get a refund. Luckily and gladly it runs like butter.I'm on a single MSI Nvidia 970, Core i7 980X 333hz, 12GB ram and it runs GREAT.I don't even need to OC my GPU at all, I hit consistently 70 to 80 fps in nearly all situations even the most demanding full of geometry and post FX with no drop no stutter at all. There is the occasional freeze, but in 20 hrs it's only happened twice. So I can live with that.As for the game, it's fun and challenging especially playing KB/Mouse. I got the Season Pass too, I figure if I'm going to wait two months for No Man's Sky, I'll need to be equipped and ready to rumble in the meantime.Driving isn't as bad as Watch Dogs, Flying is OK, wingsuit control could have been a tad better, but I'll chalk it up to me needing more practice. :)If you enjoyed Just Cause and Just Cause 2, you'll like Just Cause 3 even more.Hope this helps you decide whether to buy or not.

												Am I too old for this sort of game? You whip around with a wingsuit, grappling hook, and parachute, shooting soldiers and blowing up lots of red explodey things. It should be great.But... it's just not. For this to work, everything has to be polished to the nth degree. That grappling hook has to feel amazing, and... it just doesn't. The wingsuit controls like a drunken pig. The cars are horrible. The shooting feels like it is completely written off. Rico can't really take cover or dodge in any meaningful sense but he takes such a ridiculous amount of damage and regenerates so fast that it feels like a joke that the developers and players are both in on at the expense of the guards.Most fun upgrades are locked behind checkpoint races so all that time you spent in JC2 to get incremental damage upgrades to your guns is now going to be spent unlocking highly useful gameplay features.The only people who went above and beyond here are the folks who did the environmental work. It's just as beautiful here as it was in JC2.So if you want to know about how a game that's all about zipping around, flying, and blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up can be boring, the answer is just: Make all those things look cool but don't make them feel cool in any real way. The entire game just feels mindless and junky as a result.Also, I know I'm not supposed to care but the plot is a huge whiff. Rico is dull and uninteresting, joking in every situation where it isn't really effective to joke and when it is effective to crack a one liner he reads it off like he hasn't had any coffee yet. Tom Sheldon went from Rico's best buddy cowboy CIA operative to a slimy weasel who Rico can barely tolerate. JC2's hokey crime lord intrigue and insistence we were supposed to care who people like Jade Tan were feels like high drama compared to this clownish mess.Oh and apparently hitting a pedestrian with full nitro active is like hitting a brick wall and bounces your car back.

												This game was a bit like the Star Wars prequels for me. I went to the midnight screenings of all 3 movies, hyped to the hilt with Star Wars fever, ready to love it as much as I loved the original trilogy when I first discovered that as a child back in the early 90s.Coming out of the theatre my initial impression was always a positive one. But on the drive home, away from the jedi cosplayers, away from the thunderous cheering when ""A long time ago etc"" first came onto the screen and the opening score kicked in, when I finally had time to myself to gather my thoughts, I started seeing flaws. At first a few minor things that annoyed me. Then a few more. Within about half an hour I was already starting to realise that it wasn't a good movie at all, that I'd just been caught up in nostalgia, no matter how much fun I had at the time. It made me a little sad the first time I realised just how badly those movies actually sucked (yes, even the third but if you like it that's cool :D ) though by the time the third one came around I had a healthy dose of skepticism to go with my hype so it wasn't as surprising. It even happened a bit with the new one. Hindsight can sometimes ruin what was a great initial experience.Anyway so Just Cause 3 is sort of like that.I LOVED JC2 when I got it. Loved loved loved it. It's one of my top 10 favourite games of all time. So you can imagine my hype coming into this one. I even got a new video card just to play this (and it's run smoothly the whole time thankfully so I can't comment on the performance issue stuff).It had fantastic gameplay combined with that B-movie/not taking itself seriously at all storyline that just made it entertaining as hell. I couldn't put it down and I still hop on from time to time to liberate a few more bases or towns.Really all JC3 needed to do to succeed in my eye was more of the same basically. And in some ways that's exactly what I got but in others it dropped the ball pretty badly. I guess I should just list the pros and cons for ease.PROS It's more Just Cause. All the liberation and explosions you've come to expect. Speaking of explosions, they look sensational. Michael Bay eat your heart out. The wingsuit is a fantastic addition The new grappling system is great. Being able to tether multiple stuff is really neat. The storyline has some of that B-grade humourous feel of JC2. Some at least. Bringing up the map to find those last few things to blow up in a base/town! That could be so annoying in JC2. Liked that this feature existed although most objects were fairly easy to find so I didn't need it too often but it was handy on those massive bases when I only needed 1 or 2 more things.CONS This one might be a bit spoilery so I'll hide it.  Medici itself. It just lacks the density of Panau. This is maybe a good and bad thing. Panau can sometimes be a bit ridiculous with just how many places there are to liberate etc. but it's really noticeable how sparse Medici can feel at times. Especially the final (and biggest) island. I know the storyline explains why it is this way (if you collect the Di Ravello tapes anyway) but it still sucks. I couldn't believe how little there was to do when I finally reached that island. Was a big let down.	 The story. It's sort of tried to recapture what JC2 had but it just sort of fails this time. None of the characters are particularly likeable, not even in a so-bad-it's-good way like Bolo Santosi and Baby Panay were. The cutscenes were all kind of bad really. I didn't mind Mario I guess. Maybe spoilery again.  Trying to out-do the last game. It just didn't work. ""Oh you rode a missile toward the end of the last game? Well you get to ride one right near the START of this one!!!"" Ugh. I know partially the problem is the first one was sometimes mind blowing with some of the crazy stuff you ended up doing so it's hard to top that now but it felt like they barely tried. Oh and the very last final showdown is just pathetic. Disappointing.  Last lot of spoilers I swear!  The final two missions for each act are basically exactly the same. Seriously? Laaaame.  The parachute didn't control as nicely this time but this is super minor as the wingsuit sort of makes that gripe a non-issue. The vehicles. They just didn't feel like they controlled as well this time around. Motorbikes were especially bad. I tried using them with mouse + keyboard and controller and neither really felt that great. The challenges. I didn't mind the challenges themselves. It's nice having more things to do and I would sometimes do the ones in JC2 if I happened to be near one. The fact that all of your upgrades are locked behind them is the real problem. I know the collectible system in JC2 was a little clunky as well but yeah, forcing you to do challenges to upgrade everything is stupid. The Di Ravello tapes. I like collecting stuff and did all of that in this game but it sucks that a lot of the back story behind him and why Rico hates him so much etc. you can only find out if you collect these. I guess this sort of tacks on to my storyline gripe. I wasn't after some amazing story but I still feel like they could have done way more with what they had. The online stuff can be a bit annoying sometimes. Always online DRM is never a great solution. The leaderboard stuff is a bit annoying too. I switched it to friends only which is far better but you still get bombarded with a bunch of strangers who beat your whatever score every time you log on.That's all I can think of off the top of my head. Don't get me wrong, I had a blast and I still recommend it and am looking forward to the upcoming DLC but every time I take a step back and think about my time playing it, I seem to only see mostly negatives.So yeah if you loved JC2 then you should still like this, just don't expect to have your mind blown this time around. If you never played JC2 and you like the sound of basically being a superhero blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up then you should like this as well. Just try not to think about it too much :)			"

												At first I will start at the 2 negatives I found while playing the game:1. When launching the game my aspect ratio was set to 16:10 and I ran a insane high resolution an after setting it back to 1080p almost all my desktop icons were placed difrent.2. When I started the game it seemed fine and then I went into a cave and only half of the textures loaded, but this was easily resolved by downloading the latest AMD beta drivers.But after that the game was a blessing. I have a I7 4770K, 16GB RAM and a R9 290 VAPOR-X and the game runs butter smooth. I get no hickups and I also didn't really notice any framedrops while I'm running the game on max settings. I didn't even have any long loadingtimes while I'm just jusing a 7200 rpm HDD.The movement controls are great and shooting is pretty good to, but driving and boathing felt a little out of control when stearing. But after all ""Who is actually driving and boating a lot?"", you have an awesome wingsuite and parachute. And combined with the grapling hook you can cross some great distance in a short amount if time and it looks just F*cking amazing. I mean have you seen this game? It looks great while I am still playing at around 50 FPS on 1080p.The grapling hook seems to have some kind of last aimed spot selecter, so that if you aim over a ridge very fast and you aim in the sky and you start to grappel it will automatically grappel to the last possible grappel location. This is pretty cool, because you don't have to aim for exactly the right spot, which makes the game way more fluently.Conlusion:I had a few problems at the beginning, but they were quikly resolved and after that I just had some much fun. Why you may ask? Well, ""JUST CAUSE baby!"".I would really recomend this game, mayby wait for a patch but I think that the problems that you will have are easily solved and that it is not worth waiting for a patch.9/10 Would really recommend!

												Huge stuttering issues every time there is an explosion, or anything more than looking at the floor, really. These issues are well documented, but nothing has happened to fix this. I may not have a monster rig, but I can get 50 fps average on high 1080p, why am I struggling to maintain a stable 7 fps on the lowest settings at 720p?Furthermore, even if your computer is flawless, your internet connection damn well better be. It's not online only, but it might as well be. If your internet connection drops, or ♥♥♥♥, if Square Enix's does, which they do frequently, it interrupts gameplay because it doesn't realize you can play a game without ♥♥♥♥ing leaderboards, and wastes 10 seconds before asking if you'd like to go offline. You can say yes, you'd like to go offline, but if you pause the game in any way (looking at maps, upgrading equipment, etc) it will stop you to check for 10 seconds again.This game could be damn good, but right now it's a mess.Edit: When I wrote this review, I had only 4 gigabytes of RAM, below recommended specs. Yesterday, I upgraded to 8 gigabytes, but unfortunately, the game still ran a 10 gigabyte pagefile. This game actually requires 18 gigabytes of RAM, first off, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Secondly, unless you have 32 gigabytes, I would suggest not buying this game.			"

												**Warning: This game contains MICROTRANSACTIONS in the form of 2 euro DLC per item**The driving in this game sucks. The action is fun,  but liberating towns gets repetitive. If you are looking for a game like this, get GTA V. Same or better price now, free DLC (cars, boats, cosmetics etc.), much better graphics, a great story in single player, has multiplayer and no MICROTRANSACTIONS. You are charged a full tripple A price for Just Cause 3. In my region that is 55 CHF(+- 55 euro).That I then have to pay 2 euro extra per car or boat that they released as DLC, I find not acceptable. This is another developer that treats gamers like cashcows. I do not advice to buy this game,**Warning: This game contains MICROTRANSACTIONS in the form of 2 euro DLC per item**			"

												Game runs fine and looks good, the gameplay is just dull.    Another ""open world"" this time mostly lifeless with bases here and there filled with mindless idiots who run to get killed.   Yet another ""tech demo"" that looks great in a gameplay video and gets repetetive after a few minutes in actual gameplay.Mind you this is just my take on ""open world"" or ""sandbox"" games.  I like structured gameplay not meager infantile attempts to create a ""lifelike"" world with idiot tourists walking around.   Although the writing/banter with the main characters can be amusing, I was not drawn in by the overall 'vibe' of the gameworld, i.e. a place filled with idiots, whether it be vacationing tourists or mindless ""soldiers"".   I guess I just wanted something on a more serious note.On a positive note, the vehicles are well done with good driving physics as well as the locomotion, i.e. grappleing and parachuting around.Everything I love about Mad Max, the other Avalanche produced title seems to be missing from this one.   Whereas Mad Max is oozing with style and atmosphere, this is just a farce.			"

												I've had no technical issues beyond one graphical glitch that was resolved on restarting, but even though I can get the game to run, there are a number of problems that unfortunately do not end at technical issues. Number one on the list are upgrades being locked behind extremely tediuous and strict challenges that are a far cry from the rest of the games free-form chaos. The main gameplay is centered traveling from base to base with your grappling hook, parachute, and new to the series; a wingsuit. The traveling is superb, and nuanced. It's not just fun, it's something you learn to get better at as you play. After you liberate a base you unlock challenges that unlock new toys to play with, which creates a cycle of gameplay. Fly to a base, liberate it using your arsenal of weapons and gadgets, unlock challenges, complete challenges to unlock new weapons, gadgets, and upgrades. It would be a perfect cycle if it weren't for the challenges. The infernally designed, boring, at times controller-breakingly-frustrating challenges. Some of them are just fine. Not fun, but not frustrating. Others, such as wingsuit challenges, can be so incredibly strict that IF you happen to get all 5 gears (the equivalent to a score rating, and more importantly the way you unlock upgrades), it winds up feeling more like luck than skill. Some of the challenges took me upwards of 20 times to get 5 gears, while a couple took me 2 trys. Neither instance was fufilling, neither instance felt like I got the score I did due to my personal skill. There is so little room for error, and certain challenges feel outright broken. One wingsuit challenge has you choosing what paths to fly through, each going a seperate way, which I thought was a brilliant way to solve the issue of how strict these challenges felt, until I went through one pathway perfectly, and still didn't get a high enough score to unlock all 5 gears. Was I supposed to choose a different path? Is there a specific combination of paths that is correct? Even if that is the case, that sort of trial and error gameplay is hardly compelling. This all may seem nitpicking, I mean these little distractions are hardly why anyone plays sandbox games, but this is HOW you unlock upgrades for rico's gear and vehicles. It's LITERALLY the only way. That changes these otherwise ignorable mini-games from being distractions to being neccesary to complete if you want to get all the upgrades and unlock all the potential the games main destruction-based gameplay has to offer. Even if the challenges had been tons of fun, this game does not add on enough or change enough to warrant buying it over Just Cause 2, not for the difference in price. Yes, the wingsuit is fun, yes the tethering system is fun. Are the new features worth $45? Absolutely not. Especially considering how Just Cause 2 has a much better system for unlocking content, I would just stick with the second one for now.			"

I have a good SLI laptop (SLI GTX 765m) but since there is no SLI support, this runs awfully. Please, add SLI support, and optmize the game.Overall8/10Once they fix performance, I will change my review.

												Alot of peole bash this game for running poorly. Lucky for me, I have had no problems. I'm running a GTX 970 with an i5-4690K. Ever since the driver updates, I have been able to maintain 70-80 fps on ultra with very few noticeable drops.The good: If you enjoyed Just Cause 2, then this is your game. Jc3 improves on almost every aspect from JC2. The characters are well done, the graphics are well done (except for lod), the story is better, the driving is better, the flying is better, the explosions are WAY bigger, the rebel drop system is great (except for those ♥♥♥♥ing timers), and Rico is more badass than ever now that he is rocking a God damn wing suit!The neutral:It is so much easier to capture bases now which is good in the sense that you aren't looking around corners for an hour and a half looking for that last fuel tank but it removes the satisfaction from finally finding that last chaos object. Now it just tells you on the map.The bad:The map. Sure the map is as big as the previous one and terrain itself is with caves and epic canyons to launch yourself through with Rico's new wingsuit. The problem is that in just cause 2, the map was incredibly diverse with rainforests, cities, deserts, and mountains which were all split up into different biomes. Here, you have Mediterranean, Mediterranean, Mediterranean, and then a pissy little Mountain biomes and a tiny mining operation to explore. The map feels too much like the same no matter where you go. I would actually love to see a $15 dlc that gives me the option to go back to Panau with the new upgraded Rico.The other annoying thing is the tedious unlock system. I don't mind some of the challenges but I don't want to have to fly through hoops countless times just to unlock the next upgrade to rebel drop aeroplanes. It would also be nice to have the option to have the mods apply to all vehicles not just the ones you drop in. Also the motorcycles blow♥♥♥♥♥in the handling department.Final verdict:If you have never played Just Cause 2, either buy that or watch gameplay before deciding on if you will buy just cause 3. If you are like me and really enjoyed Just Cause 2, then this game is definitely worth the money.			"

												This game was fun, there is absolutely no doubt about that. It gives you the ability to cause pure chaos at your whim, using machine guns, sweet revolvers, a portable nuke launcher, a multiple rocket launcher, tanks, helicopters, jets, bombers, it's all there.Take out military bases, liberate oppressed cities - all the real meat of the game. Watch dodgy voiced cutscenes as you play somewhat simple and not as fun story missions.I just completed it at 40 hours with full 100% liberation. Fairly surprised, I'm sure Just Cause 2 was longer. Just Cause 2 also had mildly better story missions, working with three different factions which really gave it a little more worth. In JC3 it is one line of story missions, very simple (one is glitchy forcing you to restart the game), and very short mostly.  The end boss is a let down, and it feels like they jumped the shark with the missile riding ending to Just Cause 2, even including what felt like a sub par homage to it early in Just Cause 2.Would I reccomend this game? Hard to say. I loved the mayhem, the laid back of it, it's a great game to chill with, blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, watch movies tv or youtube. Not one you need to give your total attention. I would reccomend it, it is good, but maybe not full price.There is a season pass so I can only hope it adds some extended life to it.			"

												Am I too old for this sort of game? You whip around with a wingsuit, grappling hook, and parachute, shooting soldiers and blowing up lots of red explodey things. It should be great.But... it's just not. For this to work, everything has to be polished to the nth degree. That grappling hook has to feel amazing, and... it just doesn't. The wingsuit controls like a drunken pig. The cars are horrible. The shooting feels like it is completely written off. Rico can't really take cover or dodge in any meaningful sense but he takes such a ridiculous amount of damage and regenerates so fast that it feels like a joke that the developers and players are both in on at the expense of the guards.Most fun upgrades are locked behind checkpoint races so all that time you spent in JC2 to get incremental damage upgrades to your guns is now going to be spent unlocking highly useful gameplay features.The only people who went above and beyond here are the folks who did the environmental work.

JC2's hokey crime lord intrigue and insistence we were supposed to care who people like Jade Tan were feels like high drama compared to this clownish mess.Oh and apparently hitting a pedestrian with full nitro active is like hitting a brick wall and bounces your car back.

												If it's not broke dont fix it!!!! Just cause 2 was great and was not broken, Just cause 3 is a disapointment. The game story is hard to follow, in fact i very quickly lost the thread and gave up. The map is confusing to use and has become over complicated. If it had been a new story based on Just cause 2 with some minor improvement tweeks then this I am sure would have been the another great game. As it is i have spent about 5 hours on it and most of that has been randomly jumping off cliffs in order to use the wing suit (which is a great addition).Please remember in future just because something is new it doesn't mean its better and story and game play are more important than amazing graphics and detailed cut scenes, (which it seems many cant even view anyway).I am saying i would not reccoment this game but if you are only interested in runing around and blowing things up for the hell of it and dont care about anything else then you may well enjoy it.

												I love this game so far! Had extremely fun at the destroying and racing missions, the map looks sick as♥♥♥♥♥♥and the vehicles have really sick soundeffects, i love them. Can't tell a lot about the story, but its really good so far.Game is constantly way over 60FPS, the only issue i had was the AMD texture bug - searched at the web, downloaded the beta driver and youre good to go, easy as that if you use your mind and have the intention to fix your problems before you start to whine.Hope in future people get their stuff together, otherwise they should mind a console where you only plug and play.All in all i dont regret anything and start the way to 100% now ;)			"

												Am I too old for this sort of game? You whip around with a wingsuit, grappling hook, and parachute, shooting soldiers and blowing up lots of red explodey things. It should be great.But... it's just not. For this to work, everything has to be polished to the nth degree. That grappling hook has to feel amazing, and... it just doesn't. The wingsuit controls like a drunken pig. The cars are horrible. The shooting feels like it is completely written off. Rico can't really take cover or dodge in any meaningful sense but he takes such a ridiculous amount of damage and regenerates so fast that it feels like a joke that the developers and players are both in on at the expense of the guards.Most fun upgrades are locked behind checkpoint races so all that time you spent in JC2 to get incremental damage upgrades to your guns is now going to be spent unlocking highly useful gameplay features.The only people who went above and beyond here are the folks who did the environmental work. It's just as beautiful here as it was in JC2.So if you want to know about how a game that's all about zipping around, flying, and blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up can be boring, the answer is just: Make all those things look cool but don't make them feel cool in any real way. The entire game just feels mindless and junky as a result.Also, I know I'm not supposed to care but the plot is a huge whiff. Rico is dull and uninteresting, joking in every situation where it isn't really effective to joke and when it is effective to crack a one liner he reads it off like he hasn't had any coffee yet. Tom Sheldon went from Rico's best buddy cowboy CIA operative to a slimy weasel who Rico can barely tolerate. JC2's hokey crime lord intrigue and insistence we were supposed to care who people like Jade Tan were feels like high drama compared to this clownish mess.Oh and apparently hitting a pedestrian with full nitro active is like hitting a brick wall and bounces your car back.

												This review is based on the game itself and not the technical issues such as the very high GPU and RAM usage which can cause stutters on even high-end machines, with AMD users in particular suffering from this. Hopefully this problem will be patched soon.Just Cause 3 is basically just Just Cause 2 but with added improvements including a grapple that can tether more than once and can retract, allowing the player to tear down structures or attach two enemies together. There are a good variety of weapons and vehicles ranging from mortars to nuke launchers and tanks with energy shields, there are plenty to fuel your destruction.Compared to Just Cause 2, the weapons and vehicles are better (although lack of a Tuk-Tuk Boom is disappointing) and the grapple and wingsuit add new dimensions. As a base game, Just Cause 3 is just Just Cause 2 with a new map and more to play with, unlike how Just Cause 2 was a complete makeover compared to the first Just Cause.Is it worth full price? I don't think so, although I bought this game off ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for £17 and got a free game as a bonus. For £17 this game is definitely worth it.The upcoming DLC including Sky Fortress certainly looks fun, I'll make a review for the DLC when each is released.Overall, if you are expecting a game completely better than Just Cause 2, then this is not it. If you are a person who hasn't played a Just Cause game before, then this is a brilliant game to play. For a price like £39.99 it is not worth it for any interested party, although considering I got it for £17 off from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it is best to get it from there and the price is getting cheaper all the time.

Destruction mechanics is great.Flying all over the place with the tethering tool makes you feel like a cuban pyromaniac spiderman.Story sucks but who cares about the story just make everything go splodie.

												Pros: - Visually and asthetically superior to JC2, the world was vibrant and beautiful - Same old fun gameplay- Wingsuit really opens up movement around the world, even more so than previous games- Less general bugs than JC2 hadCons:- Had to put the game on my SSD to counter loading bugs, where the game would freeze. Did this less on later in my playthrough so perhaps that was fixed- Bugs that the game did have were severe, relating to the load times, sound playable, alt tabbing. Keeping the menu open too long caused audio to start to glitch out and freeze, which could only be fixed by disabling fullscreen mode, alt tabbing out, alt tabbing back in and reactivating fullscreen- Shorter than JC2- Lacklustre finale compared to JC2- Finding/freeing all settlements appears to have no reward, making the action of doing so beyond the story unsatisfying.Recommendation: Still good, worth playing. If you've played JC2 it won't be a great divergance from the formulae. Wait for it to be on sale.			"

												As a new player who has just purchased the game for $10, i would have NO IDEA this game recieved poor feedback if i had not read it beforehand. First i went to graphic options and set everything to ultra and savedRight from the start you are flying on top of a plane with a rocket launcher and the first thing i noticed (using xb1 controller) was how buttery smooth the performance was. WTF? Maybe the lag starts when i get into villages and stuff?? But it really never lagged. I found this to be ironic because i was expecting to spend hours tweaking this game to get it to run how i wanted.There are games that run good, games that run great, then games that run buttery smooth. If you could experience what i am experiencing right now as i play this.. you would also say it was running buttery smoothWhat you need to understand is that i am extremely OCD when it comes to game performance, i will spend the first few minutes of any new game just running forward slow/fast just to see if i can pick up on any stutters even micro stutters in performanceWhile i do have a high end pc, games that are unoptimized still jerk/stutter on it so optimization still matters. I think that just cause 3 just genuinely needs 16gb of ram to run welli7 6700kevga gtx108016gb ddr4-3000mhz500gb evo 850 SSDBesides that, the game is very next-gen feeling. The scale is epic, the textures are extremely high resolution, the draw distance is just how your eyes would see distance in real life (not low res models past a certain distance)Its nice to see a NEW game using a new game engine and fitting for the time it was made in. This is just a high quality pc game. A game i am glad to have on my steam games list.I am sorry developers brave enough to push gaming forward get hit with such negative reception (not many developers even try to make new game engines these days they just reuse what they have and are comfortable with) All in all, if you have 16gb of ram.. Get this awesome game			"

												Don't pay full price for this game!  Get it when it's under 20 bucks in a year on sale.  It's not worth it and I feel riped off because it doesn't seem finished.  Here's some examples...1. There's been a error since it came out (#38) that's only fix comes from a 3rd party app that you need to use to lower your GPU speed if you went out and bought one of the best cards on the market.  2. It's borring after the 1st few hours of playing because it's just the same thing over and over.  Take over this town by blowing up fuel tanks, radar dishes, billboards ect... Go to the next town blow up the same things.  There's like 3 different models of towns that are repeated accross the entire map.3. If you love load times then you'll love this game.  Load times for cut scenes and load times inbetween the scenes in cut scenes... and then load time to get out of the cut scene.  Even if you have a blazing fast box they take forever. 4. The driving/flying in this game is terrible...  When you have games like GTA out there that have done a great job for years and then compare it to this games driving mechanics it's like going back to 1996.  Heck even the old school Carmageddon had better driving mechanics.  Hit a tiny bump and you totally lose control especially on bikes.  Watch out for the pebbles in races because you'll have to restart and deal with more load times.5. The targeting in this game if you use a controler is terrible.  I don't get why they didn't give you an option for assisted targeting like GTA.  Just pure laziness...6. What's the deal with having to sit there forever when you load the game to watch a oil rig blow up before the game connects to the internet to load the game?  Really no option to bypass this?  I bought a SSD so I wouldn't have long load times and they decided to have this large pause so you feel like your computers 10 years old.7. The whole game just seems like they just didn't care at all... Other than the graphics and effects which are top notch the rest has VERY little thought process or planning.   The story is just borring and seems just thrown together.  This is my biggest dissapointment compared the last versions.  Where's the cool quests like in JC2?8. What the heck is with the lighting flickers... Everywhere you go you'll see popping and flashing on walls, rocks, buildings ect ect.  Just horrible and ruins any enjoyment of looking at the amazing looking world.9. The DLC content that SHOULD'VE been included with your purchase.  One of the coolest things from Just Cause 2 was the skybar... Well they make you pay for that now.  Just a kick in the teeth IMHO.  Just because of that I'll never buy another JC title again.  If you want to charge for a cool wingsuite or a crazy jet... even different outfits then fine but for content that was included in past releases is stupid.Bottom line the graphics are amazing... Other than that the rest of the game deserves a grade of F.  That really ticks me off because the Just Cause series was my favorite up till now.			"

												I loved the game, I really did. But the issue of lag slowly rising as you play, or a ""memory leak,"" as some came to call it as it's that bad. The game said my recommended settings for my hardware was max so I thought, """"Oh! That's a surprise for what this game is."" I get in and I'm hit by a blast of lag. I enjoy the new physics and explosions but if I can't enjoy the main features of the game then what's the point? I originally thought it was my cpu, until I saw others complaining about fps issues even with powerful rigs. I can't recommend this game as much as I would love to. With performance issues in a game like Just Cause it's just not worth it. I hope they fix these issues...I really do.But I'm having my doubts over the last year.			"

												It's very boring, requeres 16 GB of RAM, not 8 GB, so there were some performance issues because I wanted to play with the V-Sync on, I couldn't, this game without V-Sync is terrible. Ragdolls and physics did improve, destroyed things disappear in front of your eyes in just few seconds..... Ok, so overall, the game isn't that fun, the performance is terrible if you have 8 GB of RAM, well, It's not worth 50$ that's for sure, I did refund the game.			"

												Well I've been wanting this game for a whole year, Just cause 2 was amazing, although I played it much longer on it's shelf life so there were plenty of mods to make it even more fun. Anyway JC3 is a very. very fun game, at the moment there's a few teething problems (I had a few but since installing the new drivers I have had no problems). It;s very samey to JC2 and thats ok, I don't want too much of a chnage to the game, although it'd be nice to have it change slightly. The graphics are pretty good, and I love the features to the c4, I mean unlimited c4 is a very good add on as it was a pain if you didn't have the mod to keep ordering c4 each time you ran out.I kinda dislike the unlocking the mod thing and a wait period for buying things, but hopefully with mods they wil be taken out. The whole drm thing is a pain, but it's not a huge huge problem. I for one lone this game, the circlejerk of the bad port seems to be going over the top, yes there were and are issues but it's not unplayable.You should buy this, I love this game and so will you			"

												♥♥♥♥ it, I'm a Video-Game-Critic now!Why? I tell you why: Because Just Cause 3 is a ♥♥♥♥ing piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ A Metacritic-score of 74 is not acceptable for such a disaster.  Every time I try to play it I feel agonizing pain just by thinking of the lost potential. I absolutely loved the first two games, especially the second one. It had everything, fluent gameplay, an acceptable story, a ridiculous villain, a big, diverse map, cool missions and lots of explosions. All part three has are the explosions.Part one sure wasn't perfect, but even though the map was just as dull and plain as in part three, the gameplay was a heck of a lot better than the everlasting same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t we get served in Just Cause 3.The best thing about the first game is, that you don't have to upgrade anything. Everything just works the way it is supposed to work, as soon as you unlock it. Simply by playing the game.In Just Cause 2 they introduced the Black Market, since every game has to have upgrades for almost everything nowadays. And guess what, it was still okay, due to the fact that you were able to collect all the money and parts you needed to upgrade Rico to a decent warrior while you were playing the story.And in Just Cause 3 they absolutely ruined their formula by locking even the tiniest upgrades behind dull and repetitive side missions, which are only there to stretch the overall playtime.Playing Just Cause 3 doesn't make you feel the freedom of doing anything you want, like the previous parts did. It makes you feel the misery of doing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again, just to unlock stuff that should just be part of your equipment from the first hour of gameplay on. As a video-game-critic I give Just Cause 3 a 2out of 10, because it took my desires and flushed them down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the same way the whole industry seems to be heading.			"

The other is 32gb ram AMD 8350 and a gtx 970 4gb and I havent had a single issue with it. Havent played it as much as some on here though so maybe i just havent gotten to the issues part, but I couldnt hardly play JC2 on my machines due to crashing issues so as far as I can tell its an improvement. So get out there and Blow some **** up it's worth it!			"

												So far by few hours of in-game experience, Avalanche Studios has fulfilled my wishes and brought exactly what I have been waiting for long time. Hilariously fun to explore, spectacular combat with explosions, beautiful landscapes and lots more what I have not yet seen. I haven't encountered any bugs or even minor glitches yet, which has been bit surprising.The handling of vehicles, which many other reviews have been complaining: comparing to Just Cause 2, it has been made partly better. Handling air vehicles is way more entertaining, whilst land vehicles haven't given same great feeling as on JC2. Time shows, will this change slightly, or not.About performance, it's really easy to understand that many gamers have been suffering from bad performance, but even with my partly really old setup (see my profile) I'm able to have pretty stable 45-60fps on maximum settings, except using FXAA and models on normal (Low/Normal/High/Very High -scale). It consumes my 2GB VRAM almost fully then, and it stays there even on heavy gunfights with explosions.Just as a example of optimization, I firstly tested with lowest possible settings and had 30-40fps, while dipping into 20'ish on gunfights. So far, NVIDIA hasn't provided yet Game Ready -drivers at the time of writing this review.By what I have experienced in these few hours, I honestly recommend buying this game.			"

												Alright, I can understand how some people are disappointed about some of the issues this game had on launch, but this is getting ridiculous. I waited to get at least 10 hours into the game so my opinion would actually mean something, but I accidently enjoyed myself so much that I logged 30 instead. Of course this game had a few issues, it’s one of the largest, graphically advanced open world games of all time. This game, doesn’t only have an impressive scale, it has a story that has been keeping me playing, a huge amount of collectibles and very, very amazing gameplay. The game shouldn’t have been reviewed so negatively, but people don’t want to wait to express an opinion that wouldn’t be relevant to the actual core game, which is undoubtedly great. Now, it’s story page has been scarred with a mixed rating.			"

												One of the very few games in my pc gamen history that has made my computer spontaneously combust.Yeah... the pc version is that bad.The game itself doesn't hold up that well compared to its predecessor. Crouching and sprinting is gone, you're supposed to grapple and glide everywhere now, even in enclosed areas. JC3's field of view is especially low, which makes the new way of movement very awkward and nauseating. Dont buy this game unless you really like stuttering explosions and have at least 64 gigabytes of ram. It's shocking to see such incompetence from a AAA game developer these days.			"

												If you're the type of person that  hates reading long things, then I'll sum up what I'm going to write here: This game is a fantastic game, but it has too much stability issues at the moment for me to give it a good review.Now for the long part,Just Cause 3 is a game where you can just destruct anything, and I'm sure there's no gamer in this world that never said: ""That thing, I want to destroy it, but I can't"". This game lets you destroy about 85 to 90 precent of anything you see in the game, including trees (Take that, GTA!) You're set off in 3 main islands and one island I still didn't figure out what it is, and your goal is to annihilate every existance of the dictator Di Ravello and his military, and you have unlimited fun ways to do so.The AI is fairly decent, it's not the type of AI you see in games like Metal Gear Solid V, where they go on alert for every small thing, cause of course, this isn't a stealth game. The AI isn't impossible and it's not too easy, and 95 precent of the time it works fantastic (I ran into a couple of really small bugs with the AI like them going in circles and walking straight into walls, but that's not a big deal).Weapons are just perfect, there's not THAT much of variety, but trust me, you'll have a lot of fun with what you have and there's a weapon for every approach to this game. If you're the spraying type, you have an LMG, dual wielded SMGs with an insane rate of fire and pretty neat rocket launcers and other exsplosive weapons, and if you're the sharpshooter type you have two sniper rifles and a very powerful dual wileded pistol that can take heavy armored foes with 4 shots.Most vehicles are pretty good, choppers have really good controls in my opinion, plane controls are a little bit annoying when you're new to it but you slowly get used to it, but land vehicles are hard to control and their handling and physics is pretty odd. I found myself driving a car while free roaming or while doing a race challenge and it would bump on something and start rolling, even if the road is completely flat. Also, as you've read, the game has challnges that give you ""Gears"" to unlock ""Gear Mods"" that give you new stuff like more grenades and more ammo, but in some challenges it just seems like you can't even get a 4 gear result (max is 5), and in my opinion it should be possible to get a maximum of 5 on every challenge, but even with hours of practice I couldn't even pull a 3 gear result on some of the challngesBut the biggest issue I had is stability, and I'm not the only one to say so.Before you say: ""Then maybe your PC can't handle it"", I can run GTA V on Very High and get 60 FPS (45 in mountain areas) so I should have been able to handle Just Cause 3 pretty fine, but even on the lowest settings I couldn't even get to 40 FPS. I got the latest drivers, tried to verify game cache and even reinstall the game but I just can't seem to solve this issue. The game is just reaching the point where it's unplayable when you play with 19 FPS and have freezes every 10 to 20 seconds.So to sum it up, this is by far one of the best games I have ever played and I loved every second of it, that is, every second I didn't have lags. I really want to give this game a recommended review but the current state of the game and all the stability issues just stop me from doing so. When the stability issues will be fixed on the patch the first thing I'll do is change this review to recommended.Final Verdict: 7/10, 10/10 without the stability issues			"

My pc specs: AMD-fx 8350 4.0GHZ, amd 2XR9 290X 4gb, 32gb ram (average fps in game on ultra graphic is around 26fps)			"

												+ Vast open world, interestingly designed (big cave systems, ruins, huge structures)+ Bright, beautiful, for games almost novel setting.+ Destruction has never felt so good (and looked so pretty)+ Wingsuit is amazing (once you get the hang of it, which can take a few hours - prepare to eat dirt. A lot.).+ Tethers and explosives provide excellent new toys for creative destruction.+ Upgrades for gear that can alter the behavior dramatically - really fun to experiment with stuff.+ Challenges are mandatory to unlock gearmods, but fair and fun.+ Characters are great, even if there's only a few of them.- ish: The by far largest of the 3 islands is destined to be reached in the last third of the story. I would have liked to spend more time during the story there, but there's always free-mode.- The driving-physics feels very clunky. Had the wingsuit not been there, this would have been a major turn-off. But instead I spent the whole time wingsuiting, which is a much more adequate way to get around for Rico anyway ;)- Liberating of towns becomes repetitive after a while. Especially in the first half of the game, the cities are pretty similar regarding the tasks you need to complete in order to liberate a town.Conclusion:Worthy successor and in my oppinion best part of the series. Kudos to the devs!Old mechanics were improved and polished, new mechanics fit right in and cater to the games flow and it is so. much. fun. "

TL;DR Great game with fun explosions but you might have problems with an AMD card.The Just Cause series is pretty much known for it's chaos.Drive a motorcycle, and shoot the enemies while on said motorcycle. (JC2 and 3, possibly 1)Get on top of a jet and rain down your RPG rounds. (JC3)Freaking get a bubble blaster weapon! (JC2)Over time the series got more and more upgraded.In JC1, it's... well, JC1. It was fun at it's time.In JC2, you get a few upgrades. Grapple Hook, better Grenade Launchers, and a better parachute.In JC3, you get a wingsuit, an even better parachute, and better grappling hooks. plus better driving mechanics xpxpxpBut here's the thing, some people have issues running JC3, even though they have top tier hardware. From what I think it's something AMD related, haven't looked into full detail about it. So if you have an NVIDIA card like me, you SHOULD be fine assuming you have the right specs, but if you're an AMD user, you should think twice about buying this.PROS:1. +Better driving mechanics - JC2's driving mechanics felt very, VERY, slow. Almost to the point that parachuting is faster. Now you can parachute/wingsuit/fly/drive your way to anywhere, and still feel fast!2. +The Wingsuit - The wingsuit is very tricky at first to master, but once mastered... it's well worth it. It's very fast, and with the right upgrades I believe that you can go almost 300 km/h.3. +Explosions - I personally enjoy the explosions, blow a massive object up and feel satisfied for blowing it up.4. +Grapple Tethers - This is a new feature that I enjoy. Basiclly it pulls two objects you grapple onto eachother together. It's very fun, and sometimes you can use this to destroy everything without needing a gun.5. +The Cargo Plane - This probably SHOULD be a joke, but I'm serious. You can go inside the cargo plane, open the cargo door so that you can insert some vehicles, heck even just crash the massive plane into a massive object.6. +Gunplay - It has been very much improved, almost to the point where I wish that the Multiplayer mod would come out soon!7. +Easter Eggs - There are plenty of easter eggs to look for, which can be very entertaining sometimes!There are probably a few Pros I missed, forgive me I haven't played this in 2 days so my memory is a bit off.There are a few mehs here and there, lemme just list them.MEH?:1. +-Story has gotten a little bit better - I think this game has the better story out of all 3 of them. Then again, why would you buy this game for the story?2. +-""Useless"" features - Let's be honest, they got rid of some useless features. (crouching, only one grapple, etc.) But I kinda miss sprinting. Hopefully they can make it so it's actually useful again, I miss it D:3. +-The DLCs - Now with the upcoming DLCs, it sounds like it's going to have missions. Which gets me thinking that if you want more story, you are gonna have to pay more money. I am fine with spending money on this game, the game's treated me well and the developers seem nice enough (Even though they need to work out some issues), so I'm ok spending money with the DLC. Although with recent games coming out almost wanting $100 for the full game, I am a bit suspicious of that.4. +-AMD Users - Hold up this is not directed at you assuming you have an AMD card, but it's more that you MIGHT have some problems. Not sure what's going on, but from what I hear the game does not work with AMD cards.Sadly the game comes with cons.CONS:1. -Challenges - A good concept made into a VERY bad way. To get the good upgrades for your gadgets, you need to complete challenges. They get tedious VERY easily.2. -More ""liberating"" missions. - Minor-ish spoilers coming At the ends of Act 1, 2, and 3, you get this BIG mission, where you have to liberate the islands. You go all around the islands to help the rebels defeat Di Ravello's forces, and all in all I wish there was more than just 3.All in all: I give the game a 9.5/10, and I elect this as my GOTY 2015.

												Long review short:Don't buy. Optimisation is completely missing, no beta-testing was involved, QA staff didn't do its job, the game is unplayable with about 2-3 seconds per frame and 20-minutes-long loading screens.The game is a cash grab in the worst traditions of WarZ, Day One: Gary's Incident and every other coding atrocity dead on arrival from Early Access.Now, the long part:This is more than just a failed game. This is a testament to everything that went wrong with gaming in the last five years.I forced myself through the first mission of the game, despite ""frames-per-second"" not really applicable, since it took way more than a second to poop out one frame for the game. I forced myself to play, because I hoped that this was just a mistake, just some visual bug that would persist through the opening and than vanish like a fart in morning breeze.No, it didn't. After an hour of constantly freezing loading screen and almost crashing ""gameplay"", I say: Just Cause 3 is a certified pile of dog excrement.After enjoying Just Cause 2, Renegade Ops and Mad Max that ran smoothly, with 60 FPS on ""high"" (a rarity these days), I thought that I'd preorder JC3 and put my trust in Avalanche. When intermittent scripting issues and nonsensical patching schedule arose with Mad Max, I blamed those on WB interference, cautiously cancelled preorder, and thought that surely Avalanche will do its best with quality assurance. After the release, I finally took up courage to buy the game, thinking that two weeks after release, any major problems would be resolved.I. Was. So. Wrong.Day-one patches that are common these days are a real headache and a good sign that the devs are skimping on QA. But with JC3, there was no day-one patch, there was NO PATCH AT ALL! The game that looks like Twisted Metal 3 or something out of Direct3D era (that's what you get for minimising settings and cramming the game into a 800x600 window) still chokes out task manager on a modern gaming PC, loads slower than GTA V despite being installed on SSD, attempts to crash every other second and eats up 8 gigabytes of RAM without giving anything back after being forcibly terminated, is something you'd see being released by a scammer.I had Early Access titles being more playable than this. I had Sword of the ♥♥♥♥ing Stars 2, an incomplete gameplay prototype, being less buggy and more responsive than this steaming turd. You read this right: A HALF-BAKED CHUNK OF CODE BEING MORE OF A GAME THAN JC3! I've had it. If the developers don't release a demo, I either don't touch it or don't buy it until trying it out for free.WB are innocent, Avalanche is simply a bunch of deadbeats who cannot code a game worth 10$, much less 60.

												Running after 10 hours with no performance issues running maxed out settings on my i5-4690k and a GTX 980.Definitely a massive graphics improvement over Just Cause 2, but while it only shows minor improvements to the Just Cause formula (blow up EVERYTHING.), I wouldn't necessarily call that a bad thing.This game is worth it and while it's ultimately up to you the customer, I will say that if you enjoy games like this, you will not regret your purchase of this game.

From what I played this one seemed to be the same, only with more gadgets, more explosions and more parachutes. My problem with it was it constantly crashed, about onve every half hour. I could only play past so many crashes until I had to refund it.			"

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR ANY PRICE!!!I've played this game for a good amount of time, but now it is unplayable. My computer is less than 5 months old and was built with near top of the line specs. No amount of changeing options or restarting is fixing it. There may be a fix that I haven't found yet, but that doesn't matter.SquareEnix.

												I am only 20 hours deep in this game but it is awesome. As I have said (repeatedly) over my last few reviews (for Far Cry Primal & Rise of teh Tomb Raider), this is a very worthy successor to the franchise! The graphics are much improved and the gameplay is smooth as silk. I love just cruising along in the parachute and/or the wingsuit. As much as it seems that it would get old, it somehow has not yet. I mean, why fast travel when I can skim the ground in my wingsuit for 2-3 km? As for the action itself, it is consistent with previous titles in this series -- which is to say interesting and fun as heck! If you like blowing stuff up, you DO NOT want to miss this game. The story in the main campaign is very good with each cover mission being short enough to be able to complete even in a short session. I have loved the first 20 hours so much that I picked up the Air, Land & Sea expansion today on steep sale. I cannot wait to keep chasing after this story! Buy it.			"

												Alright. I write this after the Nvidia driver was installed that was released when the game was supposed to be. Day one it was an unplayable stuttering mess of tearing and artifacts that was Batman: Arkham Knight look good. Now it actually loads up and I can give my review.Pros:+Massive map: This map is big. VERY big. Makes  GTA V look small.+Dense map: This map is littered with collectibles and outposts in between town for you to explore...or destroy.+Blow sh!t up: Need I say more? You have UNLIMITED Bavarium C4 and plenty of rockets, grenades and powerful guns at your disposal. One special weapon shoots a homing laser that calls in an AIRSTRIKE. All the cool stuff from Mercenaries 2. Of course, you can just use volatile environmental objects to blow up other objects just as well.+Tether and Physics: You have a grapple gun that can chain together and reel in objects for just about anything. Sling an enemy onto a wall, pull a car off a cliff, launch an explosive barrel into a more explosive fuel tank, etc. Physics are a bit loose in this game, but that is needed to pull off some of the terrific chain explosions that make this game what it is. Gravity always seems to be at Moon level just when you need it.+Graphics: This game does look pretty at max settings. Textures are usually solid and water is realistic.-Explosions: Best looking explosions of any game, ever.+Wingsuit: Defy a bit of gravity and pretend to be superman. You can even use your grapple while flying to keep pulling yourself along without ever touching the ground. So much fun and way better than driving or flying a helicopter.Cons:-Game still can crash randomly without warning.-Some textures can ""pulse"" or flicker.-Game starts stuttering with gamepad input. Unplugging and replugging it fixes the problem...for a few minutes.-Game is far more intensive than necessary. Explosions and mayhem will tank the framerate on lesser machines. I occasionally drop below 60 fps with a 6700K and a 980ti. Bad. This is not Witcher 3.-Story is goofy and predictable, but a B movie parody may be what they were aiming for.-Cheesy voice acting.Overall, this game is a 8/10 from me. This is an explosive sandbox game that should be in your Library next to GTA V. Just be sure to look at the requirements to run this thing. At the time of this review it remains a glitchy resource hog that requires some serious hardware to max out. Hope you found this helpful. Time to go do ""something subtle"".... "

Edit: As of 22-Jun-16, they've released 2 expansions, but haven't fixed the random, game breaking stuttering. Edit[2]: As of 11-Aug-16, still unplayable on the ""Optimal"" settings suggested by the GEFORCE Experience. Extreme stuttering! It is a really difficult decision for me to make here, but the negatives out-weighed the positives when considering the game in its current state. What I liked:If you liked JC2, you would most probably love JC3. It's almost the same game, but with improved visuals, a wingsuit and few tweaks to the grapple hook. Navigating around the world is much better now and with the beautiful landscapes, it never feels like a chore to move from one point to another. I never even found the necessity to even use fast travel! The new physics system is brilliant. Explosions and destruction are totally eye candy and one wouldn't get bored of them soon.  What I disliked:The game-breaking stuttering issues! These stutters have stopped me from enjoying all the positive things I've mentioned above. The stuttering increased with the game runtime, so restarting the game would have sounded like a good work-around, but this game totally freezes my PC when I try to exit. I can either force log out/restart my PC or wait for 15 mins for the program to collect crash data for it to send and then finally close.The story is forgettable and the gameplay would get quite repetitive if you're not so keen on experimenting with the destruction.Vehicle handling is terrible and I very rarely found myself attempting to drive or navigate the map using them.I somehow feel the water to be a step down from JC2 where it looked really amazing. Verdict: If they fix the stuttering, this would be decent game and can potentially be a lot of fun, despite the other issues I've mentioned.			"

 This is not a review of the gameplay, this is a report on the performance of the game on specified hardwareIt's been over a year and they still haven't made the game run any better.  TLDR: On the specs listed directly below, you will experience at least 70 FPS on average on all graphics settings, but you will get A LOT of horrible micro stuttering. Specs: GTX 960 2GB, AMD FX 6300, 8 GB RAMI'm going to list off a few games I can run amazingly well on this rig:The Witcher 3: Wild HuntGrand Theft Auto VBattlefield 4Titanfall 2Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom PainFar Cry 4Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege(etc., etc.) My point is,  the aformentioned hardware can run all of the above at a consistent 60 FPS (with the exception of The Witcher 3, which runs at an average 45 FPS, but I have that on Ultra graphics). Meaning it is not the hardware's fault that the game doesn't run, the game is just simply not optimized very well. Consider saving your money if you have hardware similar to mine. EDIT: I get it, people. My PC is♥♥♥♥♥♥And yes, I ♥♥♥♥ing despise my CPU lol. Just seems like I ought to be able to run it if I have everything set on ""LOW"", but that isn't the case.(Also, consider reading through the comments to make sure your ""Your rig sucks"" comment hasn't already been written for you.)

												This game is great! It's a true successor to Just Cause 2 with many improvements. Here are some highlights:-Graphics are amazing! They are just as good for today as the graphics were in Just Cause 2 for its time. It's not quite the Witcher 3 level of graphics, but very, very good!-Optimization: I'm getting a solid 60 FPS with absolutely no dips so far at 1200p and with maximum settings. Given, I am running a Titan X paired with a stock i7 4790K, so maybe it's not completely fair to say that. I'll try on my wife's computer with a GTX 770 for comparison soon and will update with the results from that.UPDATE: I installed on 2 more computers: 1 with a GTX 770 and one with a 750Ti. The 770 one gets 55 average FPS with very few dips at max settings. Adjusting a few settings yields 60 FPS with no drops and the graphics are still amazing. On the 750Ti at medium settings, I average 40 FPS with a few small dips here and there, but nothing major. So my conclusion based on MY findings is that it is optimized well. I can't explain why others are having issues, but I wish them well and hope they get everything fixed soon.-Mission Layout: This is a big improvement from Just Cause 2. The missions are spread out nicely and the pace is so much better. The raw production values within the missions are also great. They are very Michael Bay-ish, which is a good thing here!-Chaos & Destructable environments: This is what made Just Cause 2 so great for me, and Just Cause 3 does not disappoint! They kept everything 2 had, and made the physics and destruction itself even better! Blowing up a bridge with a convoy on it is SO satisfying and a joy to watch. I also knocked over a large ball thingy with gas in it and it rolled down a hill, caught fire, hit a road, banged into a car, blew up, made the car go flying into another car, which then also blew up, and then that explosion alerted some nearby enemies at a checkpoint and they proceeded to attack some rebels passing by (I guess they assumed the rebels did it since they didn't see me do it?). And that is all just within a few hours of gameplay. I can't wait to see that else will happen!-HUGE open world. The same size as 2 which is huge enough! Just Cause 3 has 1000 square kilometers to explore. And it's in that same beautiful tropical setting we all love (ecept the snowy parts in the mountains which are still damn beautiful!).-Shooting, ziplining, and parachuting are all streamlined and feel so much smoother than 2 did. Gliding is new and a joy to play around with!-Underwater is beautiful and fun to swim around in. Another big improvement.I'd say this is a solid 8.5/10, maybe 9/10 if the story shapes up to be very good.			"

YouTube™ Video: Just Cause 3 [Game Review] 

			Views: 177		

			My review of ""Just Cause 3"", the open world action sandbox game developed by Avalanche Studios and published by Square Enix.		

Game: Just Cause 3Genre: Open World ActionDeveloper: Avalanche StudiosPublisher: Square EnixCopy supplied by SteamJust Cause 3 is an open world action game developed by Avalanche Studios and published by Square Enix.STORYYou play again as Rico Rodriguez, member of the Agency, and this time he goes back to his hometown, Medici, to help his childhood friends and the rebellion get rid of Colonel DiRavello, an evil dictator who has made life miserable for everyone.The story isn't all that different from the other games of the serie, but this time I was more invested in it: the characters are more fun, there are more over-the-top set-pieces, and I was having a genuine good time. It might not win an Oscar for best screenplay, but it works for the game just fine.GRAPHICSAMD users are currently having serious issues with this game. I recommend waiting for a patch before buying it.Avalanche knows how to make a good looking open world: the islands and mountains of Medici look gorgeous, and each town and base is beautiful to blow up in an orchestra of explosions. The physics are also improved and both more realistic and fun, and more objects can be destroyed, including bridges. The performance was mostly pretty good (45fps on an average laptop) and the game crashed only once while recording with Fraps. It's mostly been a stable experience.The character model of Rico finally looks badass, especially because of the beard. The only real complaint I have is related to everyone else: the NPCs are not very detailed and can get repetitive pretty fast. Still, it looks amazing and it was very relaxing to wingsuit from a mountaintop into the ocean.GAMEPLAYWhen playing Just Cause 3, you must know what you are getting into. It's a game that wants to deliver an open world filled with enemy bases and cities in which you must destroy propaganda billboards, fuel tanks, antennas and radars. And the game completely delivers in that.This is basically an improved version of Just Cause 2: the shooting feels smoother, you can actually walk on vehicles even while driving, you can pull tethered objects, the driving is (slightly) better, and the missions are a bit more fun. They even got completely rid of QTEs, and you can call Rebel Drops with vehicles and weapons without using any money. To move around the environment you have cars, tanks, jets and boats, as well as the grappling hook, parachute and a really fast and useful wingsuit that makes running away from bad situations very easy.Other than story missions, you can destroy outposts or complete Challenges. Each Challenge is related to a different gameplay area (shooting, driving, destroying), and you get Gears that unlock new modifications to improve Rico: carry more grenades, tether more objects, fast Rebel Drops deployments... Thus you get rid of annoying weapon and vehicle upgrades, making the game just less frustrating to play.The game is as boring as you want it to be: you can just shoot rockets and bullets at everything, or try to tether a car packed of explosives to a sphere tank and watch it all blow up in glorious fashion. You make your experience fun or boring.CHALLENGEThe game is mostly challenging while trying to get an high score in Challenges or in some bases with tight security. The AI isn't all that polished, and sometimes might shoot at nothing, but they did manage to kill me a couple of times, especially when I was trying to look cool.SOUNDThe soundtrack is fairly good and the sound effects are as always top notch. The voice acting is also the perfect blend of cheesy and self-aware, and I laughed a couple of times during the cutscenes because of some delivery (especially from Mario).REPLAYABILITY1000 km² of playground, 47 Steam achievements (mostly about Story missions and 100% completion), plenty of challenges and endless possibilities to cause chaos will keep you entertained for many hours to come.Overall, I find this to be a vary damn fun video game. If you enjoyed Just Cause 2 and open world games, the game is pretty much the same and there is plenty of content to keep you hooked. However, some of you might find the whole experience repetitive and tedious. But adrenaline junkies and fans of over-the-top action movies will feel fantastic, going from base to base blowing everything up.Story: 7Graphics: 9Gameplay: 9Challenge: 8Sound: 9Replayability: 9ENJOYMENT: 9FRUSTRATION: 4Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on Facebook{LINK REMOVED}Check my official websiteJoin my Steam group "

												After putting 30 hours into the game I was ready to give it a thumbs up. The mechanics were fine and I was having no performance issues (guess I was one of the lucky ones), but then something happened which has now prevented me from playing the game completely. When I was playing, for whatever reason my computer decided to reset (I was never able to figure out why). Then I launched the game back up only to find my save file was missing. 30 hours gone. I check the forums only to find out that I'm not the only person that this has happended to. Now not only am I upset, but I also don't want to play the game knowing that at any moment all my progress could be deleted again and I would have to start over again.			"

												To make a long story short, I played JC2 a lot and, at the time of its release, I considered it to be a technical masterpiece. Right from the moment it when live, the game was almost perfect. Now, this is a different story for JC3. What most people report; bad PC porting, graphical glitches, disconnection issue with the online features, poorly put together story, etc... are all, sadly, true.It feels like the game lack polishing. Buy it only when heavily discounted (>=75%). Gameplay is still great but not as special as in the JC2 era... Perhaps  new comer to the series won't mind.I am going to rate this negatively mainly for the lack of interest for the developer to fix PC porting problems and for the high retail price.			"

												Im glad steam gives refunds. This game is NOT worth $60. I purchased it thinking it was going to be awesome to cause mayhem, but after logging in and doing that for an hour, it got really boring. The quest line didn't hook me either, it felt dull. Sure, you can blow things up and grapple people to cars, but after you do that you realize there are other games with a lot more depth for $60.			"

												Spoiler: Just Cause 3 ran just fine for me. This is in December 2016, so presumably after patches and improvements, and on a decent system. Sorry if you had issues. I will admit it crashed more than I liked, but relatively speaking (maybe ten crashes over 42 hours?) it wasn't the worst ever.Short version of this review: buy this, especially if you can also get the DLC included, and especially if you enjoyed Just Cause 2. It's more of the same, but prettier, faster and with bigger explosions - and a slightly better story.As in the previous two, you're Rico Rodriguez, 'professional badass', 'King of the Rebels' and 'real life superhero' as the population of Medici keep reminding you when you're stood still for a second. As in the previous two your signature grappling hook and parachute combo is back, now joined by immediately indispensable wingsuit, which makes moving over the lush terrain even more enjoyable than before. It also opens up an entirely new category of challenges, which have you swooping and diving over terrain like a maniac.With the wingsuit, the weaponry and of course the huge list of vehicles, in many ways Just Cause 3 feels like Far Cry 3 (or 4) in third person, which is no bad thing. Like those games you have a huge open world to explore, although commendably it's almost all open to you at the start. Perhaps unwisely, with the exception of the rising 'heat' level you get as soon as you even look funny at the military, the difficulty level across the island doesn't vary too much. At least it makes sense. Is that a giant military base stuffed with guns and things to blow up? It'll probably be harder to tear down than a remote guard post with a couple of fuel tanks.Either way, with an unlimited supply of retries and cash (well, beacons to summon stuff; cash is completely gone in JC3, which just encourages you to wreak more havoc) it's only a matter of time before you'll destroy everything you need to and finish things off. Almost like clockwork, in fact; like so many other 'AAA' open world titles, it took me about 40 hours to finish the main story and pick up almost all of the collectibles. Great value, then, with an enormous island left to tool around afterwards.Inevitably I've got to compare JC3 to JC2, which I've played through a couple of times and enjoyed a lot. JC3 is streamlined in a few places, for example reducing 'hacking' to a timed button press and removing the ability to 'dodge' (which did always feel a little dumb). Conditioned by 60 odd hours in JC2, at first I missed my implausible rolling and leaping to avoid gunfire, but before long I realized the intention: always be moving. More than JC2 you're reliant on the hook/parachute/wingsuit combo here, and to stay alive as long as possible you need to grapple, soar and chute your way to safety, then come back fighting seconds later. Your only restriction is ammo, but even that's plentiful between the bodies and the resupply points. I rarely got frustrated and always enjoyed Rico's improbable antics.Overall, while it doesn't feel significantly different than Just Cause 2, Just Cause 3 is a fantastic open world experience and a great progression forward. With better writing, more interesting missions and more to do, this truly brings Avalanche Studios up to a new level. I'm hoping to see more from Rico, or even something entirely new using their open world expertise (Mad Max is a must play from the same team!).			"

												Just Cause 3 brings to the table (and the computers upon these tables) everything that its predecessors offered to gamers around the world. Set free from the rules of reality by its focus on fun, Just Cause 3 is everything that the modern gamer needs: a reasonably realistic simulacrum of the real word whose rules apply more to everything that isn't the player, and less to everything that the player touches.The world of Just Cause 3 is as deep as it is vast - mile upon mile of breathtakingly beautiful land (and sea...and air) stretches out as far as one's draw distance is set, and on almost every inch of these miles is an opportunity for the player to cause what the game calls Chaos.To delve deep into the universe of Just Cause, one must first delve deep into his (or her...) wallet - and it is safe, indeed, to say that this game offers far more in the way of fun than, say, $70 of takeout.

How much I recommend the gameI would only recommend this game if you really know what you're getting yourself into. I marked ""Yes"" because It was a fun game to play and I'm familiar with the series. While the game had its fair share of problems, if you're a fan of the series you'll enjoy yourself. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it is a downgrade from the sequel. If there was a ""mixed"" option, I would probably choose that instead. I purchased this game while it was 75% off, and I highly recommend that you do the same if you really want it.PerformanceIf you have a high end system, don't worry about the people complaining about memory leaks.I have 16GB RAM, GTX 1070, and Intel 6700k and experienced no real issues regarding memory leaks.However, that does not change the fact that the game was very glitchy. Enemies spawn in right before your eyes at times, physics glitches are not uncommon, and the game is generally unstable (in the lovable Just Cause sort of way). I will still able to maintain a consistently high frame rate despite this. I have crashed to desktop 1 time, and had to force close the game due to it locking up 2 times in my 24 hours of playing it, so it's really not all that bad.GameplayDrivingThey somehow managed to make the driving even worse than how it was in Just Cause 2. Once you get used to it, it's not so bad. Motorcycles are especially horrible to drive, you will never get used to them. The vehicles have a really strange momentum/weight to them, and it's very difficult to drive with a keyboard and mouse unlike in games like Grand Theft Auto 5 or Saint's Row. The driving mechanics also depend way too much on using your hand brake, and of course that is a pain since the controls are frustrating. Be prepared to not use your space bar for hand brakes. They also got rid of the Stunt Jump mechanic from Just Cause 2, which is a major disappointment. It's a lot harder to hijack cars and vehicles, and it's very frustrating trying to enter cars via grappling hook alone. Rico also has a very cool habit of only walking while on boats and planes. Since there is no more Stunt Jumping, this makes it very tedious and frustrating to actually enter the cockpit of boats and planes. In Just Cause 2, you could just press the Stunt Jump button to have Rico quickly and automatically grapple his way into position to enter a vehicle and drive it, but in 3 you have to actually walk over to the cockpit or car door for some reason.KeybindingThis game was clearly not optimized for PC. The game will never let you know about keybind conflicts, and with so many different keys and functions, things get very difficult to manage. I actually ended up binding ""contract tether"" to one of the rudder controls for air vehicles by accident and realized this halfway through the game. The game will also not let you know if chaning one bind for one control will change another. For example, if you want to change your parachute button while on foot to something else, this will in turn change your parachute and bail buttons for driving as well, and the game will not notify you of this. Also, there are many binds that are linked, such as jumping onto the roof of a car and bailing by parachute. The game will list these as separate binds although they will always be bound to the same button no matter what. This was one of the biggest annoyances of this game. The keybinding in Just Cause 2 was leagues better than this.General GameplayIt's repetitive, but such is the nature of Just Cause. However, since the story is lackluster, none of it really feels like it's worth it. Sure, it's fun to destroy bases and liberate towns at first, but then you start to realize the copy/paste nature of many areas in the game world, and the game starts turning into a chore. There are also many annoying parts of combat. Enemies with shotguns can temporarily stun Rico from quite long ranges for some reason. Also, hitting the ground while using a wingsuit is very annoying. No matter how fast you go, Rico will get stunned, unless you unlock the ability to retract your wingsuit when going slowly near the ground, which should have been a feature by default. Be sure not to get stunned while on a mountain or something, or else Rico will go into an uncontrollable tumble for an annoyingly long amount of time. The stun mechanics in the game are horrible and annoying. You will find yourself getting frustrated every time Rico falls over.There are also many challenges that you must do to upgrade tools and equipment, which also (surprise!) gets annoying quite quickly. By doing challenges, you earn ""gears"" which act as currency towards upgrades of different kinds. If you do a racing challenge you unlock gears for cars, gun challenges unlock gears for guns, and so forth. You actually have to unlock things like precision aiming, which should have been available from the beginning by default, and things like increased tethers, which should have been unlocked as the story progressed. A lot of the unlocks are also very underwhelming and were clearly meant to be filler/padding for the more interesting and useful upgrades. Oh, I unlocked the ability to get a supply drop faster? Wow, because they were sooo slow to begin with.StoryThe story was pretty nice, but the ending felt incredibly rushed. Things will be developing at a certain pace and then it will ramp up out of nowhere and end unexpectedly. The ending is unbelievably underwhelming compared to the ending of Just Cause 2. Spoilers: You don't end up fistfighting Baby Panay while riding a nuke. The game also lacks the charm of Just Cause 2. Just Cause 2 felt like a campy B-movie, and Rico felt like the stereotypical lead to that kind of movie, his voice actor fit the role perfectly. You could practically see him doing the sign of the cross after taking out baddies. Now, Rico is this rugged manly man with a new voice actor whom I'm not entirely fond of. Rico is still Rico, though. He's still out fighting for the greater good and trying to end corruption, taking the obvious moral high ground as always, and I love him for it. Just Cause 3 story-wise is basically Just Cause 2, but with less of the B-movie charm. It is nice to finally get some answers regarding Rico's past, as well as somewhat of a conclusion to it. I really enjoyed the setting and premise of the story, but felt that it was lacking in a few areas.ConclusionIf you want to just kill time with a game revolving around mindless action and chaos, and dont mind the occasional glitch and can stand mediocre controls, then go for it. It was fun to play but it could have been a lot better. If you haven't played Just Cause 2, I would HIGHLY recommend that you do before playing 3, it'll make you appreciate 3 a lot more.			"

												Brilliant game and great gameplay, however small world with gaps. I felt that the map was small in comparison to Just Cause 2. The new wingsuit is great but makes travelling quicker which influnces that. Also, there seems to be a lack of places. I've played 40 hours and have libarated the first two islands. In Just Cause 2, I have 55 ish hours and have only 30% completion after story.  Also, there's a lack of different biomes which Just Cause 2 excelled at. There is a lot of jungle areas and plains and little of the others. It could just be me but the snow biome felt like just a mountain whereas Just Cause 2 was huge in comparison. The game feels repetitive with lack of variety in the civilizations. Even with this, the game is brilliant and has many interesting mechanics. I would recommend this to any big fan of Just Cause 2 as the new features are great fun. A new player to the series? I would maybe try Just Cause 2 first as that's cheaper and still brilliant or wait for a sale.			"

												I feel the need to write a review for this since there is so much bad press about the performance. I've heard that if you have an AMD card, it will crash on you, so please research as best you can. Steam has a refund period now, so refund if you buy it and it doesn't work. I really loved this game when I wasn't expecting to.  I spent an hour in childish delight pulling down guard towers with my dual-tether because the destruction physics are so awesome. I have a decent/high-end system, and I still got a few framerate drops in big explosions, but it just looks like awesome slow-mo. If you can run it, you probably won't regret buying this, especially on sale.			"

												So far have spent 25 hrs in this game, beat the story @ 20 hrs. This is the first Just Cause I have played, also my setup is an i5 4590, gtx 970 ssc, 8GB ram, HDD, 1080p monitor. Have a few pro's and cons I want to mention.ProSuper fun as far as just causing pure havoc with a wide variety of tools. (hehe, ""just causing"")Good variety of side challengesGood variety of weapons from pistols/rifles/rpgs/nuke launchersWingsuit/tethering/parachute mechanic is great, easy to get use to. Makes it really fun getting around the map in the early stages.I particularly enjoyed the leaderboard aspect of the game, whenever it popped up I took it as a small challenge; however, I have good internet, so I can see where that might be a con to some even though the game does offer an offline mode.Settlements can be taken over using a variety of tactics, from lots of explosions and guns, to lots of tethering and flying around.Relatively large map.ConTake-overs are very cookie cutter. The only challenge is the number of chaos objects you have to destroy to get the base/settlement. Once you know how to neutralise the defenses, you pretty much control how challenging you want it to be.Vehicles are very OP, once you get ahold of something with a cannon/missiles, you're pretty much invincible if you learn how to drive it.You navigate 3 islands. 2 pretty small, 1 freaking enormous one. The giant island makes wingsuiting seem pretty slow after getting use to it for the previous locations.This game is moderately buggy. When exiting from challenges sometimes the screen will freeze until I hit the default exit button (ctrl). I experience ghosting during cutscenes and moderate frames drops/stuttering after ~1 hr. Vehicle controls are wonky. Planes rotate around the camera view and don't allow for good mouse control. Key mapping between helicopter/plane is independent except for one area, weapons. Found this out the hard way when I blew myself up upon taking off in a helicopter.Unnecessary total score system. (You blew up a tank! Yay here's some points that go to absolutely nothing!)Gear upgrades are assigned to certain challenges. (i.e. If you want to upgrade your tethers to the max, you better learn how to drive a vehicle well...with people shooting at you. Want more ammo for your RPG? Get more accurate with your pistols. Want to order more than one air drop? Learn how to fly.)Story missions are fun, plot is useless, but they need to be completed to get past certain points on the map.Has a lot of filler mechanics/challenges (i.e. sanctuary, shrines, tapes)OverallI would recommend this game to others. I got it on the winter sale for ~$40 which I would say is a fair price. The open sandbox still allows me to play it after beating it the story so I can still blow stuff up to my hearts content with greater and greater weapons.8/10 would dive into the side of a cliff again.

												To start off, I think this is a great game. I am really shocked that the review count is Mixed on Steam. It is an absolute beautiful game, with a big map full of contrasting enviornments. Time to start off a pros and cons list, cause who doesn't like those?Pros: -Very beautiful graphics with great water-A wide map with tons to explore-I haven't experienced any FPS issues or stuttering of any kind. I know this is a common complaint, but I'm running using a 970m with 8 GB of ram with and i7-4720HQ and suffer no interruptions on nearly maxed out settings.-The online connect feature I have never had a problem with, even in super crap internet, and I don't know why people are complaining about it. And if you are playing it on the go, then there must be somewhere with WiFi cause I can't imagine playing it in a car.-Clean controls, easy to learn and master-Story is good when it's there (I'll explain this more in the cons)-Wingsuit is a nice, new addition to the game-Multiple tethers and being able to retract them is another great new feature-Towns are always different, but similar in a nice way -The Havoc engine is perfect for a game like this and well used for destruction-Ability to stunt jump across the entire vehicle is an awesome feature-Characters are unique and funny and important in their own waysCons:-There is not too much story in the game, and when it is there it is sporadic, sometimes occurring back to back or going long periods without it. When it is there though, it is enjoyable with good characters.-The loading screen is the only loading issue I have. You can't skip it, which is a little frusturating, and it takes a decent time.I have to say, this game is very, very good and the couple of issues people are seeming to have still aren't enough for me to maybe think about not recommending it. Very good game, and props to SquareEnix and Blizzard Studios for creating such a good game. "

I have updated my review with a recommendation as the game is very fun.Cannot reccomend this game at present. I have an Asus Strix GTX 970 graphics card, an AMD FX 8350 CPU, 8gb 1600MHz RAM and a standard WD 7200RPM HDD. This game is almost unplayable. I usually have a frame rate of 70+ on ultra settings 1080p when just walking around but the minute I get in a fast car the FPS is all over the place, from 70-47-53-32 and so on. I experience similar very noticable frame drops when there are big explosions in an area or if I'm flying around with the wingsuit. The moment any action starts at all you will notice a frame rate hit, and considering this is solely an ACTION game, this is inexcusable. Do not buy until there is a patch. I will change this review if I ever notice that they have fixed this issue.			"

												I bought this dog of a game in hopes it would be as fun as the others... But alas, that wasnt to be true. I have a 4 core fast machine with the latest Nvidia drivers  and plenty of space.I turned the effects OFF for everything, reducing the game to an ugliness not worth playing.And yet:This game is FULL of stuttering... Sometimes it stutters for 20-30 seconds in the middls of high action gameplay making the game COMPLETELY unplayable. The sound will stutter and freeze at times yielding a long buzzing from the speakers before finally coming back to just 1-2 frames per second for 1-2 minutes... After THAT you might  get to play for 30 seconds before the next round of grating loud buzzing. The game is freezes a lot! But only when there is more than one background object,,,you know, like a pair of enemy jeeps... That grinds the game to a complete standstill... In short I am TIRED of developers putting games out as finished that are clearly still in the beta stage like this UNPOLISHED atrocious title. I would like a refund ...  "

												No, I don't buy the PS4 version because it's a lagging piece of bananas, full of performance problems. So I wait more and yes, finally I buy the PC version and now I'm stuck with something that won't even work? I only bought it yesterday but Error 38 already burned into my retina. I look up solutions, workarounds and seriously, I should UNDERCLOCK my videocard to get it to work?!And in the end it's not that the developer team makes me want to puke, but I made the wrong decision. I should've bought the PS4 version because it might be lagging, might be slow, but it's still a smaller pile of garbage then the PC version, and why? Because at least it's working.Never, ever buy this. Don't give the devs the opportunity to get more money for this. This abomination and it's creators don't deserve a single coin for making something so horrible and I'm not even angry.			"

												well my first impressions are its a fun game, there is no doubt about that, however the game needs some SERIOUS optimization, my build can only get 60 fps on max settings when literally nothing is happening, for example wingsuiting through a feild, but the second i hop into a town or a rocket explodes next to me boom drops to 30fps.. i have no doubt in my mind that this will be fixed eventually but untill it is dont buy the game especially on lower end machines!(would mixed review but there is no button for that)TLDR: DONT BUY TILL THE GAME IS FIXED			"

												I cant tell if I like it or not. There are so many positives as there are negatives. Ill start with the negatives. NEGATIVES -  First off, this ♥♥♥♥ING AUDIO BUG!!! Every time I start up my game I have to take off my headset cause its super loud static and I have to actually get into game and unplug and replug them in to remove the static. Second is the load time of the game, first you have to get to main loading screen to connect to there server♥♥♥♥♥♥ and then you need to actually load the game. Probably 3 minutes of loading inorder to play the game. Next is the performance. Its laggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥for me. First day I couldnt play it. I had a 760 and I just upgraded to a 960 thinking I will be fine.... Nope. I have to run on medium to get 50 to 60 fps. Also the spawns is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. I was on my way to a airport for around 10 minutes just trying to get there and then I die. I spawn all the way from where I started. They should have added a fast travel to discovered locations. POSITIVES - Once you have your settings right and its playable its can be really fun. Gameplay and controls are meh, but still fun ahah. Explosions and really epic and its alot of fun to tear apart a base. Also the fighter jet with the bombs is ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING. Its one of thoughs games with a ton of replay value and the ♥♥♥♥ing around doesnt seem to get old.Final Thoughts - I like it. Im sure they will fix the performance issue and other bugs, and if they dont modders will. The positive side over comes my negative and I would totally tell you to buy it, if you can run it haha. I get 55 - 60 fps on mediumMy specs - intel core i7 4770kEVGA GeForce GTX 960 FTW GAMING ACX 2.0+8gb vengeance ram(other♥♥♥♥♥♥doesnt matter lol) Sorry for typos and mis-spelling, just rushing.  "

												The game is laggy yet I somehow played the entire game with frops down to 28 FPS(Frames per second) It helped when I did not have a FPS counter(don't ask) otherwise the game is basicly what you heard explosions, explosions and more explosions! To be honest thoguh I do need a better CPU which would make the game play better for me it is not just this game but I was disapointed when Mad Max ran at a consistant 50-60 FPS feeling very smooth that this game lagged so bad:( Overall I rate this game a 8/10!

												I feel the need to write a review for this since there is so much bad press about the performance. I've heard that if you have an AMD card, it will crash on you, so please research as best you can. Steam has a refund period now, so refund if you buy it and it doesn't work. I really loved this game when I wasn't expecting to.  I spent an hour in childish delight pulling down guard towers with my dual-tether because the destruction physics are so awesome. I have a decent/high-end system, and I still got a few framerate drops in big explosions, but it just looks like awesome slow-mo. If you can run it, you probably won't regret buying this, especially on sale.			"

												Horrible first impression.Upon first launch, game had TERRIBLE inconsistent frame rate, as well as laughably severe texture problems (missing 'diamonds' of terrain until extremely close). Was required to download a day one AMD Beta driver just for this game. Fixed the performance issues, for the most part.ProsNice graphics. Nothing mind blowing but compared to JC2, very pleasing to the eyes.Wingsuit is alot of funConsUI has this strange requirement to using Ctrl to 'go back', hitting Esc does nothing...NO SprintingNO CrouchingNO minimap HUD optionFine aim has to be UNLOCKED. WTF?!Encountered some lip sync issues during cutscenesVehicles handle like♥♥♥♥♥♥ possibly worse than JC2 (despite them bragging about overhauling)Water physics are frustratingly overexaggerated; rediculous nonstop waves prevent you from getting any sort of speed.I LOVED JC2, dumped i think 70hrs into it so far. I truely was looking forward to this as they did a lot of great things with 2, but how ANYONE can see this as enjoyable as a sequel is beyond me. Must be noobies to the series. All I see is a severe step backwards.			"

												If you are like me, and often sit around wondering what game to play, without really feeling like getting into a huge story, and not in the mood for multiplayer stuff, then this game is a great cure. Just cause 3 is just amazingly fun to mess about in, just do whatever, go wherever, lose yourself in gathering vehicles, or collectibles. Or go ""liberate"" huge military bases and watch everything explode so very beautifully. Or maybe just glide around in the incredibly satisfying wingsuit, try to top the leaderboards in time spent flying or just admire the absolutely gorgeous and colorful islands of Medici.As far as story goes, from what ive seen so far its hey-okay, the characters are enjoyable and the missions can be somewhat challenging at times (this i like, a lot). But for me this wasnt the attraction of the game anyways, so im not going to talk much about it.Gunplay is pretty great, theres a good supply of rpg/grenade launchers in almost every base which is great fun to use. The other weapons are what youd expect, nothing too fancy, but there is a slight variety of high fire rate, high damage etc. Most importantly they are implemented very well so that you can nearly always fire them, and with accuracy so you dont get annoyed with spread misses constantly. Even while falling or parachuting.The addition of the wingsuit is great, and implemented pretty much perfectly with smooth transitions from parachute to wingsuit, ur just instant grapple->wingsuit flight. Its so much fun to just fly around, this is probably the best change from JC2 that i can think of.How different is the game from JC2? Well, to me it seems that its basically minor improvements everywhere that stacks up to be a pretty major upgrade. Except for the wingsuit, most of the game is the same, but now for example, blowing bases up is 2x the satisfaction because of the incredibly cool clouds of fire and smoke from all the gastanks etc. The graphics are better, but most importantly Medici is incredibly beautiful and super colorful. It is such a treat for the eyes to fly around wherever you go, its makes you dream away. Controls are in general improved quite a bit, i just feel like the simple formula for taking out bases has become a better experience, the grappling hook is much smoother to use, deploying the parachute feels quicker and more reliable. The negatives i can find is that at times its too easy, you can soak so much damage from bullets, and will pretty much never die from a single fall. But multiple falls are the biggest danger. Also the game seems to be poory optimized, and some AMD users are completely unable to play. Unfortunate launch, i hope it gets fixed. I am on pretty low settings with a gtx960, but the game is still super beautiful, so dont think playing on low will reduce the enjoyment. The lack of multiplayer (so far) is also a bit of a downer considering JC2's multiplayer mod was such a success, but there have been mentions of multiplayer possibly getting a release. This game would benefit sooo much from multiplayer its crazy, i really hope it will happen at some point. Seriously, its one of those games where messing about alone is great fun, but messing about on a map with hundres of people everywhere with similar mindsets, oh god its great.I definitely recommend the game, but if you are looking for a meaningful story, or realistic gameplay it is definitely not the choice. If you have a creative mind, and can make yourself laugh easily then its a must get.			"

												So much damn fun!  If you even remotely enjoyed Just Cause 2's openness and ability to let you create wanton chaos (or you just like sandbox, open-world games), you will ADORE Just Cause 3.The best part of the game:  the tethering system.  The tethers are the star of the show, allowing you to do ridiculous things like tying people to cars, pulling helicopters into the ground, pulling cars into helicopters, pulling enemies into each other, destroying chaos objects, destroying full bridges, pulling your character to locations or into enemies... there's just so much you can do with them that even after dozens of hours, I was still blown away by how useful and fun they were.  You actually have control of them now, too, so you can connect multiple things and pull them all together with the pull of the left trigger.The physics are very well done and play a huge role in the game along with adding to the hilarity of whatever chaos you can create.  A lovely addition is the 'satchel charges' which you basically have an infinite supply of but can only have a maximum of 5 out at a time.  These can be modified to have a rocket effect which you can imagine can create some hilarious moments.  They're also very useful if you've run out of ammo and your tether might not be strong enough yet to take down bigger chaos object.  Attach a few charges, activate, and you're set.Many people gripe about the challenges to unlock mods but honestly, the tethers are what I recommend maxing out (which is easy to do).  The other mods really just give you a few additional grenades or other things that, to me, weren't worth the effort.  Honestly, I think some of the mods were actually worse than the default (I preferred to NOT have homing grenades).Driving in the game is horrible but I spent about 90% of my time traveling through the air either by helicopter (which control fine) or by tethering and parachuting/wingsuiting.Map is HUGE but only the towns and bases are interesting.  I would wager that about 80% of the map is just filler with absolutely nothing interesting to do or see.Despite my gripes, the game is an absolute blast.  If you enjoy physics in your games combined with a buttload of tools to create satisfying, non-stop destruction and explosions, this game was made for you.  The developers succeeded in creating an incredibly fun sandbox that lets the player use their intuition and imagination to create their own fun.			"

												First of all, I would like to start out saying that I've never ever played a Just Cause game before, and therefore my experience of the franchise is only from this iteration of the game.Now, where to begin...This game delivers something that I've never really tried before. An open sandbox world, with vast amounts of different challenges and cities to capture, leaving the player with endless possibilites of what to do.It took me a while before I even started on the main quest of the game, since I enjoyed the grappling around Medici and the extremely cool flight suit, which I have not yet fully mastered!The main mission, even though I found it quite short, is awesome and exciting all the way through. The propaganda radio station that pops up every time you capture one of the millitary, voiced by the 10th Doctor, David Tennant, were pretty hilarious, especially as he becomes more and more manic as you get control of more bases. I have yet to discover everything in this game, and I'm already 20+ hours into the game. Therefore I gotta say that this is a must buy if you enjoy blowing up stuff, and just going on a rampage with all kinds of crazy weapons, helicopters, tanks and planes. However, I felt that sometimes that the game could get a little repetitive, especially when going around eliminating different bases, but that could just be my own wrong doing. There were also a few glitches in the game, at least on my end, which I've chopped down to my pc not being the most powerful out there, so I'm gonna let those slide.All in all I will give this game a 9/10.

												If you like massive open world games, contsant explosions, flying, driving, parachuting, grappling, this is the game for you!! What i found great about this game is you can do whatever you like and the physics are very well done with grappling and driving. Also great selection of cars, planes, bikes, boats, helis etc. I like the feature where you can rebel drop all the vehicles and also weapons. reminds me of GTA cheats where you could spawn items. Big negatives for me were terrible story line, just so band and not funny like they try to make it. Also becomes the most repetitive, never ending game as its so big. I began to get sick of trying to get gears and taking over the provinces become very tedious. I only reccommend this game as its great for mucking around on and having a bit of fun, but if your looking for a game with a great story and side missions, do not bother with this.			"

												If you liked Just Cause 2, you will like Just Cause 3. It's simple really; it works like drugs. If you like Cocaine, you will probably like weed. And yes I made a drug reference for a reason, becasue you will be sucked in and loose your social life and your girlfriend (if she is real or imaginary does not matter). As for the actual game, they basically took everything that was in Just Cause 2 and made it better, and took out anything that was bad or anoying. I have played for a decent amount of time, and I have yet to find anything bad with the game. Well, almost.By now you have probably heard that it plays horrible on PC, and that was true. They have now patched it, but it still eats ram like its playing a game of hungry hungry hippos all the time. But I have faith that that will be patched in the not to distant futre. If I have not said it enough already, ill say it again. I love this game, and I definatly recomend getting it for yourself. For its price, you get a lot of bang for your buck, which is good, because you won't be getting any bang out of your girlfriend.  "

												Im glad steam gives refunds. This game is NOT worth $60. I purchased it thinking it was going to be awesome to cause mayhem, but after logging in and doing that for an hour, it got really boring. The quest line didn't hook me either, it felt dull. Sure, you can blow things up and grapple people to cars, but after you do that you realize there are other games with a lot more depth for $60.			"

												Spoiler: Just Cause 3 ran just fine for me. This is in December 2016, so presumably after patches and improvements, and on a decent system. Sorry if you had issues. I will admit it crashed more than I liked, but relatively speaking (maybe ten crashes over 42 hours?) it wasn't the worst ever.Short version of this review: buy this, especially if you can also get the DLC included, and especially if you enjoyed Just Cause 2. It's more of the same, but prettier, faster and with bigger explosions - and a slightly better story.As in the previous two, you're Rico Rodriguez, 'professional badass', 'King of the Rebels' and 'real life superhero' as the population of Medici keep reminding you when you're stood still for a second. As in the previous two your signature grappling hook and parachute combo is back, now joined by immediately indispensable wingsuit, which makes moving over the lush terrain even more enjoyable than before. It also opens up an entirely new category of challenges, which have you swooping and diving over terrain like a maniac.With the wingsuit, the weaponry and of course the huge list of vehicles, in many ways Just Cause 3 feels like Far Cry 3 (or 4) in third person, which is no bad thing. Like those games you have a huge open world to explore, although commendably it's almost all open to you at the start. Perhaps unwisely, with the exception of the rising 'heat' level you get as soon as you even look funny at the military, the difficulty level across the island doesn't vary too much. At least it makes sense. Is that a giant military base stuffed with guns and things to blow up? It'll probably be harder to tear down than a remote guard post with a couple of fuel tanks.Either way, with an unlimited supply of retries and cash (well, beacons to summon stuff; cash is completely gone in JC3, which just encourages you to wreak more havoc) it's only a matter of time before you'll destroy everything you need to and finish things off. Almost like clockwork, in fact; like so many other 'AAA' open world titles, it took me about 40 hours to finish the main story and pick up almost all of the collectibles. Great value, then, with an enormous island left to tool around afterwards.Inevitably I've got to compare JC3 to JC2, which I've played through a couple of times and enjoyed a lot. JC3 is streamlined in a few places, for example reducing 'hacking' to a timed button press and removing the ability to 'dodge' (which did always feel a little dumb). Conditioned by 60 odd hours in JC2, at first I missed my implausible rolling and leaping to avoid gunfire, but before long I realized the intention: always be moving. More than JC2 you're reliant on the hook/parachute/wingsuit combo here, and to stay alive as long as possible you need to grapple, soar and chute your way to safety, then come back fighting seconds later. Your only restriction is ammo, but even that's plentiful between the bodies and the resupply points. I rarely got frustrated and always enjoyed Rico's improbable antics.Overall, while it doesn't feel significantly different than Just Cause 2, Just Cause 3 is a fantastic open world experience and a great progression forward. With better writing, more interesting missions and more to do, this truly brings Avalanche Studios up to a new level. I'm hoping to see more from Rico, or even something entirely new using their open world expertise (Mad Max is a must play from the same team!).			"

												To make a long story short, I played JC2 a lot and, at the time of its release, I considered it to be a technical masterpiece. Right from the moment it when live, the game was almost perfect. Now, this is a different story for JC3. What most people report; bad PC porting, graphical glitches, disconnection issue with the online features, poorly put together story, etc... are all, sadly, true.It feels like the game lack polishing. Buy it only when heavily discounted (>=75%). Gameplay is still great but not as special as in the JC2 era... Perhaps  new comer to the series won't mind.I am going to rate this negatively mainly for the lack of interest for the developer to fix PC porting problems and for the high retail price.			"

												Wow, heh, this game is... ♥♥♥♥in good.Remember how you had to unlock♥♥♥♥♥♥from the black market in just cause2, like guns, cars, etc? Well that system has been completely revamped. Now, instead of getting higher chaos scores, you need to bring the cars to these little garages, which are in every town. However! There's a little more to it. Remember how you had to smash everything in an army base in just cause 2 to liberate it? Well, in 3, you have to liberate little towns scattered across the map as well.Speaking of little towns! The map is split up into 3 islands, and within each island there are provinces, which have 1 big military base and a few out posts and towns. Liberating all the bases and towns will make the province rebel controlled. Now, you can't bring all cars and boats and choppers to a garage. Some of them you need to unlock from liberating bases. Others might be hidden ones, like the ww2 plane. To unlock the hidden vehicles, you must collect relics from across the map.It's incredibly fun, but not worth 60 dollars. Buy on sale.Happy gaming :)			"

												Using tethers to torture people in game is fun, but it gets boring after a while. Too few main missions. Map is large and that is great but gets really boring after you explore it a while. Mountains, mountains and more mountains. It seems like the game is more meant for landscape exploring and mountain climbing. Cities and villages are awfully small and don´t have anything interesting to find or explore. If you are a fan of Just Cause series, then it is a good buy, but if you have never played JC before and this is your first one in the series, I believe you will be disappointed a bit.			"

Might be because I'm using Intel cpu and Nvidia gfx. No slowdowns and everything is maxed out, gtx970, windows 10, intel 2770k, nothing too briliant in the hardware dept.The game is gorgeous, always loved the water and the scenery in this game and this is no less disappointing. Got to get to grips with the controls as yet but most things are second nature in using the parachute and jumping around etc. Going to have lots of fun in this one.			"

You do not really have freedom to upgrade what you want and when.Otherwise, all out fun game.  Pick up, mess around, loose hours doing so!			"

												Ridiculously broken at the moment for me, (R9 270X & Athlon 750K  8GB RAM) but tuns at a decent framerate. Only like half the worlds polygons load in.But I've played 10+ hrs like that and enjoyed all of it so it's quite good to me. It's essentially and updated JC2, more refined and some cool new things added.I reccomend the game, assuming that AMD/Avalanche get it together and patch the issues.12/20/15:Both AMD and avalanche released patches, and the game functions normally now, runs pretty well on my rig with settings somwhere between medium and high. Loading times are not so great for me however, I have the game stored on a 7200 RPM SATA drive, and I usually have to load for about a minute for everything, except the initial startup, which is more like 4 minutes. Not a huge deal, but it seems like the kind of problem an older game would have.Just beat the story and liberated everything, except for 3 settlements that I can't find, and don't seem to belong to a province.I can say I enjoyed the game, and I would reccomend it, however for 60$, I don't feel the content is diverse enough for the price. Each town you liberate is pretty much the same, there are a few types of military bases, but not many. There are so many of these that it kind of becomes a chore, and more so once you figure out how to destroy stuff the easiest.Another issue; in JC2, my favorite part was foing to and from missions, which isn't the case in this game, because my favorite way to get around was by eingsuit and fast travel, since the driving physics were bizzare to me. While you're in the air, the only things that makes traveling interesting are trees and mountains. By interesting I mostly mean difficult. As a whole however, I quite liked wingsuiting around Medici.As many people talked about around release time, the game world is huge, but the content is just spread out, making it somewhat artificially large. This doesn't bother me a whole lot, considering it's more reason to use the wingsuit, but it was something that I definately noticed throughout the game. Story is aggressively mediocre, but it didn't bother me at all. Everything is cheesy and over the top, whih is fun, but don't expect anything to wow you or interest you greatly.Graphics are fanastic, possibly the nicest looking game I've played, considering not jsut textures and polygons, but colors and art. Very pretty game.Overall I'd give it a hearty recomendation if you're willing to grind through liberatiing everything, and if you don't mind a cheesy story.			"

												Just Cause 3. Cool game, nothing innovative or drastically new.  The graphics dont seem so nice at times especially when the sun is gone (looks like its missing shadows and ambient occlusion), the performance is not very good and definately needs some patching. Nevertheless the proven gameplay mechanics make this an action packed adventure with extreme over the top stunts and physics that will make your jaw drop or provoke a giggle or two. I would reccomend it, but you could definately wait until the price drops or the first performance patches are out.			"

												This is an update on a previous negative review i made at release. My biggest gripes with the game lied in its crappy pc framerates and general performance. Since, there has been 1 big patch and it nearly doubled my fps. The game is fairly enjoyable now but there is still freezing for a solid 2 seconds in some areas and still unacceptable frame drops. Generally though, the performance on my GTX 760 (2 GB) has been largely improved, with work needed to be done.                 About the game itself, its so much fun. I had a friend over and we played it for several hours and we have never had so much fun playing a game. The controls are great for the vehicles and character movement and the destruction that you can cause makes the enviroment feel less synthetic. There is nothing like wing suiting away from a massive explosion like a badass :3Easy recommendation from me if you have a beefy pc.			"

												This game has some problems. Rampant performance issues (I can't get above 40 fps in combat on a 960, on lowest settings, game crashes every now and then, etc.) that frankly shouldn't be tolerated from a game as big as this, less UI tweaks than I would like, such as the removal of an FOV slider, and a frankly stupid online leaderboard that you can't turn off (unless you go offline on steam), and extends loading times (I haven't experienced ♥♥♥♥♥♥ loading times but that might be due to the game being on my SSD).This is however, a massive improvement upon Just Cause 2. It's not the story (frankly, if you're playing a Just Cause game for the story, you're playing it wrong) although that has been improved somewhat, but it's the beauty and versatility that this game offers to the player. The wingsuit alone adds tons of exciting gameplay, not to mention the unlimited C4, customizability of perks, and extraordinary graphics. Rico Rodriguez has been fully visualized in this game, and thank god for it, because this has made this game tons of fun.However, despite this, this game might not be for you. The challenges, for me, are great, but I can see how they could get stale after a while of playing. The destruction of bases could get boring if you don't try new things, and simply plant C4, jump, and explode.If you've hopped on the hype train and think that this game will be the game to end all games, it isn't for you. You're going to be let down, and probably will want a refund. But if you want a game that can show you what the Just Cause games are capable of, I highly reccomend it. Although maybe wait a while until patches fix those performance issues.			"

												From my many hours playing this game over the last week, I can say that this is truly an excellent game. The world is gorgeous, the explosions are jawdropping, and the vehicles are awesome. The addition of the wingsuit makes exploring JC3's vast and vibrant world an exhilirating and epic experience, and the story is actually pretty good! The time you can spend on this game and not get bored is incredible. From liberating towns, blowing up gigantic radio towers, or unlocking fun new abilities, I never found myself without entertainment. For those of you who are hesitant to buy because you heard countless reports of crashes and bugs on the internet (especially for PC owners with an AMD graphics card), hesitate no longer. I have played at least 10 hours of the game (on a PC with an AMD graphics card) and I have had literally not a single problem with the game. THIS IS AN AMAZING GAME. BUY IT.			"

												Some of the controls are a bit different from the last Just Cause, which I loved so much. Vehicle control is a little harder as well (I'm looking at you, planes.) The destruction, the fun, the challenges. I loved it so much. The new mechanics for the wingsuit. 90% of the time I'm on a wingsuit, like damn. More convenient than a helicopter ride. lol			"

												I'll admit the game doesn't run terribly well at all for me even with settings turned down but Just Cause 3 is still spectacular. Stunning visuals, new weapons and a wingsuit await Rico Rodriguez as he sets out to liberate his homeland of Medici. The game pretty much improves on everything iffy in Just Cause 2 except for the fact that there's no health bar or mini-map, but that can be excused once you start causing some chaos. Oh, there's a Formula 1 car that you can drive, too. It's great.Overall, a lovely game which really does define the word fun.			"

												well, to begin with i feel like this game is lacking content after beating the entire game in only 50 hours(50 hours of a lot of fun) this includes collecting all of the collectibles and playing all challenges to 4-5 gears this game was basically a joke like there's not nearly as many bases/ towns to take over as jc2 which i have over 100 hours in and still havent captured all of them.... the new mechanics and all are cool like the wingsuit, ge 64 explosives, and tethers (barvarium nukes OP) and being able to destory every bridge in the game while an amazing game its just lacking in the ""plenty of things to do"" area which is why this is a negative review....speaking of which the Xl version which my brother bought is a complete waste because its only cosmetic items which i find stupid. maybe if there's an actual expansion i might buy it...maybe ill update this as i think of more things to say about this game. Edit 1: i had no frame rate issues after i updated my drivers the night i got it dual r9 290's and 4770K 16 Gb of ramEdit 2: the di ravello tapes are completely pointless unless your into cosmetic items (a golden helicoptor....Yay)Edit3: the shrines are also pointless because they give free fast travel but once youve captured everything you can fast travel anywhere anyway... soo like whut.Edit4: this review is continuing to grow i modded the game( not those in game ""mods"") no something OP like infinite ammo and decided to re oppress the area that like rains nukes on you until you do the mission to disable them i have to say that was a lot of fun with infinte ammook so my final thing to say about this game is while its not terrible and the hours that ive spent were a lot of fun i quickly ran out of things to do. while yes you can re-oppress places its just not a good as it was the first time around its not rewarding buy it if you like the just cause series but be weary you may be disappointed			"

												Alot of people complain about the controls and how bad they are. I think that those people wrote their revews about 30 mins into the game. For the first time, I am going to write an actual revew for my faverate game of all time.Driving: Alot of people dont like the driving in the game, and when I first started playing, I didnt eather. But now, I really like it. It gives alot more control over your movements compared to jc2, but will take a while to get used to. So instead of just not driving like I did for a long time, practice and learn the movement and the feel of the cars.     Cars: The nitres you can get for cars is a huge thing that I always thought jc2 was m,issing, and it makes the game so much more fast paced, and the turbo jump lets you get most other cars without swerving to miss them, which can make driving much easyer too.     Motorbikes: As far as bikes go, I personaly dont like to use them, not because of their control, just because their jumping is not as high as cars, but their control is ok, the turning is a bit strange though, where if you just went left and you want to go right, rico has to begin to lean right before he turns right, but after that, he just turns right untill you want to go left.     Boats: I really like the boats in this game, expecaly the mecanic it has where if you are stranded at sea, boats will spawn around you so you han steal them. As for the controls, they are as you would expect. The turning takes a little bit and you must be on the water for it to turn, but they are a very small part of the game.     Planes: In all games, I love to fly, but at first, the flying really put me off for a while. The planes have 2 ways of turning; the ""spin and pitch up/down"" and rudder control, where the whole plane turns. The spining is a bit strange and I have goten used to it, but to use it you need to really learn it, dont just hop in and expect to fly perfect first try.      Helecopters: The heles in the game are not really looked at as ""mobility"" but ""weponry"" they are made as air controled guns that do alot of damage, but dont move particualy fast.Wepons: This is a bit of a strange subject, as I am very torn on them. On one hand I like how you can get them so easly and freely, but on the other hand, they all feel almost ""too"" strong. With most of the guns, it takes only a few shots to kill  the weaker enemys. Overall, I think it is something that very much helps you as you do have to fight 3 wars so I think I'll give it a tick of approval.Grapple: This is the part of Just Cause that everybody knows and loves, and jc3 has not at all disapointed. Not only has the grapple mecanics been revamped, where when you where stuck on the botem of something you had to graple again, but now you can 'fling' yourself off it, but now you can attatch object together and pull them together. This makes the game so much nicer to use and control, ecpecaly when trying to steal a car as you can stick it to the ground and stop it.Wingsuit: The big thing of jc3, my faverate feature. The wingsuit is not something that is 'easy' to use. It will requier some using to understand how it works and the right feel to the movement, but once to do figur it out, it is the most rewarding feeling when you just wingsuit through a whole city like a boss, passing all the builings at the speed of light.Story: I am not going to give an overvew for the story as it is too hard to put into words, I am just going to explain the key features.     Charecters: The charecters that you meet in the game are all so well made. From Mario to Di revelo to just the people, they all are just really well made people. The rebels (you) will get into your cars if you honk at them to help you out, and Di revelo is a charecter who you really get to understand through his tapes you find across the land. Overall, I just love the way they are all put together and made to just work.     Missions: I never liked how in jc2 you had to wait forever to get another mission, and alot of the side quests were quite borring, but in jc3, you always have a mission to do. After you finish a mission, you instantly have a new one to do, and instead of side quests, you have encounters where you have a little objective to do, like get a boat in the water and take a car the the gas startion, and ones for the rebles like take someone in a plane to a location or steal a limo and get infomation from a Di revelo informant.Stunts: I am not talking about landing cars on a train when I say 'stunts', I mean the stunt position. In jc2, you could only be in 1-3 places on any car, and only 1 on planes, but in jc3, you can walk all over them and attack from the best position. On the cago plane you can grapple from wing to wing and walk around to the back of it and enter the cago bay from the front hatch. Just amazing.Races and gears: I am working on my 100% of jc3, which means I have to get 5 gears on every chalenge, so I can say that they are very well made. Most of the time you will get at least 3 gears on a chalenge, but to get the full 5, you need to get a really good go at them and really know the track. Every gear that you get will help you get 'gear mods' which give you new abilitys, like c4 rocket booters, or the nitres and turbo jump.DLC: Before this game, I had never bought DLC, then I saw the air, land and sea pack, and I had to get it. It adds a whole bunch more missions, a whole air base, a new island, a wole lot of wreked buildings and♥♥♥♥♥♥is the sea, alot of new guns, 2 mechs, a new powered wingsuit and a god damn lightning gun! It might be a bit expensive, but if you see it on sale, just get it, you will not be disapointed in it. You get so much more amazing content and youget to play it within mabey 30 minets of getting into the game, and doesent disrump the rest of the game at all.Overall, I would recomend this game to anyone who can run it, you will not be disapointed in it at all.

												Honestly, I can't recommend this.I'd like to start by explaining that I do like this game. The destruction, the weapons, wingsuiting, crashing planes into bases, it's all a blast, but there are some issues.Despite everything you can do, there's not really that many new things to keep you interested after ~10 hours. Most of the villages are similar and they end up feeling like a chore after a while. The smaller military bases  and oil rigs are also pretty same-y, which usually just ends with you spamming helicopter missiles from afar to get it over with. That being said, it's fun in medium bursts (about 5 hours in a week), but you'll get bored and have to take a break after that.This kind of relates to the previous point, but the map feels a little empty and as a result you'll get bored quick. It's certainly big and there are certainly lots of things in it, but a lot of it still has nothing to do. There are ruins and some structures outside of bases/villages, but at most you'll find a collectible, and usually they're just empty.The upgrades, probably the best addition to the game, are locked behind challenges. This wouldn't be too bad but most of the challenges aren't that great, and there are way too many. Wingsuiting through wings is fun the first 3 times, but 25 times? No thanks. Also, some of the challenges just plain old suck. The driving in the JC games has never been good (in fact, it's pretty bad), so why would I want to do 14 driving challenges? This really hurts the game, because a lot of the upgrades are fun but it feels like a grind to unlock them.The biggest issue of all, the performance. I'm lucky to have a powerful computer, and I can barely run this above 30fps on minimum settings. I know I'm not the only person with these issues, and  I can't imagine someone with a weaker rig being able to run this at all. This is the real nail in the coffin for my recommendation, the game would be passable if people could actually run it, but 5 months and 3 DLC packs later, it doesn't seem like it's going to be fixed any time soon.tl;dr: Game is alright but it fails to add enough new content to keep you invested for a long period of team. This coupled with the horrific performance issues make it a no from me. "

												Hey Rico, wanna go bowling? No wait, that's the wrong game..I haven't played the previous Just Cause games but can say this one is the ultimate fooling around open world playground.(+)- Once a few gadgets are unlocked, you're pretty much free to do whatever the want and in whatever way you want. Some will look very cool, other very cheesy. Pick what you like!- Big map with a lot to do.- You can crash face first on a mountain and still live to tell the tale.- You can drive a tractor and still look badass!(-)- Some crashes and graphical bugs to be expected and never fixed by the devs.- The content can be a bit repetitive.- The story is very meh.If you're just looking to have fun doing ridiculous stuff while liberating islands and don't care much about storytelling, then go for it. Not the best open world game but still ok!Ribbit!			"

												Okay, after some more hours of playing this game I have to say getting past the stuttering, the dropping, and the audio skipping, this game is still really freakin' fun. Just, for the love of explosions, if you want to truely enjoy this game, make sure you meet the minimum requirements.  ""But Wrecked, what makes it fun if you are chugging so bad?"" Simple, the mechanics. Being able to tether a giant fuel tower to a destroyable concrete wall and then blow them both up so rebels can rush in is one of those moments you cannot get in a game. Wingsuiting from island to island while blowing up bridges to shake off pursuers, not possible in any other game. Being able to pull a boat from the ocean to a garage in town, its a rewarding challange all in it's own.  Just Cause 3 is what Just Cause 2's predecesor should be. It took what it had and made more of it in every way it could. Taking over towns now has a purpose and that's gaining territory and unlocking secret item locations. Challanges give mod parts which is more than an achievement to pin on your Steam profile. Overthrowing towns is just ""blow up everything that's red"" and not a painfull treasure hunt, and they toss hints your ways towards the end of takeovers for the last few things to blow up because lets be honest, who the hell likes to run around an above ground/undergound base for 20 minutes finding one satelite dish?  Medeci is one giant beautiful playground made just for rage-induced destruction and it does it well, and even when you aren't being Senior McBad***, the game is breath taking. Slow it down, get in a sedan and just drive. Observe the countryside while the spanish guitar strums away at your eardrums. There was love put into this game, and a lot of it. We all just need a little push to fully enjoy it.8/10 It's a damn good game, but those requirements will kill any budget build.Original Review:tl;dr Time to upgrade.   I'm sorry. I really am sorry, but this game is the first game to make my rig outdated. I can run GTA 5 on High, I can run Mad Max on Ultra, and I can run ArmA 3 on Very High. This game has been the first game to make my computer say ""Sorry buddy, I can't run this. Have a bowl full of lag."" I can understand this being a push to upgrade to some newer better equipment, but as of now I can't give this game a good review.			"

												it is a Just Cause game, a beatiful looking one! and they took a lot of aspects that needed to be corrected from JC2 and made them great. Pros:-a reasonable amount of collectables, settlements to free and vehicles to collect.-the ability to create chaos in almost unlimited ways-the season pass (at least the content that has been released so far)Cons:-rather short main story BUT the story from Sky fortress is really a nice addition so if they keep that up the season pass will make up for the lack of story in the main game. still a con since you need to buy the season pass to get a fun story-almost to many challenges but it is still okall in all it is a great game where you can have a lot of fun and i recommend it.

												This is the most fun I've had with a game in a long while.  I generally stay away from third-person shooters, and somehow I missed that this was a third-person game when I bought it.  But after giving it a chance, I can see why the game was made this way -- it really does make for a better experience, and it works well the way it was constructed.I have a pretty new machine, and I am not experiencing any problems playing the game as others have said, except for one thing: my keyboard mapping periodically gets over-written.  (You can solve this by just copying your keyboard map file, so it isn't a huge issue, but I digress.)One very surprising thing about this game for me was how well almost everything in the world blows up.  The physics on destroying things and soldiers really is fun and allows you to use your imagination in your destruction.  At first I didn't like how some things give infinite missiles and bombs, but I think it turns out more fun this way.  I really like that you aren't penalized for destroying civilians, and in some cases it's hilarious (""Rico! You could have just asked for my car!"")Once you figure out how to use your cables for destruction and moving around... well, for me there was no turning back!  I'm now in the middle of my second go-around with this game, and still having loads of fun with it.  I definitely recommend: Get this game.			"

												I bought this game back when it first released so I've had it for a good while. When it first released there were no performance issue's for me. However since the last 2 patches there has been a very big memory leak with this game. When I launch the game it sometime's load's in very slow or just come's to a halt on the loading screen's. When it eventually load's up I am faced with mass-stuttering. I have investigated and I have found that my GPU is not responsible and neither is my CPU. I have found that this game literally suck's up over 16GB of my RAM. Also it uses literally all of my paging file as well. When I kill teh game in Task manager the memory that was used by the game is still in use. I have to restart to free-up the memory that was used by the game. So far I have not been able to rectify this issue myself which is a shame because I have clocked up a lot of hour's and I can't finish the game because it is not unplayable. It's one thing for a game to release with massive performance issue's like this, but for it to happen down the line is unacceptable. I hope that in the near future these issue's will be solved. For this reason I cannot recommend this game to anyone because it might just happen to be unplayable for you as well. I will also list my spec's at the bottom for reference purpose's.As people have said previously that the developer's keeping pushing out DLC but seem to be doing nothing to rectify this memory leak issue.Other than the performance issue's it's an enojyable game to play. You can play the game how you see fit and just cause chaos.i7 4790K 4.4GhzMSI 980 4GB GE16GB 2500Mhz			"

Whilst it runs fine when working, the constant crashes on multiple systems (as others are experiencing) really takes away from the experience. I'm hoping for myself and others having these issues that patches are released to amend these problems.If you get lucky, then enjoy the game whilst it's working.			"

												I thoroughly recomend this game to anyone that has the gear to run it!It is well worth your money and then some! You can spend countless hours just goofing around,some people call it grinding. But they are playing the game wrong. You don't have to go from base to base toliberate everything. Take your time, do some races, some flying, some missions, some rebel dropping, exploring, etc.This game is gorgeous, and the fact that you can get around so easy with the wingsuit is fantastic!I really enjoyed Just cause 2 aswell, but they've really gone a step up with this release!I haven't encountered any of the problems the negative reviews mention.The cars drive just fine! (depending on the car offcourse) the tethering hooks are great!I haven't experienced any bugs, nor have i had a single lag spike. (that given, I have a decent gaming rig)To be honest, i don't know about the story, i've been skiping most of it... But that's just out of excitement to get back in the action, fly around, do another challenge to level your gear...Though i do really enjoy the missions the game gives me. At times you might feel ""overpowered"" but some of the missions will set you straight.Anyway as i said, If you have a decent rig, that can run this game flawless, and you like action games, loads of explosions, flightsuits, grappling hooks, tethering fun, jumping out of airplanes etc etc etc Then get this game! And give it a possitive review, because it absolutely deserves better then a ""mixed"" average! "

Summary:A seemingly common issue, this explosion-filled open world action-adventure's fairly severe performance issues on some systems can be fixed by forcing /borderless /fullscreen in the game's Steam command line. Despite its fairly poor optimisation and forced online, this game took Just Cause 2 and improved on many of that game's aspects, especially in terms of visuals and game mechanics (most notably the wingsuit), and as such, it's a fun title to play around with for a while. Yet gameplay outside the story quickly becomes repetitive and lacklustre, and the flawed Rebel Drop system severely limits the player from creativity, particularly early-game. As such, this game is only worth the price when on sale, and Just Cause 2 will undoubtedly give more entertainment in the long-term - for a much lower price.Rating:1 - A masterpiece. An essential purchase for everyone.2 - Great game. Highly recommended to most people.3 - Fairly good game. Recommended mainly for fans of the genre or when on sale.4 - Poor game. Not recommended but has a few merits.5 - Awful game. Would not recommend to anyone in their right minds.			"

												So i bought this for half price and playing through it felt like something I just wanted to get over with so I could install a proper game afterwards. Just Cause 2 was crazy in its own right, but it had its moments and was enjoyable.Pros:All the destruction can be quiet enjoyable once in a while.Cons:The gunplay is awful.The missions are repeatative(follow these pipes Rico).The liberation towns and bases are just repeats, its a reminder of doing mini missions in Assassins Creed over and over, you've tried it before and this one is not fun once its outside of a vehicle.The game likes to alert you with a beeping sound that your close to dying, it likes doing this while you are stuck in one of the games irretating animations where you have to wait for Rico to get up while everyone around him kills him.The cast in the game (especially Mario) are all annoying as hell and I found myself hoping Mario died during a mission but he sadly got well.The ending, yeah its bad and just cuts you short gives you a clap on the back and throws you into the sandbox. No explaination, no cutscene no enjoyment.If the game was more willing to permit you to your own fun, it would have been a lot more enjoyable.			"

												Brilliant game and great gameplay, however small world with gaps. I felt that the map was small in comparison to Just Cause 2. The new wingsuit is great but makes travelling quicker which influnces that. Also, there seems to be a lack of places. I've played 40 hours and have libarated the first two islands. In Just Cause 2, I have 55 ish hours and have only 30% completion after story.  Also, there's a lack of different biomes which Just Cause 2 excelled at. There is a lot of jungle areas and plains and little of the others. It could just be me but the snow biome felt like just a mountain whereas Just Cause 2 was huge in comparison. The game feels repetitive with lack of variety in the civilizations. Even with this, the game is brilliant and has many interesting mechanics. I would recommend this to any big fan of Just Cause 2 as the new features are great fun. A new player to the series? I would maybe try Just Cause 2 first as that's cheaper and still brilliant or wait for a sale.			"

												So far have spent 25 hrs in this game, beat the story @ 20 hrs. This is the first Just Cause I have played, also my setup is an i5 4590, gtx 970 ssc, 8GB ram, HDD, 1080p monitor. Have a few pro's and cons I want to mention.ProSuper fun as far as just causing pure havoc with a wide variety of tools. (hehe, ""just causing"")Good variety of side challengesGood variety of weapons from pistols/rifles/rpgs/nuke launchersWingsuit/tethering/parachute mechanic is great, easy to get use to. Makes it really fun getting around the map in the early stages.I particularly enjoyed the leaderboard aspect of the game, whenever it popped up I took it as a small challenge; however, I have good internet, so I can see where that might be a con to some even though the game does offer an offline mode.Settlements can be taken over using a variety of tactics, from lots of explosions and guns, to lots of tethering and flying around.Relatively large map.ConTake-overs are very cookie cutter. The only challenge is the number of chaos objects you have to destroy to get the base/settlement. Once you know how to neutralise the defenses, you pretty much control how challenging you want it to be.Vehicles are very OP, once you get ahold of something with a cannon/missiles, you're pretty much invincible if you learn how to drive it.You navigate 3 islands. 2 pretty small, 1 freaking enormous one. The giant island makes wingsuiting seem pretty slow after getting use to it for the previous locations.This game is moderately buggy. When exiting from challenges sometimes the screen will freeze until I hit the default exit button (ctrl). I experience ghosting during cutscenes and moderate frames drops/stuttering after ~1 hr. Vehicle controls are wonky. Planes rotate around the camera view and don't allow for good mouse control. Key mapping between helicopter/plane is independent except for one area, weapons. Found this out the hard way when I blew myself up upon taking off in a helicopter.Unnecessary total score system. (You blew up a tank! Yay here's some points that go to absolutely nothing!)Gear upgrades are assigned to certain challenges. (i.e. If you want to upgrade your tethers to the max, you better learn how to drive a vehicle well...with people shooting at you. Want more ammo for your RPG? Get more accurate with your pistols. Want to order more than one air drop? Learn how to fly.)Story missions are fun, plot is useless, but they need to be completed to get past certain points on the map.Has a lot of filler mechanics/challenges (i.e. sanctuary, shrines, tapes)OverallI would recommend this game to others. I got it on the winter sale for ~$40 which I would say is a fair price. The open sandbox still allows me to play it after beating it the story so I can still blow stuff up to my hearts content with greater and greater weapons.8/10 would dive into the side of a cliff again.

If you can't get connected to square enix's terrible servers, the game will forcefully pause the game every single time you check your map, start a mission, end a mission, or do anything remotely related to the UI so it can re-attempt to log you in for who the ♥♥♥♥ knows what reason. My guess is that competing with people online over scores such as most distance reeled in a single reel, most headshots in a row, and most explosions in X time period was so important to the game that the developers decided that everything else must be periodically halted so that these magnificient scores can be updated.If you are lucky enough not to have issues with the DRM, rest assured, there are other issues with the game. The controls for this game seem to be tailored especially for console users as moving the mouse around to look summons some sort of acceleration that is commonly used in games to assist console users as the control stick can't look around nearly as fast as a mouse can. This also seems to be the case when driving as when making a turn the car has some sort of lag effect before turning. Most of the time this causes an overshoot of the desired direction and then you need to steer the opposite direction which causes a rinse and repeat effect of overshooting again because no vehicle in the world operates like this at speeds less than 10mph.

												This is the most fun I've had with a game in a long while.  I generally stay away from third-person shooters, and somehow I missed that this was a third-person game when I bought it.  But after giving it a chance, I can see why the game was made this way -- it really does make for a better experience, and it works well the way it was constructed.I have a pretty new machine, and I am not experiencing any problems playing the game as others have said, except for one thing: my keyboard mapping periodically gets over-written.  (You can solve this by just copying your keyboard map file, so it isn't a huge issue, but I digress.)One very surprising thing about this game for me was how well almost everything in the world blows up.  The physics on destroying things and soldiers really is fun and allows you to use your imagination in your destruction.  At first I didn't like how some things give infinite missiles and bombs, but I think it turns out more fun this way.  I really like that you aren't penalized for destroying civilians, and in some cases it's hilarious (""Rico! You could have just asked for my car!"")Once you figure out how to use your cables for destruction and moving around... well, for me there was no turning back!  I'm now in the middle of my second go-around with this game, and still having loads of fun with it.  I definitely recommend: Get this game.			"

												One of the best open-world-sandbox games I’ve played.When I first picked this game up I had small expectations and thought that the game would get very repetitive really fast. But damn I was wrong.A lot of the negative reviews keeps saying the same thing. “It is repetitive and boring”. And sure you need to take control a massive amount of army bases and villages. But it is not about the amount of stuff you need to do, it is about HOW you do it.You can for example call in a military helicopter and completely devastate the army base from it. Or maybe you wanna recreate Miley Cyrus wrecking ball? Fear not! Just take a sturdy military helicopter. Connect some cars to your helicopter using wires. And BOOM! here you go, a chopper with 5+ cars attached = perfect wrecking ball.But you also need to take care of the animals and citizens who lives in the game. Maybe you see a lonely cow who just want to be left alone. Sneak up to it and when the cow, attach some minirockets 4+ to its buut. After that you can activate the mini rockets and see the cow fly so far away from you render distance that the cow suddenly stops being rendered.All of this gets 10 times more fun with each expansion since they offer so many new weapons, cars upgrades and more you can have fun with.

How much I recommend the gameI would only recommend this game if you really know what you're getting yourself into. I marked ""Yes"" because It was a fun game to play and I'm familiar with the series. While the game had its fair share of problems, if you're a fan of the series you'll enjoy yourself. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it is a downgrade from the sequel. If there was a ""mixed"" option, I would probably choose that instead. I purchased this game while it was 75% off, and I highly recommend that you do the same if you really want it.PerformanceIf you have a high end system, don't worry about the people complaining about memory leaks.I have 16GB RAM, GTX 1070, and Intel 6700k and experienced no real issues regarding memory leaks.However, that does not change the fact that the game was very glitchy. Enemies spawn in right before your eyes at times, physics glitches are not uncommon, and the game is generally unstable (in the lovable Just Cause sort of way). I will still able to maintain a consistently high frame rate despite this. I have crashed to desktop 1 time, and had to force close the game due to it locking up 2 times in my 24 hours of playing it, so it's really not all that bad.GameplayDrivingThey somehow managed to make the driving even worse than how it was in Just Cause 2. Once you get used to it, it's not so bad. Motorcycles are especially horrible to drive, you will never get used to them. The vehicles have a really strange momentum/weight to them, and it's very difficult to drive with a keyboard and mouse unlike in games like Grand Theft Auto 5 or Saint's Row. The driving mechanics also depend way too much on using your hand brake, and of course that is a pain since the controls are frustrating. Be prepared to not use your space bar for hand brakes. They also got rid of the Stunt Jump mechanic from Just Cause 2, which is a major disappointment. It's a lot harder to hijack cars and vehicles, and it's very frustrating trying to enter cars via grappling hook alone. Rico also has a very cool habit of only walking while on boats and planes. Since there is no more Stunt Jumping, this makes it very tedious and frustrating to actually enter the cockpit of boats and planes. In Just Cause 2, you could just press the Stunt Jump button to have Rico quickly and automatically grapple his way into position to enter a vehicle and drive it, but in 3 you have to actually walk over to the cockpit or car door for some reason.KeybindingThis game was clearly not optimized for PC. The game will never let you know about keybind conflicts, and with so many different keys and functions, things get very difficult to manage. I actually ended up binding ""contract tether"" to one of the rudder controls for air vehicles by accident and realized this halfway through the game. The game will also not let you know if chaning one bind for one control will change another. For example, if you want to change your parachute button while on foot to something else, this will in turn change your parachute and bail buttons for driving as well, and the game will not notify you of this. Also, there are many binds that are linked, such as jumping onto the roof of a car and bailing by parachute. The game will list these as separate binds although they will always be bound to the same button no matter what. This was one of the biggest annoyances of this game. The keybinding in Just Cause 2 was leagues better than this.General GameplayIt's repetitive, but such is the nature of Just Cause. However, since the story is lackluster, none of it really feels like it's worth it. Sure, it's fun to destroy bases and liberate towns at first, but then you start to realize the copy/paste nature of many areas in the game world, and the game starts turning into a chore. There are also many annoying parts of combat. Enemies with shotguns can temporarily stun Rico from quite long ranges for some reason. Also, hitting the ground while using a wingsuit is very annoying. No matter how fast you go, Rico will get stunned, unless you unlock the ability to retract your wingsuit when going slowly near the ground, which should have been a feature by default. Be sure not to get stunned while on a mountain or something, or else Rico will go into an uncontrollable tumble for an annoyingly long amount of time. The stun mechanics in the game are horrible and annoying. You will find yourself getting frustrated every time Rico falls over.There are also many challenges that you must do to upgrade tools and equipment, which also (surprise!) gets annoying quite quickly. By doing challenges, you earn ""gears"" which act as currency towards upgrades of different kinds. If you do a racing challenge you unlock gears for cars, gun challenges unlock gears for guns, and so forth. You actually have to unlock things like precision aiming, which should have been available from the beginning by default, and things like increased tethers, which should have been unlocked as the story progressed. A lot of the unlocks are also very underwhelming and were clearly meant to be filler/padding for the more interesting and useful upgrades. Oh, I unlocked the ability to get a supply drop faster? Wow, because they were sooo slow to begin with.StoryThe story was pretty nice, but the ending felt incredibly rushed. Things will be developing at a certain pace and then it will ramp up out of nowhere and end unexpectedly. The ending is unbelievably underwhelming compared to the ending of Just Cause 2. Spoilers: You don't end up fistfighting Baby Panay while riding a nuke. The game also lacks the charm of Just Cause 2. Just Cause 2 felt like a campy B-movie, and Rico felt like the stereotypical lead to that kind of movie, his voice actor fit the role perfectly. You could practically see him doing the sign of the cross after taking out baddies. Now, Rico is this rugged manly man with a new voice actor whom I'm not entirely fond of. Rico is still Rico, though. He's still out fighting for the greater good and trying to end corruption, taking the obvious moral high ground as always, and I love him for it. Just Cause 3 story-wise is basically Just Cause 2, but with less of the B-movie charm. It is nice to finally get some answers regarding Rico's past, as well as somewhat of a conclusion to it. I really enjoyed the setting and premise of the story, but felt that it was lacking in a few areas.ConclusionIf you want to just kill time with a game revolving around mindless action and chaos, and dont mind the occasional glitch and can stand mediocre controls, then go for it. It was fun to play but it could have been a lot better. If you haven't played Just Cause 2, I would HIGHLY recommend that you do before playing 3, it'll make you appreciate 3 a lot more.			"

												I did not experience technical issues.  I did experience a somewhat bland, but somewhat hilarious, sandbox game that fills a unique niche in the sandbox universe.  To be fair, I can't even remember its prequel to compare it to, because it, too, must have had the same flaws.This game is all about the grapple and stunts.  You can do a lot of fun, memorable stuff.  But, because of some design decisions and flaws, the gameplay doesn't feel spectacular or worthy of re-playing.1. The controls are not polished enough.  This is something most open-world games have a problem with, but when you're gliding and grappling around it's a huge pain point.  I found myself swearing as I flew into walls or got stuck under ledges.2. When you die, you just respawn where you left off. So you can basically liberate the whole map before doing any missions.3. New enemies spawn behind from all sides, making battles chaotic and not strategic in any way. This negates any use of the sniper rifle.4. Because of the lack of battle tactics, Rico is almost invincible, and so they didn't include crouching or cover because of this and the above point.5. Upgrades (or 'mods' as they call them) are mostly optional. They help a little, but not enough to make the game easier or feel rewarding.6. Most of the time, it was easier to glide/parachute/fast-travel rather than find a vehicle. Traveling got to be quite a shlep in the mountains.  The vehicles and attention to their detail are amazing but mostly superfluous.These points together contributed to a loss of enjoyment in gameplay.A typical attack on a military base involves parachuting around haphazardly and shooting missiles at targets.  This could have been much more fun if there were a stealth element, or 'level up' health/abilities before attempting, or both.The story has a lot of interesting characters who are never fully fleshed out.  Some side-missions with them would have been fun, or at least some more back-story.  I think maybe I was supposed to remember them from a previous game?Overall, the game is beautiful and fun, to an extent. The story isnt bad, but there's not enough of it to be fulfilling.  There is little replay value and gameplay gets repetitive quickly.  I'm left wishing I could go back into sandbox mode and have a good romp, but everything's liberated, and the battles weren't that fun to begin with.			"

												Alright, I have played this game for about 44 hours  and have to say it's a nice game if you like blowing stuff up and causing chaos and destruction. the map is insanely big but it's fun to have a map this huge, lot of things to explore, outposts to liberate, destroying entire airports and what not.There are a lot of collectibles to collect and I'd say if you really hunt em down (like I did) you probably have to spend about 5 to 7 hours in total to collect everything (used the fast travel a LOT) and you get nice stuff when you collect every collectible from a certain category, such as all Di ravelio's tapes or ancient tombs.Now this game is awesome, but there are a lot of things that do bug me. mostly known by now are the FPS drops, they are not that common, I'd say they are rare, at least for me (may depend on how beefy your pc is, I can say my pc exceeds the recommended system requirements by far so it doesn't bother me that much but still).Frequent crashes have made me (literally) smash my headset, when you're in the middle of a mission, and it happends to be a quite difficult one and you crash of all the sudden, you (or I at least) can get quite mad. especially if you have to take another route to avoid the point were it crashes your game every single time.Something else is the lock on feature in fighter jets, you have to disable the MOD (don't know the exact name rn) that let you aim better and restart your game before you can actually use lock on. something like that should not happen at all, I had to restart the mission where you have to protect Rosa Manuela's plane more than 10 times because of a not working lock on.All this seems like this game is bugged af, but it's not entirely. at the beginning it's difficult getting the hang of the new controls (especially going back with 'CTRL') and getting used to face planting 24/7. but after a while when you unlock new weapons and MODs for your tools, it gets soo much more fun. I personally am obsessed with the M488, a ♥♥♥♥ing rocket launcher, infused with bavarium to make your rockets go off like bloody nukes. I never had so much fun in any game before as I had with the M488.If you're into blowing up stuff hardcore, ready to die quite often (because of how hard it sometimes can be) and wanna wingsuit like a badass, and can deal with sudden fps drops. I highly recommend this game for you. if not, go and find another game where you can cause the same amount of destruction and still have fun			"

												The gameplay in the game is great, the game itself is broken AF. when i start up the game it starts lagging on the intro screen, it takes 5-10 min from when i start the game till i am actually playing the game. Even though on max settings i have +/- 85 FPS. Second probem with the game is that it ♥♥♥♥s up your sound, during and e few seconds after the loading screens finishes my sound gets al laggy and broken, not only the in game sound but also my TS starts lagging, i cant hear a single thing my friends are saying. Also it chrashes for no reason, but i havent had this problem to often.Conclusion: Dont buy this game untill it is fixed (if that ever even will happen) or at least wait till you can get it for like 15 euros.

												I haven't written a negative review yet so this might as well be my first, and i'm short on time so let's make it snappy.Extremely long wait at the main menu.Where sometimes the game will flood my RAM and spill onto my hard drives.The RAM continues to be used until i reset the PC.When i do waste enough time and the game finally loads it runs fine, besides constant stuttering.If you endure the stutter you'll have to also endure the terrible console FOV which can't be changed, the FOV Slider mod made by the community keeps breaking every patch.Speaking of patches, they don't seem to have any intention of fixing the problems everyone is having, they add more DLC instead.I bet the game is fun, but until it's fixed i won't play it, though enough time has passed with no word from publisher or developer so i wouldn't expect anything, DON'T PLAY THE CONSOLE VERSION EITHER, it has severe performance issues... A good job all around.			"

												Written from the point of view of someone who has played 123 hours of Just Cause 2 and would probably rank it in my top 5 games.JC3 is pretty fun. Pretty all as expected. It looks fantastic. I really like the better implemented destruction. Driving is feels a lot better than JC2. Being able to see on the map the things you need to destroy to complete a settlement is a life saver. Having unlimited plantable bombs makes a long session of destruction easier and means you don't mind using your rocket launcher or similar weapon more. The progression is more interesting than JC3 with you getting more abilities rather than just weapon hits harder. Couldn't imagine life without the wing suit now. But the main missions are dull af, very few highlights. Its mostly just 'escort' missions where you have to protect something, so its just adding a rule holding back your destructions. Just Cause 2's location feels more interesting than Medici; it has as snow, desert, forests, mountains and huge cities where medici only has forests, mountains, coastline (very pretty) and quarry areas. The challenges are pretty dull; Wing suit ones are alright but the destruction ones are again just adding rules to limit how you want to play. It feels like its missing one extra variable to really vary things up. And I'm not just talking about co op, but that would have been a great addition. JC3 is more of the same with a few improvements. If you found JC2 repetitive you probably won't get a lot out of JC3. For some reason I don't think I'll keep coming back like I did for JC2. So overall I did have a fair amount of fun with JC3, but it didn't blow my socks off as I was hoping.			"

BUT as everyone says: The fps drops from about 60 to 40 or even 30 and if you dont have a good comuputer/laptop you arent able to play this game. So in MY opinion I think this is worth buying.			"

												Best sandbox/open world game ever!!!I don't know what it is about just cause 2 and 3, but I can't get enough.The freedom to do what ever you want and blow up what ever you want is very appealing to me.The massive range of vehicles from air land and sea is so awesome.Great graphics and a huge world to explore.Can't wait to see what comes next in the future.Part 3 has really stepped things up a notch too and has improved on part 2 in so many ways.AAA+			"

												I haven't written a negative review yet so this might as well be my first, and i'm short on time so let's make it snappy.Extremely long wait at the main menu.Where sometimes the game will flood my RAM and spill onto my hard drives.The RAM continues to be used until i reset the PC.When i do waste enough time and the game finally loads it runs fine, besides constant stuttering.If you endure the stutter you'll have to also endure the terrible console FOV which can't be changed, the FOV Slider mod made by the community keeps breaking every patch.Speaking of patches, they don't seem to have any intention of fixing the problems everyone is having, they add more DLC instead.I bet the game is fun, but until it's fixed i won't play it, though enough time has passed with no word from publisher or developer so i wouldn't expect anything, DON'T PLAY THE CONSOLE VERSION EITHER, it has severe performance issues... A good job all around.			"

												I am seeing alot of negative feedback all saying it runs terrible, whether they are following the trend or I am lucky; I don't see the graphic glitches they speak of. Like any computer game, do not buy this title just because you meet minimum and expect it to wow you. I pick this up at a low price and since I played the second one I knew what to expect. I'd label it as a ""time filler"", running around blowing stuff up, grappling things are all things I'd throw on when bored.But that is the extent of it, story is not engaging at all. I found myself skipping cutscenes just to play, shooting needs work, whatever aim assist they have is dog♥♥♥♥♥♥and you will get angry when you get ""juggled"" by explosions. I personally enjoyed this game, not for the story, but for just bombing around in. DO NOT buy this is you don't well exceed the reccomended settings. Graphics are not terrible on the highest setting.			"

Even though on max settings i have +/- 85 FPS. Second probem with the game is that it ♥♥♥♥s up your sound, during and e few seconds after the loading screens finishes my sound gets al laggy and broken, not only the in game sound but also my TS starts lagging, i cant hear a single thing my friends are saying. Also it chrashes for no reason, but i havent had this problem to often.Conclusion: Dont buy this game untill it is fixed (if that ever even will happen) or at least wait till you can get it for like 15 euros.

												Love this game! Amazing graphics! Make sure your computer is powerful enough to run it though.(Im running an AMD FX-8320 CPU with an MSI R9 380 4G GPU)Lots of fun to liberate bases and whip people across the map with the tether!This is also a great game to play if you are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and need to let some Steam out! (Pun intended) because it's great to just load into the game and find the closest road with civilians driving around and start messing with them! Such as tether their cars together and watch the chaos as they try to drive away. And then all of a sudden you see a nice sports car drive by you and you either do 1 of 3 things:#1 you tether yourself to the roof and steal the car and drive it like you stole it... Because you did steal it!!#2 you accidentally tether it to a cliff and watch as it falls to its death...#3 you pull out your rocket launcher and completely obliterate it!!10/10 would obliterate with rocket launcher again			"

												When I first booted the game, I had countless problems, from the uncanny crashing to the horrendous framerate, and thankfully I managed to get everything fixed. The game is absolutely superb, and that is just because it is fun. A fun game is mostly what you need, and a game may have a decent story, but if it isn't fun, then it isn't worth playing. This game exceeds on what Just Cause 2 build, and makes an experience that is basically Michael Bay simulator on drugs. Unfortunately, there are a few problems, like not being able to kinda zoom in with your weapon as well as not having the ability to sprint. These elements should be key in a game like this, but unfortunately no. Also, the game doesn't have a mini map so it makes things a bit difficult at specific times. The side missions are pretty much just liberating and races. Thankfully, they are both fun. The car handling isn't particularly amazing, but I guess it works. The graphics are pretty good, especially Rico's character model.The world is GORGEOUS. It is massive, exotic and beautiful. The music is also really nice. The combat is good fun, but it feels pretty much like every other game and it is far, far too easy for me. Either way, I love it and I can't put it down! The story though, is particularly uninteresting but the characters are really nice. I cannot wait for the multiplayer mod anyway. This is a must buy if you can get it on a sale! It is lengthy and a great purchase.			"

												The game Micheal Bay would play when thinking up a movie. Blow up EVERYTHING!  Story is an afterthought but not at the expense of game play.  However I did find it annoying how the weapon mods are limited to some side events I feel uncompelled to play.  Locking away the gear drops and vehicle drops feels like a limit to a game where I just want to bring the world down on my enemies. WHY DEVELOPERS? WHY DID YOU DO THAT?  The destruction numbers are arbitrary........... Why are they even there?! What do they serve?!? Telling me I caused 65million in arbitrary units. Also, why am I being told about some guy with a blue beard who was flying with the wingsuit for 5mins...... Screw it! I'm going to out fly him.Is it enjoyable? Yes. Does it have problems? Yes. Do the problems make the game unplayable? No. Is it worth it? On a discount.  "

												I like this game. The graphic's and gameplay aren't as good as, let's say, GTA V, but this game does have some cool unique features which are a nice and welcome change to the usual 'freeroam-gameplay'. The missions are pretty fun, but get a bit repetitive. So does liberating the towns. A part I really enjoyed was searching for a fix to get the game to actually start. Turns out I had to underclock my CPU for it to work. Haha, that's fun! Get's even better when the game randomly crashes every now and then, and when mission objects simply dissapear. Great stuff! Haven't seen anything from the DLC's yet. I was hoping for a DLC that would allow me to save the resolution settings, instead of having to set them every single time I start the game. Haven't seen anything like that so far - but I'm only 8 hours in.			"

												I got it from a friend as a burthday since i wanted it so much, and so far from the air land and sea DLC, the DLC is outstanding, so is the main story, although there are some flaws such as-No Stoping Point for trains-The DLC storyline is only comic-The fact that everytime you look away from a road, new cars spawn in. (Trust me, i have gotten more deaths from an enemy armored car spawning while i was looking behind me than dieing from and heli's and gunshots.)-The Shadows do tend to flicker alot, causing my game to lag from 60FPS to 30FPS-The train (all of it, includeing its cars. tanks, and jets) are COMEPLEATLY invunerable from the ground, makeing impossible for them to explode.The Good things about the game in general are:-Advanced AI calculations (when to stop and get off, or when to get a tank to kill the player)-The mech's are exremely powerful and durable, and should stay like that-The Storyline (Main) Has basicly used you for Air (Cargo Jet) Land (EMP convoy) and sea (Nitrus Boat with mario!)-A good variety of cars, boats, tanks etc. to have as a rebel drop (The fastest boat nearly made me want to cry since i tried so hard to get it in a rebel drop)-A variety of secrets (for example the doge secret)-A good baised humor (although some parts Wierd)Overall a good game, how ever should fix some bugs.

												If it's >=75% off, you have the money to spend and really enjoy Just Cause, sure.I bought this game during the Christmas sale at 20% off ($47.99 US) and have enjoyed my purchase, though I wish I'd waited for a deeper sale.PROS: - It's really fun in freeroam- The story is the best out of the series (e.g. terrible but enjoyable campy)- Avalanche knows the strengths of the series, so you're powerful but so is the AI- The wingsuit is a great addition- Nuke launcher- Tanks and helicopters with shields- It's amazing how good it is considering the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practices- Great graphics, nice aesthetic- Plenty of easter eggs- Amazing explosionsNEUTRAL: - A lot of weapons are gated behind missions- Acceptable performance: Was above 50 fps 99% of the time, which is good for me, on a 980 (keep in mind my monitor is connected via HDMI so it's locked to 60) with every setting except AA maxed. Did see some stuttering in high-foliage environments like forests, but that's expected for me. CONS: - One save slot. On PC. Really.- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ always-online DRM (ironic because the enemy is called the DRM)- Most side missions to unlock gear mods are super boring*- Enemies can be bullet sponges- Buggy**- Moderately high pop-in- The volcano in the game does not have a base inside it- Load times in the 5-10 minute range, thanks to the before-mentioned always-online DRM- Once you complete the game, you must manually ""re-oppress"" every base seperately. And you need to teleport to that base to do it, which can take upwards of 30 seconds. Don't expect to easily have a new game plus run without save editing.*The wingsuit courses are fun, the gun range is super easy if you have a mouse, the rest are just annoying because you almost get x stars but are just off**I've noticed at least four bugs:-If you go at high enough velocity downwards, you go through the ground and have to swim to the coast, underground- Helicopters can instantly die if their rotors clip something because the rotors apparently have the mass of the whole helicopter- If you have precision aim (which is an unlockable upgrade, for some reason) on, missiles don't lock on. A patch tried to fix this, but it's still broken for me. This means you can't complete certain missions without restarting the game.- A ♥♥♥♥ton of flickeringNOTESThere's ~5-10 minutes of loading before starting the game. Probably an hour or two of my 'playtime' was loading, especially considering it sometimes didn't connect and so reconnected everytime I paused or opened a menu. This is in service of a leaderboard which is interesting but which doesn't justify the connection times or lack of an offline mode. You can physically unplug your internet or disconnect your computer, but it still attempts connection on every loading screen, even if you're offline on Steam. It's a testament to this game that I was able to still enjoy and recommend it. Also, I played it with the default version which did not include any DLC and I beat the campaign and liberated every base in 36 hours, which included significant ♥♥♥♥ing around.			"

												Now, a lot of people have been complaining about this game's performance issues, but I can run it fairly well. 70 FPS most of the time with drops every now and then during large chains of explosions, but most of the time it's totally fine. Looking at this game from a gameplay perspective, it's absolutely incredible. The vastness of the world is incredibly fun and beautiful to explore using the wingsuit, and all of your tools to mess with physics and cause destruction work really well with that. There has been no times that I have been bored playing this game.			"

												Just Cause 3 was my most hyped game of the year ( I've never like fallout for some reason) and to be honest it lived up to my expectations. I feel bad for the people having issues with this game as my mediocre system runs Jc3 with the occasional frame drop/stutter. I believe this game is a worthy successor to Jc2 and my definate GOTY			"

												Just Cause 3. Cool game, nothing innovative or drastically new.  The graphics dont seem so nice at times especially when the sun is gone (looks like its missing shadows and ambient occlusion), the performance is not very good and definately needs some patching. Nevertheless the proven gameplay mechanics make this an action packed adventure with extreme over the top stunts and physics that will make your jaw drop or provoke a giggle or two. I would reccomend it, but you could definately wait until the price drops or the first performance patches are out.			"

												Positives:- Great game overall- Multiple Grappels- Missions are fun- Explosions- Beacons as currency for dropsNegatives:- Buggy as crap (Various in game bugs but the worst for me is an extremely loud audio glitch on startup, means you have to restart the game anywhere from 1 to 30 times before you get in without the glitch)- Beacons for me are hard to find, I imagine this is just me but seriously can't you just make it infinite, it would make things a lot more fun than waiting to find a beacon.- Score beating - I don't care if some random people who I have never talked to or have on my friends list beat my damn score, if you don't play for a few days your screen just spams the crap out of you about people beating your score WHY! So you'd think that just playing it offline like blocking it in your firewall would be fine? Nope. If you do that it comes up with some thing asking you to verify a code online so you do that and then guess what? AUDIO GLITCH! >:( The audio glitch also seems to happen more often when offline too.Overall this game is great, all the developers need to do is fix the bugs i've outlined and i'd have been happy to recommend this. I'm really disappointed in how unfinished this is.			"

												Bang, Bang, Boom, ZIIIP, Skoosh, BOOOO.Zip onto any random car. If they recognize you, they will:1)CURSE you for they just washed their car.2)Say its an honour to have the legenary RICO on their car.And you can, shoot the wheels of other cars and make them flip, tackle helicopters while the army chases you, or tether random passerbys to the car and watch them swing around, or you can make your car fly by connecting it to a helicopter, or hijack the helicopter, and use the car as a wrecking ball, or crash the helicopter into an enemy tank, and wingsuit away like a baws, and then hit (and dig yourself) into the mountain(or lamppost) you didn't see coming up while you were busy laughing at the tank, and let rico fly like a ragdoll, potentially forever...This game is just for laffs... and its the kind where you can get rid of your rage...

												Great fun so far. It's like GTA V but people thank you for stealing their cars, you can dangle underneath helicopters and shoot rockets at other helicopters, no amount of collateral damage you create will ever be held against you, actually people thank you for blowing up their town in the process of liberating it.At one point i just ran onto the beach sticking bombs to some surfer kids and then blew em all up and everyone was like you're a superhero Rico!This game is just completely over the top crazy where your imagination is the limit to how much destruction you can cause.As far as performance goes, i'm running this 1080p with no drops in framerate. framerate does seem capped at 30 for some reason though but at high settings it looks good and plays great on a GTX 960 2GB, 16gigs ram and i5 3550.

												Alright, I have played this game for about 44 hours  and have to say it's a nice game if you like blowing stuff up and causing chaos and destruction. the map is insanely big but it's fun to have a map this huge, lot of things to explore, outposts to liberate, destroying entire airports and what not.There are a lot of collectibles to collect and I'd say if you really hunt em down (like I did) you probably have to spend about 5 to 7 hours in total to collect everything (used the fast travel a LOT) and you get nice stuff when you collect every collectible from a certain category, such as all Di ravelio's tapes or ancient tombs.Now this game is awesome, but there are a lot of things that do bug me. mostly known by now are the FPS drops, they are not that common, I'd say they are rare, at least for me (may depend on how beefy your pc is, I can say my pc exceeds the recommended system requirements by far so it doesn't bother me that much but still).Frequent crashes have made me (literally) smash my headset, when you're in the middle of a mission, and it happends to be a quite difficult one and you crash of all the sudden, you (or I at least) can get quite mad. especially if you have to take another route to avoid the point were it crashes your game every single time.Something else is the lock on feature in fighter jets, you have to disable the MOD (don't know the exact name rn) that let you aim better and restart your game before you can actually use lock on. something like that should not happen at all, I had to restart the mission where you have to protect Rosa Manuela's plane more than 10 times because of a not working lock on.All this seems like this game is bugged af, but it's not entirely. at the beginning it's difficult getting the hang of the new controls (especially going back with 'CTRL') and getting used to face planting 24/7. but after a while when you unlock new weapons and MODs for your tools, it gets soo much more fun. I personally am obsessed with the M488, a ♥♥♥♥ing rocket launcher, infused with bavarium to make your rockets go off like bloody nukes. I never had so much fun in any game before as I had with the M488.If you're into blowing up stuff hardcore, ready to die quite often (because of how hard it sometimes can be) and wanna wingsuit like a badass, and can deal with sudden fps drops. I highly recommend this game for you. if not, go and find another game where you can cause the same amount of destruction and still have fun			"

												I did not experience technical issues.  I did experience a somewhat bland, but somewhat hilarious, sandbox game that fills a unique niche in the sandbox universe.  To be fair, I can't even remember its prequel to compare it to, because it, too, must have had the same flaws.This game is all about the grapple and stunts.  You can do a lot of fun, memorable stuff.  But, because of some design decisions and flaws, the gameplay doesn't feel spectacular or worthy of re-playing.1. The controls are not polished enough.  This is something most open-world games have a problem with, but when you're gliding and grappling around it's a huge pain point.  I found myself swearing as I flew into walls or got stuck under ledges.2. When you die, you just respawn where you left off. So you can basically liberate the whole map before doing any missions.3. New enemies spawn behind from all sides, making battles chaotic and not strategic in any way. This negates any use of the sniper rifle.4. Because of the lack of battle tactics, Rico is almost invincible, and so they didn't include crouching or cover because of this and the above point.5. Upgrades (or 'mods' as they call them) are mostly optional. They help a little, but not enough to make the game easier or feel rewarding.6. Most of the time, it was easier to glide/parachute/fast-travel rather than find a vehicle. Traveling got to be quite a shlep in the mountains.  The vehicles and attention to their detail are amazing but mostly superfluous.These points together contributed to a loss of enjoyment in gameplay.A typical attack on a military base involves parachuting around haphazardly and shooting missiles at targets.  This could have been much more fun if there were a stealth element, or 'level up' health/abilities before attempting, or both.The story has a lot of interesting characters who are never fully fleshed out.  Some side-missions with them would have been fun, or at least some more back-story.  I think maybe I was supposed to remember them from a previous game?Overall, the game is beautiful and fun, to an extent. The story isnt bad, but there's not enough of it to be fulfilling.  There is little replay value and gameplay gets repetitive quickly.  I'm left wishing I could go back into sandbox mode and have a good romp, but everything's liberated, and the battles weren't that fun to begin with.			"

												I am seeing alot of negative feedback all saying it runs terrible, whether they are following the trend or I am lucky; I don't see the graphic glitches they speak of. Like any computer game, do not buy this title just because you meet minimum and expect it to wow you. I pick this up at a low price and since I played the second one I knew what to expect. I'd label it as a ""time filler"", running around blowing stuff up, grappling things are all things I'd throw on when bored.But that is the extent of it, story is not engaging at all. I found myself skipping cutscenes just to play, shooting needs work, whatever aim assist they have is dog♥♥♥♥♥♥and you will get angry when you get ""juggled"" by explosions. I personally enjoyed this game, not for the story, but for just bombing around in. DO NOT buy this is you don't well exceed the reccomended settings. Graphics are not terrible on the highest setting.			"

												Just Cause 3 is an openworld third-person shooter. The player is controlling Rico Rodriguez, who is a parody of action movie heroes.Pros:- Easy to learn- Fun and exciting- Great if you need to kill an hour or two.- A huge map to play around in and exploreCons:- The game feels like it has very little content compared to the size of the map.- DLCs haven't added more than 2-3 hours of content- Horrible controls on certain vehicles- Seperate key-binding tabs for vehicles, but certain keys are not bound individuallyThe game is fun once in a while if you can't find something else to play, but it is probly not a game you will spend a great amount of time playing. This will probably change once the multiplayer mod for Just Cause 3 is released and the experience of playing can be shared with others.I will give the game a 7/10.			"

												If it's >=75% off, you have the money to spend and really enjoy Just Cause, sure.I bought this game during the Christmas sale at 20% off ($47.99 US) and have enjoyed my purchase, though I wish I'd waited for a deeper sale.PROS: - It's really fun in freeroam- The story is the best out of the series (e.g. terrible but enjoyable campy)- Avalanche knows the strengths of the series, so you're powerful but so is the AI- The wingsuit is a great addition- Nuke launcher- Tanks and helicopters with shields- It's amazing how good it is considering the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practices- Great graphics, nice aesthetic- Plenty of easter eggs- Amazing explosionsNEUTRAL: - A lot of weapons are gated behind missions- Acceptable performance: Was above 50 fps 99% of the time, which is good for me, on a 980 (keep in mind my monitor is connected via HDMI so it's locked to 60) with every setting except AA maxed. Did see some stuttering in high-foliage environments like forests, but that's expected for me. CONS: - One save slot. On PC. Really.- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ always-online DRM (ironic because the enemy is called the DRM)- Most side missions to unlock gear mods are super boring*- Enemies can be bullet sponges- Buggy**- Moderately high pop-in- The volcano in the game does not have a base inside it- Load times in the 5-10 minute range, thanks to the before-mentioned always-online DRM- Once you complete the game, you must manually ""re-oppress"" every base seperately. And you need to teleport to that base to do it, which can take upwards of 30 seconds. Don't expect to easily have a new game plus run without save editing.*The wingsuit courses are fun, the gun range is super easy if you have a mouse, the rest are just annoying because you almost get x stars but are just off**I've noticed at least four bugs:-If you go at high enough velocity downwards, you go through the ground and have to swim to the coast, underground- Helicopters can instantly die if their rotors clip something because the rotors apparently have the mass of the whole helicopter- If you have precision aim (which is an unlockable upgrade, for some reason) on, missiles don't lock on. A patch tried to fix this, but it's still broken for me. This means you can't complete certain missions without restarting the game.- A ♥♥♥♥ton of flickeringNOTESThere's ~5-10 minutes of loading before starting the game. Probably an hour or two of my 'playtime' was loading, especially considering it sometimes didn't connect and so reconnected everytime I paused or opened a menu. This is in service of a leaderboard which is interesting but which doesn't justify the connection times or lack of an offline mode. You can physically unplug your internet or disconnect your computer, but it still attempts connection on every loading screen, even if you're offline on Steam. It's a testament to this game that I was able to still enjoy and recommend it. Also, I played it with the default version which did not include any DLC and I beat the campaign and liberated every base in 36 hours, which included significant ♥♥♥♥ing around.			"

												I had no issues running this on my rig (GTX 1060 6GB, Intel Core i5 6500, 8GB of ram). The gameplay is improved over JC2 through many minor tweaks to various aspects. It feels less clunky and less restrictive than the previous game. The story is still pretty weak and predictable. The upgrade system is nice however the challenges are pretty meh. The way to unlock more abilities and thus improve your character is to succeed at random minigames dispersed throughout the map with no context. These challenges tend to be like fun little arcade games but they can get repetitive and occasionally frustrating. I personally dislike how far removed these things are from the rest of the game. Driving a car through hoops really fast doesn't feel at all connected to the goal of removing a dictatorship. I would still recommend this game because the open world feels like a better Just Cause 2 and it is fun to mess around with the civilians. I'd say pick it up when it's at $15 if you have a solid computer and enjoyed Just Cause 2.			"

												it is a Just Cause game, a beatiful looking one! and they took a lot of aspects that needed to be corrected from JC2 and made them great. Pros:-a reasonable amount of collectables, settlements to free and vehicles to collect.-the ability to create chaos in almost unlimited ways-the season pass (at least the content that has been released so far)Cons:-rather short main story BUT the story from Sky fortress is really a nice addition so if they keep that up the season pass will make up for the lack of story in the main game. still a con since you need to buy the season pass to get a fun story-almost to many challenges but it is still okall in all it is a great game where you can have a lot of fun and i recommend it.

												No, I don't buy the PS4 version because it's a lagging piece of bananas, full of performance problems. So I wait more and yes, finally I buy the PC version and now I'm stuck with something that won't even work? I only bought it yesterday but Error 38 already burned into my retina. I look up solutions, workarounds and seriously, I should UNDERCLOCK my videocard to get it to work?!And in the end it's not that the developer team makes me want to puke, but I made the wrong decision. I should've bought the PS4 version because it might be lagging, might be slow, but it's still a smaller pile of garbage then the PC version, and why? Because at least it's working.Never, ever buy this. Don't give the devs the opportunity to get more money for this. This abomination and it's creators don't deserve a single coin for making something so horrible and I'm not even angry.			"

												well my first impressions are its a fun game, there is no doubt about that, however the game needs some SERIOUS optimization, my build can only get 60 fps on max settings when literally nothing is happening, for example wingsuiting through a feild, but the second i hop into a town or a rocket explodes next to me boom drops to 30fps.. i have no doubt in my mind that this will be fixed eventually but untill it is dont buy the game especially on lower end machines!(would mixed review but there is no button for that)TLDR: DONT BUY TILL THE GAME IS FIXED			"

												I saw this game was on sale for about $22 and simply had to buy it since I loved JC 2. I had some high hopes that I figured might end up being too high for a game a year old now, but this game has blown my mind. It is incredibly fun. From the new wingsuit, to the new dynamic destruction, it feels like something new rather than Just Cause 2.5. Even the characters that I expected very little of impressed me. Yeah, it's blatantly cheesy at a lot of times and the characters are supposed to seem a bit outlandish, but they still entertain. I consider this game absolutely worth picking up on sale, and maybe for a die hard fan full price. Which is why I have nominated this for the ""WHOOOAAAAAAA, DUDE!"" award.*Note I see a lot of complaints about performance issues and such, of which I am experiencing none so I will not include it in my personal review. I am running a GTX 1060 and 12 gigs of ram without a hitch so far.			"

The gameplay is just as fun as JC2 but explosions and effects are more satisfying and there are a few more ways to cause destruction.At it's current sale price of -75% i'd say its well worth buying.

The story is  good and the game is fun but it really needs to take up less RAM. Also, I recommend this game for people that can enjoy the game at 8gb of RAM when it stutters or people with 12gb+ will get on fine. Also, close down applications before opening because that will help a bit.			"

												Just Cause 3 brings to the table (and the computers upon these tables) everything that its predecessors offered to gamers around the world. Set free from the rules of reality by its focus on fun, Just Cause 3 is everything that the modern gamer needs: a reasonably realistic simulacrum of the real word whose rules apply more to everything that isn't the player, and less to everything that the player touches.The world of Just Cause 3 is as deep as it is vast - mile upon mile of breathtakingly beautiful land (and sea...and air) stretches out as far as one's draw distance is set, and on almost every inch of these miles is an opportunity for the player to cause what the game calls Chaos.To delve deep into the universe of Just Cause, one must first delve deep into his (or her...) wallet - and it is safe, indeed, to say that this game offers far more in the way of fun than, say, $70 of takeout.

It has a  lot of replay level and is really fun and destructive which is what makes it even more fun. I recommend using a controller to play it makes it eaiser just to say. The camp[aign lasts a long time I beat the campaign at 20 hours and dont regret spending any of those hours playing this game.          There is only one con with my perspective, MODDING!!!!!! Dont buy this game if you want to mod it first they patch it so you can't mod it and know its back but people gave up on modding it and they keep getting rid of modders. Please stop removing mods it makes it more fun and they removed all of the fun removing mods.			"

If yes, then you most likely will enjoy this game.If you haven't touched Just Cause 2 and aren't sure if you enjoy this style of gameplay, just get JC2 and some mods, as this game doesn't do much more than give your prettier graphics and larger map.Also, if you hate bugs, don't touch this one yet. In the first 3 hours I've dropped through the world three times and few times some UI elements got stuck in the middle of screen, making aiming and practically anything that requires vision impossible.The oddest thing for an AAA game, this one actually runs rather well.

												Just Cause 3 got a lot of hate when it came out in December for being extremely laggy and barely working. If I wrote this review then, I'd say something along the lines of ""Don't get this game until they fix it"". And guess what? They did. By the time I got around to playing it, I was getting a smooth 60 fps everywhere with one GTX 970.Pros:-It's mental. Bases that fire nukes and pretty much everything in bases are physics objects-Jets on the two airports respawn INSTANTLY. No waiting around for them to respawn-Its very pretty-By the end of the game, you'll be practically an immortal god because of the upgrades you can get-You don't have to do the story. I ran off and destroyed every base that I could find and unlocked the perks that make Rico amazing-There are sheilded tanks and helicopters, my personal favorite for destruction-The wingsuit is the BEST way to travel in any game. They nailed the grapple/wingsuit combo-You can turn the SAM's on the enemies. Cons:-Story is a bit bland, Just Cause 2's story was MUCH better-Rebel drops and their stupid wait times. (You can disable this by doing the races, but still, 10 minutes for a gun? No thanks)-Rebel drops are limited. You have to travel to a garage to pick up more rebel beacons.Overall, I recommend this game a lot but I'd avoid the story at first			"

This means that on a whim the game may freeze, stutter, or drop to a slide show frame rate, and that's when it doesn't crash outright.

I'm not running it on a crazy system (960), but it should be enough to play at medium-low. Nope. Stuttering, frame drops, freezing, and audio bugs have swerved my review for the most anticipated game of 2015 into negative.EDIT: After verifying the game cache, the problems have seemed to cease.

												Pour in a tin :•1 full mixing bowl of explosions•10 tall tablespoons of fun•2 glasses of sumptuous graphics•A pinch of craziness•As many experiments as you wantMix everything.Bake in the oven at 400 ºF for several thousand hours.Serve with your friends and enjoy.Just Cause 3 is an open-world, destruction, fun simulator. You can literally do whatever you want in this game. It has so many possibilities that you never get bored of it! I have played it a few hours and still don't have explored all. A lot of people say it's a Michael Bay Simulator... Indeed, it is! The giant explosions; sometimes ""Just Caused"" by a simple flick, will let you AGAPE! You can choose to follow the story of the campaign, which I think is really cool and entertaining, or you can choose to spend your time exploring the majestic, giant and beautiful world.The graphics? They are just amazing. I have rarely seen graphics that nice in other games... (I've made so many screenshots in the game to remember all the delicious places I've met...) You also have a menu to spawn weapons and vehicles where you want on the map. The tall choice of this menu is very pleasant. From the bike to the giant army plane, going through the assault tank! Also, the wingsuit and the grapple system is something you can only find in Just Cause... It's one of the most important gadget in the game, allowing you to go everywhere on the map with much fun!The only thing that is missing yet, is a multiplayer mode. Sharing with your friends your crazy experimentations and funny nonsenses is something very pleasant. Just Cause 2 multiplayer mode was much fun... Bring it back, developers! By the way, you will have to play it with a good computer, otherwise the graphics will not be as beautiful as I said, and it will crash many times if you get too crazy with your experimentations!Finally, if you want a game that never bores you and where you can have much fun, playing an entire day, stop looking for it. This game is Just Cause 3.			"

												Well worth the wait, well worth the money!I had purchased this all the way back to May, after spending continuous weeks on JC2. This one is just as good, with better and worse parts.Better than JC2:+Graphics. Not perfect, but great. Could be better? Yes. Would that be necessary? No. Its good enough. It's great. I liked the optimization too. Worked almost fluent in all very high settings on my GTX860M Acer Nitro (Most people are having optimization and performance issues though).+The wingsuit. Ah, what a pleasure. I hope they consider putting this to JC2 as a mod. It changes the whole game.+Physics engine and the new wire tethering. With just a little experience, the need for guns is gone. And it doesn't get boring that fast. Very fun to play with.+Environments. With better graphics, better views. +New capturing system. No more ""just kill everything"". Still, these are just to keep things from being the same thing over and over again, for a while.+Loading times. The game loads while you watch the intros. And it does not take a very long time too. But you WILL need an SSD to stop nagging about it. Worse than JC2:-Controls. The steering delay is even worse, gun controls were better IMO.-Staying online all the time. Not mandatory, but keeps trying to compare achievements and annoys at times.-HUD. Minimap is gone, so are most of the object indicators.-Cutscenes are choppy. But, then again, it might just be my configuration.-Map and menu. They found a way to make the map even less functional, and more important.-Random glitches and crashes. Everyone's having different problems. Most people have performance issues too.Now, JC3 is great. It might suck where JC2 made its fame (optimization, controls) but it's still a lot fun to play. If you have not tried JC2, I suggest you give it a try first. They are basically the same.I can't help feeling that Just Cause 3 is an unfinished game. It feels like they had a couple more things to add but they reached the deadline. It could be better, eventhough it's already worth the money. "

												Just Cause 3 was my most hyped game of the year ( I've never like fallout for some reason) and to be honest it lived up to my expectations. I feel bad for the people having issues with this game as my mediocre system runs Jc3 with the occasional frame drop/stutter.

												Just Cause 3. Cool game, nothing innovative or drastically new.  The graphics dont seem so nice at times especially when the sun is gone (looks like its missing shadows and ambient occlusion), the performance is not very good and definately needs some patching. Nevertheless the proven gameplay mechanics make this an action packed adventure with extreme over the top stunts and physics that will make your jaw drop or provoke a giggle or two. I would reccomend it, but you could definately wait until the price drops or the first performance patches are out.			"

												Ridiculously broken at the moment for me, (R9 270X & Athlon 750K  8GB RAM) but tuns at a decent framerate. Only like half the worlds polygons load in.But I've played 10+ hrs like that and enjoyed all of it so it's quite good to me. It's essentially and updated JC2, more refined and some cool new things added.I reccomend the game, assuming that AMD/Avalanche get it together and patch the issues.12/20/15:Both AMD and avalanche released patches, and the game functions normally now, runs pretty well on my rig with settings somwhere between medium and high. Loading times are not so great for me however, I have the game stored on a 7200 RPM SATA drive, and I usually have to load for about a minute for everything, except the initial startup, which is more like 4 minutes. Not a huge deal, but it seems like the kind of problem an older game would have.Just beat the story and liberated everything, except for 3 settlements that I can't find, and don't seem to belong to a province.I can say I enjoyed the game, and I would reccomend it, however for 60$, I don't feel the content is diverse enough for the price. Each town you liberate is pretty much the same, there are a few types of military bases, but not many. There are so many of these that it kind of becomes a chore, and more so once you figure out how to destroy stuff the easiest.Another issue; in JC2, my favorite part was foing to and from missions, which isn't the case in this game, because my favorite way to get around was by eingsuit and fast travel, since the driving physics were bizzare to me. While you're in the air, the only things that makes traveling interesting are trees and mountains. By interesting I mostly mean difficult. As a whole however, I quite liked wingsuiting around Medici.As many people talked about around release time, the game world is huge, but the content is just spread out, making it somewhat artificially large. This doesn't bother me a whole lot, considering it's more reason to use the wingsuit, but it was something that I definately noticed throughout the game. Story is aggressively mediocre, but it didn't bother me at all. Everything is cheesy and over the top, whih is fun, but don't expect anything to wow you or interest you greatly.Graphics are fanastic, possibly the nicest looking game I've played, considering not jsut textures and polygons, but colors and art. Very pretty game.Overall I'd give it a hearty recomendation if you're willing to grind through liberatiing everything, and if you don't mind a cheesy story.			"

												After playing Just Cause 2 on the Playstation 3 for many many hours, it's a little disappointing that I can't recommend this game to anyone, at least in the state it's in. Months after release, I thought enough updates would have passed and made the game how it should have been at launch. Ha, no. I have an i5 processor, GTX 970 (which is actually the card recommended for the best experience on this game) and 8GB of RAM, and yet I can't run this game at the settings I should be able to without getting the worst framerate I've ever had to experience. At launch, I was able to fiddle around and make it work reasonably well, but come on. This game is months old and I still can't play it without nerfing the settings. And even when the settings were lowered it wasn't perfect. As a result, I can't judge this game for it's merits. The unplayable choppy framerate (which gets worse with the more action) has left such a bad taste in my mouth that I can't look at the good points of this game without being annoyed. I've looked up fixes, made sure all my drivers are up to date, but I can no longer be bothered to look for ways to fix something that SHOULD NOT NEED FIXING. I'm not going to re-install my drivers or go into the game's files or whatever, 99% of other games don't require me to do this and I'm certainly not going to start now with this one. Just Cause 3 will sit in my library, Steam will download it's updates automatically, and I will wait and see. And the longer it takes Avalanche to get it together, the more likely I won't buy anything they make in the future. From a disappointed fan.			"

												Why should you buy this game. Just Cause. Ok got that out of the way. Just Cause 3 is a open-world sandbox psychopath simulator where you fill the nitroglicerin filled shoes of Rico Rodrigez: professional dictator remover. No really that's his job title. Just Cause 3 is all about exploring a very beatiful series of islands and liberating them from a powerhungry despot by blowing them to oblivion. Liberate! The core gameplay revolves entirely around blowing stuff up and doing it with style. The entire sandbox is built around that design system and if you are looking for a more story driven experience then you better continue looking because this isn't your game. With that said I have adress the elephant in the room: that game has some notable technical issues that have made the game borderline unplayable for some people. I can run it pretty well on medium settings with some framerate drops when I'm blowing a military base into the stratosphere but so far there hasn't been any outright gamebreaking framedrops (My laptop uses a Nvidia 780M and I have 32GB of RAM). With that said if you don't have a decent video card and at least 12 GB of RAM I'd suggest holding off buying JC3. But if you have required specs the you should go for it.			"

												Now, a lot of people have been complaining about this game's performance issues, but I can run it fairly well. 70 FPS most of the time with drops every now and then during large chains of explosions, but most of the time it's totally fine. Looking at this game from a gameplay perspective, it's absolutely incredible. The vastness of the world is incredibly fun and beautiful to explore using the wingsuit, and all of your tools to mess with physics and cause destruction work really well with that. There has been no times that I have been bored playing this game.			"

												I'm going to say it straight foward, this game is incredible if you have the rig to run it.People are knocking this game because of its inferior performance to games like GTAV and MGSV, which are slower paced games. This game moves fast, and your game will move slow if your computer is slow a snail.  So if you have a sub-par computer that does not meet the recommended requirements. Put this game in the wish list, becuase it is damn well worth it when you have a rig that can properly run it  (My GTX 960 and Haswell I7 run it at a crystal clear 60fps with ultra settings (AA at MSAA 4x)). Is this game perfect? No, it is not perfect. The main story is not the crux of the show, it comes in the form of the town clearing and the challenges. This game shoots itself in the foot by hampering a ridiculous amount of your power through the upgrade system, so while you are playing the game, do the challenges. No, you might not get 5 stars initially, but the upgrades are worth the effort. When you have even semi-maxed tethers and grenades, the♥♥♥♥♥♥you can do is so much fun that it's worth it.I do have to say that the wingsuit was the most frustrating part for me in terms of challenges. Not because of the variety and beautiful vistas that they take you through, but because of how poorly the wingsuit handled for me initially. Unfortunately, I have only a mouse and keyboard, but you can actually master the wingsuit with mouse and keyboard. If you tap the keys rapidly to do your maneuvers, you won't have your movement locked and faceplant into the ground. Just a piece of advice from me to you.To those who say the DLC is too short, I understand where you're coming from, but do not forget that the idea is to combine them and use them in the main game. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is really fun to go through Montagne and the mines with the DLC content. I would suggest playing through the vanilla content by itself initially, but the DLC content provided me an extra 25 hours of gameplay just by screwing around with the weapons that the DLC provide. Did I mention that the OST is amazing? The game feels so great with headphones while you blowing people to shreds. The game's appeal is not from using amazing gadgets, this is not your average Ubisoft open-world. It is a crazy game that will  NOT  hold your hand at baby dumb mode. You can't move around and kill easily on foot? No♥♥♥♥♥♥ the name of the game is to fly around and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up from the skies with your parachute and gadgets. You can beat the game by simply hitting♥♥♥♥♥♥with the gun on ground, but this is a classic Eidos game. There's more depth to it that you expect.It took me 95 hours to 100% this game over winter break, and it was one of the greatest times I've ever had with a game. If you have the rig to run it and the patience to get good at it, you will not regret it at all.			"

												Written from the point of view of someone who has played 123 hours of Just Cause 2 and would probably rank it in my top 5 games.JC3 is pretty fun. Pretty all as expected. It looks fantastic. I really like the better implemented destruction. Driving is feels a lot better than JC2. Being able to see on the map the things you need to destroy to complete a settlement is a life saver. Having unlimited plantable bombs makes a long session of destruction easier and means you don't mind using your rocket launcher or similar weapon more. The progression is more interesting than JC3 with you getting more abilities rather than just weapon hits harder. Couldn't imagine life without the wing suit now. But the main missions are dull af, very few highlights. Its mostly just 'escort' missions where you have to protect something, so its just adding a rule holding back your destructions. Just Cause 2's location feels more interesting than Medici; it has as snow, desert, forests, mountains and huge cities where medici only has forests, mountains, coastline (very pretty) and quarry areas. The challenges are pretty dull; Wing suit ones are alright but the destruction ones are again just adding rules to limit how you want to play. It feels like its missing one extra variable to really vary things up. And I'm not just talking about co op, but that would have been a great addition. JC3 is more of the same with a few improvements. If you found JC2 repetitive you probably won't get a lot out of JC3. For some reason I don't think I'll keep coming back like I did for JC2. So overall I did have a fair amount of fun with JC3, but it didn't blow my socks off as I was hoping.			"

												I like this game. The graphic's and gameplay aren't as good as, let's say, GTA V, but this game does have some cool unique features which are a nice and welcome change to the usual 'freeroam-gameplay'. The missions are pretty fun, but get a bit repetitive. So does liberating the towns. A part I really enjoyed was searching for a fix to get the game to actually start. Turns out I had to underclock my CPU for it to work. Haha, that's fun! Get's even better when the game randomly crashes every now and then, and when mission objects simply dissapear. Great stuff! Haven't seen anything from the DLC's yet. I was hoping for a DLC that would allow me to save the resolution settings, instead of having to set them every single time I start the game. Haven't seen anything like that so far - but I'm only 8 hours in.			"

Not Suitable For High End Gaming PCs If you have a high end gaming PC then I recommend that you avoid this game (even if you LOVED Just Cause 2), because there is a good chance that you won't be able to play it. JC3 will not run on my PC. And when I was searching through forums trying to get the game to work, I discovered that I am not the only person having this problem (game crashes immediately after you jump off the plane at the beginning).I'm running a liquid-cooled Core i7 5930k at 4.5 GHz, on an Asus Rampage V Edition 10, with 16 GB memory and dual 980 Ti video cards in SLI. Also, just FYI, I have tried *everything* to get JC3 working, including clocking everything back down to stock speeds and voltages, and using low graphics settings in-game, and removing 1 of the video cards. No luck.JC2 was an awesome game (despite the bugs in the PC version), and if the developer had bothered to put some time/money into supporting JC3 after its PC release, then JC could have gone on to become a huge title in the future. But, unfortunately for them (and for PC gamers), their developers are lazy (or understaffed/underfunded) and their QA staff is incompetent, so that is unlikely to happen... unless the developer decides to start investing in the title immediately (e.g. release updates to support high end PC hardware configurations).

Story is lame and very short, and a big no-no: You will unlock the best stuff after you completed the hardest missions. So, you can use them or... squirrles? :|Also very easy. Just hop into a helicopter and spam bases with missles, land and clean up leftovers. And although the world is very big, the biggest island (top one) is filled with nothing. Obviously a port for xbox. And for the controls, a bad port.  Buy the game when it's on discount.			"

To start off before I speak more about the gameplay, performance, etc, I'll break down my computer: intel i7 6700HQ quad-core 2.4GHzNvidia GeForce GTX 965M with 4GB VRAM12GB RAMas you'll notice, I have a quite powerful computer (can run The witcher 3 near maxed at a stable 40-ish FPS), and JC3 runs...okay. it runs at about 60FPS on low settings, with some dips thanks to it eating up 4.5GB of RAM.  Sometimes after extended play it'll start to leak worse and lag more, but that's not a constant thing.  Overall, performance is quite dodgy, but it could be worse, at least it only dips in framerate due to the memory leak (I can be blowing up a base, and not skip a beat, no noticeable frame loss).  Also, the story's much better than JC2's...but honestly, it's still not great, though who plays just cause for the story? the game's also quite pretty. Even on low it's gorgeousSo I know this is short, but I will say, YES I recommend just cause 3, if you enjoy just cause 2, and have a fairly strong PC.  I can't comment on the DLCs, but hopefully this will get fixed like Arkham Knight did (which I still need to aquire to play :/)			"

Summary:A seemingly common issue, this explosion-filled open world action-adventure's fairly severe performance issues on some systems can be fixed by forcing /borderless /fullscreen in the game's Steam command line. Despite its fairly poor optimisation and forced online, this game took Just Cause 2 and improved on many of that game's aspects, especially in terms of visuals and game mechanics (most notably the wingsuit), and as such, it's a fun title to play around with for a while. Yet gameplay outside the story quickly becomes repetitive and lacklustre, and the flawed Rebel Drop system severely limits the player from creativity, particularly early-game. As such, this game is only worth the price when on sale, and Just Cause 2 will undoubtedly give more entertainment in the long-term - for a much lower price.Rating:1 - A masterpiece. An essential purchase for everyone.2 - Great game. Highly recommended to most people.3 - Fairly good game. Recommended mainly for fans of the genre or when on sale.4 - Poor game. Not recommended but has a few merits.5 - Awful game. Would not recommend to anyone in their right minds.			"

												I love seeing how many bad reviews are about performance, the game is just fine, you need a better pc, same thing all the times a game comes out: everyone complainting that he can't run this. I have a high range pc and this game runs on ultra above 65-70 fps. But you can't ask it to run on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc. Now i don't really know how are the performance on AMD graphics card, in Nvidia cards WITHOUT the drivers this runs smoothly as ♥♥♥♥. Probably if this game had a worse graphics, more people would be liking this. Now, about the game:1-The story makes basically nosense, but the good nosense.2-Graphics are beautiful3-This is one of the best movement system in video games history, no joke.4-You have infinite C4 so you can do the ♥♥♥♥ you want5-There are a lot of weapons, veichles and side missions are the best, it's not just the ""drive from A to B"" thing, you make explode things and that's fun, right?6-There is not multiplayer mode, i think that if it had had one, this would have been much better.7-I am really hoping for mods for this game.That's it, the game is fun, buy it, for me it's worth the 49,99 Euros that it costs.Thank you for reading this review, if you need any information about this or other game i have, please add me and ask!

												Fun game (if you like just running around blowing stuff up) that looks great. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of large improvements over Just Cause 2, and many of the changes seem to be side-grades rather than upgrades (changes that are not objectively better than JC2).Would NOT recommend only because the game runs terribly, moreso the longer you play (my specs are above the min and I turned everything to 'low'). Seems to be some performance issues with the game that have not been fixed even 6 months after release. Also somehow they managed to make cars handle even worse than JC2.Specs: i5 3470, GTX 760, 8GB RAM, 1TB 7200 rpm HDD.			"

												I thoroughly recomend this game to anyone that has the gear to run it!It is well worth your money and then some! You can spend countless hours just goofing around,some people call it grinding. But they are playing the game wrong. You don't have to go from base to base toliberate everything. Take your time, do some races, some flying, some missions, some rebel dropping, exploring, etc.This game is gorgeous, and the fact that you can get around so easy with the wingsuit is fantastic!I really enjoyed Just cause 2 aswell, but they've really gone a step up with this release!I haven't encountered any of the problems the negative reviews mention.The cars drive just fine! (depending on the car offcourse) the tethering hooks are great!I haven't experienced any bugs, nor have i had a single lag spike. (that given, I have a decent gaming rig)To be honest, i don't know about the story, i've been skiping most of it... But that's just out of excitement to get back in the action, fly around, do another challenge to level your gear...Though i do really enjoy the missions the game gives me. At times you might feel ""overpowered"" but some of the missions will set you straight.Anyway as i said, If you have a decent rig, that can run this game flawless, and you like action games, loads of explosions, flightsuits, grappling hooks, tethering fun, jumping out of airplanes etc etc etc Then get this game! And give it a possitive review, because it absolutely deserves better then a ""mixed"" average! "

												I was a big fan of JC2, I completed it for 95-97%, searching for boxes etc. I had fun, the same I had playing Saints Row IV.Now, I finally decided to buy JC3, and the main problem of that game: it's not fun to play it, it's boring!97% of reviewers complains about bad optimization and overall graphics quality. That's true, but if you have GTX 970+, you're almost ok, the game is playable. But I won't recommend you to do that.That game should be called JC2 HD edition. Some new tricks won't add much new in boring city-by-city freeing.I know, it's hard to add something revolutionary new in a game like that, but at least make changes in concept, to motivate people to raise another flag.Plus, they did something very strange with hook control, it acts very strange and stupid, especially while you try to capture a boat, for example. Hard to explain, but this is really a pain, trust me.And a lot of such downgrades, which makes you fight with controls instead of make amazing complexity tricks, we loved JC2 for.And yes, JC2 was 4gb installed size, this one occupies 50gb with prevgen console graphics, and cloned buildings/objects on the islands around (i.e. the same approach as in 4gb JC2, btw)! Compare it with The Witcher with all DLC's, and its amazing variety of the universe for the same 50gb.Maybe I just grew up since JC2 release, but I don't want to spend my time on that game anymore in near future (after 15 hours).I'm glad, I bought it on sale!UPD 30 jul 2016I took 8 months to fix perfomance on PC (another path seems solve this problem)!But guess what? Nobody cares now.And this patch won't fix the main problem of the game: boring, repeating and clumsy (buggy) gameplay.			"

												Sorry to agree with the naysayers but this game needs a lot of optimizations. Performance is awful and dialing down the graphics settings doesn't work as well as it should. You'd think that a GTX670 and a 3770K with 16GB ram ought to at least hold 30fps at 1680x1050 with the settings at medium and all the fluff (like tesselation, motion blur) turned off but you'd be wrong. Not sure if I got the new patch got installed or not. Probably? Isn't Steam supposed to do that sort of thing automatically? Ah, I miss the good old days. Gaming is officially dead.Btw. Wasn't exactly hooked on the feel of the gameplay, parachute and gunfights, not to mention the incessant cut-scenes either, but that is really not the point as long as you can't even play the damn game.Will probably ask for a refund.

												Well worth the wait, well worth the money!I had purchased this all the way back to May, after spending continuous weeks on JC2. This one is just as good, with better and worse parts.Better than JC2:+Graphics. Not perfect, but great. Could be better? Yes. Would that be necessary? No. Its good enough. It's great. I liked the optimization too. Worked almost fluent in all very high settings on my GTX860M Acer Nitro (Most people are having optimization and performance issues though).+The wingsuit. Ah, what a pleasure. I hope they consider putting this to JC2 as a mod. It changes the whole game.+Physics engine and the new wire tethering. With just a little experience, the need for guns is gone. And it doesn't get boring that fast. Very fun to play with.+Environments. With better graphics, better views. +New capturing system. No more ""just kill everything"". Still, these are just to keep things from being the same thing over and over again, for a while.+Loading times. The game loads while you watch the intros. And it does not take a very long time too. But you WILL need an SSD to stop nagging about it. Worse than JC2:-Controls. The steering delay is even worse, gun controls were better IMO.-Staying online all the time. Not mandatory, but keeps trying to compare achievements and annoys at times.-HUD. Minimap is gone, so are most of the object indicators.-Cutscenes are choppy. But, then again, it might just be my configuration.-Map and menu. They found a way to make the map even less functional, and more important.-Random glitches and crashes. Everyone's having different problems. Most people have performance issues too.Now, JC3 is great. It might suck where JC2 made its fame (optimization, controls) but it's still a lot fun to play. If you have not tried JC2, I suggest you give it a try first. They are basically the same.I can't help feeling that Just Cause 3 is an unfinished game. It feels like they had a couple more things to add but they reached the deadline. It could be better, eventhough it's already worth the money. "

												Ridiculously broken at the moment for me, (R9 270X & Athlon 750K  8GB RAM) but tuns at a decent framerate. Only like half the worlds polygons load in.But I've played 10+ hrs like that and enjoyed all of it so it's quite good to me. It's essentially and updated JC2, more refined and some cool new things added.I reccomend the game, assuming that AMD/Avalanche get it together and patch the issues.12/20/15:Both AMD and avalanche released patches, and the game functions normally now, runs pretty well on my rig with settings somwhere between medium and high. Loading times are not so great for me however, I have the game stored on a 7200 RPM SATA drive, and I usually have to load for about a minute for everything, except the initial startup, which is more like 4 minutes. Not a huge deal, but it seems like the kind of problem an older game would have.Just beat the story and liberated everything, except for 3 settlements that I can't find, and don't seem to belong to a province.I can say I enjoyed the game, and I would reccomend it, however for 60$, I don't feel the content is diverse enough for the price. Each town you liberate is pretty much the same, there are a few types of military bases, but not many. There are so many of these that it kind of becomes a chore, and more so once you figure out how to destroy stuff the easiest.Another issue; in JC2, my favorite part was foing to and from missions, which isn't the case in this game, because my favorite way to get around was by eingsuit and fast travel, since the driving physics were bizzare to me. While you're in the air, the only things that makes traveling interesting are trees and mountains. By interesting I mostly mean difficult. As a whole however, I quite liked wingsuiting around Medici.As many people talked about around release time, the game world is huge, but the content is just spread out, making it somewhat artificially large. This doesn't bother me a whole lot, considering it's more reason to use the wingsuit, but it was something that I definately noticed throughout the game. Story is aggressively mediocre, but it didn't bother me at all. Everything is cheesy and over the top, whih is fun, but don't expect anything to wow you or interest you greatly.Graphics are fanastic, possibly the nicest looking game I've played, considering not jsut textures and polygons, but colors and art. Very pretty game.Overall I'd give it a hearty recomendation if you're willing to grind through liberatiing everything, and if you don't mind a cheesy story.			"

												JC2 was amazing. This review comes from someone with hundreds of hours in JC2. I suggest you play that game instead.JC3 has tons of challenges. They are required to get any cool stuff. 80% of them are 0% fun. I suggest you just get a mod to unlock everything (IF you can find one, I can't) because they really, really SUCK.Driving has not improved from the last game. It still sucks.Shooting has not improved from the last game. It still sucks.The wingsuit is ""meh"". I would have preferred JC2-style parachutes.Instead of pressing ""A"" on the controller to quickly parachute out of a vehicle, you need to HOLD A. I DESPISE this change. The whole ♥♥♥♥ing point of it was to be able to quickly bail out by slapping A- now you need to hold it for a second? When my helicopter is going down, I don't have a ♥♥♥♥ing second. And worse- if you DO tap ""A"" you go into stunt jump mode, so you're stuck to your flaming, crashing helicopter for a few seconds while the animation plays. Controller buttons cannot be changed.This game IS pretty, but has no SLI or Crossfire support and I often get a ""black screen"" bug requiring me to alt-tab/restart multiple times.There are only a few improvements. I do like that upgrades exist for things other than weapons (which actually can't be upgraded in this game but that seems OK). Tethering things with the grapple is much better. But for the most part it's the same or worse than JC2. This game is a remake of JC2 with a bunch of bad changes. Even the map is very similar.			"

Great step up from the previous in several ways.PROS:- Story and Characters: Boiled down, it's a typical ""viva la revolucion"", destroy the oppressive regime story, but they did a fantastic job with it. The story missions are entertaining as hell. More distinctly than the previous game, the characters are much better defined and far more interesting.- Navigation: Holy damn, the wingsuit is fantastic. That, combined with your parachute, fast travel, and vehicles everywhere, getting around is a breeze and loads of fun.- Weaponry: Easy choice here, it's chaos on a massive scale, and it's balls-to-the-wall fun with tons of options.- Scenery: Medici is a beautiful place. Even on only ""high"" settings, it's a well-designed place with towns that feel alive and countryside perfectly populated to feel realistic.CONS:- Performance: As is everyone else's complaints, I've noticed it also. Even scaling down to ""high"" settings, there are occassional dips in FPS, especially with destruction.- Bugs: There are a few bugs with weaponry and planes, one in particular that prevents campaign completion (heat seeking doesn't working in ""Rico and the Rose"").- Police Stations: Claiming most is fine, usually simple. But the ""destroy X PLUS cause chaos"" leads to a few terribly stupid situations where you're waiting for reinforcements one by one to kill enough crap to conquer it. Dumb mechanic.- Vehicles: Most are useless, honestly. Motorcycles especially drive like absolute garbage. Most cars/boats don't get much use, you just end up find the most useful tanks/fighters/combat boats and using those. Fun for collecting and messing around, at best.Honestly, given its scope, there's not too much about the gameplay I have complaints about. It's unadulterated chaos in a beautiful open world. Definitely recommend it.			"

 One step forward, two steps back Before I begin my review I'd like to add some context - Just Cause 2 was one of the first games I've played when I got my own pc back in 2011. It was a very enjoyable open world game that defined the current generation of sandbox games. So when Just Cause 3 was announced last year, I was genuinely hyped. Even though these days you can't get hyped about a game without worrying about how it'll perform on launch day, I didn't care, because Just Cause 2 was a very optimized game and Square Enix has a decent record of games with good optimization. That being said, I was getting ever and ever more doubtful, how the pre-release coverage of the game showed so little as opposed to other AAA titles, how no one was talking about the map, performance or anything. Hell the biggest feature of this franchise, the map, was shown only a week eariler before release. And when it did release, I couldn't play the game because of the horrible optimization. That being said, after a few patches and buying more RAM, I finally got to play it. Now on to the review. GRAPHICS The graphics in this game speaks for itself. You can see farmlands, sunflower fields and scattered villages for miles. The spires of big bases have a very significant apperance of Di Ravello's oppresive regime. Beautiful sea beaches merge with coves and scattered cliffsides. At night the cities and bases light up and provide a beacon for it be discovered.  SOUND This game is a treat for the ear as much as the eye - guns sound powerful, sports cars sound ferociously fast and explosions give that great sound of satisfaction that you may not find in any other game.  MAP & GAMEPLAY Now on to the part which I found most controversial. The map of Just Cause 3 seems much more lackluster compared to JC2. There aren't any more landmark locations like the Mile High Club, the Radar Dish, or the Radio Tower. Instead there's just a lot of villages and bases. Sure they look unique from each other, but it's a step back from JC2. Also half of the biggest island is literally walled off and abandoned, where in a similar way in JC2 there were  a lot more villages, bases etc. Roads look like masking tapes put on the floor, the highways have no hoardings above them, there are no dividers and the biggest city - citate di ravello, is as lack luster as it can get. The gameplay is a bit cumbersome. Auto aiming is gone, so expect a lot missed shots. The health meter is gone, though now it's the same as not getting health pack like in JC2. The minimap is gone, so you won't know where are the enemies and you won't notice the remaining chaos objects without pausing the game and looking up on the map.Sure they changed the driving model, cars tend not to swivel out of control, but bikes on the other hand will behave realistically and just won't go straight. I wish  the Sleeping Dog's driving model was implemented here. The biggest change this game offers is the wingsuit and in the sky fortress dlc, it turns into a ♥♥♥♥ing jetpack. Though it's quite fun. It is only one step forward from the last game.  FINAL VERDICT Just Cause 3 behaves similarly to Just Cause 2,the map has been stripped to just bases and cities. As if the developers played a lot of Far Cry 3 and added it's wingsuit and nothing much else. There is much more accesibility, and the game is still jolly good fun. I'd recommend buying now. Because once this goes on sale, it'll just be another $5 game that you'll never play , another entry in your untouched game library.			"

												This game is an improvement to Just Cause 2 in every way. I'm not sure why the ""gaming community"" is so torn between it. Take Just Cause 2 and compare it to this one, because thats all it is, a sequel to a good game. The shooting part of the game actually works well, and you don't run out of bullets every 5 seconds running around looking for another gun, nor do you go through a whole clip trying to take down on person.The vehicles control like....vehicles? rather than little boxes that flip and go flying at every little bump in the road. The controls feel more realistic than the last game.I have seen people complaining about the story of this game. Why don't you load up a fresh game of JC2 and try to tell me the intro to that game isn't the worst piece of writing ever? I love the way the grapple hook works now, along with a wingsuit. Put that in with the first DLC that gives you a jet pack, gun and rocket launcher attached to the wingsuit, its the best addition to the series yet. My favorite complaint I have read on several reviews is that liberating towns is repetitive and boring. Did we not play the same game? Because thats exactly what you did in JC2, run around blowing everything up in a town or military base until you had control over it. The only difference now is that you aren't looking for crates of weapons, you're raising a flagI have also read about the ""long"" load times and long connection to get online. This is 2016, and a Q4 2015 game. Maybe consider buying an SSD and get with current gen hardware before complaining about long load times. Takes no time to load this game on my SSD.I'm even impressed with the graphics with what it requires, and doesn't. By that I mean the system requirements are higher than my system in certain aspects. Running an i5 3570K with 8 GB RAM and an Nvidia GTX 660. The recommended system req. are higher, however I have been running this game on max settings for 2 days now, flown around everywhere and tried lagging the game out with massive explosions, with no problems. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a game thats just about explosions and pure enjoyment, because that's what this game is. You run around and blow things up, this isn't a cure for cancer, and it isnt the second coming of christ. Try to remember this is a sequel to Just Cause 2. This isn't GTA, or JC2 Online where you boost around everywhere at 1000 MPH and have unlimited everything, and you too might one day be able to make your own opinion instead of mindlessly following others.

												I am seeing alot of negative feedback all saying it runs terrible, whether they are following the trend or I am lucky; I don't see the graphic glitches they speak of. Like any computer game, do not buy this title just because you meet minimum and expect it to wow you. I pick this up at a low price and since I played the second one I knew what to expect. I'd label it as a ""time filler"", running around blowing stuff up, grappling things are all things I'd throw on when bored.But that is the extent of it, story is not engaging at all. I found myself skipping cutscenes just to play, shooting needs work, whatever aim assist they have is dog♥♥♥♥♥♥and you will get angry when you get ""juggled"" by explosions. I personally enjoyed this game, not for the story, but for just bombing around in. DO NOT buy this is you don't well exceed the reccomended settings. Graphics are not terrible on the highest setting.			"

												I like this game. The graphic's and gameplay aren't as good as, let's say, GTA V, but this game does have some cool unique features which are a nice and welcome change to the usual 'freeroam-gameplay'. The missions are pretty fun, but get a bit repetitive. So does liberating the towns. A part I really enjoyed was searching for a fix to get the game to actually start. Turns out I had to underclock my CPU for it to work. Haha, that's fun! Get's even better when the game randomly crashes every now and then, and when mission objects simply dissapear. Great stuff! Haven't seen anything from the DLC's yet. I was hoping for a DLC that would allow me to save the resolution settings, instead of having to set them every single time I start the game. Haven't seen anything like that so far - but I'm only 8 hours in.			"

												If it's >=75% off, you have the money to spend and really enjoy Just Cause, sure.I bought this game during the Christmas sale at 20% off ($47.99 US) and have enjoyed my purchase, though I wish I'd waited for a deeper sale.PROS: - It's really fun in freeroam- The story is the best out of the series (e.g. terrible but enjoyable campy)- Avalanche knows the strengths of the series, so you're powerful but so is the AI- The wingsuit is a great addition- Nuke launcher- Tanks and helicopters with shields- It's amazing how good it is considering the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business practices- Great graphics, nice aesthetic- Plenty of easter eggs- Amazing explosionsNEUTRAL: - A lot of weapons are gated behind missions- Acceptable performance: Was above 50 fps 99% of the time, which is good for me, on a 980 (keep in mind my monitor is connected via HDMI so it's locked to 60) with every setting except AA maxed. Did see some stuttering in high-foliage environments like forests, but that's expected for me. CONS: - One save slot. On PC. Really.- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ always-online DRM (ironic because the enemy is called the DRM)- Most side missions to unlock gear mods are super boring*- Enemies can be bullet sponges- Buggy**- Moderately high pop-in- The volcano in the game does not have a base inside it- Load times in the 5-10 minute range, thanks to the before-mentioned always-online DRM- Once you complete the game, you must manually ""re-oppress"" every base seperately. And you need to teleport to that base to do it, which can take upwards of 30 seconds. Don't expect to easily have a new game plus run without save editing.*The wingsuit courses are fun, the gun range is super easy if you have a mouse, the rest are just annoying because you almost get x stars but are just off**I've noticed at least four bugs:-If you go at high enough velocity downwards, you go through the ground and have to swim to the coast, underground- Helicopters can instantly die if their rotors clip something because the rotors apparently have the mass of the whole helicopter- If you have precision aim (which is an unlockable upgrade, for some reason) on, missiles don't lock on. A patch tried to fix this, but it's still broken for me. This means you can't complete certain missions without restarting the game.- A ♥♥♥♥ton of flickeringNOTESThere's ~5-10 minutes of loading before starting the game. Probably an hour or two of my 'playtime' was loading, especially considering it sometimes didn't connect and so reconnected everytime I paused or opened a menu. This is in service of a leaderboard which is interesting but which doesn't justify the connection times or lack of an offline mode. You can physically unplug your internet or disconnect your computer, but it still attempts connection on every loading screen, even if you're offline on Steam. It's a testament to this game that I was able to still enjoy and recommend it. Also, I played it with the default version which did not include any DLC and I beat the campaign and liberated every base in 36 hours, which included significant ♥♥♥♥ing around.			"

												I was a big fan of JC2, I completed it for 95-97%, searching for boxes etc. I had fun, the same I had playing Saints Row IV.Now, I finally decided to buy JC3, and the main problem of that game: it's not fun to play it, it's boring!97% of reviewers complains about bad optimization and overall graphics quality. That's true, but if you have GTX 970+, you're almost ok, the game is playable. But I won't recommend you to do that.That game should be called JC2 HD edition. Some new tricks won't add much new in boring city-by-city freeing.I know, it's hard to add something revolutionary new in a game like that, but at least make changes in concept, to motivate people to raise another flag.Plus, they did something very strange with hook control, it acts very strange and stupid, especially while you try to capture a boat, for example. Hard to explain, but this is really a pain, trust me.And a lot of such downgrades, which makes you fight with controls instead of make amazing complexity tricks, we loved JC2 for.And yes, JC2 was 4gb installed size, this one occupies 50gb with prevgen console graphics, and cloned buildings/objects on the islands around (i.e. the same approach as in 4gb JC2, btw)! Compare it with The Witcher with all DLC's, and its amazing variety of the universe for the same 50gb.Maybe I just grew up since JC2 release, but I don't want to spend my time on that game anymore in near future (after 15 hours).I'm glad, I bought it on sale!UPD 30 jul 2016I took 8 months to fix perfomance on PC (another path seems solve this problem)!But guess what? Nobody cares now.And this patch won't fix the main problem of the game: boring, repeating and clumsy (buggy) gameplay.			"

												Fun game (if you like just running around blowing stuff up) that looks great. Unfortunately, there aren't a whole lot of large improvements over Just Cause 2, and many of the changes seem to be side-grades rather than upgrades (changes that are not objectively better than JC2).Would NOT recommend only because the game runs terribly, moreso the longer you play (my specs are above the min and I turned everything to 'low'). Seems to be some performance issues with the game that have not been fixed even 6 months after release. Also somehow they managed to make cars handle even worse than JC2.Specs: i5 3470, GTX 760, 8GB RAM, 1TB 7200 rpm HDD.			"

You have to put in way too much time and effort to make travel not abhorrently tedious, liberation is repetitive and annoying, once you get the  jetpack  there's no good reason to use vehicles, there's very little variation in the twenty or thirty weapons, and as far as I can tell it doesn't get much better as you get further into the story.But then again, I'm watching a video of a man spraypainting his mouth silver and playing with the glass shards from a mason jar he smashed.

However I did find it annoying how the weapon mods are limited to some side events I feel uncompelled to play.  Locking away the gear drops and vehicle drops feels like a limit to a game where I just want to bring the world down on my enemies. WHY DEVELOPERS? WHY DID YOU DO THAT?  The destruction numbers are arbitrary........... Why are they even there?! What do they serve?!? Telling me I caused 65million in arbitrary units. Also, why am I being told about some guy with a blue beard who was flying with the wingsuit for 5mins...... Screw it! I'm going to out fly him.Is it enjoyable? Yes. Does it have problems? Yes.

												I got it from a friend as a burthday since i wanted it so much, and so far from the air land and sea DLC, the DLC is outstanding, so is the main story, although there are some flaws such as-No Stoping Point for trains-The DLC storyline is only comic-The fact that everytime you look away from a road, new cars spawn in. (Trust me, i have gotten more deaths from an enemy armored car spawning while i was looking behind me than dieing from and heli's and gunshots.)-The Shadows do tend to flicker alot, causing my game to lag from 60FPS to 30FPS-The train (all of it, includeing its cars. tanks, and jets) are COMEPLEATLY invunerable from the ground, makeing impossible for them to explode.The Good things about the game in general are:-Advanced AI calculations (when to stop and get off, or when to get a tank to kill the player)-The mech's are exremely powerful and durable, and should stay like that-The Storyline (Main) Has basicly used you for Air (Cargo Jet) Land (EMP convoy) and sea (Nitrus Boat with mario!)-A good variety of cars, boats, tanks etc. to have as a rebel drop (The fastest boat nearly made me want to cry since i tried so hard to get it in a rebel drop)-A variety of secrets (for example the doge secret)-A good baised humor (although some parts Wierd)Overall a good game, how ever should fix some bugs.

This game moves fast, and your game will move slow if your computer is slow a snail.  So if you have a sub-par computer that does not meet the recommended requirements. Put this game in the wish list, becuase it is damn well worth it when you have a rig that can properly run it  (My GTX 960 and Haswell I7 run it at a crystal clear 60fps with ultra settings (AA at MSAA 4x)). Is this game perfect? No, it is not perfect. The main story is not the crux of the show, it comes in the form of the town clearing and the challenges. This game shoots itself in the foot by hampering a ridiculous amount of your power through the upgrade system, so while you are playing the game, do the challenges. No, you might not get 5 stars initially, but the upgrades are worth the effort. When you have even semi-maxed tethers and grenades, the♥♥♥♥♥♥you can do is so much fun that it's worth it.I do have to say that the wingsuit was the most frustrating part for me in terms of challenges. Not because of the variety and beautiful vistas that they take you through, but because of how poorly the wingsuit handled for me initially. Unfortunately, I have only a mouse and keyboard, but you can actually master the wingsuit with mouse and keyboard. If you tap the keys rapidly to do your maneuvers, you won't have your movement locked and faceplant into the ground. Just a piece of advice from me to you.To those who say the DLC is too short, I understand where you're coming from, but do not forget that the idea is to combine them and use them in the main game. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is really fun to go through Montagne and the mines with the DLC content. I would suggest playing through the vanilla content by itself initially, but the DLC content provided me an extra 25 hours of gameplay just by screwing around with the weapons that the DLC provide. Did I mention that the OST is amazing? The game feels so great with headphones while you blowing people to shreds. The game's appeal is not from using amazing gadgets, this is not your average Ubisoft open-world. It is a crazy game that will  NOT  hold your hand at baby dumb mode. You can't move around and kill easily on foot? No♥♥♥♥♥♥ the name of the game is to fly around and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up from the skies with your parachute and gadgets. You can beat the game by simply hitting♥♥♥♥♥♥with the gun on ground, but this is a classic Eidos game. There's more depth to it that you expect.It took me 95 hours to 100% this game over winter break, and it was one of the greatest times I've ever had with a game. If you have the rig to run it and the patience to get good at it, you will not regret it at all.			"

												Now, a lot of people have been complaining about this game's performance issues, but I can run it fairly well. 70 FPS most of the time with drops every now and then during large chains of explosions, but most of the time it's totally fine. Looking at this game from a gameplay perspective, it's absolutely incredible. The vastness of the world is incredibly fun and beautiful to explore using the wingsuit, and all of your tools to mess with physics and cause destruction work really well with that. There has been no times that I have been bored playing this game.			"

BUT as everyone says: The fps drops from about 60 to 40 or even 30 and if you dont have a good comuputer/laptop you arent able to play this game. So in MY opinion I think this is worth buying.			"

But it is very short, I finished the whole game in 20 hours. The devs make such a enormous map, but they kind of forget to make a big story.Oh, and by the way, the intro sucks. You have to watch to the brand of the devs for like 30 secs doing totally nothing.			"

												Just Cause 3?More like Just Explosions 3.Very pretty, and extremely enjoyable gameplay.My only real complaints are the memory leaks that make the game run slower than a Salirosan Skramp, and the liberation aspect. Once you've seen one town, you've seen them all, and it's just another after another. At least the military bases gave you something new to play with after you blew them to kingdom come! The towns...? Not so much.Overall, it's a really good game, definitely worth the price, unless you don't want to see things explode.The Tether is also the greatest weapon known to mankind. Flip helicopters, draw cars together, I had so much fun messing around with it.			"

												Just Cause 3 is a pretty fun and beautiful (can't stress that enough) game if you're not dealing with the crashes and bugs others seem to be. I must have been one of the lucky ones to be able to enjoy JC3 without any gamebreaking bugs. I did get a little mad when the game decided to crash during a cinematic scene after I beat the final boss (it did not save), but the overall experience I had with the game makes me give it a thumbs up.

												Feel free to liberate towns by blowing up statues and loudspeakers, assault military bases by exploding everything inside, or just goof around by making your chosen thing go boom. The developer has improved how escalation works in these scenarios, no longer lurching from single policeman to tanks the moment you’re spotted. For the first time, hiding is a viable tactic to lose heat, and a pleasant innovation allows you to spot somebody calling for backup and take them out accordingly. If things get too hairy you can even find sanctuary with a priest to reset the wanted counter to zero.The surroundings are so exquisite that sometimes it’s worth enduring the slideshow for the canapes and champagne. This is a sumptuous world teeming with stuff to do. The scripted campaign isn’t perfect but there are entertaining set pieces and I recommend doing at least the first few to gain essentials like supply drops and fast travel. It’s also worth taking on challenges like car races and wingsuit courses to obtain upgrades; you can compete against ghosts of your friends as an added incentive.Just Cause is a beautiful playground that allows you to star in your own totally ridiculous action film. It may lack depth but it’s hard to care when you’re grappling out of a crashing helicopter into the cockpit of a Formula One car. However, you definitely will care if your driving style is more Pastor Maldonado than Lewis Hamilton because the frame rate has slowed to a crawl. Hopefully patches will smooth everything out, but until then a potentially great game comes recommended.There are some known issues that occur with the most recent official release AMD/ATi graphics card drivers.Just Cause 3 already has several patches, but not everything is fixed yet.

												Why should you buy this game. Just Cause. Ok got that out of the way. Just Cause 3 is a open-world sandbox psychopath simulator where you fill the nitroglicerin filled shoes of Rico Rodrigez: professional dictator remover. No really that's his job title. Just Cause 3 is all about exploring a very beatiful series of islands and liberating them from a powerhungry despot by blowing them to oblivion. Liberate! The core gameplay revolves entirely around blowing stuff up and doing it with style. The entire sandbox is built around that design system and if you are looking for a more story driven experience then you better continue looking because this isn't your game. With that said I have adress the elephant in the room: that game has some notable technical issues that have made the game borderline unplayable for some people. I can run it pretty well on medium settings with some framerate drops when I'm blowing a military base into the stratosphere but so far there hasn't been any outright gamebreaking framedrops (My laptop uses a Nvidia 780M and I have 32GB of RAM). With that said if you don't have a decent video card and at least 12 GB of RAM I'd suggest holding off buying JC3. But if you have required specs the you should go for it.			"

												I just completed the game with 100% province and story completion, so my opinion in light of that:The Good: This is a spectacle shooter. If you like explosions, Rambo-like action, think 80s shooter movie, then you'll enjoy that aspect. The graphics are much better than Just Cause 2, and there are a few (not many) tweaks and changes made to your arsenal to open up some possiblities.The Bad: This isn't much of an evolution from Just Cause 2. It isn't worth $60, although it held my attention for 25+ hours, I do think it is a solid pick in the $30-$40 range, but I'd wait for a Steam Sale.The story is by-the-numbers, and there isn't much in the way of depth. Not much changed from the first province taken to the last. By the end I was just tired and wanting to complete it. The best part of the game is the voice acting of the Medici radio announcer, which is no surprise since I'm a Doctor Who fan. I was more concerned about his fate than the rest of the story. In any event, pick it up on a sale and if you go in with low expectations you'll have a great time. If there were a star rating, I'd give it a 3/5. "

												I have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of games. I play a lot of them. Just Cause 2 was one of my favorite gaming experiences of all time, from the corny voice acting to the unbelievable story, the constant explosions and utter insanity that was jumping out of a vehicle before sending it off a cliff to explode. JC3 is more like it's predecessor than some people will like, but I have played it for about 7+ hours now and I am having a complete blast. The similarity of settlements and military bases is a little boring at first but after rolling through a military base in a light tank, blowing up everything in sight time after time I can say that the destruction never gets old. I also understand that there are some people whow are having performance issues. I have an FX-8350 and a Tri-X 390X and am having no issues maintaining 60fps at 1080p using current beta drivers.			"

												I had no issues running this on my rig (GTX 1060 6GB, Intel Core i5 6500, 8GB of ram). The gameplay is improved over JC2 through many minor tweaks to various aspects. It feels less clunky and less restrictive than the previous game. The story is still pretty weak and predictable. The upgrade system is nice however the challenges are pretty meh. The way to unlock more abilities and thus improve your character is to succeed at random minigames dispersed throughout the map with no context. These challenges tend to be like fun little arcade games but they can get repetitive and occasionally frustrating. I personally dislike how far removed these things are from the rest of the game. Driving a car through hoops really fast doesn't feel at all connected to the goal of removing a dictatorship. I would still recommend this game because the open world feels like a better Just Cause 2 and it is fun to mess around with the civilians. I'd say pick it up when it's at $15 if you have a solid computer and enjoyed Just Cause 2.			"

												I have this on two PCs. The first one is an Acer Predator Desktop with an I5, 24 gb of ram and a Nvidia 735 in it. The game works great and doesn't have a single problem.My second computer is even beefier then that. It is an Asus ROG 501 and has an I7, 24gb of ram and a Nvidia 960 in it.  You wouldn't guess it was beefier because game runs as if it's on a stock computer with 2 gb of ram in it. So let this be a lesson that this game has a 50/50 chance of working for you which is sad since it is a AAA title. Devs are clearly trying to focus on DLC. 5/10 since the devs only put half the work in on it. This is the last Just Cause game I buy.			"

												Just Cause 2 was probably my favourite game of all time so I was desperately waiting when I heard that Just Cause 3 was announced at E3. My friend and I were talking about this game an aweful lot, because the graphics looked so great in the videos and we really wanted to blow more stuff up.I bought this game quite quickly after its launch and can stay that the experience has been quite awesome even though I've  got quite a couple of improvement points. First of all, for some reason my PC totally stops working after I finished a mission and move somewhere else. I need to manually restart my computer since none of my software works anymore. Secondly, I lost all of my progress one time, which was quite annoying...BUT, besides these bugs, I really enjoyed this game. The graphics are beautiful, the explosions enormous and overall I have created a LOT of chaos all over the map. And this is what this game exceeds at. Destruction, chaos and ruining stuff. That's why I loved Just Cause 2 and that is also why Just Cause 3 is my new favourite game!10/10 - Only bugs and glitches need to be fixed			"

												Just cause 3 is the ""homecoming"" of Rico Rodriguez, and it is set in his homeland. The Just Cause franchise is known for being an open world sandbox with destructible environment, and in the first hour you are given the freedom to do whatever you want. In my oppinion, it is one of my favourite games on the PC, i repeat, on the PC, i became a PC gamer on november on 2015, i give it a 9,5/10, and here's why:Pros: It's a very fun game, with tons of explosions, and the destructible environment make it seem believable. You can fly wherever you want from the first hour of the game. Some challenges are really cool, especially the wingsuit ones, i became a master at them, my lowest score being 4/5. You are not told to play the main story, you need to play only like 4-5 missions until you get all the mission upgrades, the last one being the ability to save cars in your garage. You can drive any vehicle you see. Flying and sailing controls are really good, the driving ones are okay, but they are very, very sensitive and require a lot of practice. The wingsuit is very fun The bases are the best part in the game in my oppinion, you need to destroy almost anything that is ""red"" to complete the base, and then you will be given challenges(everywhere), vehicle unlocks(at military bases), and garages(at cities). You can destroy things in the way you like, and you can get very creative in this game. You can attach anything with your grappling hook.Cons: The story is very boring and unattractive.-Rico can take a lot, and recover from it in 2 seconds, more realism would be better. There is an empty area in the game. You get huge 2-3 huge bases from the beggining without liberating, it would be fun if you had to liberate them too, the military bases are the best.Summary:I recommend you buy this game at any price. It is worth it!			"

												The game gets boring fast and there aren't that many story missions, but if you want GTA V with wingsuits, infinite parachutes, hand hooks and sick destruction mechanisms this is the game for you. Good 6-10 hours of pure fun.			"

												PC version crashes constantly and the devs have never fixed it. Do not buy at any price. The game is all flash and no substance. feels like the worse parts of Ubisoft titles bundled together only more boring. Just Cause 2 is better than this play that instead.			"

												Overall I recommend this game because it is just plain fun however find it at a cost you are willing to pay. Deals can be had or be found.I have played 30-40 hours at this point on a friends system over the last two months and just bought this for mself in the last two weeks. Not a ton of time but enough to see the best and worst i believe.I also play this on a older AMD Phenom II with a AMD R9 390. I have seen a few framerate issues at times but they have been few and far between now that the game has been patched a few times. This game is a great deal of fun especially now that some of the worst bugs have been fixed. The storyline is decent, I have had fun playing thru so far but where this game shines is simply the open world mechanics. You can go anywhere and destroy anything and be as inventive as you want in doing it, here i have just scratched the surface. I'd call it a open world simulator with a Story line and plot. You can chose to play the story or just go around the massive island and destroy with wild abandon. The game still has bugs and will force close on occasion and others that are annoying. Unless you find a good sale it is still costly to purchase but you can get 15%-20% off min at GreenMan usually.ProsOpen WorldDecent storyReplay valueConsBugsCost			"

												The campaign is lots of fun, the graphics are amazing and the weapons/abilities are so versatile. But once you complete the campaign, there's not much left to do. With no multiplayer, all you can do is run around getting collectibles or buy a DLC.In conclusion, the game has very little playtime without DLCs.			"

												----- Very Early Review -----Ok, so i bought this game yesterday, and only played the game for an hour and a half. Here is how i felt about playing it so far. The game crashed at the first mission when i was on the plane, when i had to shoot the first building, it just crashed, after a restart, it ran fine. The game actually ran really fluent, the time i was playing, i did not expect that when reading all the negative comments. It runs at a really acceptable frame rate for me, pretty fast, considering my hardware, i do luckely have 16G of Ram (I have read there is a memory leak in it.) though, i do think it will crash some more in the future :) I really laughed when i heard the ""Firestarter"" cover for the first time, and the stupidity of the explosions and destructables, and fighting the ""DRM"", made me smile from ear to ear. I think it would be a great game for a party evening, or for newyears eve in the background, easy to pick up, and easy ""to have a blast"" :)Will update when played more.			"

												Denuvo is a huge problem with this game. Every time this game is launched and then closed it does not release the RAM that it has set aside for the game causing high RAM usage until my system is restarted every time I play the game. The game is also very tedious and boring as the gameplay is just the same thing again and again.			"

Requires a lot of computer power though (I actually had to get a new GPU to run it) and it has a slightly large price tag (I think the price tag is mostly worth it).I SERIOUSLY recommend you buy this game, if you:1.

Just Cause 3 has way better graphics, more to explore and ways to explore them .. AI has always been my gripe about the game but its not GTA nor is it trying to be.. It does make it feel lifeless at times and very solitary but all in all a great game and a late review.			"

												Okay so I have probably played this game for a good 40 hours now offline + online. And I can safely say that it is a breath of fresh air in its design freedom and overall entertaining values. This game is a lot of fun! But the good wear out fast. After a while the design of the game makes it feel like a chore and destroys the whole enjoyment. And the things you do do not really affect the world around you and that becomes more noticable every other second I play it. Stunning Graphics horrible performance but I have a gtx 1070 so I manage, pick it up when its on sale but dont count on a long enjoyable gaming time this game should be played in short bursts even tho it isnt desinged to be played so.

												If you're prone to motion sickness like me dont buy this game, no settings to change FOV or camera distance make this game almost unplayable. Its graphics are a step up from the previous game but the world looks very bland compared to Just Cause 2. But my biggest issue with the game is its controls: grappling and using your wingsuit/parachute is a lot harder and driving/flying is near impossible. In Just Cause 2 these things were a breeze and made it possible to raise hell and do all the crazy stuff the series is known for. Just Cause 3 does add a lot of gameplay elements and new ways to go about doing these things but in its current state its hard to do these and pull of cool♥♥♥♥♥♥ which is a shame since thats the main selling point of the series in my opinion. Story wise not much to say the plot/writing is still crap and the voice acting is as bad as always.I wont be playing much Just Cause 3 until these issues are resolved, and i would not recommend buying this game in its state, especially not at full price.

												I don't know why people are complaining about perfomance. I've got an i7 965 and a GTX 970 at work and the game runs beautifully on high at 5760X1200 across 3 screens. At home I've got an ASUS G751 laptop with an i7 4710 and a GTX 980M and it's running on Ultra @ 1080P smooth as butter.  The game itself is an extension of Just Cause 2, the story is meh, the dialogue is pretty lame, the overall design of the game is ""ok"" at best. But the sandbox world and the physics alone are worth the money. I'm very happy with it so far and I'm sure with patches it'll just continue to improve.			"

												Pros and Cons have been editedl, and thankfully now the game is playable.Just Cause 3 is open world, action and shoot em up game set in a fiction island called Medici, which is basically Fascist Italy and Falange Spain with some Cuban elements and a leader who read Kim Jong Un's biography. The goal of them game? BOMB THE F**K OUT OF EVERYTHING. Just Cause 2 remains better, but JC3 is definitely rivalling it, and definitely better than the original. Take this scenario: You're back from work, tired and stressed out. You're angry at the communist muslim reptile man Obama for taking your money and spending it on mexicans so they can steal your job. What do you do? Carpet Bomb civilians, because ya know, freedom. Bored with nothing to do? Carpet Bomb civilians. Homework you don't want to do? Carpet Bomb Civilians.Want to enjoy a good storyline? Get a different game... After carpet bombing civilians.Just Cause 3 is a solid 8/10, reasons below.+Different types of assault rifles and shotguns+You can call in bomb raids anywhere+Name on other game except fallout where you can detonate a nuke+You don't need to worry about money, just call in rebel drops for free fighter jets.+Grenade Mods.+A ton of easter eggs to find.+One of your missions involves kissing a cow and delivering alcohol while avoiding a truck that explodes+Italian Sportscar racing simulator 2015-Story could be less predictable, but is a huge improvement and is longer than the last two-Placing your triggered explosives on helicopters takes about 50 attempts-Physics are once again a huge improvement, but still really annoying.-----ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW-----As of now, I wish I opted for the PS4 version.PROSIts Just CauseMASSIVE EXPLOSIONSCool carsRebel Drop is a better alternative to black marketDifferent types of Assault Rifles, Handguns etc.CONSWingsuit is hard to get used toNeeds a JC2 control layoutGonna wait for a patch... Right now it's unplayable and hard to enjoy. Back to Just Cause 2 I suppose.			"

												Just Cause 2 was probably my favourite game of all time so I was desperately waiting when I heard that Just Cause 3 was announced at E3. My friend and I were talking about this game an aweful lot, because the graphics looked so great in the videos and we really wanted to blow more stuff up.I bought this game quite quickly after its launch and can stay that the experience has been quite awesome even though I've  got quite a couple of improvement points. First of all, for some reason my PC totally stops working after I finished a mission and move somewhere else. I need to manually restart my computer since none of my software works anymore. Secondly, I lost all of my progress one time, which was quite annoying...BUT, besides these bugs, I really enjoyed this game. The graphics are beautiful, the explosions enormous and overall I have created a LOT of chaos all over the map. And this is what this game exceeds at. Destruction, chaos and ruining stuff. That's why I loved Just Cause 2 and that is also why Just Cause 3 is my new favourite game!10/10 - Only bugs and glitches need to be fixed			"

												I just completed the game with 100% province and story completion, so my opinion in light of that:The Good: This is a spectacle shooter. If you like explosions, Rambo-like action, think 80s shooter movie, then you'll enjoy that aspect. The graphics are much better than Just Cause 2, and there are a few (not many) tweaks and changes made to your arsenal to open up some possiblities.The Bad: This isn't much of an evolution from Just Cause 2. It isn't worth $60, although it held my attention for 25+ hours, I do think it is a solid pick in the $30-$40 range, but I'd wait for a Steam Sale.The story is by-the-numbers, and there isn't much in the way of depth. Not much changed from the first province taken to the last. By the end I was just tired and wanting to complete it. The best part of the game is the voice acting of the Medici radio announcer, which is no surprise since I'm a Doctor Who fan. I was more concerned about his fate than the rest of the story. In any event, pick it up on a sale and if you go in with low expectations you'll have a great time. If there were a star rating, I'd give it a 3/5. "

												I got to play this game for a solid few hours and had a blast. This game is amazingly fun and so immersive it can keep me engaged in so many different ways. Kinda hoped a multiplayer thing would have been checked out, but oh well. Overall This was a great purchase and a steal for $30 on sale.   The only reason I don't reccomend this game is, unless you have a proper system to run this, it will not run in any stable form whatsoever. I have tried so many times to troubleshoot and scour for solutions to the cause of this locked 99% memory usage in my pc whenever I play this game. It does not stop until you restart your computer unfortunately.   The game ran like a champ my first session playing which was strange, no issues at all minus a few frame drops, but I have a mid end PC so i understand the issues. However when i came back the next day to load a save, nothing could stop this memory thing from happening, tried every posted solution, tweaking with gpu settings for the program, complete reinstallation, and launch commands. I'm sorry for the downvote, but it is unplayable in its current state.  I hope this can be fixed relatively soon, I would love to retract my downvote and be able to write an actual review to this game.			"

												I will just downvote the game because for waht it suppose to be (fun destruction in unique ways) it fails so bad its just sad all they had to do was gives us things to blow now exercices to be able to blow up things and do other stuff in a fun way.Problem is you are forced to do chalanges no exeptions what so ever not unless you dont want to unlock anything like rocker powered c4 to stick on people and tanks and whats them fly and cause masive destrucion or just laugh nop got to do chalanges ohh and thats not the bad part, the bad part most chalanges are completely bugged there one where you have to drive a car at surtain speed or you lose more points and then jump out just before hitting your targets to destroy them as the car is the bomb. well problem is they dont get destroyed by the explosion of your car or your car explodes as soon as you jump out so you cant complete it at all it just make no difference what you do (some of these type of chalanges seem to be okey as in work but about 40% dont), These challanges just screw it up completely you start getting infuriated to get those 5 gears you need for stupid♥♥♥♥♥unlocks and maybe you even want the achievement, they give 0 fun, make 0 sense why not give gear unlocks for destroing bases so we can have fun and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up experiment any way we want and at the end get nice stuff for it, this aint dark souls ♥♥♥♥♥, yet its so much harder especialy cause of the broken chalanges that exist for no reason other then to distract you from fun and then infuriate you so much that even when you get nice stuff you dont give a damn any more you just had 2 hours of broken♥♥♥♥♥chalanges that were uter dissaster and the last thing on your mind is using those unlocks anywhere ells cause you probebly have to take paracytamol to deal with the furry and headache you have now. I know i had to. in short they made a fun game for 10% of the game but they made you get infuriated and uterly wanting to shred your keyboard to peaces just so you could have a tiny bit of fun later... ggg who ever made this♥♥♥♥♥♥game here how ya fix it remove all chalanges boom revies go up we have fun idiots...(ps it has random chrashes after 2 years of release (well techincaly less but they dont listen to player feed back so they wont get fixed, also memory leak have fun the more you destroy the more later it will lag lol so dont destroy and profit?)

												After playing this game for 50+ hrs and 100% completing the game and all the achievements I think I can say my own opinions on the game.The story is decent and I suggest not skipping the cutscenes as the game does not take itself too seriously.The game is not about the story however, EXPLOSIONS and magnificent they are! There are so many bases and villages to liberate/destroy; the map is huge with too little bases. It over one thousand square kilometres big with only about 60-100 bases. Obviously a lot, but it's extremely empty while just walking around.A problem many people have with the game is the performance, I have an overclocked GeForce GTX 970 and a standard Intel i7-4790k processor but I still average about 70 fps with fully optimised game.Verdict: I think you should get this game if you like giant explosions and huge open world games. If you want story, this is not the game. I suggest buying this game now aslong as your computer can handle it.			"

												It's cheezy, it's over the top, there are explosions, there is bad humor, but most of all it's just fun and it looks good too. I like it a lot, more so than Just Cause 2.All in all, you don't need to write essays over a game like this, but on discount, you should pick it up. Full price? Well there's a lot of content but it's too repetitive to warrant a 50€ pricetag. 30€ and you're golden.			"

												Despite some of the PC issues, I still think this is a fantastic expansion from Just Cause 2. It looks to me like the developers took into account the JC2 mods that were most popular, and made an official implementation for them and added a new map and storyline to make JC3. For example:The multi-grapple mod in JC2 is an upgrade you get get in JC3!The super-strength grapples mod in JC2 is an upgrade in JC3 also!The superman mod in JC2 is the wingsuit, of course without the propulsion. It helps you cover distance faster (and is so much fun), which is why I got the superman mod in JC2. Here's some pros and cons....Pros:-Great upgrade system!-Great graphics!-My rig (NVIDIA GTX 980, i5-4460, 8GB ram, 144hz monitor) handles it very well, hitting 80-110fps on absolute max settings (measured using nvidia geforce experience fps overlay). Of course, I waited a few months to get the game because I had heard it had bad performance on PC, so they must have patched some of the issues. Cons:-Terrible vehicle control. I mean, atrocious. Doing the races in JC3 isn't that fun. (But who needs a car when you have a wingsuit:)-Occasional crashes. -Fairly long load time for HDD users. -Spawns are still just as annoying as they were in JC2. Don't you love it when you see a spot in a military facility that you'd love to plant some explosives on, then see that no enemy units are there, then land and plant the first bomb. Suddenly the military is crawling out from behind all the buildings like the goblins in the mines of Moria, then you subsequently die from being riddled with bullets like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris had a grudge against you with an automatic 50 cal with incendiary armor piercing adamantium rounds (if you understand all those references, you rock! )-Moderately short campaign, which is made up for by all the free play you feel compelled to do after the campaign is done. -One serious bug that made one of the campaign missions unplayable (jet rockets wouldn't lock-on due to precision aim upgrade). I simply had to deactivate the upgrade temporarily for that mission. There's probably other cons I've simply forgotten because the game is so dang good! There is sooooo much experimenting you can do with the retracting grapple with the strength mods! I regularly like to drag civilian cars to the top of buildings XDOverall rating:So much fun, but -1 due to some bugs and bad vehicle control. 9/10 would grapple-retraction-launch civilians 700 meters again			"

The graphic in the game is so nice when you have in on high, becuase the vehicles and buildings and nature are so good and looks so real.

												For those who don't have i7's and gtx 980's, etc, the game is still great! The stutters / lags have been fixed in the latest nvidia drivers. A lot of people complained about the game because of performance issues when it came out, but I'm having a blast with it now.I have a single GTX 960 and an i5 6600, and for 10 years I've been using the Matrox TH2GO to run triple monitors on every computer I had (my first taste of triple screening was Oblivion, with the TH2GO I was able to run three screens on a simple 9800 GT!). I'm running it triple screen at 3 x 1440 x 900 (the native res of my monitors) and I'm having no problem running on max graphics settings with my gtx 960.Triple screening works natively with this game, and I think they've done a good job of it. My only minor quibble is the keyboard interface - for some reason they made CTRL the default 'back / cancel / escape' key. I keep pressing ESC in menus, before I remember I have to press CTRL to go backward.Anyway, I've only played for an hour so far - but I really like it, and just wanted to point out that the lag is indeed fixed, it runs triple screens great, and it plays just great on a GTX 960.specs:i5 6600asus strix gtx 960 4gb8 gb ram 2133 mhz			"

Also:Find fuel tank.Tether fuel tank to helicopter.Ascend with helicopter.Jump out of helicopter.Profit.			"

												Just Cause 3 is the sequel to Just Cause 2. Just Cause 3 is a game designed for destruction and is definitley by far one of the most destructive games compared to its previous games. Avalanche studios has done a really good job here, the game looks beautiful on pc, but what Avalanche havent done is optimize it enough for pc the game has a lot of framerate drops which is really disapointing but on the other hand Just Cause can be extremely fun like gliding around and just taking in the scenery, now do not even ask because the driving is awful which is to be expected from a Just Cause game but riding planes and Jets are really done well and I mean now combined with the Grappling hook, Wingsuit and parachute you can now do anything. Now the story is not all that great but its a Just Cause game and its not really known for its story. Overall Just Cause 3 is a fun game that has some flaws here and their but its still a good game none the less.8/10			"

												This is a really fun game if you know what you're going in to before playing. If you want a free roam game where you can blow stuff up in whatever way you can imagine, this game is for you. If you want a game with a rich story, this won't satisfy your needs. The story can be summed up as rebels fighting against an evil dictator. So here are a couple of my pros and cons that resulted in a positive review.Pros:-Explosions. Alright? It's a blast.-Variety of vehicles-Wingsuit, parachute, and grapple (once you learn how to use them they're extremely rewarding)-Did I mention explosions?-Beautiful scenery (a relaxing contrast from the constant explosions)-Freedom of Choosing your own way around-ExplosionsCons:-My gosh, the bugs. Specifically graphic related bugs. (nothing an immense amount of troubleshooting and reading can't fix though)-Lack of an interesting story, although the characters can be interesting at times-Minimum specs don't seem to be correct on the store page			"

												Don't get me wrong, this game can be fun and entertaining (especially so if you like explosions). However, it's still terribly buggy and laggy after a full year of being released and the gameplay also becomes repetitive (as expected from a game like this).I get as low as a 'cinematic' 25fps in cities (with explosions) with a GTX 1080 at 1080p. As for bugs, the most glaring one to me is that I'm stuck playing the game windowed, because if I put it fullscreen it makes the image blurry and the UI unusable because it offsets my mouse cursor and some buttons just dont work. Unfortunately, there is no borderless mode (I haven't looked into it, maybe there is with launch options) and the game doesn't lock your mouse cursor so I find myself clicking off screen and freezing the game occasionally.The gameplay itself is fun but gets repetitive (think of Far Cry) after liberating a few cities. If there were more variety in the cities, and there is some, but if there was a big enough differences for me to be able to say ""Oh, this is where I had to do XX to liberate it."" The story (I have yet to finish it) isn't really engaging but it drives along the game a bit, mostly it's just ""Kill this person"" or ""Hijack this tank"", the generic stuff.			"

At home I've got an ASUS G751 laptop with an i7 4710 and a GTX 980M and it's running on Ultra @ 1080P smooth as butter.  The game itself is an extension of Just Cause 2, the story is meh, the dialogue is pretty lame, the overall design of the game is ""ok"" at best. But the sandbox world and the physics alone are worth the money. I'm very happy with it so far and I'm sure with patches it'll just continue to improve.			"

												If you're prone to motion sickness like me dont buy this game, no settings to change FOV or camera distance make this game almost unplayable. Its graphics are a step up from the previous game but the world looks very bland compared to Just Cause 2. But my biggest issue with the game is its controls: grappling and using your wingsuit/parachute is a lot harder and driving/flying is near impossible. In Just Cause 2 these things were a breeze and made it possible to raise hell and do all the crazy stuff the series is known for. Just Cause 3 does add a lot of gameplay elements and new ways to go about doing these things but in its current state its hard to do these and pull of cool♥♥♥♥♥♥ which is a shame since thats the main selling point of the series in my opinion. Story wise not much to say the plot/writing is still crap and the voice acting is as bad as always.I wont be playing much Just Cause 3 until these issues are resolved, and i would not recommend buying this game in its state, especially not at full price.

												To be honest this is probably my favorite game ever. i don't care what anyone says i love it. a few complaints i usually see is bad driving mechanics and it can crash more frequently than other games. now i have played it on Xbox one and PC and have logged over 50 hours on Xbox but my answer (maybe not the right answer) to these complaints are it was just ported poorly for PC. i use an Xbox controller when i play it on PC, compared to mouse and keyboard, feels smoother and just better. the second complaint i mentioned was crashes. now i have only crashed a few times when playing but it was because i was using a lot of memory on my computer. my computer is an ASUS republic of gaming PC with 2 processors and a GTX 960 Graphics card and it runs almost smoothly on max settings. i prefer the PC edition of this game because mods (duh) and i just prefer PC. i hope this review made anyone look at the game in a different way or just explain anything about why its not so high rated on steam.

The first time I loaded up the game, everything seemed to be fine. I got into the game and out of the first cutscene, but that's when things started going wrong. Voice errors and terrible lag had more of a definite presence than actual gameplay. I'm not recommending this game on steam, but I'm recommending you get it on a console, if at all.			"

												Fun, pretty, almost well made game.So I've been playing this game for about 12 hours straight since I bought it, when compared to Just Cause 2, it feels much more alive, unlike the island nation of Panau, places you liberate, stay nice and populated and there are always cars on the road, so it feels more like a real place.I've had a lot of fun blowing things up as the devs really tried this time to make you care about the story just a little bit, but when you get a game that has a huge focus on blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up, you can't really expect me to follow the plot and remember who any of the characters are, I barely remember the protagonists' name, and that's only because they keep calling you by name, that's the reason I know his name at all, but it's so painfully irreverent, that you forget it instantly.Some of the design choices are questionable, I'm talking about the controls that take some getting used to, since the space bar is used to open the parachute on foot and inside cars, the handbrake is Shift, so naturally when you want to use the handbrake, you're going to find yourself jumping out of the car and opening the parachute, and you can change the open parachute in car to shift and handbrake to spacebar, but holding down spacebar will still open the parachute in the car, you have to change both on foot and in car settings if you want anything to work, so that's probobly due to the fact that this game was clearly developed for the consoles, and then poorly ported to PC, another evidence to that is how much of a resource hog this game is! I heard people with 980Ti and 1080 having problems with it, so me with my 780Ti had my work cut out for me, but when I started playing, it didn't seem bad, on ultra I got 30 fps, after some fine tuning, I got to 60... but they it started to rain! This game has one of the cheapest looking rain effects in recent years, but it just eats away at your GPU! From a good and stable 60fps, I got 5-10 when the rain started! After turning the water effects off, I got normal frame rate again. They are slowly fixing the issues with the game, so it's getting better.My final advice is: Do not spend full price on this, a developer that does a lazy job on a port, is one that does not deserve the 60$ price he asks for, if the game is above 20$, do not pay for it, I got it on sale for 15$, that's around the price it's worth			"

												It's like just cause 2 remastered. I would recommend playing just cause 2 first then getting this game on sale. If you can get this game on sale then get it otherwise not really worth full price. i only got this game because it was on sale for £10.This game feels too much like just cause 2. it has the same story, There is a corrupt person controlling the country, you have to stop him. It would have been great if the story had a bit more imagination and felt like something new.Again i recommend playing and finishing just cause 2 before playing this, get this game on sale.edit: something i forgot to mention was that a change from jc2, instead of unlocking guns then upgrading them with the crates you find in bases and villages they have added these challenges which are your average time trials and shooting targets. You have to 5 star or 5 gear all of these to unlock all of the unlockables. These unlockables aren't hats ect. they are abilitys like having more tethers and being able to carry more grenades. It is a bit boring at the start and i found myself installing a mod thay unlocks them all. Not because im bad but because the challenges are either hard or just boring. The challenges are repetitive and get boring. I would recommend installing a mod that unlocks them all. LINK TO MOD: https://justcause3mods.com/mods/unlock-all-gear-mods/ "

												TL;DR THIS GAME IS SO BADLY OPTIMISEDNow for the real review.From first glance this game looks perfect. A badass character blowing up structures with a sweet phisics engine.And then you play the game. ""Oh sweet look at all dem explosions!"" you say ""This is awesome!"" And then... ""What happened to the frames"" That is exactly what i said when playing this game. I even turned down the settings to the lowest just to play it but it spits right back at me and just gives me 2 more frames. I've read a review about how this game lags because Rico blows up lots of stuff but most of the lag comes from wingsuiting around the place, which is one of the most fun ways to get around. And even when I do start to blow things up it lags a little less for some reason, about 2 fps instead of -198382017398406738362947193719437597 fps.In conclusion don't buy this game unless your computer was blessed by Lord Gaben.PS.

												This is the worst $60 game I have ever played. I have a 980Ti overclocked through the roof and I still get frame loss. Like how??? The game also has some questionable design choices. Example?There's a little base you can capture, however you will get air strike after air strike called on you while you try to liberate it. One would assume these would stop if you liberate the base? Nope. You can liberate the base but you will be blown up endlessly if you dare step foot in it. Meanwhile all the rebel npcs just walk around like nothing is happening. The game gives not a single explanation how to stop these. Awesome.If this game was like $10, I'd say get it. Otherwise, definitely not.			"

												I dont even know what to say, this game has been on my wishlist since december. The story is not that good as many say, but if your computer is good enough, this game has fun that can last for months... no, even YEARS. i suggest if you have this game to get challenges like ""tether a plane to a helicopter and fly high into the air, jump off the helicopter and land onto the plane and fly off"" to be honest, this isnt the hardest of things. this game can pack alot of fun, the explosions are great, sunsets are beautiful. and must of all. MODS. that will last you alot of fun. as you read this, people are developing mods for this game. if you dont like story heavy games, this deserved to be at the top of your wishlist.

I personally did not like JC2 the most, but this game changed my mind.Pros:+Great Physics engine+You can do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want+Wingsuiting+Enhanced tethering+Very vibrant and colorful island+WingsuittiiinnnnngggCons:-Laughable story-The gear mod challenges are a joke. In a game based entirely around the fact that you use your tethers and the environment to complete your objectives in the most contrived way possible, you are tasked with ""fly through x many rings to get points to unlock content"". Great Idea guys...-Liberating settlements can get repeptitiveOverall, after having completed the game, and liberated every settlement, I find myself coming back to this game time and time again, just to fly around the beautiful world, drive the cars, and spawn♥♥♥♥♥♥in to blow dudes up.If youre into that, this game will be fun, if not, and if you did not enjoy JC2, this game sadly will get stale very quickly.

You have got the aim to finish it with 100% but you wont do this because its the same everytime like Far Cry.The graphics are great and it runs smooth with a GTX 960, I7 6700k and 16 Gb of RAM on ultra settings.The story isn't important because you only want to destroy everything and thats the best thing of Just Cause 3.

I picked this game up on sale with 75% off. That makes the game worth it for me, not the full price tag they want. So yes i recommend the game (if you can run it), but pick it up on sale.			"

												I think this game is more fun than its predecessor. However, that's just when the framerate is normal...This game has some serious memory problems. I've got a pretty decent computer, so normally the game can render 60 fps. However, it frequently drops or freezes as soon as the game spawns new actors or geometry or something else happens. I did stomp the settings to almost lowest possible and it helped a little (probably mostly because of texture size), but I still get jerky FPS.For extra irritation, you can't properly customize your keybindings in the game. If you do, the game adds two entries in the keymap file that the game isn't able to read. This leads to the game defaulting the controls every time you start the game. Also, there are multiple entries that can be changed in the config file that doesn't appear in the custom key binding screens, which means that the keys you happen to bind on those keys may get interrupted. Like (hold) Detonate Explosives on F (you can only rebind (tap) Detonate Explosives), and Look At on R.There is a workaround for this, by editing an unmodified kepmap.txt (not a typo), but it shouldn't be needed. I can't see how the config thing can be that hard to fix that it isn't sorted out a half year after release.Until these things are fixed, I would not recommend anyone getting this game. If they do fix these issues, I would happily recommend the game, because it is really fun (to me at least) when I don't experience those frustration elements.			"

												Good game? Yes.Well performing game? Eh not really, quite demanding of resources so frames will be low throughout, putting graphics on medium and turning of V-sync slightly helps, and going offline also seems to give some performance boost, but the poor performance is most noticeable when you are in the heat of a battle.Ok so a bit more in depth now:Driving mechanics- for quite a few reviewers there seems to be issues with controlling vehicles. Personally I use keyboard and mouse and it works fine, though I did need to remap some controls to suit me I got used to it pretty quick.Flying (vehicle) mechanics- by far better than driving, maybe because there is less that you can crash into, until you get onto planes. The boost gear mod makes you crash into the runway whenever I try to take off.Vehicles in general: Planes are annoying, you can hijack pretty much any vehicle instantly, military vehicles are overpowered as all heck but I'm down with that.Flying (wingsuit) mechanics- Ok so the vehicles aren't great but the character certainly is   so long as you dont ragdoll a hundred feet into water that is   . Personally the wingsuit is my favourite method of travel, the feeling of seeing Rico (your character) glide so close to the ground, grappling along elegantly is absolutely brilliant, one of the most satisying feats I have personally done in probably all my time gaming came from my first few hours playing this game when I managed to fly over a bridge alongside some cars.Ragdoll mechanics- These are annoying pretty much every time you fail anything and get sent sprawling across the floor, especially when you get into combat, it is all just a bit too long and slow.Combat mechanics- Pretty much the same as any other third person shooter, with a few differences such as the grapple hooks and no melee at all, save a kick/shove. Tanks shoot things, helicopters/choppers fly and shoot things, lots of explosions etc.Territory system/map control- Not particularly exciting, you can just keep flying into a certain base, shoot one target, die, come back, shoot another over and over until you get everything should you so wish. Dying results in no penalties, leaving enemy territory half broken doesnt result in the enemy rebuilding it and liberating territories as a whole is a bit too easy, but this game really isnt meant to be taken too seriously.Civilians- Generic talk, generic player play foddle, but this time you can tie them together, attatch them to a car and drive them off a cliff.Action vs Wandering about- the map is big, you can teleport places and call in vehicles but these require flares and such which are quite difficult to find so you will do a lot of running or flying or driving or, Leonardo Da Vinci forbid, swimming, but even so there is plenty to do, and you wont have to travel far to find a place to liberate, unless you find yourself going back on yourself.DLC- they seem worthit, though short. They do provide some content but the Sky Fortress dlc took me about an hour tops to complete. Eden so they are fun.Collectibles- There are a lot, dont go crazy trying to get them all because it will ruin the experience. Just take yer time I'd say.Overall: It is a good game, possibly get it when on sale though, and be prepared to face some (pretty major) lag and fps drops. Even so it is still a good game, and I recommend.			"

												Fun, pretty, almost well made game.So I've been playing this game for about 12 hours straight since I bought it, when compared to Just Cause 2, it feels much more alive, unlike the island nation of Panau, places you liberate, stay nice and populated and there are always cars on the road, so it feels more like a real place.I've had a lot of fun blowing things up as the devs really tried this time to make you care about the story just a little bit, but when you get a game that has a huge focus on blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up, you can't really expect me to follow the plot and remember who any of the characters are, I barely remember the protagonists' name, and that's only because they keep calling you by name, that's the reason I know his name at all, but it's so painfully irreverent, that you forget it instantly.Some of the design choices are questionable, I'm talking about the controls that take some getting used to, since the space bar is used to open the parachute on foot and inside cars, the handbrake is Shift, so naturally when you want to use the handbrake, you're going to find yourself jumping out of the car and opening the parachute, and you can change the open parachute in car to shift and handbrake to spacebar, but holding down spacebar will still open the parachute in the car, you have to change both on foot and in car settings if you want anything to work, so that's probobly due to the fact that this game was clearly developed for the consoles, and then poorly ported to PC, another evidence to that is how much of a resource hog this game is! I heard people with 980Ti and 1080 having problems with it, so me with my 780Ti had my work cut out for me, but when I started playing, it didn't seem bad, on ultra I got 30 fps, after some fine tuning, I got to 60... but they it started to rain! This game has one of the cheapest looking rain effects in recent years, but it just eats away at your GPU! From a good and stable 60fps, I got 5-10 when the rain started! After turning the water effects off, I got normal frame rate again. They are slowly fixing the issues with the game, so it's getting better.My final advice is: Do not spend full price on this, a developer that does a lazy job on a port, is one that does not deserve the 60$ price he asks for, if the game is above 20$, do not pay for it, I got it on sale for 15$, that's around the price it's worth			"

												It's like just cause 2 remastered. I would recommend playing just cause 2 first then getting this game on sale. If you can get this game on sale then get it otherwise not really worth full price. i only got this game because it was on sale for £10.This game feels too much like just cause 2. it has the same story, There is a corrupt person controlling the country, you have to stop him. It would have been great if the story had a bit more imagination and felt like something new.Again i recommend playing and finishing just cause 2 before playing this, get this game on sale.edit: something i forgot to mention was that a change from jc2, instead of unlocking guns then upgrading them with the crates you find in bases and villages they have added these challenges which are your average time trials and shooting targets. You have to 5 star or 5 gear all of these to unlock all of the unlockables. These unlockables aren't hats ect. they are abilitys like having more tethers and being able to carry more grenades. It is a bit boring at the start and i found myself installing a mod thay unlocks them all. Not because im bad but because the challenges are either hard or just boring. The challenges are repetitive and get boring. I would recommend installing a mod that unlocks them all. LINK TO MOD: https://justcause3mods.com/mods/unlock-all-gear-mods/ "

												This is a really fun game if you know what you're going in to before playing. If you want a free roam game where you can blow stuff up in whatever way you can imagine, this game is for you. If you want a game with a rich story, this won't satisfy your needs. The story can be summed up as rebels fighting against an evil dictator. So here are a couple of my pros and cons that resulted in a positive review.Pros:-Explosions. Alright? It's a blast.-Variety of vehicles-Wingsuit, parachute, and grapple (once you learn how to use them they're extremely rewarding)-Did I mention explosions?-Beautiful scenery (a relaxing contrast from the constant explosions)-Freedom of Choosing your own way around-ExplosionsCons:-My gosh, the bugs. Specifically graphic related bugs. (nothing an immense amount of troubleshooting and reading can't fix though)-Lack of an interesting story, although the characters can be interesting at times-Minimum specs don't seem to be correct on the store page			"

												Don't get me wrong, this game can be fun and entertaining (especially so if you like explosions). However, it's still terribly buggy and laggy after a full year of being released and the gameplay also becomes repetitive (as expected from a game like this).I get as low as a 'cinematic' 25fps in cities (with explosions) with a GTX 1080 at 1080p. As for bugs, the most glaring one to me is that I'm stuck playing the game windowed, because if I put it fullscreen it makes the image blurry and the UI unusable because it offsets my mouse cursor and some buttons just dont work. Unfortunately, there is no borderless mode (I haven't looked into it, maybe there is with launch options) and the game doesn't lock your mouse cursor so I find myself clicking off screen and freezing the game occasionally.The gameplay itself is fun but gets repetitive (think of Far Cry) after liberating a few cities. If there were more variety in the cities, and there is some, but if there was a big enough differences for me to be able to say ""Oh, this is where I had to do XX to liberate it."" The story (I have yet to finish it) isn't really engaging but it drives along the game a bit, mostly it's just ""Kill this person"" or ""Hijack this tank"", the generic stuff.			"

												Game worked fine for a few months, then they updated it and it causes my computer to Blue Screen of Death every time.  The devs seem to not care about fixing the game, Its been broken for months.  I truly regret buying the DLC for this, I haven't even been able to try it. Don't buy this until they fix it!			"

												This is the worst $60 game I have ever played. I have a 980Ti overclocked through the roof and I still get frame loss. Like how??? The game also has some questionable design choices. Example?There's a little base you can capture, however you will get air strike after air strike called on you while you try to liberate it. One would assume these would stop if you liberate the base? Nope. You can liberate the base but you will be blown up endlessly if you dare step foot in it. Meanwhile all the rebel npcs just walk around like nothing is happening. The game gives not a single explanation how to stop these. Awesome.If this game was like $10, I'd say get it. Otherwise, definitely not.			"

												This is a great game, I won't lie. But, as most other reviews say, the optimization for this game is absolutely terrible. The first time I loaded up the game, everything seemed to be fine. I got into the game and out of the first cutscene, but that's when things started going wrong. Voice errors and terrible lag had more of a definite presence than actual gameplay. I'm not recommending this game on steam, but I'm recommending you get it on a console, if at all.			"

												To be honest this is probably my favorite game ever. i don't care what anyone says i love it. a few complaints i usually see is bad driving mechanics and it can crash more frequently than other games. now i have played it on Xbox one and PC and have logged over 50 hours on Xbox but my answer (maybe not the right answer) to these complaints are it was just ported poorly for PC. i use an Xbox controller when i play it on PC, compared to mouse and keyboard, feels smoother and just better. the second complaint i mentioned was crashes. now i have only crashed a few times when playing but it was because i was using a lot of memory on my computer. my computer is an ASUS republic of gaming PC with 2 processors and a GTX 960 Graphics card and it runs almost smoothly on max settings. i prefer the PC edition of this game because mods (duh) and i just prefer PC. i hope this review made anyone look at the game in a different way or just explain anything about why its not so high rated on steam.

												This is a really fun game if you know what you're going in to before playing. If you want a free roam game where you can blow stuff up in whatever way you can imagine, this game is for you. If you want a game with a rich story, this won't satisfy your needs. The story can be summed up as rebels fighting against an evil dictator. So here are a couple of my pros and cons that resulted in a positive review.Pros:-Explosions. Alright? It's a blast.-Variety of vehicles-Wingsuit, parachute, and grapple (once you learn how to use them they're extremely rewarding)-Did I mention explosions?-Beautiful scenery (a relaxing contrast from the constant explosions)-Freedom of Choosing your own way around-ExplosionsCons:-My gosh, the bugs. Specifically graphic related bugs. (nothing an immense amount of troubleshooting and reading can't fix though)-Lack of an interesting story, although the characters can be interesting at times-Minimum specs don't seem to be correct on the store page			"

The sheer size of the map gives you a playground that only few can match in today's AAA games.Out of the 3 Just Cause games I'd say this is close to being the best. Waiting for a fully fleshed out multiplayer experience then we have ourselves a true contender for one of the best open world games.			"

												The optimization of this game is terrible. I am having AMD RX 480 and 16GB RAM, but during the game I am still having massive FPS drop. The game is quite entertainment, but after 3 hours of doing exactly the same it is not so funny anymore. Same quets, same cities, same enemies...The AI of enemies is awful and the whole game is full of bugs - tanks flying around, people stuck in the ground or enemies from sudden just appears in front of you. Another problem is ""Logging"" - the game keep losing connection to servers (my internet connection is stable), therefore I had to keep pressing button - ""Play in offline mode"" or something similar. I understand why the game wants to be online - for piracy check, some useless leaderboards and as I thought primary to keep my game saves (progress) backed up. Well, after 17 hours of playing this game I found out that how much I was wrong. Game just crashed and all saved data are lost. After searching on the forum I have forum I found out that I am not alone with all of these problems. Unfortunately the tech support of the game did not even reply. I really regret of buying this game. Please do not make the same mistake like me.			"

												I tethered someone's face to their foot, then tightened the tether. I proceeded to remove it, and then they stood up and asked for my autograph.I grappled onto someone's car while they're driving down the interstate. I fling the door open, pull the driver out, and take over the car. As the driver is tumbling down the road, they yell out ""WAIT! I LEFT MY GLASSES ON THE DASHBOARD!""I walked up to another person, covered them in sticky grenades, and walked away dramatically pressing the detonate button.I blew something up.I crashed my car into a bridge, and didn't care, but I did love it.I lit everything on fire.I assume there's story to this game, or some kind of goal, but I've been too busy blowing things up to find out for myself.Just buy the game already.

												I think this game is more fun than its predecessor. However, that's just when the framerate is normal...This game has some serious memory problems. I've got a pretty decent computer, so normally the game can render 60 fps. However, it frequently drops or freezes as soon as the game spawns new actors or geometry or something else happens. I did stomp the settings to almost lowest possible and it helped a little (probably mostly because of texture size), but I still get jerky FPS.For extra irritation, you can't properly customize your keybindings in the game. If you do, the game adds two entries in the keymap file that the game isn't able to read. This leads to the game defaulting the controls every time you start the game. Also, there are multiple entries that can be changed in the config file that doesn't appear in the custom key binding screens, which means that the keys you happen to bind on those keys may get interrupted. Like (hold) Detonate Explosives on F (you can only rebind (tap) Detonate Explosives), and Look At on R.There is a workaround for this, by editing an unmodified kepmap.txt (not a typo), but it shouldn't be needed. I can't see how the config thing can be that hard to fix that it isn't sorted out a half year after release.Until these things are fixed, I would not recommend anyone getting this game. If they do fix these issues, I would happily recommend the game, because it is really fun (to me at least) when I don't experience those frustration elements.			"

												The game looks and feels nice IF you get past all the **** it throws at you when you start:I've played for about 10 minutes and here's a list of bugs I found: The game doesn't launch in full-screen mode and will probably take you ~20 minutes to launch it. (only shows top right corner of the game window when it does) Crashes for no apparent reason Controls are often unresponsive. The characters in custenes often double up / blur during movement (on maximum settings). (Tutorial missions) The game tells you to open a map,select a mission and place a waypoint and when you fail to do that (the waypoint placement doesn't register) the orange message message saying ""Open communicator"" stays at the center of your screen.Bugs aside controls are horrible and only some of them can be changed. The mouse sensitivity is all over the place: sometimes you will rotate 180° with a single small mouse swipe and other times it takes 3 swipes to do the same.To summarize, the game needs some polish or A LOT of getting used to. Given that the game has been out for so long I can safely asume fixes are not comming.Disclaimer: This is my personal experience on a PC that is way past recommended requirements.			"

												With all the reviews happeneing, I completely decided not to buy this game at all. Instead, I recieved it from a friend. I was afraid that all the troubles from all the reviews were true, and some of them are yes. The memory needs to be fixxed HEAVILY. I have an factory built office computer that I added a GTX 750 TI 2gb into. I have default 8 gb of RAM, and for this game, its all actually pretty good. It runs very well, but other than the fact with the high memory usage, it also lags, and during some stuff (alt tabbing) It tends to take a few moments to run the game back up. Overall. Its a great game, but do expect some lag issues. My advice is to buy it, see if you like the lag at all, and if you do, run with it. Its an amazing game that just needs some memory and FPS problem fixxing. If you think you can't handle the lag, then return it, wait till you think its been updated enough and better. Also if you're one of the ""fortunate"" type of people that expect greatness upon release, shut up. And shut up now. ""I have a GTX Titan X"" Whaetever. Shut up. The Developers are trying. You're going to complain isn't helping. Help them by telling them whats wrong. And if you reallly think they still need to work faster, learn coding, learn the basic engineering of building a game such as Just Cause, and then tell them how to fix stuff.			"

												9/10(10/10 IF I CUD GET ♥♥♥♥ING 60 FPS... nah its k)While Just Cause 2 made up for its lack of gameplay features (few weapons, lack of base variety, unpolished mechanics) with a beautiful open world, some pretty cool explosive action and great mod support, Just Cause 3 initially seemed worse to me.Here is what I thought before getting the game for 10 bucks:- they got rid of the roll mechanic (some of the coolest moments are with slow motion mod and dodging bullets with rolls matrix style)- they got rid of the sprint ability (ahem... superspeed mod was badass)- the wingsuit renders driving pointless- other than this, the game looked just like JC2 with better graphics and bad performanceBoy, was I wrong. This game is fu(king phenomenal.Removing the roll and sprint make complete sense to me now. Using your grapple to evade attacks is much cooler and the game overall moves faster than Just Cause 2, so there is no point for being able to supersprint.There are performance issues, yes, but I have a modest GTX 970 and the game runs pretty solidly at almost maxed out settings, so unless you're some graphics junkie there is no reason to complain.The star of the show, however, is the new wingsuit. Not only is it an absolute blast to fly with, but it also adds new gameplay ideas, as the parachute was never a good way to move horizontally in the last game.There are also many cool smaller things added, such as a lot more weapons (like the Leech, fu(king amazing) and an improved rebel drop system, improved handling and vehicle models, plus retractable grapples, adding a whole new aspect to connecting things to cause mayhem. While in Just Cause 2 you could only connect things, in this one you can do this plus cause the grapple rope to tighten and crash the two objects (or people) into each other.When the game was first released I fell in love with its soundtrack (Firestarter is so good), but the game seemed like too much of the same coupled with $hitty performance.

												I was a big fan of Just Cause 2 - and wasn't disappointment by this Gem. The Story is believable, the Map nicely done and the competition against 8 of your friends is just fun!Also now, it is 75% Off - would buy it again!Pros: - Huge map- New mechanics (Wingsuit)- Controller support- Fun- Boom BoomCons:- Variety of landscape- If you can't entertain yourself you could get bored after 30-40h			"

												Just Cause 3 is an insanely fun open world explosion-fest-Fun and inventive gameplay (Wingsuit/Parachute/Grapple hook combo makes traversal fun and easy, ridiculous weapons and vehicles to be unlocked)-Massive open world (Full of fun Easter Eggs to find and fuel tanks to blow up)-Generic, uninteresting story with a TERRIBLE final boss fight-Performance issues...Overall, really fun			"

												I was really excited when I got this game because Just Cause 2 was one of my most favorite games ever and, of course I made sure that I met all the technical requirements of the game and I also got it on sale for $35 CND but was very frustrasted and upset when I went to boot it up for the first time after waiting 15 hours for it to download (I have very bad internet connection) when I found that the game would crash just before it was going to get to the main menu screen right after the opening clip and a message would come up saying ""low system memory"". I tried it a few more times to make sure it was not just the first time and I've had the game crash 10 times repeatedly, sometimes even freezing my compouter and forcing a restart now I know my computer only has 8GB of RAM but in the minimal system requirements it says 8GB of RAM. So any ways I'm very dissapointed that I could'nt play the game I had been so looking forward to playing.I also know I'm not the only one with these issues and I'm quite suprised that Avalanche Studios has not really done anything about it except for releasing these (useless) DLC's that I can't use in the first place because the game does not even boot up!If Avalanche Studios does not do anything about these problems soon I will be asking for a refund because otherwise it's just a waste of money. Also if they don't release any ""patchs or fixes"" regarding these issues I will seriously consider not investing in any of there future games because of the doubt of there loyaty to there customers.If they do release  fixes for these problems preventing me from playing Just Cause 3 I would be glad to write a positive review of this game but until then I will remain frustrated with the game, the company and the company's loyaty to their customers who deserve more. I know that some people have the game at least running but I however do not and think that these new DLC's that they keep release are completly useless and that they should be focusing there attention on fixing the problems with the core game itself.So any ways I AM VERY DISIPOINTED AVALNCHE!!!Please fix these issues!

Story has never been a strength of JC & this is no exception. B-grade plot with forgettable characters :( but kickass gameplay with explosive over the top action :) Lots of weapons to shoot, vehicles to drive & upgraded grappling hook, retractable parachute & tethers allow creative ways of traversal & destruction.

												If you're prone to motion sickness like me dont buy this game, no settings to change FOV or camera distance make this game almost unplayable. Its graphics are a step up from the previous game but the world looks very bland compared to Just Cause 2. But my biggest issue with the game is its controls: grappling and using your wingsuit/parachute is a lot harder and driving/flying is near impossible. In Just Cause 2 these things were a breeze and made it possible to raise hell and do all the crazy stuff the series is known for. Just Cause 3 does add a lot of gameplay elements and new ways to go about doing these things but in its current state its hard to do these and pull of cool♥♥♥♥♥♥ which is a shame since thats the main selling point of the series in my opinion. Story wise not much to say the plot/writing is still crap and the voice acting is as bad as always.I wont be playing much Just Cause 3 until these issues are resolved, and i would not recommend buying this game in its state, especially not at full price.

												To be honest this is probably my favorite game ever. i don't care what anyone says i love it. a few complaints i usually see is bad driving mechanics and it can crash more frequently than other games. now i have played it on Xbox one and PC and have logged over 50 hours on Xbox but my answer (maybe not the right answer) to these complaints are it was just ported poorly for PC. i use an Xbox controller when i play it on PC, compared to mouse and keyboard, feels smoother and just better. the second complaint i mentioned was crashes. now i have only crashed a few times when playing but it was because i was using a lot of memory on my computer. my computer is an ASUS republic of gaming PC with 2 processors and a GTX 960 Graphics card and it runs almost smoothly on max settings. i prefer the PC edition of this game because mods (duh) and i just prefer PC. i hope this review made anyone look at the game in a different way or just explain anything about why its not so high rated on steam.

												This is a great game, I won't lie. But, as most other reviews say, the optimization for this game is absolutely terrible. The first time I loaded up the game, everything seemed to be fine. I got into the game and out of the first cutscene, but that's when things started going wrong. Voice errors and terrible lag had more of a definite presence than actual gameplay. I'm not recommending this game on steam, but I'm recommending you get it on a console, if at all.			"

												This game is fun and has a lot of content but gets very boring after a while, I see this game as a $40 game with the dlc, not a $60 game without it. The story has a bunch of cool features but it seems like the main goal, liberation of the island, is not a part of the story. I feel this game is trying to make as much money as possible and doesn't care about satifaction for the user, but it has good aspects. Overall I think this game needs to add more of a storyline surrounding liberation and should lower the costs a lot.			"

Posted: January 13, 2016
												So currently, you'll see a lot of crude remarks and ""reviews"" about Just Cause 3 in the community hub. A lot of them have to do with them believing the game isnt fun or does not function correctly which I'm ok with, that was their experience, but I feel like it's starting to cloud the judgement of people who have a high probabillity of enjoying this great game that Avalanche studios and Square Enix have made for us.I'm here to put out my opinion on the game and I'll start with straight off saying HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.I'm totally for this game, bugs and all.So I won't do a Pros vs. Cons lists because it's a bit annoying imo to see a list of things someone doesnt like, but I will tell you what I do like.The most important feature in the game is the wingsuit now: The wingsuit is fairly easy to master and can be really fun if you know when to time your grapple shots. It's pretty quick and can get you to most places without using an air vehicle.Challenges: They're rewarded throughout your gameplay (When you liberate or take a settlement) and you essentially are playing them for mods and a bit of practice using different tools. The challenges are based on many factors and the result of getting points in them is GEARS. Gears are like a currency type for your mod menu and unlock the mods as you recieve them. You can earn up to 5 gears in a challenge, 5 being fairly difficult to achieve without practice.Mods: Modding is a new feature and is really cool! It allows you to toggle on and off certain things you want to apply to your tools such as rocket boosters to C4, a faster reel in for grappling (which applies to multiple actions like, wingsuiting, parachuting and regular grappling), and many many more. *****Do Not Confuse In-Game Modding With Workshop Mods*****Story: Much more humor has been put into the story, and the characters have more...character to them. The story could still use work for future games in the series but you now have a much firmer grasp on ricos past and the concept the Developers are going for in this game.Graphics: Absolutely lovely. If you played BattleFront beta on High settings, you may have noticed how amazing it looked kind of giving you a warm happy feeling. Thats what the graphics are like in Just Cause 3. Simply Beautiful. Unlimited C4: This is also a new feature, one of many. Rather than simply being allowed to drop C4 everywhere and finish the game in 3 hours, you now can place 3 C4 on any nearby object or drop them from above in parachute mode and detonate them from far away, maybe on a high vantage point to admire your work. You can also upgrade to 5 C4 later on.Upgraded Grappling Hook/ Multiple Tethers: The grapple hook now looks much more sleek and presents a much better feel to the player when grappling to objects. I Don't know for sure, but it also seems like the grapple distance is slightly farther. You may now upgrade to 6 Tethers throughout the game and you start off with two fairly early, say 15 minutes into the game. With these tethers you can pull objects together with the new Manual Retract Function.Weapons: Not much to say other than ammo is much more common throughout the world and there are many more weapons presented compared to Just cause 2. These can also be modded.Over All Gameplay: A very fun game, full of moments where you question what your true abillities really are! You may ask yourself whether or not you can accomplish a task, truth is you most likely can. The gameplay is rewarding and well worth your money (Remember it's in my opinion) and runs really smoothly....MOST OF THE TIME. This leads us to the bugs ........*************. DEVS THIS IS FOR YOU..***************................BUGS:People will often play music but are not holding instrumentsWhen Slingsuiting up at afairly steep angle, Rico completely flips around backwards instantly making recovery difficultThe vehicle driving could use a bit of a touch up, but I think it's a major improvement over JC2!NPCs will sometimes vanish when a physical object hits the ground near them.HOPE THIS HELPS THE CAUSE~Blue JayMy Computer is a ROG ♥♥♥♥j and I run at around HIGH with 60 fps			"

												The graphics are nice, the game has some stunning vistas and the wingsuit is a lot of fun. Unfortunately that's where my praise for the game has to end.This game has innumerable issues that just make every gameplay session frustrating, most notably:-The basic feature of weapon zooming was locked behind an upgrade, and although it's easy to obtain, this leaves new players lacking the most basic and fundemental shooting mechanics. -DLC. I bought a version of the game with a season pass, and expected to get all of the DLC, yet there's still tons of vehicles and weapons that aren't included, I find this underhanded and deceptive. -Performance, I'm running an 8350 and an RX 480, yet even in the lowest settings with all of the performanc tweaks I was able to find online, I get drops to the low 20s. This is inexcusable. The game also has a memory leak that was never patched that will continue to eat your system RAM until your PC crashes. -No sprint and no roll. I looked into this, and the devs stated that not including these features that were present in Just Cause 2 was due to them wanting to ""encourage the players to use the grapple mechanic, flying is Rico's cover"". Well that's just a load of bull, you're never more vulnerable than you are when you're airborne, if you try to use the parachute to escape a gunfight you just make yourself an easier target. On the ground you move at a brisk jog, and there's no dodge mechanic to let you avoid gunfire. This makes every engagement an exercise in frustration as you lack the agility to play the way you would in JC2 and the game's flight mechanics do not remotely work as stated where combat is concerned.-Nauseating, disorientating FoV. This can be fixed with a mod, but the fact that it passed playtesting in its current state, and that there is no FoV slider in the game is inexcusable. I found driving cars next to impossible with the default FoV, so narrow that I couldn't see anything that was going on around me.-Bad controls. They're just bad, I don't know how else to explain it, this is a situation where you have to play it for yourself to truly appreciate all the little annoyances and bizarre choices. I tried playing both with the M&KB and an Xbox controller, and it's irredeemable. Every vehicle has this odd oversteer, like the deadzone is all wrong, and the grapple that is supposed to be your primary mode of transportation frequently hooks to things that weren't even close to where you were aiming the cursor. Rico slips off the geometry of the map, slides down the edge of a building rather than jumping up on top of it because your grapple was a fraction of an inch too low, sometimes the grapple won't deploy and you die as a result, he gets ragdolled and rolls for minutes at a time while you hammer buttons in a futile effort to shoot a hook or get him to stand up before he dies, sometimes when you deploy a grapple while parachuting you lose all momentum and drop out of the air, it's just a mess. Shooting is imprecise with the controller, and there's mouse smoothing that makes shooting accurately very hard. I never feel like I have any real control over what's happening, it's all just a gamble that Rico will do what I want him to at any given moment. I'm sure there's a lot more to unpack here, but I don't care to play much further in order to find out. Very disappointed, I thought getting the game on sale with the seaon pass for 70% off was a good deal but I regret the purchase.  "

If only military bases in partially liberated provinces would get slowly rebuilt so you could destroy them over again...  I have only one real complaint: This game fails the Badass test i.e. when I play the game, I don't feel like a badass. Everything kills me. JC2 made me feel like a supersoldier by the end of the game and that was a big reason for going back and playing it mulitple times (on my xbox - i know, i know). I'll still recommend this game though.			"

												Just cause 3 is the ""homecoming"" of Rico Rodriguez, and it is set in his homeland. The Just Cause franchise is known for being an open world sandbox with destructible environment, and in the first hour you are given the freedom to do whatever you want. In my oppinion, it is one of my favourite games on the PC, i repeat, on the PC, i became a PC gamer on november on 2015, i give it a 9,5/10, and here's why:Pros: It's a very fun game, with tons of explosions, and the destructible environment make it seem believable. You can fly wherever you want from the first hour of the game. Some challenges are really cool, especially the wingsuit ones, i became a master at them, my lowest score being 4/5. You are not told to play the main story, you need to play only like 4-5 missions until you get all the mission upgrades, the last one being the ability to save cars in your garage. You can drive any vehicle you see. Flying and sailing controls are really good, the driving ones are okay, but they are very, very sensitive and require a lot of practice. The wingsuit is very fun The bases are the best part in the game in my oppinion, you need to destroy almost anything that is ""red"" to complete the base, and then you will be given challenges(everywhere), vehicle unlocks(at military bases), and garages(at cities). You can destroy things in the way you like, and you can get very creative in this game. You can attach anything with your grappling hook.Cons: The story is very boring and unattractive.-Rico can take a lot, and recover from it in 2 seconds, more realism would be better. There is an empty area in the game. You get huge 2-3 huge bases from the beggining without liberating, it would be fun if you had to liberate them too, the military bases are the best.Summary:I recommend you buy this game at any price. It is worth it!			"

												just cause 3 is what pitch perfect 2 is to the original pitch perfect. pitch perfect was a very good movie it had a good story, performances, and comedy but in pitch perfect 2 they just capitalised on the performances and the comedy and they left the story and other good features out. thats what just cause 3 is to just cause 2 a game with great explosions, map, and graphics but they got rid of the good story and other great features that made just cause 2 an amazing game. im kinda on the fence about this game as far as wether i like it or not but i do reccomend it if you like micheal bay movies becasue its just a big micheal bay movie.

												I was having fun playing the game, and I came back home from a long grueling day to play. When I come back my Fps, which is usually 60, is constantly 30 or less. I don't know what happened and nothing i've tried helped it. I have an i7 intel core 4720HQ and a Nvidia geforce 965 graphics CARD.			"

												I get it. Many people are angry that they are lagging in game and it is unplayable. I have specs that barely make it to minimal, and i have a one gb graphics card. When i loaded in I got about 1 frame per second. I knew this would happen. So I LOOKED UP HOW TO FIX IT. Instead of complaining and not doing anything about it, TRY AND DO SOMETHING. And that is what I did. I found a video on youtube that fixed my lag and i can play at about 40 fps. That is a huge improvement. I expect that Avalanche Studios will try and optimize JC3 in the future, but reading everyones comments drives me mad. Heres the video:

												Despite some of the PC issues, I still think this is a fantastic expansion from Just Cause 2. It looks to me like the developers took into account the JC2 mods that were most popular, and made an official implementation for them and added a new map and storyline to make JC3. For example:The multi-grapple mod in JC2 is an upgrade you get get in JC3!The super-strength grapples mod in JC2 is an upgrade in JC3 also!The superman mod in JC2 is the wingsuit, of course without the propulsion. It helps you cover distance faster (and is so much fun), which is why I got the superman mod in JC2. Here's some pros and cons....Pros:-Great upgrade system!-Great graphics!-My rig (NVIDIA GTX 980, i5-4460, 8GB ram, 144hz monitor) handles it very well, hitting 80-110fps on absolute max settings (measured using nvidia geforce experience fps overlay). Of course, I waited a few months to get the game because I had heard it had bad performance on PC, so they must have patched some of the issues. Cons:-Terrible vehicle control. I mean, atrocious. Doing the races in JC3 isn't that fun. (But who needs a car when you have a wingsuit:)-Occasional crashes. -Fairly long load time for HDD users. -Spawns are still just as annoying as they were in JC2. Don't you love it when you see a spot in a military facility that you'd love to plant some explosives on, then see that no enemy units are there, then land and plant the first bomb. Suddenly the military is crawling out from behind all the buildings like the goblins in the mines of Moria, then you subsequently die from being riddled with bullets like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris had a grudge against you with an automatic 50 cal with incendiary armor piercing adamantium rounds (if you understand all those references, you rock! )-Moderately short campaign, which is made up for by all the free play you feel compelled to do after the campaign is done. -One serious bug that made one of the campaign missions unplayable (jet rockets wouldn't lock-on due to precision aim upgrade). I simply had to deactivate the upgrade temporarily for that mission. There's probably other cons I've simply forgotten because the game is so dang good! There is sooooo much experimenting you can do with the retracting grapple with the strength mods! I regularly like to drag civilian cars to the top of buildings XDOverall rating:So much fun, but -1 due to some bugs and bad vehicle control. 9/10 would grapple-retraction-launch civilians 700 meters again			"

												No performance issues. 60fps+ @1080p on a MSI RX 480 Gaming X (not oc) and a FX-8370 @ 5.0 Ghz.Game is in the Top 3 I've ever played, being those:1. The Witcher 32. GTA V3. Just Cause 3I got the game on Sale since I saw many negative reviews regarding the performance on high end pc's,Best decision ever. Well worth the €60 or more. Buy it. Blow stuff up. Enjoy!  "

												Great challange to see if you're faster at pressing 'esc' or get to see unskippeble animations.Loads of stuff to blow up and fun make up for ""physics"" and crappy AI.Has some down sides. Has some good points. All and all, still fun at that important parts.Good 'nuff			"

												While there are some downers to this game, like the lack of mini map and weird k/m control scheme, honestly it's extremely fun and has plenty of explosions. That's why I liked JC2. Splosions. And headshots. It does suffer from a pretty bad memory leak - but then so did Deus Ex Mankind Divided, on my machine they both skyrocket their memory use to over 7 gigs, and that's simply unacceptable for any game. The one issue that I do wish they'd fix is the minimizing bug. I have my resolution set to full screen, and I'd like it to NEVER change that. Not sure why it stops being full screen. People these days do have multiple screen setups and I often shift-tab out of steam to view information or sites while playing, and coming back to a windowed mode is ridiculous. But that's not game play, plot, or graphics textures, it's an issue that could probably have come from an entirely outside development team. The game itself is just plain pure stupid fun.			"

												Easily the best Just Cause game. Sunning visuals, music, and gameplay. The story is so so, but what do you expect from this series. Unlike in JC2 none of the bases are just copied an pasted, which is great for variety, but there is a lower number of bases. Huge sense of scale within the bases, from towering cliffs to massive harbours.If you like JC2 you'll like this game.			"
