												You play as Erica Reed, a Boston FBI agent with a deeply troubled past and some supernatural abilities, which are introduced to you throughout the first episode. Cognition is a traditional point and click adventure game, and it doesn't add too much to the formula. When you click on something, a small radial menu shows up of things you can do with the object, and its context sensitive. You can look at it, use it or grab it, or use your currently equipped inventory item on it. The graphical inventory is on the right side of the screen, and you can not only equip an object, you can also look at it, use it, or combine several objects together.It definitely has a very mature comic-book feel to it. The cutscenes are delivered in the standard ""motion comic"" style, with minimal animation - mostly to highlight the important aspects of the scene. The actual gameplay has full cel-shaded environments and characters, complete with mouth movements to accompany the voice acting. The music is also wonderfully done and definitely sets the mood for each scene. The best thing I can say about it is that it didn't get in the way, which is the point for a game like this. It highlights the atmosphere appropriately.Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller may have some clumsy animation, some robotic faces and the occasional instance where the tech and the art don’t quite gel, but it is a hugely competent adventure game in every other regard. One that provides stimulating puzzle mechanics that make perfect sense within its world, and a compelling story that quickly gains momentum and keeps it up until it culminates in a thrilling, memorable finale. That’s categorically what you want from the genre.			"

												Cross between ""the mentalist"" and the nastiest CSI torture killing episodes you've ever seen.Steep learning curve on episode 1, fighting with the interface to work out ways to advance the adventure.Probably most people will give up somewhere along this lengthy episode which is a shame because Episode 2 and 3 are real gems, better than vast majority of adventure games.This a very long and involved adventure game with challenging puzzles.  I am skilled with this type of game but lost patience several times and consulted walkthrough.The gore and shock of this series is a seriously over the top and would be quite upsetting and disturbing for most.  I struggled not to barf at times.  There's one viscious torture killing after another and it gets to be a bit much.The dialogue and characters are well done for this type of game. There is a lot of implausible high drama, cliff hangers and twists, perhaps akin to a comic book series.It does make for an exciting ride.I liked it, but honestly think only a small subset of gamers would.* need patience for a very long game with challenging learning curve, interface, and puzzles.* have unusually strong stomach for truly over the top gore and disturbing content (torture killing)* appreciate convoluted plots and well written dialogues* like adventure games with paranormal (psychic) aspects.Sherlock: jack the ripper might be another good title for fans of this game -- highest quality writing though the game is quite old.

												Cognition is an adult graphic adventure about lost, revenge and fate.Story is really well done and progresses nicely without feeling forced, most puzzles are logical, all characters are complex and have motivations that you can understand, this is helped by the great voice acting.The game has a supernatural twist, but it doesn't feel cheesy and works well in the game for the most part, allowing for some very interesting mechanics.DIfficulty is well balanced except a couple puzzles that might require an effort, but everything is feasible and can be deducted logically, no need for weird guessings. There are a few moments where you can actually die, but it's not frustrating since the game allows for fast retrying.All 4 episodes are quite good, but the third one is weaker because it focuses on a single location, although it's needed  to move the plot further and get ready for the final of the game, so it can be forgiven and it's not bad anyway, just not as good as the other 3 episodes.The game has a few technical bugs, like the character moving through objects, but none are gamebreaking, just a few little annoyances.Overall I greatly enjoyed the game and highly recommend it to anyone looking for an adult graphic adventure with an interesting plot.

												This game is a point & click, mystery solving game. Was not sure i was really going to enjoy it, but quickly found myself liking the game.The voice acting is pretty good. I really liked the characters, especially the main one, which is pretty important in a game.The game is styled like a comicI found myself getting stumped A LOT. Almost felt like I had to actually be an FBI agent to crack the case. lol. The game does no hold your hand, and what you should do next is not always obvious. The game has a tip system, but it lets those who want to figure things out on their own, do so. The cases are pretty lengthy, more so if you get stuck a lot, like me. The story has small alternate paths. They don't change the story too much, but it's nice to have the small alternate choicesSmall negative is that sometimes you have to travel back and forth to the same spots several times in a row, and it gets a bit annoying. Like in the first episode I recall having to go to the antique store, then back to the station, then back to the antique store, then back to the station again.This game definitely might be flying under a lot of people's radar. I feel it deservers a bit more reCOGNITION.			"

												A really great game for a little money. FBI agent versus the serial killer - sounds cliche? Don't worry, the story will surprise you a few times. Especially the first two episodes are very enjoyable and worth playing. The story is like the mixture of two famous film thrillers: Seven and Silence of the Lambs. Advantages:+An interesting plot and characters+Story twists+Nicely written dialogues+Mechanics: typical adventure with some puzzles and action elements+Music+Voice acting+2D graphics (great comic stylised drawings ) Disadvantages:-Initially great story slows down at the end -Towards the end of the game the characters' choices become unreasonable and ridiculous-Bugs-3D graphicsHowever, try it if you like point-and-click thriller style adventure games.

												Fantastic game. One of the best stories in a video game I've played. Intriguing yet disturbing, and full of tense moments. The closest analog I can think of are the Ace Attorney/Phoenix Wright games. Now imagine those games without the court cases. Now add in much deeper investigation scenes accompanied by extremely cool ""cognition""  techniques, and you basically have Cognition. I can not emphasize enough how good the story is. Big budget $60 games struggle to achieve anything close to this. The characters have real emotions and real backstories, and the player will feel for them. Some characters make me want to punch them in the face, others make me tear up inside. Its these bonds that really make the player attached to Erica and her situation.The story really takes off due to the tense moments. Although all games have tense moments, Cognition handles these so much better. The intensity never lets up. Just when the tense scene seems to be ending, something even crazier springs up. Best of all, Cognition is not afraid to have harmful consequences. In other games, I am relatively calm even in tense moments because I know everything will be fine once I complete the scene. Not so in this game. Even if everything is executed correctly, key characters will die, gruesome imagery will haunt the player and the sanity of the player will be repeatedly questioned. All in all, a must play and a must buy.+ Incredible story+ Engaging characters with personable backstories+ Mood appropriate music+ Innovative ""cognition"" mechanics+ Vivid imagery+ Intelligent puzzles that are never too vague- Minor graphical glitches			"

Review: Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller""Cognition promises to be an exciting game for adventure fans with a rich story and beautiful (and creepy) visuals!"" This is what Jane Jensen says about this game. If the mastermind of Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers would make such an appraisal, why would you even care about reading my own opinion? Well, maybe you have never heard of Jane Jensen. You have never played Gabriel Knight. You may have never even played a Point-and-Click Adventure at all. Go ahead, read further. You will find yourself taking the role of Erica Reed, a Boston FBI Special Agent, accompanied by her partner John McCoy. Right after the start they are rushing to a cemetery in order to rescue Erica’s brother Scott, who is being held captive by a psychopath called ""The Cain Killer"". He is known for gruesome murders involving siblings who get tortured with devices you would only expect to see in a Saw movie. Erica owns a special power, the cognition, that only she and her partner John know about. Explained simply: She sees what others did in the past, trying to use this to her own advantage. Right now you, the player, will make her use of it to get into the crypt where Scott is being held. If you read the Official Description carefully, you will already know how this is going to end.. 3 Years Later..Erica spent the last 3 years trying to find the man who did this to her brother. Having not found him and losing control of her life she is forced to close the Cain Case and move on. But soon after she begins to investigate the next murder, she finds clues - left for her. Clues pointing out that whoever killed that person knew about Erica’s ""special gift"". Is it the Cain Killer again? A new serial killer? And why would he know about Erica’s Cognition Ability? With the help of Rose, the owner of an antique shop, medium and expert for psychic abilities, and her Partner John, Erica tries to solve this puzzle in the four acts of Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller. Use your mouse to click, Erica moves, doubleclick and she runs. Press Space to highlight Objects to interact with. Congratulations, you just learned the basic controls. Some objects can be used, others can even be combined in your inventory. This is the bread and butter of Adventure Games but learning to use this efficiently will save time, time you will need to solve some of the puzzles this game has to offer. I had a tough time with some of them but if you get stuck there is a really nice hint system. This games story is amazing and it knows how to keep you engaged if you get stuck. Ericas special power, the cognition, is key for nearly every problem you will get confronted with. It requires some trial and error but it adds possibilities other games simply can’t offer. Your power will evolve while progressing, forcing you to rethink situations, finding new ways to solve puzzles.The overall setting is dark and stylish, combined with cutscenes that appear in nicely drawn comicstrips. I must admit that I encountered some bugs while playing like mouths that looked like broken boxes. This is nothing that breaks the game but tends to look a bit funny sometimes. What keeps you really entertained instead is the amazing soundtrack which all of you should give a listen even after finishing Cognition. Whether your heart needs pumping or your soul cries for relaxation, this games music makes sure that things start to get emotional. Believe me. Big Text, Quick Facts: Pro:An intriguing, dark and mature story with an exceptional plot.Interesting main protagonist....and many antagonistsDark graphics with comic looksVeterans AND Newbies will quickly get used to controls and mechanicsFresh take on problem solving with Ericas Special PowersRewarding puzzlesNice hint systemAmazing soundtrackCon:Comic Look (listed as pro but not everybody likes that kind of style)Puzzles might get tough sometimes, literally forcing you to use the hint systemGraphical bugsAt some points I simply felt overwhelmed with where to go or startToo hard for kids eyes and earsSummary: If you haven’t shut your mouth with shaking hands, asking how all of this could have happened, you haven’t played Cognition yet. Be prepared for a clever, dark and brutal thriller that plays with emotions - but brace yourself for some tough puzzles that might discourage you at first sight. Do not let this happen. Use your Hint System if it gets to hard and enjoy the plot.There is something I have to add for those of you still hesitating. I haven`t played Gabriel Knight or any game connected with Jane Jensen before either, so my praising words should be an assurance for all of you.8,5 / 10No drama, Just Reviews "

Product received for free
												When a friend of mine gifted this to me about a year ago, I was touched and happy to finally have this game in my library. Sadly, it took me a while to get around to picking it up and actually playing it, but once I started, I couldn't put it down. I remember thinking that the Still Life series was the grittiest and most realistic crime thriller that I had ever played. Then Cogniton came around...Trying to tell the whole story would take too long. Suffice it to say that you play as Erica Reed, a FBI agent with a promising career in front of her. The game begins as you are racing to stop The Cain Killer from murdering Erica's brother. What follows is an awesome,  episodic thriller that does not let go until the final moments of the last episode. Even through there are different killers and cases woven through all 4 episodes, the major theme of catching The Cain Killer is the thread that binds them all together. The pacing is well done. The voice acting and the depictions of the characters are wonderful. These are characters that you will love or hate. Depending on how you play the game, you will definitely see character development. There is nothing static about these characters. Apart from the supernatural gift given to the protagonist, they feel like real people in really desperate situations.The game play is mostly your standard point and click with a scroll down inventory, but Erica Reed's cognitive powers set this game apart. She has four abilities that she uses throughout the game, starting with just bein able to get slight visions of the future. As the game progresses she learns more about her gift and her abilities start to broaden. By the final episode, you have use of all 4, sometimes using them all in the same puzzle or scenario. The only tedious think about this is that in the early episodes (1-2), you are constantly going back to visit Rose, who helps you realize your full potential. This can really break the pacing, since you will be at a crime scene, or in an interrogation and you suddenly have to break what you are doing to go to a different area entirely to learn more to progress further in the game. Luckily, the later episodes fix this and you don't feel that you break with the story in order to go into a tutorial mission. The game is gorgeous, gritty, and violent. I love the comic book style. Even though it looks hand drawn or painted, the imagery is very vivid. I could only play an episode at a time, because the final images of each episode would stay with me, and I had to get up and take a break. The music just adds to the tense and thrilling feel of the game. As I write this review, I am listening to the soundtrack, because it is just that good. I am starting to notice a serious trend in adventure games feeling less ridiculous and more common sense. That tone is definitely felt here, since you are solving cases. Sometimes you have to think slightly outside the box, because you are being covert, but it still feels within the realm of reality. Some of the puzzles can be difficult, but that will only be if you don't pay attention to details: what is said, the evidence you collect. Not paying attention to details can cost you a lot in the game, from losing trust with co-workers, to flat our losing partners to a killer. There are timed scenarios. Even in Still Life 2, my palms didn't sweat. My palms sweat in this game. A point and click. They don't happen often, at most once in an episode, but once is enough. I honestly can't think of any negatives. The story was well told and it ended very well. Not necessarily a happy ending but one that is true to the plot. I can honestly say that even though I was given this as a gift, it is worth every penny that is being asked for. I know there is another playthrough in my future, but I may need some time to get over my first playthrough!			"

Short version: 81%(Episode breakdown: 95%, 94%, 64%, 79%.)A paranormal serial murder thriller packed into a point ‘n’ click adventure? It’s easy to sell this concept, harder to actually pull it off. Cognition luckily manages to do that, although not without problems.Long version:Psychic cops and serial killers are always a good mix in the hand of capable writers, and Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller is a nice example of that. It follows the struggles of the titular FBI agent, who needs to tackle not one, but four different murderers preying on the streets of Boston.Her story is structured like a television miniseries with four self-contained episodes. Arguably, the first two ones are the best as they remain close to the concept of being about the investigations, while the third episode is just a huge plot dump constrained into a single location, and the fourth hastily ties everything together using a set of rather tired clichés (including the classic ‘you are suspended!’ one).Still, the plotting is spectacular; each episode has endings that would make you grip the edge of your chair if they wouldn’t also feature the best, most complex puzzles, with perfect music to boot. The developers really knew how to reward patience.As for the rest of the game, Cognition is a fairly standard point ‘n’ click (with an uncomfortable interface) that adds cognitive powers on top of the usual item manipulation. The use of these powers is not really consistent; there’s one that you invoke maybe three times in the entire story, even though you spend half an hour acquiring it. Graphics aren’t too spectacular: the backgrounds look good, but the characters are weird and glitchy. The audio is a lot better with a memorable soundtrack, and all main actors do an astounding job playing their (fairly stereotypical) role. It really helps getting immersed in the game, which is always great for thrillers like this.			"

												Having played the first 2 chapters of this game, I would say it is an interestingly presented adventure game. Its strongest part would be the artwork cinematics, along with a quite interesting storytelling and a good soundtrack. The gameplay is fairly comfortable, the riddles mix well with the overall plot and the voice acting is generally ok, if not falling short in some parts. The game's low point would definitely be the graphics: the characters' skin has a weird shine on it, while movement is unnatural and glitchy. Overall, I hesitantly recommend it, if you don't think the glitchy graphics would ruin your experience. It is a shame however, that it was not built around its strongest point which is its art style.			"

												I will easily bring this game up as a great example of Adventure games. Extremely engaging and a great cinematic experience. The top notch games for me were always the broken sword games and only did this affect me to the point of comparing it to them. It is also good to note that very few point and click games put the player in tense situations and actually punish them for the lack of some choices (Pre Telltale mainstream era :P). What are Adventure games without elaborate detective stories? Loved every second of it and it is rare for me to enjoy great voice acting. The performance here was amazing and I can barely find a single flaw in it. The animation is a bit limited here and sometimes there are animation bugs and glitches, but the story and the writing easily makes up for what it lacks. If anyone is interested in a great mystery/detective story, look no further. I forgot to mention it is made by the Gabriel Knight developers, need I say more? :D			"

												Good people + hard work = great product. As naive as it may sound, I strongly believe that. When people with the right ideas and enough love for their project show real commitment, failure is just not an option. And this is the case of Phoenix Online Studios and Cognition. Crowdfunded through Kickstarter, Cognition is a crazy good adventure game, and playing it you kinda wonder how this game could have been made with just 35k dollars.Despite being pretty common the story is very interesting, it's a thriller story with a strong paranormal vibe and a revenge theme, but what is really good is how they managed to link all the investigations Erica will be involved in. Great work, cool plot twists. Characters are also well described, I loved Erica from the very beginning with all her flaws, fears, doubts. She's a very strong character, but at the same time someone you can relate with. Tridimensional. Puzzles are interesting, not very hard to crack but not super easy either, you'll probably get stuck a couple of times (at least it happened to me, and I loved it, getting stuck and having to think it's a big chunk of what an adventure game is about, for me). Plus, having Jane Jensen (yes, you heard, Jane Jensen *__* )  as a story consultant is a real added value.So, to wrap it up, a very good game. Interesting, challenging, not a game you'll easily forget. Try it.			"

												All episodes have unique gameplay features, different extraordinary powers and duration of each of them is about 5-8 hrs.An intriguing plot with logical and interesting puzzles, accompanied by beautiful soundtrack.Comic book arts are just great and voice acting is very well done, especially for Erica and Cordelia.Some dialogs are short and weird though. It could be better... Devs made a pretty good thriller atmosphere.There're a few graphical bugs (not critical) and character turning animation is too slow.

												Going to be one of the lone dissenters here, in the hopes that others with a similar mindset may read this and be saved the trouble.I'm somewhat of an adventure game addict - I have played a ton, including all the classics. Cognition is trying to be a ""hybrid"" with the inclusion of action game situations - a formula that works for some, and may even bring some new fans to the genre, but adds essentially a feature that is nerve-wracking to those of us wanting a traditional adventure game. There *are* timed sequences to the game, as well as situations where you have to think fast, or do things in an explicit order just the right way. This isn't a relaxing, exploratory adventure at all.  It's trying to go for intense and cinematic, like a low budget Fahrenheit Prophecy. However, at least those games rely on QTE's; mice, especially ones with twitchy drivers, just aren't good for precision timing when you're getting all sweaty and nervous trying to click on the right set of pixels.Furthermore, although I have a rather strong stomach for gore and horror... I still hate torture. And this seems the entire premise of the game, at least for chapter 1. If you're squeamish at all about torture scenes, I'd advise even staying clear of the comic. It's just something that squicks me out. I'd prefer seeing heads pop off in Wasteland 2 to slow, agonizing self-mutiliation scenes.I'm sure this is all just me whinging about personal gripes, and YMMV - most people really enjoy the game, and it's awesome that it's trying to be unique. It just wasn't my cup of tea.			"

Posted: September 13, 2014
												Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller is a mature point-and-click (P&C) adventure game heavily focused on storytelling and puzzle-solving with high doses of drama, thrills and unexpected twists which grab your attention right from the start. Set as a gritty murder mystery theme with supernatural elements, you follow Erica Reed, a FBI agent in Boston, trying to unveil and take down the Cain Killer who murdered her brother. While the concept may sound a bit convoluted, it does its job surprisingly well, enough to express gratitude to its godfather, the Gabriel Knight series, for the inspiration and stand on for its own merits.The strongest point of Cognition is perhaps in its story and narration. Firstly, Cognition is not for the faint hearted. Unlike most P&C adventure games which are traditionally light hearted and occasionally “cartoony” in tone, that is absolutely not the case here. Instead, it is a totally fresh approach -- albeit nothing new per se –- for adults looking for a genuine thriller. As stated earlier, Gabriel Knight is clearly a big inspiration, however Cognition pushes that envelope. What starts as a simple search for the Cain Killer, it eventually turns into a complex story where Erica finds out that there are more killers similar to him, each with their own creepy personalities and unique, yet gruesome, ways to kill their victims and how other characters turn out to be not what they might have seemed at first glance. Almost everyone is hiding dark secrets, and there are plenty of legitimate moments of unexpected twists which you would have never thought of. It can be argued that the game feels like a B-type movie, but if that were the case, it would be amongst the best. Cognition boasts many moments of shock horror, tension and emotional rollercoasters in its journey; sometimes to its own detriment, funnily enough. As much as the story is solid throughout the game, at times it does feel a bit forced with the whole mature content and the melodrama from some of its characters in certain situations, as if the developers tried really hard to make an emotional impact on the audience. So yes, it is forced at times, but nevertheless it is good to see that they are taking risks and throwing all they got into your face. So, on a personal note, it does have an impact. In the end, after the shocking revelations in Episode 3 and seeing the final conclusion, I felt for the characters. Although the story does stumble upon some pacing issues typically midway through an episode, they all start and end on high notes. Lastly, Erica Reed is an exceptionally well-written female protagonist. A bit cocky at times, but as her character development grows with each new episode you start to like her even more and sympathise for what she has to go through. Plus, the voice actor for her is amazing. There is rarely a moment where she cannot deliver a line appropriately.The most unique game mechanic, even for a P&C adventure game, is Erica’s supernatural cognitive powers which allow her to see events from the past when touching objects. This makes puzzle-solving and the gameplay in general fresh and interesting, setting them aside from the traditional and mundane mechanics of clicking around to see what happens. Moreover, each episode introduces other new abilities and mechanics which allow her to perform various other tasks. In general, the cognitive mechanics are ingenious, functional and most importantly fun to use.The hand drawn artwork and backgrounds capture that comic book vibe brilliantly and set the mood fittingly. Likewise, all the cutscenes never seize to be so captivating and tense. There is nothing not to love about them. On the other hand, there are possibly two grips with them: the character drawings move statically during the cutscenes and some of the hand drawn backgrounds can look a bit rushed and unpolished in some areas. But with a great soundtrack as well, Cognition’s setting and atmosphere are well established.The puzzles here never feel hard throughout most of the game, but they can still be challenging (especially in the second last episode) and sometimes silly. Yes, there are a few puzzles which seem a bit out of place (ie. lockpicking the boss’s office in full view of everyone else) which can break some of the immersion, but in most parts Cognition provides interesting approaches to puzzles with its cognitive mechanics. The puzzles get even better with each new episode, except in the final episode which lacks as many puzzles as in previous episodes and instead focuses more on tying all the loose ends of the story.Surprisingly, through a first playthrough, the game can last as long as 20 hours, at least in my case. Thus it provides quite a lot content for its current price tag; substantially more than other adventure games out there, even compared to high budget ones. Even through a second playthrough, now knowing how to solve all the puzzles and where to go to look for clues, the game is perhaps around 15 hours long, which is still remarkable.As much as Cognition seems to be like the best new P&C adventure game in years, it has some major flaws which can harm what it sets to achieve. Firstly, graphically it is not impressive at all and by that I mean the character models. Since it uses the Unity engine, the characters look like plasticine. Moreover, the animations are not impressive either. There will be moments which they can break immersion if you are a nitpicky person. If you are looking for something as fluent and polished up as The Book Of Unwritten Tales’ graphics for example, Cognition is not what you are looking for. And that is a big problem because it makes Cognition look unprofessional on the surface. While the artwork is great and praise-worthy, seeing average looking models with clunky animations on top of beautifully hand drawn backgrounds can be underwhelming. Luckily, if you own the Game of the Year Edition, most of the animations are much smoother and polished up, but nothing too drastic. The transition from the hand drawn characters in cutscenes to 3D does not work.Secondly, due to the scope of the game and the size of the team, there had to be some compromises on realism. For instance, buildings can be rather unpopulated. The FBI station’s main office is a long room with no more than around six people (not all interactive) including Erica inside. Surely the FBI has a lot more agents in a single room in real-life. It is understandable that being confined by a small budget and probably lack of manpower stopped the team from adding more realistic details. And on the topic of realism, in a way it fails to realistically capture how FBI agents actually behave and work due to some improbable dialogues and situations which you would not see in real-life. While the story is gripping and it is its stongest point, Cognition is not very realistic in some aspects.Lastly, the support characters can be corny and cliché at times, but plausible if you can accept them as they are. Conclusively, Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller is a blasting experience from start to finish which will sure leave a good lasting impression after finishing its long gritty story in the style of Gabriel Knight and Jack The Ripper; even despite its flaws due to the lack of resources that well-established companies like Telltale Games have at their hands. It is good see such a young and talented developing team taking risks with their mature story and unique gameplay mechanics. It definitely rivals acclaimed games such as The Walking Dead and even Jane Jensen’s Gabriel Knight in the story department. So if that is enough incentive for you to give this game a chance and get past its undercooked graphics and animations, it will be the best $10 you will ever spend. And yes, I would proudly say this was the best point-and-click adventure game of 2013. Highly recommended!			"

												Good game for detective stories fans :) As I am. You'll notice some bugs, but rather funny than annoying :) (see: the gallery) The game is not only point&click, has some action you have to take right...or die ;) Great story, great hangman's face look (scary! I still see him in my dreams), and what's the best - you feel like being the detective, inside the story, which I like most.			"

												Awesome story, great art style, great sound, music, and I didn't notice any major bugs. The animations could use a little work, but other than that, I'd say it's an A+ title. This is one of the few episodic adventure games that I could actually sit down and play through both of the first two episodes in a single sitting, AND still want more. These episodes aren't really that short, either.			"

												Personal Rating: Solid game, not recommended for casual players (like myself)Classic Rating: ★★★☆☆Strong Points:✓ Exceptional Graphic Art, you can feel many hours spent in game developing: characters, backgrounds and cut scenes are very detailed and good-looking.✓ Soundtrack: It's composed by two Volumes (as DLCs) and I only got the first one but it's been a pleasure listening to it even when I wasn't playing the game - absolutely no complaints.Mixed Points:✘ Inventory and Psion features: They are not easy to use and sometimes understand, on the contrary they get pretty messed-up. The complexity of game's puzzle probably demanded that but developers should have tried and found out a better compromise.✘ Story and puzzles: The story is one of the strongest and weakest point of this game. Very, very deep, probably too deep. Aided by the fact that English isn't my primary language, it was very difficult to follow the story progress over each chapter.. it got each time more and more complicated and so did puzzles. Very often you are left without sufficient enough clues to solve them, that your only hope is trial and error. I got so frustrated playing the last chapter that I quit in the middle of it without completing the game.So, it's basically what I said on top: this game has a lot of qualities and maybe you're going to fully enjoy it; however if you're not a ""point and click"" hard-core gamer but you still like this genre, I can't recommend to play ""Cognition"" - there are many more accessible and funner games than this one.

												That was a really entertaining adventure/investigation game to play :+ Good story+ Nice graphic style+ Good voice acting+ Interesing and logical puzzles+ Rather good music+ The cognition system, clever and interesting to use+ Trading cards and achievements- Moving characters is a bit slow- 3D models are not all that great- Starting at episode 3, I had some funny bug with Erica's model : from time to time, after a load or a cutscene, her model was completly freaked out ... hands in air, head pushed back against her back, and head spinning 360° permanently ... funny to watch but kinda breaking the mood. It stops after you start moving her again.- Some puzzles, though logical, are a pita (especially the one at the end of episode 2, requiring you to remember every insignificant detail of the case ... the map on episode 4 is also difficult, mainly because of the way it's presented)- Some achievements (especially episode 1) require you to replay, in a slightly different way, almost half of the episode case- Some dialogues or cutscenes can not be interrupted sometimes, not even sure if it's on purpose or a bug.- Some inconsistancies : Erica pulling her gun on her partner, entering suspect locations alone ... not very plausible.Despite those little flaws, it's definitely a recommanded game, imho.NB : Expect around 20h if you aim for 100% achievements.

Review of all 4 episodesI was ambivalent about recommending this game. It's in dire need of editing (both in the story and in the gaming elements) and full of technical problems. It's almost reaching the ""so bad it's good"" end of the spectrum. And yet it's also fun and beautiful and original. I'm giving it a yes because I'm a sucker for lovable trainwrecks, but only if you buy it heavily discounted. Because while I'm all for supporting devs that create a project of love (which this game clearly is), for that asking price I also want a polished experience (which this game CLEARLY isn't).Here's a rundown of what to expect:* A very convoluted story of the crime/supernatural B-movie variety, that tries its damnedest to twist whenever a twist is possible, and also when it's not. It often makes no narrative sense, yet it has moments when it's surprisingly gripping. I also appreciate the bleak and mature atmosphere it tries to convey. Treat it like a paperback novel, one that's not winning any awards, yet is fun if you don't take it too seriously. * Characters so weird that they're occasionally interesting, with inexplicable/over the top motivations, often completely unlikable (which makes them occasionally very likeable - which, again, is weird).* Puzzles covering the whole range from the very original, refreshing, interesting and satisfying to the ""so obvious it's funny"" and ""so unnecessarily complicated and counterintuitive it's clear someone was trying too hard"". Add to that some mind-numbingly boring fetch quests, a bunch of questionable QTEs of the ""die 5 times in order to figure the puzzle out"" variety and a later added ""trust"" system that completely undermines any meaningul storytelling coherence, and you can officially say this game has it all. Yes, that was sarcasm. Or not, your mileage may vary.* An honest if somehow flawed effort at gameplay progression and variety from episode to episode. Every chapter introduces new gameplay and puzzle elements, that for the most parts add to the game. Though again, when you try to do everything, chance are few you'll get anything right. Often you're just left baffled at why oh why no one told these devs that not EVERY idea they come up with needs to be implemented in one single game.* Gorgeous comic-book visuals, at least while nothing is moving. Once a character starts to walk though, we verge on ""so bad it's good"" territory.* Great soundtrack, good sound design overall, very hit and miss (mostly miss) voice acting.* Poor, though not horrible, UI.* A very mediocre hint system that tries not to ruin immersion yet often lets you down (especially when later on the story becomes so confusing you don't have a clue what you're doing next).Most importantly, you should be aware to expect:* Glitches. Oh the glitches. Hilarious dancing characters, persistent floating objects, clipping, dialog skips, dialog repetitions, and so on and so forth. Also: Occasional crashes. Overall: General technical incompetence. This is again one of the areas where you've got it all, from utter frustration to incredible ""so bad it's epic"" laughs. If it's any consolation, most of the glitches and bugs are not game breaking (though you may need to be prepared for the occasional restart from the latest save point).So after all this, why did I click yes? Because this game has moments of sheer brilliance. Even if they are drowning in a sea of near misses, complete disasters and epic fails. It tries really really hard to include everything and your dog, and in the end it succeeds in very little. It's very often like watching a trainwreck. And yet those moments of brilliance in it are geniunely fun to play. Despite all the problems (and sometimes because of them), I had fun with this game.			"

												Serial killers, torture devices and psychic powers - the story of Cognition is a mix of Saw and The X-Files. You play as FBI agent Erica Reed, trying to solve a series of serial killings with the help of a unique psychic ability. Each episode focuses on 1 serial killer, but there's an overarching story connecting all of them. I would like to say more, but I'm afraid of revealing too much.Gameplay-wise, the best thing about the game is the hint-system. If you're ever stuck, you can message one of Erica's friends in-game with your phone. The hints are helpful most of the time, but they won't give you the answers outright, so you still keep a sense of accomplishment when making progress.Another nice feature is that there's a button that reveals all hotspots, so you won't be pixel-hunting!The graphics are decent enough although the character animations aren't the best. The music and voice acting are excellent though. Some of my favourite tracks are played when you're solving a puzzle or trying to escape a scary situation.Complaints:1) A few logic glitches allow you to do the same thing more than once, but the effect is the same. Luckily this doesn't actually hinder progress, but it may confuse the player a little.2) Dialogue is mostly skippable, but there are some you can't skip, and it gets annoying when it occurs in the middle of a puzzle.Overall verdict: 8.5/10One of the best point-and-click adventure games ever.

												Solid adventure game, exactly my speed.Quick description: An FBI agent with psychic powers can't let go of the unsolved case of her murdered brother.  A series of apparently unrelated cases, with a high body count and plenty of gruesome crimes along the way, eventually lead her to a final confrontation with her nemesis.Gameplay is well done.  A traditional point and click interface adds a thoughtfully designed psychic angle, giving play an extra dimension.  I normally find point & click games tedious but this one was fun.  Agent Reed's powers develop as the game goes on and new mechanics are introduced right up to the last chapter, which keeps things fresh.  There's no pixel hunting, as you can always highlight interactive items in any area.  The built-in hint system has a very light touch - it was enough to get me through the game without ever consulting an external walkthrough, yet it wasn't a big enough crutch that it felt like cheating.I liked the writing.  There is a large cast of characters, most of whom are a bit too stereotypical, but still likeable and well-acted.  I could have done without the old black woman full of gentle wisdom and mystical knowledge, who you have to visit time and again to receive psychic tutorials; but the forensics nerd, the by-the-book FBI captain, the donut-eating street partner, and the random people you meet at the post office, college administration, etc. are believable and entertaining enough.  Dialogue gets right to the point which is always welcome.  Some characters recur enough for you to become very familiar with them over the course of the game; but except for the woman mentioned above, none overstay their welcome.The story is well thought out and compelling, and kept me always motivated to find out what would happen in the next scene.  So many other adventure games start strong and then lose my interest in a swamp of nonsensical items and locations, but everything that happens in Cognition is on-task and furthers the plot.  Well ... almost.  Chapter 3 begins with a long, long sequence about reading the past of a sister and two brothers, that doesn't feel like it has much to do with anything.  This section came very close to losing my attention, as Agent Reed is presented with several different scenes all at once, some of which cannot be solved until others are completed, requiring a lot of tiresome flipping back and forth to try to figure out where the critical plot point is that will unlock progress in another scene.Once I got through that section, it became clear why this was all relevant to the story, and the game returned to its (thankfully) more straightforward puzzle-oriented idiom.The graphic style is a little weird.  There's something ugly about the lighting and the bright highlights on all the character outlines.  I don't play games like this for AAA visuals and the game communicates well, but be warned that this is a low budget game and looks it.I like the soundtrack.  Scary.  I'll be loading it into my road playlist to remember the game by.Bottom line: worth 17 hours of my time, and nowadays when I have more games than I can ever play, that's a big deal.  I would not have felt ripped off if I'd paid full price $15 for it.  Of course it goes on sale from time to time so you should be able to grab it for just a few bucks if you're patient.  In any case, get this game and support these devs.  They did a good thing here and are taking adventure games in a good direction.			"

Posted: February 8, 2015
												Right now, this is a review about the first episode and ~10% of the second one.First of all, I really like the art style of this game. It has that comic book/cell shading aesthetic you may already know from Telltale games like ""The Walking Dead"" or ""The Wolf Among Us"" (or even -non TTG- XIII but that was quite a while ago). Most of the backgrounds are hand drawn though, which results in a very comic-escque blend. I prefer it over the ""Telltale Style"" which sometimes feels a bit too sterile for my taste.The soundtrack as a whole is right around the upper threshold of ""Okay"", surpassing it with some haunting piano pieces, dipping way into ""Meh"" regions in the selection of the ambient theme of a store you visit quite regularly. Someone really dropped the ball there, light hearted, up-tempo Bossa (Elevator Music, basically) doesn't mix with moody antique stores/spiritual guidance etablissements that only open when the sun goes down.Most of the voice acting is great, bordering on sublime, especially in the cases of the two main investigators. Unfortunately there are some very weak performances as well, including the obligatory badly faked Louisiana accent.With aesthetics out of the way, let's take a look at the controls: They're awful.I'm not even kidding. Rarely has a game made me groan out in annoyance as often as Cognition did in the few hours I spent with it so far. Granted, for the most part it was a mix of sub-par puzzle design and awkward controls, but still.The protagonist reacts rather lethargically to your mouse input. It kinda feels like you're trying to get an 18-wheeler to move instead of a rather athletic young Special Agent of ~60kg (~130lbs).There are also some really unnecessary animations. In the office you can't move until the door of the elevator you just stepped out of closes. Sitting down by your desk, opening a door, it all just manages to overshoot the sweet spot (in terms of the length of the animation) ever so slightly. Lots of tiny things that really slow down the games pace and make you dread the idea of having to visit locations more often than necessary (which the game, being an adventure game after all, requires you to do pretty much all the time). Same for the ""I can't use the dead squirrel with the cheese grater"" monologue snippets the adventure game veteran loves to hate. All just that tiny bit too long. It helps turning off the tutorials in the menu, though.Then there's the controls on maps and elevator panels and such. Think you can just click the floor/location you want to get to? Guess again, it opens the context menu, which gives you the option to ""Inspect"" or ""Use (go to)"" said floor or location. Every. Damn. Time.There's always a ~2 second loading time when switching screens, which also gets old very quickly. You'd think that a game with pre-rendered backgrounds, released in 2012, would handle that a bit more gracefully. Same for the transitions into and out of the ""Intuition"" mechanic.You also get unexplainable interface lags. Entering a room or exiting an inspection (more on that later) sometimes causes the user interface to be unresponsive for up to 5 seconds. The game itself doesn't lag, animations, music, everything runs smoothly, you just can't click or do anything, sometimes the interface overlay doesn't even show up but sometimes it does. This was especially noticeable in the first ""action scene"" of the game. Now, what do I mean when I say inspection? Well, that's basically all screens that have the word ""Exit"" written on them in blue letters. It happens when you're sitting at a desk, when you're ""zooming in"" to inspect certain items closer, stuff like that. Now while you're inside an inspection-screen you won't be able to open certain other inspection-screens. This may sound a bit abstract but let me give you an example: One puzzle requires you to sit at a desk (first inspection level), use a computer (next inspection level) and read a text file on that computer, which contains the code word to open something you have in your inventory. You won't be able to inspect (in this case: zoom in to be able to interact with) said inventory item to enter the code until you logged out of the computer and stood up from the desk.Also, if you're using two monitors you gotta be careful not to click outside the game window. Even in fullscreen mode the game doesn't capture the cursor.One quirk I noticed: When you leave a location to the map screen and you click that location again, the sound of the car's motor still plays, although you never actually travelled anywhere.But wait, there's more:In certain cases, the game gives you the option to make a decision. Take this or that agent to the interrogation, accept or decline the lunch invitation of your FWB-slash-colleague (it's complicated), force or persuade a witness to make a statement. In other cases it forces you to steal a flower from someones grave because you forgot to bring your own for the anniversary of your brother's death. Now I get that you're trying to do some exposition here, but man. Really?Also, plot holes. Example:You get taken off a case because it's too personal. It was your case, the whole first episode revolved around it. In the end you realize that the next victim is going to be your boss. You hurry to the scene, guns blazing, but it's already too late and the murderer gets away. During your debrief with the new boss you start to feel a little dizzy and stumble to the bathroom. On your way there, before falling unconscious, you see a woman dragging your FWB-slash-colleague (""Sully"") out of the door, cutting his ear off with a scalpel. What you didn't know is that you and Sully were drugged by your impostor office assistant while waiting outside the bosses office for your debriefs. Right after you wake up the boss assigns you to the case. Literally 20 minutes (that's ingame time, about 30 seconds real time) after taking you off of a case that's too personal because your boss died in it he assigns you to a case in which both you and your love interest are the victims. He doesn't even give you the time to get up.Then there's the usual minor deus-ex-machina, logical error and/or techno-babble you always quietly hope they manage to avoid but they always fail to (minor spoilers):- police officer needs your phone's PIN number to send you a GPS-location- magical gadget from techno geek/forensics expert/trapped in friendzone-limbo ""pal"" (more on him later) only needs the manufacturer's color code from a spray paint can to make text that was sprayed over in said color appear. It also tricks finger print readers by projecting an image of the finger print onto the detector- FBI outpost records interrogations on tape but doesn't have any gear to listen to the recordings- grumpy old coroner won't give you her tape recorder to listen to potentionally critical recordings- the office assistant's computer shows a (presumably...hopefully) confidential case file opened on her screen- the lead investigators monitor also always shows that case file, even after logging out and leaving the desk- so do several other computers in that office- office full of people doesn't give a rat's a** that you're picking the door to your bosses officeAnd then, finally, there's the cast. Pretty compelling for the most part, like already mentioned with the odd outlier but there's also ""pal"". Evidently the two of you took some undergrad courses together and evidently he's been sleeping on a pillow with your face printed on it and sobbing into his TV dinners ever since. He actually pretty much looks like the ""2/10, would not bang""-guy from that old image macro. Unfortunately I'm running out of characters but their interactions are really something. I just hope it's done on purpose.			"

												It’s an emotional roller-coaster ride that keeps you on your toes and just wondering what will happen.  Few games these days make you feel.  In an era where mindless first-person shooters and grindy MMOs only have your fingers twitching, it’s a refreshing change of pace to make your MIND twitch.  I was left speechless and in tears by the time my experience was over, and I find myself longing for more.			"

												This is a wonderful game with a well-crafted and deeply engrossing story. It is basically a point & click adventure with some innovative twists to it. I highly recommend reading the prequel-comics before playing, as it sets out the background very well.Since this game is so good, I'll get the bad out of the way first:- Most animations are unskippable, as are some dialogues. If you accidentally click on an object at the other side of the room, you are forced to wait until Erica walks all the way over there and interacts with it before you can continue playing- Unlike the classic take of point&click games where you could just pick up everything you might ever need, Erica often won't pick something up unless she knows she's gonna use it. This results in having to backtrack and having to go through places you've already searched just to get something you couldn't before.- It isn't always clear what to do. It feels at times like the game is forcing you to use the hint system.- Episode 4 drifts away from the standard point & click style and into choice-based dialogues where you die if you say the wrong thing. It isn't as fun as the previous chapters (gameplay wise).Ok, now the good:- Great detective story with many twists and turns, interesting characters and a well designed investigation at its center- Erica's powers provide a very cool and unique take on the genre- The game remains refreshing, providing new powers and other gameplay mechanics in each chapter- Fun, challenging puzzles that will make you think outside the box- Comicbook like graphics that fit the game perfectly- Wonderful soundtrack that keeps you in the moodIf you're into the genre, this game is definitely worth your money.

Posted: July 31, 2016
												Okay so after finishing the first chapter and a bit of the second chapter I can safely say i'm probably not going to finish the rest of this game.This game suffers from three main problems that completely break immersion and make the game unenjoyable to play.The first (and main) problem that this game has is pacing. It pads itself out needlessly. In one instance: the player sees an interactable object that is clearly meant to be picked up. The protagonist refuses to pick up said object because ""she has no need of it yet"". Then, several scenes later, during an interrogation scene, the protagonist needs the object, resulting in the player to backtrack all the way to where the object was located. Mind you, the movement speed of the protagonist is incredibly slow and the game has unskipable animations. In case of the dreaded interrogation scene, the player first has to quit the dialogue screen, then stand up, then walk all the way to the door and then press exit before being allowed the option to select the map and loading the area where the protagonist (not the player!) neglected to pick up the very obviously placed item in the first place.  This has to be done every.single.time the player forgot something or the player didn't forget something but the protagonist simply refused to acknowledge something. This problem would have been fixed easily if the UI was equiped with a button that instantly brought the player to the map screen. It also doesn't help that the game is awfully particular about how you have to solve certain dialogue trees. ""I am hungry"" says a character. ""Have a donut"" I reply. However, the game won't let me give the donut to the character. I instead have to backtrack to a vending machine, grab some crisps, offer the crisps to the man only for him to tell me ""No i prefer something sweet"" so i could give him the donut that i wanted to offer him in the first place. (edit: Notice how a lot of the time spent in the game has NOTHING to do with solving murders in a fashion that involves the paranormal and instead has you running after people's needs like some disheveled butler because they're too lazy to do it themselves)This brings me to the second point: Some of the puzzels make NO logical sense and are incredibly convoluted. Mind you that some puzzels are nicely written, like the one at the start at the game. There's a clear cut problem, you acquire certain tools that let you deal with that problem and you solve that problem. However later on in the game certain hurdles are being thrown at the player without any clear-cut explanation as to how to deal with them. There is a hint system but if some of the puzzles made more sense then the hint system wouldn't be needed. This in conjunction with the constant backtracking and the unskippable animations/slow movement speed makes the game incredibly grating. You can spend 10 minutes with this game and have the impression that you haven't progressed much at all.The third, and last, problem that his game has is character design. I'm going to assume that the developers of this game are teenagers, or had the mindset thereof, when designing Erica Reed (our main protagonist). For example, she pulls a gun on her collegue ""because she is angry"" when said collegue asked her to wait for reinforcements. She's constantly acting like an angsty teenager but she's supposedly a 30-something FBI agent. At one point one of the characters called her performance as an fbi agent wildly inconsistent and as a player i'd have to agree. She's certainly not the most professional or likable person that I played as. Her collegues are not much better. You have the cliché fat guy who always sits at his desk eating donuts, never lifting a finger. You have the cliché ♥♥♥♥♥y boss lady who is screaming at you one second and asks you how you're holding up immediately after. You have the nondescript receptionist lady whose name i can't recall. And finally you have the guy who offers weird, unwanted sexual tension because what poorly written tv drama could ever go without that trope.  Come to think of it, that's precisely what the characters are. Tropes.  They never feel like well rounded characters and as a result you never get to feel personally involved in what's going on. I always felt like i was playing a video game, as opposed to being absorbed into the story. Also, much of the story is being told by the exposition lady at the antique store (kind of makes me wonder why Erica Reed never visited her before the game began). Thankfully, dialogue is skipable (notice how this isn't something to boast about).The game does have some genuinly nice and satisfying moments, but they're too scarse for me to recommend this title.Avoid like the plague.Props for the visual style though.

												I was drawn to Cognition because it had the same art style as Jane Jensen's game, Gray Matter, and it also offered the same type of addictive story-telling that I enjoyed so much. The music was also good, it set the mood for a modern noir detective story and it helped with the immersion.Just to give you an idea of what the story is about, it's about an FBI agent named Erica Reed who uses her psychic powers to see the past which helps her piece together her murder investigations. It's something akin to Law & Order meets The Medium.I enjoyed Erica's refreshing personality and her interactions with her partner, John, and her on-again-off-again lover, Sully; she was sarcastic and witty and I related to her struggle for moral insight during investigations as well as making peace with the past and letting go. And, just the theme in general is interesting since Erica was able to interact with items and see visions from the past that added perspective and depth to the story.And the game also brings up the long debated argument and encourages players to question if crime is ever justified.I'm sure I could go on and on about the game but I don't want to spoil it nor turn this review into a novel.The game has four episodes and it took me roughly seventeen hours to play through comfortably without rushing. I personally recommend that you find the time to sit down and play Cognition rather than play it in short bursts, otherwise you run the risk of forgetting small details about the story. In this game, every little bit matters and ties up at the end.Be forewarned, it has quite a few moments in which I personally got stuck on certain puzzles and needed to do certain things that I would never think of trying unless I had the guide handy. You can use the Gameboomers one without too much worry of seeing spoilers as you progress. Unlike some other episodic games, Cognition ends satisfyingly well and without a cliff-hanger that would beg for a sequel; it ends in a way that doesn't require a sequel but it certainly is open for one if the writers choose to continue. So, you probably won't need to worry about feeling that continuity itch.			"

												Iam pretty sure i got this game from a bundle, so i dont see whats the point to write a review, my opinion wont be counted, handled as a secondary citizen, but i liked this game so why not?Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller is a crime themed point and click game. Some part of the game pretty scary, some very emotional and all of the game very interesting.The story immense, interesting and you cant stop about thinking what will happen next. Voice acting decent, awesome music, if you own this game you definetly should play this game.The game has a few issues, game frozen 3 times on episode 1 this issue not came up on other episodes tho. There are graphical issues asswell, related to character bodies but you will forget about these while enjoying the story.			"

												This is a really excellent adventure game with a great crime drama mystery story. The puzzles are all pretty well thought out and although the Steam version of this game has a couple of graphical bugs it's nothing game breaking. The graphics and character animations are really well done. As for the characters you, probably won't learn that much about anyone else until after half way through but Erica Reed is incredible all her own. I highly encourage anyone who has this game to try it. Each episode is about 4 hours long. I spent a little over 20 hours on this game and enjoyed every minute of it. It's definitely something that will keep your interest.			"

Which is sad, because there are some redeeming features, such as interesting characters and plot, plus nice background art (character models look kind of disturbing, though)Bonus Feature: Three Crashes in under 2h playtime!

IntroductionWhen I first encountered Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller, it was in a bundle -It looked interesting but I put it on the back burner since I was busy with other games. Fast forward a few years, I asked my friends on Steam what game I should play as a break from my usual things, and this title came up. After looking into I realized this seemed like a great idea! I had not played a point-and-click adventure game in a while, the other reviews seemed positive and it was recommended by friends as well. Drawn in by the comic book art style and the opportunity to play a female protagonist I booted the game up and instantly became addicted. This title offers a solid story, good gameplay and hours of fun for any gamer.UpsideDive into a gritty detective story filled with twists and turns: The story is told in four separate episodes, all focusing on the titular character, Erica Reed. She’s an FBI agent from Boston who has special psychic powers that help her see the past and even into people’s memories. Three years prior to the game, Erica’s brother was brutally murdered by a serial killer and this haunts her throughout the whole game. I enjoyed the first two episodes a lot as they focused on Agent Reed solving cases, however the plot gets deeper by the third episode and things begin to focus mainly on Erica and her abilities. Not much can be said without giving away spoilers, but even at its weakest points the story kept me glued to my seat wanting to find out what would happen next.Make choices that affect the story and solve interesting puzzles: At certain points in the game, you have the option to make choices which directly affect how the story goes. Granted, you’ll always end up in the same place at the end but there are slight differences, plus, if you want all the Steam achievements you’ll have to make different choices at different places. The game also has plenty of puzzles to keep you busy, they’re mainly all logic puzzles since you are playing a detective. Using Erica’s special abilities helps to solve cases and as the game goes on you’ll learn new tricks and ways to get to the answers you seek. The game also has modern tools, like searching the internet, for finding evidence and information.Enjoy beautiful comic book inspired artwork and great voice acting: While it may not be everyone’s cup of tea, I loved this game aesthetically. It felt like I was in an actual comic book and created a great immersive experience. The game has cutscenes that help tell the story, all of which are fully voice acted by a great cast of characters. Despite Erica having a case of “Me accent be slipping” and some characters sounding a bit flat during dramatic moments, overall everyone does a good job. The background music also helps round out the package and soundtrack itself is available to purchase as well.DownsideThe story can get a bit convoluted: I really did love the story in this game, especially the first two chapters where you were doing actual detective work. However, the third and fourth chapters focus on Erica’s powers and a certain other character I won’t spoil. The entire third episode is spent in one apartment building, while it did explain some backstory it wasn’t much about Erica and slowed down the pacing of the game. The fourth episode did pick up a bit and gave a thrilling conclusion but I was still left with many questions.The graphics engine is pretty wonky: After asking around about this issue, I found out this game was made with an older version of the Unity engine. Because of that, even at its highest graphical settings, the game just has many weird moments. Items float in mid-air, Erica’s body twists in unnatural ways and people’s faces do weird things. These weren’t enough to make me dislike the game, but they did take me out of the story when they happened. I had the game at the best graphics quality so perhaps I had these happen to me less than others would, but they still happened so fair warning. ConclusionIf you’re a fan of point-and-click games or want to get into the genre then grab Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller, as it is now you can buy all four episodes at once and marathon the whole story and I would say it’s worth the full price tag. It’s an older game and certainly not perfect, be warned that Erica moves at a snail’s pace and isn’t always very reactive to where you click, but I feel the good story makes up for the game’s faults. It has Steam trading cards and achievements that aren’t too hard to collect. Be ready to sink a good amount of time into this game, however, this title does have violence in it and a bit of crude language so young ones and parents be mindful of this.Lunar Productions[lunarproduction.com]The Hidden Levels[thehiddenlevels.com] "

												Cognition is a good buy and I suggest that waiting for a big discount will make things better.When all the game reviewers say that this game is like a roller coaster ride, they were not kidding. The story lines were full of twists which were unexpected to even begin with. The story line is at the top so just read it. I'm not going to spoil anything.The level designs are good, though plagued with occational bugs and glitches (It didn't ruin the game but it was still irritating to see them sometimes). Be warned though, the puzzles can be tough at times and it can get rather vague at the first 2 episodes.Soundtrack successfully immerses players into the game so go ahead and buy the soundtrack along with the game. You know it is good when it can immerse and go along with whatever situation that goes along.Puzzles can be creative at times and seriously, you will have to think ALOT in this game or you will not progress anywhere. While most games only introduce and shows you whatever the main character does for a living, this game shoves you into their shoes and expects you to try it out.This game is a 4/5 :D			"

												I'm a big fan of ""point-and-click"" adventure games, and this one was fabulous.  I love that it's set in Boston (if you've been there for any length of time, you can shortcut a few puzzles, which made me feel all smug), even though the accents can be a little cringe-y, and the use of Erica's postcog skills is an awesome mechanic that adds to and diverges from the standard ""combine everything in the room and your inventory"" trope.  I played the first two episodes and couldn't stop thinking about it until I got the last two (and played them in one sitting).			"

												If you are a fan of the point and click genre, get this without second thought. You play as the guttsy Erica Reed, an fbi agent trying to find her brother's murderer. The gameplay has a nice new twist from the usual point and clicks as she uses her psionic abilities to solve puzzles, like touching an object and seeing its past, memory manipulation to recover lost memories and more. The story gets more and more intriguing as it unfolds, all the puzzle pieces comes together to form a  clear and crazy picture at the end.			"

												If you like me, grew up on a steady diet of the classic Sierra and LucasArts adventure games this game is for you. If the fact that Jane Jensen (legendary designer of Gabriel Knight) is involved as a story consultant isn't enough...The story is a potent mix of influences from The X-files, the SAW movies and the tv show Dexter as you guide FBI Agent Erica Reed on various investigations hoping to maybe pick up the trail of the elusive 'Cain Killer'.The graphic is stylized comic-book like (much like Telltale's The Walking Dead) and the puzzles vary from easy to somewhat challenging even for a veteran of Sierra's games. The best puzzles usually involves Erica's special gift. The music is haunting and beautiful and the talented Raleigh Holmes (lead singer of The Scarlet Furies) does a fine job bringing Erica to life. The fact that the plot branches and there are often multiple ways to progress enhances replayability.If you like a creepy, suspensful, sometimes gruesome (Episode 2 get's kinda gory..) paranormal mystery story who's characters stay with you, give Cognition a try. I don't think you will be dissapointed...			"

												In Cognition, you play Erica Reed (of course), a detective with the FBI, as she solves cases. This is a point-and-click adventure game, with various puzzles along the way. The unique twist in the game is that Erica also has a psychic ability which you can enlist to help solve the mysteries she encounters. I really wasn't expecting much, as most point-and-click games are merely competent, but nothing special. In this case, however, I have been very pleasantly surprised. Everything about this game is done incredibly well, from the graphics, to the music, to the voice acting, to the strong female protagonist, to the well-written story. The puzzles you encounter along the way are sometimes challenging, but not impossible. Highly recommended for anyone who likes this kind of game, I doubt you will be disappointed in the end.			"

												A detective Adventure Game with an interesting ""psy"" mechanic/puzzle: what is more to say? oh. ok. Cognition is pitched for Adventure gamers and it delivers a great detective story even if a little flawed. It shows that this is not a big budget title, but this is still a very good indie title.Visuals are reasonably good but are jarring at times (just plain ugly and an occassional graphic glitch). Voice Acting and Sound is good. The occassional Graphic Novel styling is good and not used enough. Puzzles are usually tricky and/or complicated. Interface is ok: it is likely that it may cause you trouble at times. The real star is the interesting story & overall good dialogue which keeps everything rolling on. Erica Reed is good main character,  but the entire supporting cast is just forgettable.A rare treat for Adventure Gamers: this is a must. It might be a a little intimidating to people new to Adventure Games: get it if there is a really good sale.			"

If you're a gamer and are into detective stories, do not miss this gem!This is one of the very best point and click adventure/detective games I've played ever.  In most point and click adventure games, you just click some items on the screen in order to progress the story.  But in this game, you actually feel like you're a real detective, doing the gumshoe thing and piecing evidence together in order to track down the murderer.  You use your psionic abilities to see into the past, you pick up photographs and items and try to figure out what they are and their significance to the case.  I highly recommend that when playing the game, you have a real pen and little notebook with you so you can quickly jot down notes and be more immersed in the game.			"

												Cognition is just ok. Given the pedigree of people involved I was hoping it was more Gabriel Knight, but it ends up being more CSI Boston. The over arching story is decent. The game is fairly easy. With point and clicks the pacing of the game can be ruined if the puzzles are too challenging. This game strikes a decent enough balance between challenge and pacing. There's about 18 hours of game here. There is a lot of time just spent listening to Erica have conversations. The graphics style is very much in that of a comic-book. The animation of Erica herself looks weird a lot of the time. The model used for her face looks a bit odd too. She looks kinda like a puppet that could've been Chucky's mom. There are a few interesting game mechanics revolving around psychic abilities that were reasonably well done. There just isn't anything spectacular about Cognition. It's all been done before. I still did enjoy playing through Cognition, but I was hoping for more.			"

												Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller is an excellent adventure game. It's one of the best ""pure"" adventures games that I've played since TellTale's The Walking Dead: Season 1. quite frankly. Cognition's first season is excellent, with more twist + turns in the story; really logical puzzles (for the most part); really good character development. Without spoiling too much here - Erica Reed is a cop, her brother Scott gets taken, and she begins chasing after this serial killer. You play mostly as Erica, embarking on this journey of finding out more about this killer, the past of the killer, and who the killer plans to attack next. This is just the tip of the iceberg here, as there's a lot more than that that is going on in this game, story-wise, play-wise, and character-wise. A few of the puzzles are tough, but the Hint System can give you just enough to point you in the right direction to help you figure it out. At some point - Erica begins having visions, learning she has powers that can help her solve puzzles. Not only that, but there are puzzles based around her visions are extremely well integrated into the game. I don't want to spoil too much, but each episode seems to integrate a new type of puzzle that has to deal with her abilities. Even the final episode (Episode 4) introduces a new mechanic, which I'm sure is going to have some replaying the last episode, since it can even change some of the actual journey of the final chapter & the actual final outcome of the game. There's very few flaws + problems w/ this season. The voice-acting quality is the biggest problem, as it's all over the place. Erica, Cordelia, and John are the best voice-acted characters; and then the quality for the rest of the characters are all over the place. The graphics do have the very interesting, stylish and comic-book type of look - ranging more on the artistic side, instead of having any sort of real technical quality. None of those above-said flaws should stop you from playing this game, as those are very minor problems with this game. After 26 hours or so with this game, there was hardly any moments where I was not wanting to find out what's going to develop and happen next in the story + to these characters. The game kept things fresh with new puzzle types + new game mechanics, with each episode. With never a dull moment, even for its length - the game kept me constantly engaged. Fans of murder-mysteries; cop + FBI stories; old-school style adventure games w/ logical puzzles (and a Hint system to help those who get stuck, which will point you a bit in the right direction); great character development; and great dialogue - look no further than the excellent Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller. Final Grade = B+			"

												The best way I can describe this is if the Blackwell games got high on PCP - similar sort of mystery/detective game, except you have mystical powers. However...it is significantly more serious (blackwell had some great character interaction, whereas this has a better overall story).First off, it's incredibly gritty. There is no holding back in the subject matter (to the extent that if you're squeamish or don't like torture, probably stay away). The atmosphere, story, and writing is top-notch. I was consistently on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen.Puzzles are on the harder end, but not frustrating. Soundtrack is great.Gameplay is a little clunky (moving around and lots of clicking), but not to detract it.Definitely recommended.			"

												Slight spoiler alert that might actually improve your enjoyment of this game: episodes 1 and 2 are not a good indication of how the rest plays out. If you like episodes 1 and 2, like I did, there is a chance that 3 and 4 will fail to engage you due to your expectations. I might finish this game later after thinking about it for a while, but as it stands I gave up partway through 4 because I didn't like how the story was unfolding and no longer cared enough about the characters to finish it. I'm recommending the game because it starts out very strong, but keep this in mind and maybe take a few days off between episodes so you aren't too invested.			"

												If you are as much of a fan of point and click games as I am, or simply love a satisfying interactive story then I reccomend this one. The game is not a linear on rails puzzle game it offers many solutions to a problem but rewards the most ingenius, it is the kind of game that forces you to pay attention to the dialogue and encourages you use all resourse available to you to make any progress. You play Erica Reed, an FBI agent who carries the talent of physic abilities and pre-cognition regarding items she touches and people she encounters. It all comes together to force you to deal with some fantastic puzzles and situations. If you liked games like the Walking dead or the notebook mechanics in Discworld Noir or Sherlock Holmes then there are worse things you could do with your free time. The game is split into 4 Episodes all now available on Steam and they offer a hell of a story. Its worth checking out, you won't be disappointed.			"

I didn't do my usual thing of getting distracted with other games - that's a very good sign. It's laid back & the achievements are fun to get if you are into that. The art style is lovely & it's got just that hint of a (softcore?) se7en feel to it, but mixed with... psychic powers (which aren't quite as lame as I first suspected). It still had a few visual bugs when I played it, but they may well have been fixed by now as the developers are active on Steam. The developers and the game are the type that deserves supporting - and I'm glad that I was able to.			"

												For context, I am long time adventure gamer.In brief, loved this game. It had a great story and mixture of puzzles. Loved the subject matter although may be gory for some (i.e. serial killers and graphically violent scences). Several parts of the story were a bit confusing and I felt had to jump to some of our own conclusions (or interpretations); but overall was compelling and had nice twists. Puzzles were of appropriate difficulty. I got stuck on a couple, but that was my fault for not paying attention to some detail. All the necessary info was provided at some point prior to a puzzle. A couple of times was not clear what needed to be done from a game function point of view (as opposed to a puzzle), but persistence in trying out of the box thinking will help. The psion game mechanics are compelling. I strongly recommend this game if you like detective adventure stories.			"

												So, somehow the whole setting reminded me of the movie ""Seven"" and Jane Jensen was sort of involved in the story, so, as an old Gabriel Knight fan I bought it and thought what could go wrong?Now I know... A lot. You are Erica Reed, a mental wreck who breaks down every 5 minutes, suffers from regular visions and has her office in the hallway of an FBI building right next to the vending machine. Of course you also have the casual office flirt going on and a partner who seems to be incapable of doing anything by himself. Amazing... From the get go it feels like you are stuck in a soap opera, with cheesy dialogues, irritating behaviour and a lackluster main storyline.The dialogues are so off, it hurts. The forensics guy is telling you stuff the coroner should tell you, the coroner tells you stuff the forensics guy should, in between your boss ♥♥♥♥♥es around and a whole bunch of FBI agents (2 of which look exactly the same) trample around the scenes of a murder, yet they wait for you to do some minor investigations. That just doesn't make sense either.Apart from that, the graphics constantly glitch, which I wouldn't mind so much if the story was at least okay. Well, I guess if you liked Gray Matter, then you might like this. If you want to have a story that is consistent and combines some paranormal abilities with somewhat realistic police work, then stay away.I'm just in for a bit more than an hour and I think I will try to get the game refunded. It's a shame, from the store page I thought I'd really like this game.I would definitely suggest that, unlike me, you get the demo first and see for yourself if you think that this is worth buying.

												Cognition weaves together an intense, very well-crafted narrative where you solve not one but four serial-killer cases, following throughlines that veer closer and closer to FBI Agent Erica Reed's personal history with violence and loss.  The game builds Reed's psychic powers into a really interesting set of mechanics -- you begin with the ability to see the past through objects in a room, and gain abilities to get more insight by using multiple objects, including ones in your inventory, and being able to go into other characters' minds to help them recover memories they don't realize they have.  It's not just decoration on top of a crime story, as in a lot of supernatural + crime games (and movies), but adds real depth and chances to figure things out in cool ways.  Plus, for me, there were none of those moments point-and-clicks are so prone to where I check a walkthrough and say, that's totally bizarre, I would never have thought of that.  It's probably the most natural-feeling story I've had the pleasure to play through, with excellent, excellent music supporting the scenes from beginning to end.It also does some just awesome things with the psychic powers, story ideas I've never seen done before, and there's no way I can describe them without spoiling, so I'll just say that chapter 3 is where this game absolutely shines.  So much wow.  If I'd paid full price and the whole game had been just that chapter, I would have felt like I got my money's worth.  Instead, I got it on a sale and was blown away by how much there is to it -- total steal.Cognition doesn't pull any punches, either with plot events or with serial killers doing freaky things to their victims.  I eat up cop shows & true crime stuff like pudding, and there were points in Cognition that wowed me/freaked me out.  As a crime-media aficionado, this was great and my hat is off to Phoenix for really going for the things they went for -- if you're less bloody-minded, just, be warned.  Still get the game, because it is so good, but if you feel like you need to step away after half a chapter, I think that's ok.I have some quibbles with later story choices just because I think they'll make a sequel awkward, and I want to play more of these people's stories, using Erica's powers.  But, eh, Phoenix can put out other games with great stories and cool narrative mechanics, and I'll play those, too, whether or not they pick up from this one.  My only genuine complaints are about the graphics.  The graphics and animation were so screwy that I initially thought this was a much older game than it is, in fact.  Comic-inspired panels, which the most powerful cutscenes use to great effect, are gorgeous, but the scenes you walk around in -- I'm sure they were going for gritty, but it comes off as dull.  This is especially a problem in the first chapter, which could stand to have its entire palette redone.  Characters' animation is almost always glitchy and just off -- people's shoulders in really strange places; surfaces that don't match up, leaving black crevices in people's faces; position problems where someone's neck, for example, will be stretched way back so their chin ends up above their clavicle.  In a few cases, someone's head and/or torso would start spinning around wildly after they finished speaking, and keep doing it until I clicked the mouse to do something.  Oy.Still recommend this very, very highly to point/click players.  I'm genuinely excited about doing a second playthrough to get the rest of the achievements.  It is just *so* good.			"

												One of the best adventure games I've played in a long time. Unfortunately there were a lot of glitches, requiring restarting the game to continue (luckily the autosave is never too far). Each episode introduces new mechanics that keep puzzles intresting, and the story has cool twists.			"

												A fairly engaging murder mystery; the strong point of the game really is the characters and the interactions between them. They more than make up for the somewhat over-tuned puzzles (instead of digging into ground that had been recently disturbed with your hands very early on in episode one you have to use a hammer to break a shovel that's been glued to a statue's hand) and the fairly predictable outcome of the murder mystery itself. I did, however, enjoy the way the psychic mechanics worked in the game for puzzle solving. The use of past/future to provide information and clues was neat and occasionally made the puzzles themselves more interesting (despite the sometimes ridiculous Rube Goldberg-ness of some of them). Even with the weak points of a fairly linear storyline and occasionally illogical/frustration puzzles, the deep story telling and characterization more than made the game worth it. I was especially pleased to see the care taken with the two protagonists, Erica and Cordelia, and how their stories mirrored and intertwined. The dichotomy created between the two characters really worked well and made for a satisfying resolution.			"

												Pretty good game overall I'd say. The strongest point is definitely the story - it's interesting from beginning to end and certainly exciting and thrilling as well. I'd say the second episode is the standout and the third is the weakest but they're all pretty good. The second episode though might be one of the most engaging plots in a game that I've played... the last scenes especially are insanely tense. Gave me chills... really good stuff though, seriously.In terms of gameplay. The puzzles never get too hard or moon-logic-y at all. Each chapter ends up having a new mechanic that the previous ones didn't and each mechanic gets used in future episodes as well so it's much less about pixel hunting and more about figuring out which cognition power is the best for the job. There's an in-game hint system as well if you ever get stuck, which I did on a few occasions but not excessively often, which is good.The weak point has to be the animations. Because dear god are they terrible. It's... really clunky on this one element and basically nothing else, which iss a tad baffling to me really. The art style is generally good, the music is good, the voice acting is mostly good, but the animations are just not. Not nearly bad enough to ruin what is otherwise a great game though, perhaps a bit overpriced but certainly worth a look.			"

												I don't usually write reviews.  Some games are good, some are so so and some are bad but I tend to roll with it. In this case I have to start by issuing an apology to the developers. I deeply and sincerely apologize for waiting for this game to go on sale. You deserve to make every penny possible on this game and I hope that you are planning to invest in more Erica Reed or similar games based on the Cognition elements. When you do I will be there for first day sales and willingly pay the prices.This game snared my attention from the first few moments of the introductory comic book and DID NOT disappoint right through to the conclusion. The story line is engaging and intense. The voice acting is AMAZING. The game play is engaging with puzzles that are not simple but don't drive to distraction trying to figure out things that just don't make sense. I can see where there will be players who will critique the graphics but for me they were fine. Not flashy but they supported the story - and in this case the story is the main draw.I heartily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys an well written thriller.			"

												Man, when I started this game I was like, a point&click game.. it's full of glitches, the cell shading characters are not what I like the most but I played this game for almost 15 hours !The story tells about an FBI Agent Erica Reed investigating in the Cain Killer case. She has the power to see in the past and find out the memories that people forget.It is a 4 Episodes story, each one follows the story amazingly and I got into it. Some parts of the story are really morbid and disturbing (cutting body parts, killing her own brother, hangmens.) and to enjoy the game at max it requires a full walkthrough.So if you like thriller stories with some horrible things, this game is for you.

												I tried to enjoy this game, I really did.But when Rose started explaining some expositional crap about how certain cognition powers worked in episode one (it just dragged on and I simply didn't care), it was unskippable, and I just brought up Facebook in the Steam overlay and missed nothing at all when it finished.It's just not immersive, and the puzzles were more annoying than interesting. I did like the art style, and the demo I thought was quite good which was why I ended up buying it, but the full version just felt like it dragged on so much. I used the message Dad thing a lot more toward the end because I just wanted the episode to end and couldn't be bothered looking for the solutions myself. Also, how many times do you have to show the same vision of her dying? Like, we get it, you saw yourself die. Stop seeing it repeatedly and acting surprised each time it happens. Should clarify I gave up partway through episode 2.			"

												Cognition is a decent effort, but it has definite problems.On the positive side, it has a fairly interesting story and a strong atmosphere.  Like many point-and-click adventure games, the graphics might be considered ""primitive"" by some, but they are well done and have a definite artistic style that is attractive.  Erica Reed's ""cognition powers"" are fairly fun and the puzzles generally strike a nice balance in difficulty.On the negative side, the game is buggy.  I didn't come across any game-crashing bugs, but several things give this game a ""less than polished"" feel.  Animations, interactions with characters or objects, even trying to walk can be problematic and sloppy.  The inventory system is poor. The writing and dialogue have a flowery ""fan fiction"" style, which combined with the bugginess gives the game an amateur feel.As a whole, I give a cautious recommendation to those who like adventure games, mysteries, or who dig the music or graphical style.  Those who are used to more polished games from established studios should look elsewhere.			"

												TL;DR: - Great Soundtrack and sound effects. - Amazing art style. - Great story - True suspenseAll the above = A fine piece of workmanship.I was sceptical about this game before I even start playing it. Mostly because I was not a fan of the genre ( point & click ) . The only reason I decided to play  was to see how s****y the game was. But how wrong was I.And  funny how after I finished the first episode, I found myself desperately searching around forums and sites for the rest of the series.Such a well written and story rich game, with amazing characters, graphics, soundtrack and sound effects - Cognition is one of those gems that leaves a mark after itself, that hunger when you finish the game and you don't know what to do, as you can hardly find another similar to itEverything in this game is so well made, that even if you dare to look for some shortcomings you will decide to overpass them.The suspensfull music and sound effects gives you the feeling of a great psychological-thriller-detective-mystery, that will keep you on edge till you finish the game.The visuals are amazing - I liked the art style of everything from buildings to the gory crime scenes - which are perfectly created, adding up for a great detective mystery. The supernatural element comes up right on time to make it even more intriguing.It  gives you those same chills and thrills, as when you watch a great detective-murder-mystery with a supernatural element. And still Cognition is not only that - the story that is bind to the main character expands and reveals more about herself, the mystery and the people around her. Now that I finished Cognition I must say that you can never evaluate a game or a genre before spending enough time of playing it.This is the game that made me a fan of Point & Click Adventure Games and  one of the few  that I'll always look up to, when it comes to a game with rich and compelling story.- For the fans of the genre - You should definitely play it !- The rest of You that are not sure what to do - give it a try !

												The story is okay, but the voice acting is really bad. Weird graphical glitches around the character's mouths and shoulders/arms make the whole atmosphere pretty hilarious, not good in a Detective game where atmosphere should be important. The way the main character walks is just bizarre, she looks like a sumo wrestler that had an accident in his loincloth.  I think they should have delayed releasing this game until they sorted out the bugs.Glad I didn't pay full price for it. Severely lacking in both atmosphere and polish.			"

												This game has a plot that grabs you from the beginning and will not let go. Erica's powers are an interesting method for pacing the game, as they can keep things hidden from you. Most of the puzzles are very intuitive to figure out, and it is rare that you get completely stuck. I think my favorite puzzles are when you help people remember the past.There are some glitches in this game. I had a menu glitch that made it very difficult to keep the menu open or select what I wanted to use. The in-game help system is not very good at detecting what problems I am stuck on. Overall, this is a compelling game, and I can't wait to finish the last two episodes.			"

												Let me get the bad things out of the way first:Subpar 3D models and really, really bad animations. Clipping teleporting and stuttering character complement it.Well, I don't care.The rest of the game is just plainly awsome.The art style is the typical american comic style topped with more details and love.The soundtrack is through the roof. It fits the atmosphere perfectly and is actually one of the best soundtracks I ever listened to.There were moments in Cognition, where I got goose bumps all over because of this perfect art ensemble.The story is huge, has twists and a rich variety.Most of it was unforseeable and surprising for me, since the game successfully lead me on a wrong trailand turned out differently most times.The puzzles fitted the story very well and were fair throughout the, except one time.This doesn't mean that it was too easy.I had to think about everything carefully, which ended in about 21 hours of playtime for one playthrough.I'll give 8 out of 10 points for this beautiful masterpiece.

The art style is kind of weird, particularly where there is 2d character art it looks kind of low budget for some reason, but if you can get past that there is a solid game waiting for you.

												Seems to me a great potential has been wasted with the game engine used. I mean, if there is an emergency, it shouldn't take 2 seconds for a character to simply turn back and align with the object that has been chosen for interaction. It's so ""10 years ago"". I like the way how the story is told, then again, the game engine tells that story so slow that your excitement is questionable.Still, yes, I recommend the game as it is hard to find a solid adventure game.

After three years the case gets closed by the director of the FBI since there has been no progress in the investigation since that fatefull night. Then one night you get called to a crime scene to determine if it was a murder or suicide and from there on on you get spiraled into an investigation in which you not only have to find the murderer but also find a way to prevent your own death.THE GOOD Excellent story Beautifull music Logical puzzles Great to above average voice acting Hint system availble for those who want to use it Strong female lead characterTHE BAD Mediocre animations at some spots in the game Had two spots in my gameplay where a grapical glitch happened on my character A few puzzles, while logical once you figure them out, are really hardTHE UGLY Nothing really in my humble opinionFinal Verdict: 9 out of 10 "

The characters and story are all very interesting and interwoven very well, the character Erica is very interesting with attempting to learn and control her powers of precognition, which you have to use later down the line to solve crimes, stop murders and continue this dance of death for this serial killer before someone else is killed.I'd highly recommend this for any fan of adventure games!Edit: Forgot to add, There is a problem when playing this game on 64bit systems so I suggest doing the same work around as mentioned on their forums here: http://www.postudios.com/blog/forum/index.php?topic=15161.0It's due to hyperthreading issue with the engine and the solution makes the game focus on just one core instead of getting confused with multiples.

												I love to play some adventures between competitive games, so I tried Cognition because the good reviews. And WOW! It was great. One of the best...nah I would say THE best adventure I have ever played. I have never played a serious adventure which was that good. The Story is the strongest part. The Killers are really creative and the atmosphere is perfect. One of the best tellings I have ever seen with perfect logic. Also the puzzles. Great and not to far away from the game. I hate puzzles which are there only for beeing puzzles without a real meaning for the game. I always remember Silent Hill with useless puzzles like the piano one which have nothing to do with the Story or the actuall game.The artdesign of a comic is fantastic and fits perfectly. How do we say in germany? Where you find light you also find shadows. The gameplay is far too slow, Erica moves  slow like granny and you have some issues where she don't react after clicks. I also did not like that she commented every small thing. Problem is that you can't skip her talk and always need to wait even if she already commented the situation. I'm far to impatient for this. Still there are some techincal issues. I had some crashes and in the Cordellia Sequenzes she just don't react after a command, standing still and I needed to restart the game.But these are just minor issues for a great game, even though not every episode is as great as another. Maybe there shouldn't be a second season. We know, nothing beats the first season in a show.			"

A rough and tumble game with glitches and bugsThe game is quite good. Actually I like this kind of point and click adventure games. Sadly to say, but this game is a little ""bug""-ridden. It crashes quite regulary, safe-games can't be loaded too (at least not at episode 1) and sometimes the graphics become glitchy when Terence is talking for example.I will recomend this game nonetheless, since they still seem to work on the game. It is a game full of riddles and clues to find. Erica Reeds talents evolve during the game - the characters are quite good developed.  It offers hours and hours of suspense, thrill and sometimes frustration if you had the wrong ideas about the true importance of some objects. The game is a great addition to any collection and a greater gift to people who like point and click adventures, the price is four all four episodes of season one and thus it is a great value, since you won't run through the adventures but stand, look and ponder about some of the darkest, yet very detailed sceneries - you might even wish to return once in a while to relive some of the more beautiful and surprisingly satisfying moments of the game.Oh, and don't mind the sometime rough and tumble language, I have read and heard worse in some so called ""Bestseller"" books, especially in northern german crime and suspense stories it seems to be a thing of vogue to have the inspector talk like some brainless, drunk and lewd sailor... *sigh* Addendum 20.06.2015Sadly after playing the first episode through and just starting the second one I also have to say that the game stays a bit behind in expectations. Sure it still is a good game, as an adventure it offers a lot - but some lapses in the game regarding save game issues and some very illogical puzzles (you'll have to see for yourself, becaus an explanation can't give you a hint)Conditional Recomendation: For fans of the Point and Click Adventure Genre, the game still needs some finetuning.

												In this classic point and click thriller with touches of horror, you play Erica Reed - FBI agent - hot on the trail of a serial killer.  As the story unfolds Erica develops several paranormal abilities that allow her to gain additional information on events and at scenes.The interface with objects and people becomes more complicated as the game progresses and in one chapter you need to keep your faculties about you as you switch between watching future events to get tips on the past that you need to interact with in the present.  Sound complicated?  Not really, there is plenty of onscreen help, a killer soundtrack and great dialogue throughout.The trademark of Jane Jensen is clear in this edge-of-your-seat, mind-bending puzzler.  Highly recommended.			"

												You are Erica Reed a detective dealing with loss, a serial killer and who has 'powers' to see pieces of the past. The way this is added to tradtional point & click adventure format gives a clever little innovation in both it's puzzles and story telling. Up until Episode 4 I thought this was the best narative to an adventure story I've ever come across. The first episode is introducing you to the characters and several mystery plots that you will investigate to find the truth. Persist with the game after a good but not great first episode because it gets better. The second and third episodes really fleshes out the story with a plot full of twists and turns. The peak being episode 3.The final episode is a let down partly down to '2 boss puzzles' that are overly tough for my liking but also because the story goes all over the place. Honestly I can't play a game like this without a gameboomers walkthrough running in the background and I suggest for all but the most hardcore puzzlers to do the same if you actually want to enjoy it.It isn't for the squimish, some of the gore is maybe a tad unnecessary and unrealistic even for a serial killer. Another downside is excessive running/walking between scenes when you're solving a puzzle, ie there's no fast travel in some places. But these are small complaints.Still the depth of the characters, the story arch and the twists and turns are up there with the best I've come across in an adventure game and it's worth theseI had this game on idle so I didn't play 100+ hours but I probably have spent about 40 hours on it. It's a pretty big, long adventure. Overall 9/10			"

												So, I picked up chapters 3 and 4 as part of a bundle. This meant that I jumped into the story mid way and to be honest the ""what happened so far"" catch up thing did nothing but utterly confuse me. Nevertheless the story came together quite well once I started playing. The voice acting is reasonable, the protagonist is decently compelling and storyline is quite fun if you like serial killers. I wasn't a fan of some of the mechanics in chapter 4 that would happily lead you to an untimely death (although it didn't make you back up far if you did) - it's worth saving after each very linear chunk of that chapter if you want to get the achievements. Chapter 3 was much more fun but I get the impression that it probably would have been more so had I already been attached to the characters and had a better understanding of what was going on.Inexplicably for a chapter based game like this... I can't buy the missing chapters to find out what happened at the beginning as my only option on steam is to purchase all four in one go. For a game that is often partially featured in bundles this seems silly at best.Anyway, if you like point and click adventures and want to stray away from using the rubber chicken with the pulley to dismembered corpses and strong language then this may be the game for you.

Each chapter do its own but they are very systematic in overall view.++ Puzzles in the game are not so easy but do not require checking every options to pass through. It is just fit so that I can enjoy them like swiftly flowing stream :D+ Comic-like graphics create the game much more absorbing.+ Each chapter adds new ways to handle puzzle. It prevents me become boring about solving puzzle.- Still Buggy especially about the visualization. You can see bodies go through backgrounds like walls, tables, ...- Chapter 4 makes quite crashes during play. "

												This game was a very intense emotional ride. In four episodes, we find an FBI agent with psychic abilities follow a serial killer. The story was really nice, and the comicbook-motivated artstyle and creepy soundtrack fitted the narrative.However, I had some problems with the game: the user interface seems like designed with touch devices in mind, which means, meaning simple actions require multiple clicks, only a single mouse button is used, etc. Additionally, some puzzles were exceptionally hard for me, sometimes simply figuring out the solution, other times remembering the details that were presented in a case file previously.Alltogether, although clearly not the best point-and-click game of the 21st century, it provides a very compelling story, so I recommend it (at least to those who are not afraid of a very dark-mooded game).

												One of the better point-and-click adventure games of recent years. I've thorroughly enjoyed this. You play as Erica Reed, a redhead-with-a-temper FBI agent, solving a series of rather gruesome crimes. Playthrough time is roughly 20 hours for the average player, and the game is divided into four episodes (each episode presents one crime case). The game has a great, comicbook-style art style, although the 3D models and animations are somewhat basic and glitchy. It has a moody atmosphere, supported by a good soundtrack. Interesting feature is Erica's 'cognition' power, which allows her to e.g. see things from the past. Rather than this being just a neat trick (which happens all too often when games introduce a new mechanic that is clearly intended to be new), this mechanic helps turn the game into an actual investigative game. My score: 10/10.			"

												This is a hidden gem that beats any AAA adventure games for me. Every single episode introduces a new gamplay and scene, that makes it even more interesting, not speaking of the story, one of the best of the genre, a multiple twisted one.Enjoyable conversations, full of emotions, incredible voice acting and remarkable music bring the main characters and events closer to you.And the downside?Some bugs and glitches (In Melissa's room you can prove you are not only a psion,but a ghost as you walk thru tables, walls etc.). The worst ones are those when a certain event is not triggering because of a bug, so make sure you save the game often.What else can I say?It is a must buy for those who like story-based, emotional, SAW-like, dark, detective games.10/10			"

												Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller has many things I could say about it, but because the plot is a thriller/mystery I’m going to try and keep away from spoiling any surprises the game might have in store for anyone daring enough to give it a try.Ultimately I gave the game thumbs up. Cognition was by no means a flawless creation, but it impressed me with how different it was from other point and click adventure games I have played. It was basically a horror game that made you think.  Not to many of those lying around.Now I know it hints at what to expect in the title. The game is technically a thriller, yes, but it is so full of gore, twisted psychology, mind games, deathtraps and people dying in horrible ways that the only thing that seems to  keep the game from plunging into the full fledged horror-only end of the spectrum is the fact that the main character, Erica Reed, is an FBI agent with some psychic abilities.Still, the writing is so dark an twisted that even being a psychic investigator in the FBI doesn’t really help Erica Reed much and she often comes out as more of a victim trying to survive than anybody who is successfully solving anything. It’s not even to hard to guess who the evil sick killers are as soon as they are introduced, but the puzzles, sick mind games, and music are so disturbing that most players will find it hard to stop playing.Despite it's ability to grip an audience, the over all presentation of the game still does flip flop a bit in quality. Sure there is the great draw of that dark atmosphere and the developers do a ton of things right as far as creepy tension goes, but there are a couple of moments where the presentation trips over itself.  Voice acting was hit or miss. The 3D animations would occasionally go from wildly over the top movement to actually breaking the character model, causing the character to glitch out and crash. It can be a bit distracting, listening to what sounds like a bipolar Erica Reed doing an anime style fist pump and then spontaneously having her head spin 360 degrees kind of takes a person out of the seriously tense moments. Luckily these bizarre issues were few enough to not really bother players with a forgiving sense of humor. The over arching storyline is divided into five parts. Each of the five episodes seemed to have their own strong moments, paired together with little flaws in detail. There were plenty of moments when, if anyone stopped to really think about it, it would seem that the characters did things that would make no sense just to further the plot. In fact, there were many ways for the killers to have been caught in each episode, but FBI protocol and any logic associated with that setting is conveniently thrown aside in favor of a over dramatic scene or additional puzzle. For instance, there is one laughable moment were Erica Reed thinks she has to figure out how to steal an old tape recorder and tape from a grumpy colleague then goes about breaking a couple of laws in the process, but the whole time I can’t help but wonder why she can’t just go to her boss, use her smart phone to record things or, heck, hop in her car and go to a local electronics store to buy her own hand held cassette recorder for around $20 or so. Does Erica Reed's actions make any sense in the above situation? No, but it's not distracting enough to ruin the game for anyone who has tried other games in the point&click genre. Sure the dips in logic are noticable but not crippling to the bigger scheme of things and most casual players will probably shrug them off.In the end, what really won me over was how the game made you thinks when it came to puzzles. If it’s a very mature game with mature content, you expect some very difficult and mature logic solving puzzles right? Well the player actually can get that here! It actually makes the player think and a player can solve most of them without using the hint system if one puts one’s mind to it.  I really enjoyed the complexity of the puzzles and I ended up using the hint system more to navigate through nonsensical parts of the story to find them than to do any actual puzzle or logic solving because of the long awaited challenge they represented. In conclusion, I give Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller a thumbs up, although it's a twitchy thumb with warts just around the thumbnail. Honestly, I’m not sure if this game is for most audiences, since the game seems to have been made for people so desensitized that they no longer have a gag reflex combined with the tendency to have the patience level of a saint. I'm not even sure making any more ""Erica Reed"" thrillers (if that's the intent behind the needlessly lengthy title) would be a good idea considering how random the plot was, but was this game was different enough to stand out in a crowd and entertaining in it’s own right. I say give it a shot, just be aware that you might have to talk to a therapist when you are done playing.			"

And after you select an action, get ready for her to think about it, shuffle to the left two steps, then slowly walk towards the target, all while stressing ""we have to go fast to save my brother.""Skip this ludonarratively dissonant trash fire and play a good adventure game.

												If you are interested in a point-and-click mystery/adventure game with hours and hours of play, I think this is something you should try out. Even though I have not gotten half way through the content, Cognition:  An Erica Reed Thriller is definitely a game that I would recommend to someone. Pros: Cognition has an exciting storyline that is brimming with drama and touches of gore. This is all brought out vividly through comic-strip-like cut-scenes that are very well drawn and fun to watch. In addition to the cut-scenes, the makers really make an effort to provide voice acting (which is helpful for suckers like me who don’t want to read). In addition to the great storyline, you’re invited to activate your thinking process throughout the game. Not only do you collect and search for clues, but you also solve a variety of puzzles which are linked to the cases. The amount of cerebration involved not only makes it great solo-play, but also team-play if you like working with others. Cons:When playing this game, you’ll find out that there is a steep learning curve in the beginning. Finding out what the functions are on keys was what made it hard for me to play. If you keep an open mind and continue trying out buttons, you’ll soon get how to play the game and mangle your way through cases. :POverall, this game has been very enjoyable for me and I’m going to play it until the end!

												The number of times that I almost felt asleep while playing is not normal.. First, you absolutely have no control over the plot or outcome or decisions ... Everything will happen in a very very narrow and specific way, and your role as a player is to keep clicking until you find out what the developper wanted you to do next, which bring me to my second point: This might be hell for anyone who is picky about to user friendly platform and commands ! It will literally take you countless amounts of clicks to achieve a very simple command/task that could have been set up with a click or scroll menu or or or.... The game is not intuitive,  the platform is not adequate, no excitment, and you litereally are sleeping bored in what it supposed to be a thriller/crime based game....			"

												The spiritual successor to Gabriel Knight 1. The story was well-paced and definitely had mature themes (much like the GK series). Puzzles were generally well thought out, and I thought it was nice the way they introduced new game mechanics each chapter to keep the game from getting stale. This would be pretty high on my list of adventure games~+ Great story+ Interesting game mechanics+ Good production - graphics, music, everything is quality9/10			"

												If you are looking for a serious mystery & clue searching game (none of those random object-puzzle bullcraps), this is perfect for you. I've been playing this game here and there for a long while now. It's broke down into Episodes, where each episode is worth about 3-5 hours of game play (if you don't use a walkthrough). I'm currently stuck on Episode 4, and have been for awhile. I try hard not to use walkthroughs, so it's my own fault--honestly. Thank god I'm not a real detective, or I would have failed at life. If you like the Sherlock Holmes games, then this is a game for you. Lots of death, mystery, and even some supernatural aspects to keep you going.			"

2/4 episodes finished so far.Edit: I finished whole game. But not much to add. Last part is a bit disappointing. Seems to be shortest, but it also branches to different parts based on choices.Strong points of this game: Story, music.Weak points: Badly mixed 2D & 3D graphics (comparing to some games, I've already played) & animations are glitched in many places, many bugs (as for PnC game), splitting into episodes [I dislike it] and RADIAL menu. And last, f[!]king tedious Cognition system (blue sphere option).It would be way faster to have only LMB and RMB as controls... because of that and some non-senses game takes slow pace so repeating episodes to get another achievements is simply tedious and not really rewarding - the alternatives are not really exciting, like refusing or accepting coffee.Edit: Oh yeah, commentary inside of game... to get it, it's very tedious, too. You need to replay whole episode to get bits. And I didn't really liked the ones I hear on beginning of Episode 2. Maybe I'm not that much into this game.I really wished my review to be neutral, cause this game could be much more better "

												To be perfectly clear, I'm bad review purely because of technical problems. By the end it was like trying desperately to watch a DVD with a scratch, or watch a streaming video when your internet keeps dropping out. The game would freeze up on me so I'd have to kill it in task manager. It never happened in the 1st episode, happened twice in the 2nd, happened regularly in the 3rd, and the 4th was nearly unplayable. There's a scene in the 4th where two characters talk in the car, with no opportunity to save partway through in case of a crash. It took me more than a dozen tries to get through that scene, because it kept freezing up in the middle. Honestly, if I wasn't so into the story, I would have given up on it, so take that as you will.I've glanced at the discussion boards, and it looks like the developers were fighting alot of these issues. It looks like they were very responsive too. But the game is 2.5 years after release, and it still feels like early beta. Ok, technical issues aside, I loved the game. If you play the demo, I just need to say: the game is better. Each episode was better than the previous. Now the 4th episode was an exception... I thought the ending was pretty weak, but I may have just been distracted by the crashes. There were a few little things... Erica's voice actor was obviously working on her accent as the games progressed, so her dialect drifted from midwestern to boston as the games progressed. Still though, the game really was one of the most intense point n clicks I've ever played. So I loved the game, except that the freezes ruin it. If there's a 2nd season, I would definately be interested, although I might watch the forums to see if they got their tech stuff in order before buying it.			"

												I first came across this game whilst looking for info about “Moebius: Empire Rising” by Jane Jensen (big fan of her work), so it was a while ago. Played the demo but wasn't too impressed with the voice acting (especially) and the dialogues... the story (from the little that is shown in the demo, which is the first part of the first chapter of the game) seemed predictable and not very well written. I guess this was because we're pretty much thrown into something that would have a bigger impact if we'd previously had some time to care about the characters involved - too much too soon. So I wasn't exactly motivated to buy the game after playing the demo. Months later I managed to buy the game along with a some others for a very low price (including Steam codes, thankfully), and decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did because the story is actually very good, the demo does it no justice and the voice acting gets a bit better as the game progresses (or maybe I just ended up getting used to it, I guess). The dialogues can be cringe inducing at times (especially in the first two chapters) but because the storyline is so engrossing I managed to ignore that as well as the mediocre animation and models (Moebius suffers from that as well, which is a shame). But I am a lover of good stories and good mysteries and this game caters to both notions, I just wish that more attention was put into the quality of animation, models and voice acting. But overall, it’s a good game with a good story and interesting characters. The cognitive “powers” are well developed and are part of what makes this game so addictive - they were well thought out and make sense in terms of game mechanics.I would highly recommend this game for the storytelling experience alone, but I also liked it for its uniqueness and interesting themes. i hope the developer invests in better 3D modeling and animation as in the future I'll keep my eyes open for more games coming from them.

												Game is about an FBI agent trying to figure out the killer to a homicide case but it unfolds in a way that brings up old murder cases that were passed as suicide.  This game style reminded me heavily on Phoenix Wright series from many years ago.There are a lot of running back and forth looking at places and talking to people for information/evidence. The story plot is a lot darker but keeps you curious. Pros: interesting plot- interesting mechanics such as reading people's minds, going back in time and creating ghosts to look at the past- graphics is decent like telltale gamesCons:- the main character is ugly and there is nothing attractive about her- the main problem I have is the hint system doesn't prompt you sometimes until everything is done, so if you miss one or two things the hint system doesn't progress and if you're stuck you need to rely on a walkthrough- there are some little things that really need polishing - having to go through dialogues that you have heard already instead of being able to skip/fast forward, having to walk into the interrogation room and sit down to be able to talk to the person instead of choosing to talk to the person and your character will sit down on her own- soundtrack wasn't that good- way too many mechanics than needed - regression/projection, it really isn't necessary to make a game that complex, can easily do with just 1 skill for the whole gamegame overall for me is a 7.5, it is a good start for the developers to look forward to more of their work but the key for this game is less is more. Game is worth buying on discount.			"

In every Chapter the Powers are increasing and you have new possibilities.The riddles of the game are of medium difficulty. In most of the situations the are logical and can be solved with a little bit of guessing.			"

												This isn't the BEST point and click adventure, nor is it the best episodic point and click adventure....Heck, it's not even the best Point and Click adventure from Jane Jensen, but it's still a fun and enjoyable experience. In fact, I would suggest ALL point and Click fans pick this up.It has a similar dark Graphic Novel feel like Jensens spectacular Gabriel Knight game, except this features a strong female lead character...who..um...has to have a man use ashovel to dig a whole, because she's so frazzled that she can't focus on the incredibly difficult task of using a shovel on loose dirt to dig..what looks to be half a foot...in the rain.Erica Reed is an FBI agent that has the power to see into the past! Which admittedly sounds a lot less amazing than it is! She's chasing a serial killer and that's all I can say without tossing out spoilers.I didn't encounter any game breaking bugs...A few lip sync fails, some poor modeling(in fact early on in episode 1 where Erica looks less like a human, and more like a frog human hybrid)			"

												Wow, does this game suck you in!  I'm a big bookworm, and it was fun to play a game with such amazing story writing.  The best of gaming and reading combined :)  Got this game in a bundle and was surprised to find out how amazing it is.  I think it'd be worth paying full price for - I'd pay full price for a sequel right now.  Gameplay is fairly linear, until you get to the final episode, where your dialogue choices affect the story more.  Early in the game, the struggle is more with grasping the controls.  One of the last puzzles had me stumped, and I still don't know how I got past it.  If you're looking for a button-masher, this isn't for you.  But, it's not like the point and click adventures that are mindless, either.  It's an engaging story with four parts, and you can skip between them.  No need to complete the first part before the second, except for the storyline.  I'm rambling, but I just really enjoyed this game and have to dig into the other projects Jane Jensen (the writer) has done.  Buy it!			"

												Erika ReedA very enjoyable adventure game. It has good puzzles and a very engaging (creepy) story. As adventure games go, this one had a more serious tone. You are an FBI agent tracking a serial killer who killed your bother. And yes, that makes it personal. Which causes a certain amount of friction with your boss and (some) coworkers.  This one has fairly deep character design for computer games. I don't normally notice voice acting, but I did this time (in a good way). The puzzles made sense to me, but if not the game does have a hint system. I did experience one crashing bug, but the game autosaves when you switch locations so not too bad. There are occasional humourous graphical glitches where Erika's head starts spinning in random directions and decides to rotate through her stomach, but those were rare enough not to bother me. Oh, and if the developers are reading this (1) If I disable tutorial text in the main menu, this is because I do not want to see tutorial text. I don't like ""Oh, *this* tutorial should be shown even if it's disabled"". And, more importantly, if you have a dramatic fast-paced really tense scene, it makes sense there would be a lot of director's commentary with it. Do not ever again alternate a click in a fast-paced intense scene with 30-60 seconds of commentary with another intense click with another minute of commentary, .... "

												I'm almost done with the second chapter of Cognition and I wanted to write a quick positive review before I forget.  I don't know why it took me so long to ""get into"" this game after I bought it, but finally I forced myself to give it a whirl (after one abbreviated initial attempt).  It's been totally worth it.  One of the most engaging story-themed games I've played in a long time.Yes, there are some flaws.  Some dialogue is a bit silly.  And while some of the obstacles in Agent Reed's way are typical of an adventure game, those same obstacles seem convoluted for a story that's supposed to be more realistic.  (In just one example, Agent Reed has to pick the exact type of snacks an interviewee craves before he can be interrogated. This is a guy who is homeless, by the way, presumably hungry, and who supposedly wants to help avenge his dead wife by providing info.)But if you're willing to go with some of the silliness of the story, and buy into a lot of storytelling tropes (Agent Reed's superiors barely stop short of ordering her to turn in her badge at certain points, Reed never calls for backup, etc) then you'll get pulled in.  It definitely has that Jane Jensen feel--that lady who is most famous for creating Gabriel Knight, and who is here credited as a story consultant.Most of the voice acting is very good, including, thankfully, the lead actress playing Erica Reed.  Others have noted some sketchy graphics quality.  Well let me tell you, while the in-game animations are a little awkward/robotic (they're ""good enough""), the stylish, comic-book-panel like cut-scenes more than make up for them.  VERY polished and effective, the art style in those instances.I'm scratching my head a bit as to why Adventure Gamers' reviews of Cognition seemed so critical at times.  (Again, I'm only finishing the second chapter now, but I thought it was just as fun as the first.  AG gave it a pretty negative review, by contrast.)  I can only assume that their harshness was partially due to the fact that they were waiting around for the chapters to be individually released.  (I bought the ""game of the year"" edition, and can play it all at once).  They probably were more critical of any flaws as they saw each chapter as a singular experience instead of just part of the whole experience one gets when they buy all chapters together.Even though I'm only now getting around to playing Cognition, the game is already a couple years old.  If Phoenix Online Studios ever wants to make a sequel season (or even crowdfund one), I'm definitely on board.***Update:  I finished the second chapter, and frankly, it's stronger than the first one.  I'm not sure what Adventure Gamers was thinking with their rating for it.  I feel like they got hung up on some nitpicky things (like maybe how cartoony the new field director character was) so that they overlooked how much tighter this chapter was compared to the first one.  Also, the final puzzle in Chapter 2 (The Wise Monkey) was downright brilliant.  Hilariously over-the-top-twisted, yes, but brilliant.  If you enjoyed the involved nature of the Regression/Interrogation puzzle in the first chapter, then you'll really appreciate Chapter 2's final puzzle when Reed has to use her new ""Synergy"" power on, well, a bunch of body parts.  It's like a crazy twist on the old Adventure Game Inventory puzzle, with a dash of Jeffrey Dahmer.Update #2:  I'm well into Chapter three now, and I can honestly say, this is one of the most clever games I've ever played.  The best I can describe the game at this point is ""META.""The game is getting crazy with the way the plot is referencing itself like some kind of mobius strip.  Here in chapter three we have a case of TWO people with psionic powers--one who can see the future, the other the past.  And with them both being psions, they can mentally interact with each other across two different time periods, both viewing the same environment with different eyes, and both inadvertently planting ideas in the other's head with their observations.  If it sounds crazy and convoluted, it is.  It's starting to resemble a hall of carnival mirrors at this point, and I love it.Additionally, the game lets you reflect on the events of the first two chapters from a whole new angle.  In the first two chapters Erica Reed found scrapbook notes and dossiers (of potential victims) meticulously made by the serial killers she was after.  What's funny about Chapter three is, Erica discovers a dossier made by the mystery person hinted at in the first two chapters.  This mystery person is a sort of serial killer of other serial killers.  And here we get descriptions of THIS person's encounters and plans on how to target the original killers.  As I say, meta.***Update #3:  I'm writing this update for the second time, having just finished Chapter four, and thus the whole game.  I originally complained that Cognition's final chapter didn't quite ""stick the landing"" perfectly.  (There are definitely pacing issues; it feels like the story hits a wall immediately after the breathless cliffhanger of Chapter 3.)  Having considered things further, my thinking on it now is, ""But it was close enough.""Seriously.  This chapter turns the tawdriness and melodroma of the previous chapters up to 11.  And that's either a good or bad thing depending on your point of view.  Whatever it is, it's certainly ""Cognition.""  And as I said in my original conclusion:  ""At least I can appreciate that when a train does go off the tracks, it's only because the people running it aren't afraid to go full steam ahead.""Does the origin of the Cain killer (and his dynamic with Cordelia) feel 100% organic?  No.  But as I continued playing, I eventually accepted it--until finally after the story's balls-out conclusion, I was able to appreciate what they were going for.  (""You'll be an angel among those who are like us.""  Damn.)Heck, I even liked the final ""fight sequence"" between Erica and the bad guy.  ""Action"" sequences are usually something adventure gamers avoid like the plague, but I thought this was creative as hell, showing the fight through comic book panels.Concluding thoughts:  That's it.  It was a heck of a ride.  44 hours on record.  (Give me a break, I never used a hint guide.)  I give Cognition 4 out of 5 stars.  The Adventure Gamers reviewer must've been on crack.  And I'm ready to help back season two of Erica Reed, just say the word.			"

I'd love that, thank you :)WARNING:I experienced that my game froze quite a lot during the second and third episode and the only way to close it was with the task manager. Nothing gamebreaking, but slightly annoying and ruins immersion. Make sure to save often! Other than that I had a character bug that made the character's head spin while standing still. It disappears when you start moving again, but not great for immersion either. For me the problems were minor since I loved the rest of the game so much, but you might not feel the same way.

												I've just played through the first chapter and only the first chapter, so take this as more of a first impression than a complete review - though, spoilers, i intend very much to continue through the other chapters when I have the time.In short, because I get carried away easily;PRO:- beatiful hand-drawn artstyle- compelling and well-told story- some very good voice-acting- intuitive controls- creative puzzle-solving mechanics- satisfying level of interactionCON:- animation duration- glitches [mostly minor]- some forced choices and obscure solutionsRecommended for adventure-game fans and those in to interactive novels, since it fulfills most of those expectations either well or excellently. Most gripes arise from gameplay, which, if sufficiently engaged [and that's definitely possible], will be tolerable.One of the first things you need to be aware of is the length the game takes to play. Clocking in at 5.6 hours for one of four chapters seems to be on the fairly slow side when looking at the other reviews, and is in itself not a bad thing either. But it's not JUST the lenght of the story that caused this time. It is also the overall slowness of animations that are, as far as I could tell, unskippable [some dialogue is skippable and some isn't, and depending on your memory and/or trial and error you may find yourself listening to a minute+ long unskippable piece of dialogue in order to verify a single statement]. You can run with double-click, which is nice, and in some cases you can directly exit a location, but overall the movement of the protagonist is slow. As someone who generally likes slow pacing, I'm not as bothered by this as others may be, I do however have a problem with the animations when sitting in front of a computer [a nice animation, though] or when opening a door. For the amount of times you have to do these actions, the animations become too slow too quickly. Finally, I tend to visit every location whenever I get new information, so that I can see all dialogue options and find potential hidden stuff. If you are anything like me, you can spare yourself the trouble [though if your anything like me, I know you won't]. There are cases where you are clearly meant to backtrack, but it's always clear where to if you paid attention [""get food"" for example], and there are cases where you are convinced you don't have to backtrack, yet no option you have available works [when asked to ""get food"", you already have food in your inventory that isn't usable], in which case the duration it takes to go somewhere and back again will make you readily inclined to use the very direct but sufficiently helpful hint system. So overall, very sluggish gameplay-wise. Since it also lags occasionally, be prepared for slow progression and/or long playing sessions.The plus-side is that the game's story is quite engaging. You have enough options and freedom to make you feel like you're actually doing some work on your own, and there are different ways to solve certain problems - though this is the exception - as well as a few different choices you can directly make [like accepting or declinging an invitation]. I can't comment too much on the story; so far it hasn't been the most original, but it was well-told and fairly well-paced, with appealing characters and adequate to very good voice-acting. The other strong suit of the game is the artstyle. I really like the comic style of the characters, but am particularly impressed by the backgrounds, so much so that I spent quite a while just looking at the pictures before even seeing what I can interact with. The cutscenes, aside from direct dialogue, are mostly minimally animanted [very minimally, like blinking], which I've seen done a lot worse and I think works nicely. The gameplay animation is 3D and might be quite glaring at first. It seems to go for a comic-like 3D effect akin to many Telltale games, but it comes across jagged and quite glitchy, with many animations clipping through each other [most glaringly the fact you can walk straight through most character models]. I got used to it quite quickly, but considering it is a major part of the game and does NOT look like the handdrawn backgrounds and cutscenes, you should be at least okay with them in order to gain any enjoyment from the game.Though I generally liked the artstyle, the presentation, the possibilities provided by the gameplay, the characters and the story, there were a few more undesirable aspects aside from the speed that I feel need a mention. Firstly, the game never crashed for me, but there is a chance that it might; save regularly [no or very rare autosave]. Instead, the game nearly froze three times in the span of five hours. All three times it was when I tried to move somewhere, and it wouldn't respond. Every other option was still available and I could highlight them, but none responded to clicking. After a while, the protagonist simply warped to the position I initially clicked for her to go. The last time had me waiting for her to ""warp"" for well over a minute, after which I noticed that I could just hit the dialogue option with nearby characters to make her warp instantly, allowing me to edge my way towards the elevator and to the next floor, where all worked fine again. A very minor glitch that may be entirely due to my graphics card is that the shadows cast by moving objects came out pixelated.Secondly, there are FAR too few dialogue options when clicking around stuff in the background. Perhaps I'm spoiled, but in a point-and-click game I expect more variety than the exact same dialogue for ~five crypts or –six graves [as well as their seperately selectable but identical gravestones], especially when you are expected to click on all of them in order to find something specific. Also, don't bother clicking on things more than once - so far, the dialogue has never changed [but if you're like me, you'll check anyways].And thirdly, while the puzzles are generally good, well-integrated and of various difficulty, some are highly obscure, especially when there's a perfectly reasonable way to solve them that the game simply doesn't recognise [I already mentioned the food]. Some of these problems have to do with the interface - you can choose to look at or interact with an object, sometimes with whatever item from your inventory you selected. But not all items allow for experimentation, and sometimes you get the option only after having checked something else first [which I could never stand adventure games doing]. A frustrating point specifically was when I needed to borrow an item from someone that was clearly very important to them. As soon as I was done, I wanted to return it, but there was no option to do so up to the end of the chapter despite me repeatedly trying [the text once even said ""these two just don't match"" or something, which is clearly false regarding the object that you supposedly only temporarily borrowed off the guy]. Probably the game will have me use the item once more [hopefully without also losing it in the process], or the guy I got it from will ""remind"" me to return it, as if I as the player have forgotten also. Speaking of which, there are a few instances where you have no choice but perform a ludicrous action that you yourself don't want to do. SPOILER: When reminded by my father to bring flowers to someone's grave, I was presented with the option to take them from another grave. I didn't want to do that, but I found NO other way to get one, even after revisiting every single open location. Finally I had to succumb with the justification that I had ""forgotten"" to bring flowers, even though I had done anything but that. Minor things like this can be very irksome when the game otherwise allows you reasonable liberty.Despite its flaws, I was engaged enough through visuals, narrative and interaction, allowing the game to more often than not get away with it.

												Cognition (2013) is like the Blackwell Legacy (2006). They are both point-and-click adventures where you play a female redhead medium on a detective case. The difference is that in Cognition you just flail around from scene to scene, instead getting a cool story.I also ran into a bug where if you left on psychic mode between scenes, it was stuck on.

												Cognition is an absolutely wonderful mystery/thriller with a well plotted story that is very satisfying to play through.  Everyone who thinks they might like it should definitely buy it.I want to make that very plain at once because everything else I have to say about it is complaints.  The constant frustrations from beginning to end are just astounding.  Towards the beginning they are most game design issues, while in the last two chapters they are mostly technical issues.  In fact the last two chapters froze up so many times, I felt like I'd played through them both twice by the end.  The suspense was primarily situated in whether I would make it all the way through a cut scene or if it would hang between lines of dialogue.  And this is particularly troublesome because the last two parts are wonderful and genius.  Before I got to them, I thought the game was good, but not as good as Still Life.  In the first two chapters there are a lot of poor busy work puzzles, two absolutely obnoxious characters (the CSI guy and the coroner), and this horrible idea of giving you a cell phone but ALWAYS forcing you to actually go visit a person when you have to talk to them.  It's like the cell phone is taunting you.  The other bad thing, is all the time you spend watching slow jerky walking animations.  Why are the sets so large with about three things to interact with on each?  They could easily all fit on screen.  But no, invariably you must walk back and forth slowly and jerkily over at least two screens just to find out there's still something you need in another location completely.  The worst offender is the beautiful apartment in chapter 3.  (You notice how I'm compelled to compliment it even while complaining about it?)  In this apartment where you spend most of your time you must walk back forth around kitchen counters, islands, and coffee tables and dining tables that fill the screen.  The game seems to mostly be how to find a pixel's worth of floor space you can click on to get Erica moving in the right direction. The only problem I have with the plot is that there is a suggestion throughout the last chapter that you will have some opportunity to decide what happens to certain characters, whether you kill them or bring them to jail, I'm fine with what the game decides to happen but not so fine with the fact that it suggested you'd have more agency in it when you do not.The game is so good.  While the busy work puzzles are generally awful or unbelievable, the central puzzles are always wonderful, the way the various psy powers work out always very inventive and intricately planned out, the plot is very well done and never disappointing.  I like too that you don't have to like the good guys or dislike the bad guys.  Cognition is wonderful gem, but really Phoenix Studios, shape up.			"

												SUMMARY: Thrilling murder mystery point&click game with novel post-cognition mechanic. A great episodic adventure where each consecutive episode builds up on the mystery of preceeding chapters to the grand climax of the final episode. Game representation is pleasant, but lacks certain degree polish you'd expect from title having jane jensen's name attached to it.  Needlessly amateurish character models and animation. Enjoyable 20 hour trip despite minor flaws and glitches.  GOOD: fairly well told mystery murder story with several twists along the way interesting congnition mechanics, where puzzles are, at times, solved by observing past history or items/peoplewell acted voiceover. nicely painted backgrounds20ish hours of gameplay for very acceptable price. BAD: opening sequence can be off putting since it presumes you caring about the protagonists without prior familiarity. some puzzles lack a clear build, leaving player without any clues to pursue.occasionally buggy pathfining causes erica to take her sweet time to walk where you point her to with you cursor. occasionally flaky animation where torso walks facing one direction, and legs face opposite direction (sand crab walk)bad mesh topology on character mesh models. when erica turns her head, her neck twists into a knot seen when squezzing water out of a towel. Facial expressions sometimes cause stray polygons pop out of characters' faces, making them resemble creepy robots.			"

												Like a sandwich - the filling is the best part.As a whole, Cognition is a brilliant adventure game with puzzles which will perplex you and a story that hooks you. You'll be solving murders as Erica Reed, an FBI agent with the ability to see into the past. Three years earlier from when the story begins, we look into the past and see a tragic case for Erica. In terms of gameplay, Episode 1 is problematic. The puzzles hang on tenuous links at best, and sometimes you'll have to bust out the guide. What should be a throwaway line of dialogue becomes super important for a puzzle, but the logic you have to link it up requires so much thought. But wait! Episodes 2 and 3 fix it, and you're no longer scratching your head. The puzzles are clever, they'll make you think without being impossible. Each episode introduces new gameplay designs, and so they each have a different flavour.Also, the ability to see into the past adds often unique gameplay aspects. You'll have to look at certain objects and discover what they were used for. You'll have to regress people and fix their memories by figuring out what colour their wive's shirt was, what was the day they last saw. It's clever, it's different, and it feels different from normal point and click. You truly get into Erica's head and feel like you are an FBI agent, and also one with the power to see the past.Story-wise, all four episodes have a different flavour also. It did surprise me how the episodes turn out, and I won't spoil it for you here. However, I will say it's incredibly well-written. Episode 2 is a highlight for me. Sadness, frustration, intrigue, mystery, you have it all here, and it never feels forced. There is an overlying arc in the episodes, and each one make you to want play on further to solve the mystery. I for one finished episode 3 yesterday and finished episode 4 tonight ... and that leads onto the problem of Episode 4. It's shorter than the others, and it's very linear. You feel forced into the narrative, and it's not told as well. It's not bad, but it's certainly not as good as the rest. There are a lot of questions that remain, but it remains a good game.Plot-wise, great, acting - great. Puzzles - frustrating in episode one, but clever in all the rest. You truly do begin to like Erica as a character, and the people you meet along the way are well-written as well. Her 'walking stereotype' partner John, McAdams, Davies ... the game is full of memorable characters, which pull the story along. Some are forgettable, like Gallagher. The plot itself is worthy of any TV show.Problems - there are technical issues. I often got clipping with the sound, and there were a few animation glitches which took away from the story. Seeing Erica's head twist around her body like a possessed contortionist was funny, but you don't want to laugh in a psychological thriller. Also, some of the cinematic, drawn in a beautiful comic book style, sometimes ... aren't so beautiful. They can appear choppy and rushed at times. Nevertheless, they are fluid and they do work well. They go on quickly enough with higher quality images that you don't question the poorer frames.Like Erica, I don't look back into the past and see only good memories. Episodes 2 and 3 are both incredible, but Episode 1 has flaws in the gameplay, and 4 in the story. But ... adding up all the memories together, it created a wonderful and great experience. I would highly recommend it to anyone who's patient enough to get through the first episode's diabolical puzzles. Great story, great characters and highly ingenious puzzles, Cognition is a game that takes all the best aspects of an FBI thriller film, whilst making you the actual detective.			"

												It's really unfortunate that I can't give this game a good review... it's got some very nice attention to detail at some points, such as when you try to boost Erica, the protagonist, into her cognition mode when she's already there. You get an artfully done flash of red, indicating a rush of blood at the fruitless attempt to boost her preternatural ability. Or take Erica's mobile phone, where you can do anything from choose tags for web searches for entertainment, to have Erica tell you that she doesn't happen to feel like listening to music at the moment, as her brother is currently being tortured. When you break the hand off a statue, in an act of possibly regrettable vandalism, the hand stays behind, instead of disappearing into hammerspace. Details like these can really make a game experience, providing immersion for some truly diverting story or gameplay.And this is where the game fails. The gameplay is fairly standard for a point-and-click, with a nice flourish from the cognition ability and the very streamlined interaction system, so that's not the problem... No, the game fails on story.The first puzzle turns out to be very simple, something easy to solve while you're still leaning the interface. The madman who has taken Erica's brother has used a makeshift lock to hide in a masoleum, then buried the key out back. Without waiting for backup, Erica and her partner bust into the graveyard, where the only shovel has been cemented into the hand of the 'weeping angel'-style statue. It's a point-and-click, so instead of being able to dig in the loose dirt with her hands, Erica needs to use the hammer from the toolbox to whack off the statue's hand, in order to obtain the shovel to dig. Fine.Except Erica can't dig. The shovel is tainted with the psychic unpleasantness of having whacked her brother in the back of the head. She tries, then tearfully informs the player that she can't use the shovel. An entirely psychic weakness from a psychic isn't very reassuring, and it's conveyed to be on about the same level as a fear of spiders, which is puzzling. It's one of my pet peeves in these sorts of games when the character refuses to do something; not because they couldn't, or it isn't really feasible, but just because they don't want to get their hands dirty. It's a tendency which disproportionately affects female characters. Okay, fine. Maybe I'm being unfair. After all, it's not like psychic abilities don't have downsides too. A blessing and a curse. In any case, Erica goes back to get her male partner and tells him to dig, which he ♥♥♥♥♥es about, but he probably doesn't know about her ability. A secret, double-edged ability, wielded gingerly by a ginger heroine. At this point, I feel like I may have been a bit unfair to label the exchange unreasonably sexist. Erica claims the key from the ground and heads to the front of the masoleum. Then things get really bad.First of all, in the upcoming exchange, her partner reveals that he knows about Erica's ability, which ruins my headcanon of Erica's careful management of her secret capability. Then again, the entire scene ruins Erica's credibility, and calls into question her ability to reasonably manage anything.Erica trys the arcane stone wheel key on the makeshift lock, and tries to turn it. It won't turn, not unless someone is standing on the pressure plate. 'It's a trap!' says her partner, fat white male police guy, 'wait for backup!'. 'No!' snarls Erica, 'I'm doing this'. She turns the wheel... and spikes pop out near her legs. 'Stop!' says fat white police guy 'You see, I was right!' (Actually, I think I jumped the gun on his previous line of dialogue, so he doesn't actually say this, he says that instead, but w/e). And then Erica pulls her gun and points it at her partner's head. Erica has an FBI badge in her inventory, and my guess is that it isn't forged. Given that, her pulling of a gun loses all its melodramatic teenager-style charm. Erica should know how to use a gun, and would only pull it in two cases, to incapacitate, aiming at limbs to slow a dangerous target, or to kill, as a last resort. Given how her gun is directed, she's offering to kill her partner for worrying about her safety. Just wait, it gets worse. Turns out the cryptic message scrawled on the door indicates that the murderer who has her brother wants her to drive the spikes into her shins by continuing to turn the wheel. He's watching them through the camera he installed, so he could probably open the door at any time. Erica's plan is... to do it. Her resolution here is utterly baffling after her refusal to lift a shovel. She turns the wheel to do so, and gives a shriek indicating low pain-tolerance, even after being totally prepared (if I was being sexist, I would say the shriek was 'manly', due to some studies which indicate that men have, on average, lower pain tolerances. Not everyone bases their sexism on statistically derived fact, however, so I feel that the majority of people would come to the opposite determination, were they being sexist). The door opens, and... the trap springs! Catching her partner in the chest, which Erica seems not too unhappy about. She slumps down the stairs, having difficulty walking on her wounded yet not overly bloody legs, making attractive poses against the walls of the spiral staircase. At this point, I could only come to the determination that the developers were of a sadomasochistic bent, who apart from that (in and of itself, not so shameful) likely enjoyed writing a female character due to all the irrational decisions they could justify with one (which is definately a shame). Erica is supposed to be an FBI agent, something which takes no small amount of work and competance. Instead, she's written like a troubled teenager, which utterly kills the story.			"

												One of the better adventure games I've played in a long time.  While this game suffers from lots of back-tracking, it doesn't really borrow any other frustrations from its genre specific brethren.  No pixel hunts.  No insanely illogical puzzles.  This leaves you, the player, to settle down to a fascinating story.  The cognitive abilities make for a nice way to expound the narrative without being overly cheesy.  While the voice acting broke in places, it was very enjoyable overall.  The same goes for the soundtrack.  What gripped me was the dark story told in a very unique way.  And it was surprisingly complex. I also appreciate the very timely auto-saves, since this game will let you make mistakes (very little hand-holding).  I encountered graphical issues, some odd game behavior, and a few odds and ends that didn't quite fit with the otherwise brilliantly polished game, but none of those issues took away from the overall experience.  Even with its issues, this is a must play game for adventure fans.  Its even recommendable to non fans of the genre if you simply enjoy a good story.  I'd recommend some old-fashioned pen and paper (or use the in-game note system) to help with a couple of the puzzles that make sense, but draw on multiple clues.  I'd also recommend lots of saves, since some of the scenes can jump multiple times before giving you back the controls.  (this was mostly only noticeable in the last episode as they closed out a lot of story in that one).  I.E.  lots of back to back cut scenes and conversations while you are itching to try something in the game.			"

												I knew about this at the kickstarter stage, but decided on this one to wait till it was complete. Recently saw an online sale and picked it up and was I glad I did! This was an AMAZING game. I really enjoyed it. It was spooky, eerie, (and a little gory!) but had a lot of great puzzles that were just the right amount of hard to enjoy solving without getting bogged down for too long. I never had to use the hint system, but I wasn't stuck for days beating my head against a wall. That, to me, is perfection in adventure game writing. The storyline was fun, though whoever came up with this serial killer idea, well, I hope you have a therapist to talk to! Disturbing! (but in a good way!) I I loved the soundtrack, the voice artist work was so fantastic (Raleigh Holmes, who does the voice of Erica Reed, is amazing -- She hit all the right notes, emotions and tones. Best voiceover work in any game I've played. I heard she was battling an illness, so I hope she gets well soon and does a sequel!!!!)  Thanks Phoenix Online for distributing a great game, keep doing stuff in this type of point and click adventure genre and I will be a happy customer.			"

												One of the best, if not THE best, Point & Click adventure games i have played this decade.Puzzles are challenging enough to praise yourself upon clearing them with a hint system that will not spoil anything.The plot is so well thought out that it will peek your interest until the credits roll.Though it has 4 episodes, each one will take 5 to 6 hours to complete making this well worth the price.Cognition : A revenge story with a lot of feels. So much feels.			"

												There are things in Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller I really like and some things I find pretty frustrating. Putting it all together I'd still recommend the game which excels in setting scenes and telling a story, has interesting game mechanics but also is sometimes glitchy and bossy.+ Uses original music to set scenes, especially fitting for tense situations+ Overall story is interesting and well interwoven with game mechanics+ Metroidvania-esque+ Good voice-acting+ Decisions; at times the adventure includes sort of lifelike decisions, i.e. the game gets harder if you choose stupidly+ In-game notepad that can interact with the OS clipboard; good for reviews- Bossy, requires player to do odd things or things odd- Episodes made me visit website at the end of each credits roll even though I bought the whole series- In-game notepad not always available- Achievements sometimes require repetition of parts unnecessarily including lengthy scenes- In-game commercialsFrom the start the game managed to grip me and put me into a tense atmosphere. This was immensely helped by the main musical theme, the non-distracting good voice-acting and the mystery surrounding Erica's supernatural powers. I laud all of those. Enjoyably those elements worked for me in pretty much all the pivotal scenes.The game mostly kept me interested to see how the story would unfold and which of my questions would be answered. Though there are story drivers, twists and turns - some of which I'm made part of, some I just watch - I strongly disagree with. Erica is a crime investigator, still she unnecessarily touches pieces of evidence with bare hands (artefact), basically encourages tampering with evidence (dean), disregards the account of a witness claiming to recently having seen a serial killer (Cordelia), is unnaturally easy to ambush (episodes 1 and 4), steals without need a flower from a grave (story driver).There are more objectionable actions but they are sufficiently well explained by the storyline.When I say the game is bossy I refer to a certain linearity. Sometimes you are, without prior or subsequent explanation, required to do things in a certain order, sometimes you are hinted to do something which you actually cannot do yet and sometimes you cannot actively do an action that is immediately afterwards done by the game. Example: I tried to call John and Erica stated there is no reason for that. So instead I left the scene directly leading to a cutscene in which the first thing that happened is Erica calling John.The game feels unfinished or rather unpolished in places. And several transition are not state-safe. There is a clickable ladder that supposedly ""leads to the roof"" but there is no hatch above it. After sitting down at her desk Erica can walk away with the game thinking she is still seated. When the game catches up Erica runs through the stand-up routine wherever she might be at the moment and the chair magically moves by itself. Certain dialogues leave Erica broken, literally. Her upper body is bend back in an unhealthy way, arms sticking out and her head moves about in a fashion the makers of The Exorcist could only dream of. Leaving the actual interrogation room can retain elements of the GUI that shouldn't be available. There is a graveyard scene where you collect the locket followed by a cutscene. When I clicked next I was presented with ""Skip cutscene?"" even though the cutscene ended already. At some point Erica's synergy power was suddenly disabled, i.e. clicking the cognition sphere disappears the inventory and even the open inventory button. Everyone is obsessed with the Cain Killer, see office monitors. Playing on the ""Fastest"" graphics settings I saw some pretty ugly facial animations. By the looks of it only half the points of the lip polyline moved. Sometimes the safe at Longmore's apartment is available as an interaction point when inspecting the desk. When inspecting the safe from inspecting the desk and then exiting will have the desk gone as an item to interact with and looking at the keyboard afterwards takes you to the Boston travel map. Pieces of the photo are mirrored in the inventory ""Next - 7"". For some reason you can only retry the scene or close the game altogether after dying.As said before, the player almost immediately learns about Erica's supernatural powers. Those powers focus on the past and develop over time into four branches specific to different situations and are later complemented by Cordelia's precognition in a way I find really satisfying and appropriately confusing.Another well-established mechanic is the played character voicing inner thoughts to the player. The game is not quite breaking the fourth wall when one of those voicings is overheard and reacted to by another character. I found that pretty immersion-breaking. Fortunately that only happened once very early in the game.One of the most interesting things I have encountered in Cognition and games in general in quite some time is the notepad that is available in Erica's phone. Not only is it editable but it can also cut, copy and paste and uses for those purposes the clipboard of the player's OS. This means that you can import text to and, more importantly, export text from the game. This is very useful for reviews and was used for this one. Unfortunately, the notepad is only available most of the time and doesn't transfer between episodes.Erica's phone is also used to advertise real-world games for which Erica seems ""totally hyped"". Irritatingly, that excitement is apparently more important than to uphold the current atmosphere.In episode 3 'exits' are no longer used but simply clicked. On the one hand this is convenient but you don't always know which object is an 'exit'.When coming into a room the game sometimes takes several seconds before actually letting the player do anything. This would be ok were a triggered sequence to follow but is irritating otherwise.Hints: Save at the beginning of scenes to have access to dialogue and hints later on. If an object seems useless there is about a 50% chance this is because of one of the decisions that actually influence the story. Erica and strangely Cordelia as well may not be as clever and clear-seeing as you are. More often than I would have liked you sort of need to firmly establish a fact before Erica can act on it. So what you tried earlier to no avail may be fruitful later on.A few times I sort of fell out of the flow, i.e. I became unaware of what needed to be done next and twice went brute-forcing. Well, let's not blame the game for that.The conclusion of episode 3 was very awkward and almost turned me away from Cognition - could be verbalised as ""It almost looks like they will.. They wouldn't! Would they?! Oh no, come on man."" Still, the story pulled me back.My final gripes concern the fact that I had to visit the website of the publisher every time after the credits rolled in order to get back to the game menu and the fact that the main menu has a gallery which apparently should have concept art, cinematics and 'behind the scenes' but is consistently empty.For all the problems stated above (and a few unstated) I'm unlikely to replay Cognition but I did enjoy the one play-through and recommend it to players that like adventures and a dose of mystery.

												This game is pretty grimdark for my taste, especially when compared to other adventure games.  I'd classify it as more of a horror game, honestly, given the content.  It doesn't seem to be marked for mature audiences either, which I think is a HUGE mistake.For people who like a lot of uncensored blood and horror, this is pretty fantastic.  I personally love graphic novels as a storytelling medium, so the look and feel of a gritty comic really appeals to me.  The writing is great, the story is dramatic...very little to be desired there.  The voice acting is also pretty great.The game itself...phew.  It's not great.Firstly, as an adventure game, this is pretty solid.  The puzzles make sense (gasp!) and you're given access to all the things you really SHOULD have as a cop (a gun, a phone, etc), and that gives the whole thing a stronger ""no nonsense"" feel than other games in the genre.  The cognition mechanic/system is also really cool, not gonna lie.  That's fine.But, I'll say this...the game was made with Kickstarter and Unity, and it shows.  It is not well-built.  There are several time trials, which is alright...until you realize that the pause screen doesn't actually pause the game or stop the countdowns.  If you experience any lag - and there's a HORRIBLE amount of lag on some machines (thank you Unity), the time trials suddenly become impossible, giving you 15 seconds of being unable to click on anything, and 5 seconds to choose your action.  (Arguably) Worse, any lag you experience interferes with the cutscenes, making dramatic moments stutter, and sound falls drastically out of sync with what should just be static images.  It's really unfortunate, since story and drama is where the game really shines.The artwork for this game is great, but I feel like the whole thing would be better if it was kept in 2D with the graphic novel images.  The character models do have...expressions...sort of...but they look sort of messy and strange to me.  The whole game might just run better without all that.  I don't know.  It seems unnecessary.Lastly, the music is repetitive.  It captures the feel of the game nicely when there's a long enough piece of music in the area, but for crying out loud, the same four bars of ambient atonal sound gets real old real fast when you're wracking your brain trying to figure out how not to die.  A little more variation, and slightly longer tracks, would do wonders.I'm not going to continue playing this, partly because the content makes me a bit ill (personal preference, I'm sure others would love it), but mostly because it's difficult to play for all the worst reasons.  I could get into this as more of a horror title if it wasn't for the pain when this game doesn't run smoothly, or the interface itself.			"

												Okay, I try to really be fair and forgiving, especially to indie projects, but as a 3D artist myself - this game has THE WORST weight painting I've ever seen on a shipped game that I spent money on. Which is a shame, because the animations are pretty fluid (the mocap data is cleaned nicely, or the animator that hand-animated did a good job) but the effect is all but ruined by verts floating a good six inches above a character's collarbone. It's not clean, it's not professional, and it really doesn't do an already clunky game any favors.It's the most glaring symptom of an overall experience that is pretty poor. It's going to be a slog to grind through this for achievements.			"

												This game is so slow and glitchy. There are 500 cutscenes just in the first episode. When you want Erica to go look at something she takes a full minute just to turn in that direction before she decides to walk. The glitches aren't too bad.... Mostly graphical (her mouth glitches at one point giving her a disjointed Joker-esque smile.) I spent most of the game waiting for the game to hurry the @!($ up so I could actually do something. Otherwise the idea behind it is fine... Just could've been carried out in a more exciting way.			"

												Although the comic-book style graphics aren't the greatest, the rich story, abundance of well-developed female characters with different physical characteristics and personalities, and unique cognition ability mechanics more than make up for it. The music fits the themes perfectly, and I found myself thinking about the game long after finishing it. Fans of the Blackwell series from Wadjet Eye Games would probably find plenty to love in Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller.			"

												This is a great point-and-click game packed with a compelling story arc, fairly complex puzzles, and interesting main characters.  The cutscene art is vibrant and well done.My only frustration has been frequent crashes.  A quick search through the forums revealed that this might be due to a known, raptr-related issue in-game.  Using the '-force-gfx-direct' command line option solved that problem for me.  The game has run without any problems so far (~1 hour).  w00tUPDATE: no crashes or lags since updating the launch options, going on 5+ hours of game time since.			"

												I will recommend this game with a warning, don't have high expectations for quality or atmousphere.  There's a lotta neat qualities about this game.  It's a very decent point and click mystery and the story, on paper, is very interesting.  But for some reason, I can't like this game.   The dialogue, the voice acting, the graphics, the art, none if it flows very well and it's very obvious that these guys were only working with what they had on them, which that being considered makes this game very impressive.  I understand that indie developers struggle to put out a decent game, but I can't help but point out that there are many indie developers who still manage to put out high-quality products.  Which leads me to believe that there were probably better options the devs could have made design and development tool-wise that could have improved the quality of the atmousphere. All that being said, this game is very impressive when understanding that these guys probably had a low-budget.  I'm recommending this game cuz, even though i'm a bigot and the quality kept me from enjoying the game, I'm confident that these devs can do something really special with the right support.			"

												TL;DR: *MOONLOGIC* game.I tried. I couldn't. The UI/UX of this game is a nightmare. The movement is slow. Some of the puzzles are unexplained. Example: You need a device to scan a graffiti that is covered with green painting. You get the device. You try to scan through the green painting to see the graffiti. You can't. You need to enter the color Id. How? I don't know. You can't interact with the device. That and other things stopped me from continuing the game. The back and forth from location to location to get simple stuff is boring and annoying. You don't feel progression. padding after padding... I don't recommend this game to anyone who gets frustrated quickly.			"

												What is Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller?Genre: Point & Click AdventureSetting: police officer with supernatural abilities hunts down psychotic killer in a noir-style cityDifficulty: 6/10 --> some scenes require some puzzlingLength: 10-20 hours for a single playthrough, another 10 for rerunning and unlocking all achievementsMode: singleplayer campaignSimilar games: Broken Sword series, Gabriel Knight series, Sherlock Holmes seriesThe positive aspects:- Let's emphasize: The VOICE ACTING is OUTSTANDING. - authentic atmosphere: a dark and dirty city, devious cops and suspects, and, of course - the voice acting!- thrilling episodic story with well-written twists, gathers pace and slows down at the right moments, summarizing flashbacks. Not your typical happy-end-for-all-story!- well-embedded background musicThe negative aspects:- Sometimes the game would freeze and crash, causing you to start over again from the last save (which may have been a while ago)- The spot identification is sometimes messed up- Ok, finally some high-level critics: characters are a bit too cliché. the hard-boiled cop, the handsome agent, the tech geek etc.Result (and summary for those who have no time reading):Don't hesitate to buy Cognition: ERT! Alone the voice acting is worth the price. Plus this adventure grants you a dark, yet gripping story with dramatic cutscenes and fitting background music. And that comes in a handy package with your beloved pointing and clicking! Now! What are waiting for?! Go buy it!			"

												I really got fooled into playing this by the overwhelming amount of positive reviews.I've only played this game for a little under 2 hours, because I couldn't bring myself to continue this terrible game.Now, I'm not a huge point-and-click fan, but have played several of them.ProsVery nice graphics (love the comic book style).The idea of the story seems interesting.The voice acting is solid.The puzzles are quite interesting.ConsBy far the worst flaw is the EXCRUCIATINGLY slow movements of the characters. Every movement of the characters is painstakingly slow and laborious. Having to go through 15 seconds of animation to do a simple thing is just a terrible waste of time.Ridiculous overacting of the characters. It reminds me a little of those over-the-top Japanese cartoons where everyone shouts and goes crazy with excitement even when doing mundane things. I felt a complete disconnect with how I, as the player, experienced the situation and how the characters expressed themselves. All believability and empathy goes out the window because of this.Dying numerous times because of trial-and-error style situations/puzzles. It wouldn't be so bad, but you have to go through the slow cut-scenes and animations again. The penalty of dying in this game is killing your fun-time.I think it's a huge pity, because I really want to play the game. But, not in this state. If someone knows how to speed up the animations, please tell me!			"

When I started playing this game I was almost immediately sucked into the atmosphere of the game, it didn't fail during all episodes.I can recommend this game to all puzzlers out there who love a good story line with some nice twists.definately an 8+ out of 10!

												For Episode 1-3, it is an excellent story telling game with good song and great voice acting.Episode 4 still something until we meet Keith...........Did the team lose a whole scene plot at that part?So those 3 people need to make a BIG scene JUMP into a critial under-hand condition........This nearly make me laugh, even I am playing a such DARK and SAD game. So bad.Besides, the game still have many bugs and have many improving area. Look forward to the next game, no matter is about Erica or someone else.			"

												Too Expansive, controls too clunky and far too much backtracking and not allowing you to pick up objects until you need them. Got about three quarters of the way through the first chapter when I got sick of the game, trying to artificially extended the game play, so restored to a walkthrough because I had got bored of the game and just wanted to finish it as quickly as possible.Also be aware that the screenshots don't convey how awkward the character animations are.

												FBI agent Erica Reed has an uncanny talent: she can see the past and piece together how a crime unfolded. But not even this sixth sense could save her younger brother, Scott, from a brutal serial killer. Three years later, the investigation into Scott’s murder has gone cold -- but Erica’s work has only just begun. Jump into Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller, the exciting four-part series that brings Erica face to face with the deranged demons of her past. A serial killer is loose in Boston -- one who seems to be leaving deliberate clues that only Erica, with her unique post-cognitive abilities, can uncover. Is she finally on her way to solving Scott’s murder? Or, blinded by vengeance, is she falling into a trap that could cost Erica her life? And how does this new killer know her secret? Developed by Phoenix Online Studios (makers of the King’s Quest spin-off The Silver Lining), with contributions from veteran game designer Jane Jensen (Gabriel Knight, Gray Matter) and comic book artist Romano Molenaar (Batman, X-Men, The Darkness), Cognition is a thrilling adventure that grips you and won’t let go.

												What's this ? A game or torture ?I tried to play that game and at the cemetery you need to enter a tombe. You cannot look around. You have to click like a maniac every possible hot spot until it ""unlocks"" a needed skills to continue. Then when you use that skill you find out that there are some tools on the left side of the tombe.What the ... ? The game did not let me check the left side before - the hotspot was just disabled. Why do i need a special skill to go to the left side of a tombe ?Why does it not let me go where i want to go ?Why does the help system wants you to phone your dad to ask questions and you cannot ask any question ?If you need a program that orders you to follow a path step by step without giving you any choice then this is what you were looking for. If you want a game where you need wits and that makes fun then this is not for you. "

												If you're not a fan of adventure games, no need to read more, stay away, this is not a good example of what an adventure game should be.If you are a fan of the genre, then I really don't recommend this game at full price or anything near it ($30 at the time of writing). It's very frustrating with useless backtracking on the map to lengthen a game that does not feature many puzzles for you. Also, it's kinda glitchy (sometimes graphical glitches, worse in rare occasions).And the story, while it does try to be serious and deal with adult matters, it fails at being taken seriously, partly because of the glitches, but also because it makes no sense at all the more complicated it gets. (I get the story, I just don't believe it at all.)Sad, because I'm pretty sure the people involved in the project at least tried to make something good and it stays fresh between episodes, though not very good. There are certainly traces to be found of the greatness it could have been.			"

												Excellent music and well-drawn visuals can't save an adventure game with actual loading times (on a quad-core i7 - yeah, it's not my computer that's the problem) and poorly-designed UI (unskippable cutscenes that can trigger multiple times, the ""cognition"" system is cumbersome (why do we need to click cognition, then click what we want to use it on, then click it a second time? At least one of these steps is not necessary), and a lot of forced waddling).The voice acting is absolutely abhorrent (whoever did the voice for John should never use a microphone again), and - perhaps worst of all for a point-and-click adventure game - the mouse pointer is a bit strange, it feels like it's swimming through syrup even at low graphics settings.The plot may be the most gripping thing on earth for all I know, but I'm not going to suffer through the bad UI and poorly-thought-out mechanics to find out. I gave it an hour on Desura, and that's an hour of my life I'm not going to get back. Just buy the soundtrack and read a Stephen King book while listening to it.			"

												On two levels I think this game is brilliant: artistic style of the backgrounds and cut-scenes fits the over tone this game tries to set.  It's subtle, muted, coloful, and simple.  The story itself is complex and deep (and somewhat convoluted) with unexpected twists, interesting concepts, and somewhat original gameplay mechanics.However that's where the briliance in this near disater of a game stops.  The puzzles, while some are clever, are at best average, and the music fares a bit better than average.  Everything else falls dreadfully short of average from horible character models and animation to weak, shallow, and often laughable characters, some horrendous voice acting, and questionable dialogue.This amounts to what could have been a greaty story and gaming experience ruined by the way the story itself is told with poor production values in most departments mentioned above, with the voice acting, dialogue, and character animations being the worst of the offenders.  One particular puzzle has its hot spots off, causing you (well, at least me) to select the wrong answers in a critical moment even though you clik the right answer.  And the devs can't tell their left from their right and their center.  One puzzle, after every move, you get the exact same dialogue repeated that takes up 11 seconds before you can move again.  The puzzle is taking forever, just form the stupid repeated, and useless, dialogue. Also, the actual game engine (Unity) itself detracted much form the experience with several lockups and frequent delays (the engine seems to need time to recover from every action you perform causing a delay of a few seconds before you can take another action).  Also, the default Unity start up screen that asks you about game setting before actually getting into the game is a put off as well.Sadly, I cannot recommend this to anyone as an overly enjoyable experience.  You can play this game and you probably won't regret it, but you'll be overly disappointed because this game fall so short of what it could have been.  It borders more on being an amateur title than an indie one.			"

												Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Ugh so frusterating. Cant decide what it wants to be. Its it an adventure or is it a shooter or is it a a fighting game. Who knows? They dont. Ugh I have so many issues with the gameplay and this is just in the first act of episode 1. Where to begin?They dont tell you how to use anything in the game. Nothing. Your left to wonder what the developer is thinking. The gate requires a gun. Does the hint system tell you this? Nope.  You have to randomly click on on things until you disover your gun. Its to the right.The other issue is the clunky action system. Your suppose to rescue you dumb brother who manages somehow to get kidnaped. ""Be fast. Click on the killer's head and do action punch"" Ugh. Stupid stupid stupid. Does it sound like I am irrated by the game. Yeah I am. The walking dead series made it all look so easy and natural. The game is just a mess of ideas. None them very good. I got killed 3 times by a killer who is supposed to be some master villian. He kills by letting you know he is there and then after he fights with you then he pulls out the gun and then kills you. Ugh. Better off watching a youtube of the game and saving yourself the fun of playing guesse what the developer is thinking.Watched a youtube of how this scene is supposed to be played. punch. Grab curtain. Of course that makes a lot of sense. A lot of nonsene. Ugh still do not recommend this game to anyone.			"

												I love point-and-click adventure games, but when it comes to a point-and-click thriller, this one really takes the cake.  Where do I start?  Let me break this down for you.Storyline - 10/10 - Absolutely fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic!  And I do not put that lightly.  It's very deep with multiple twists and turns and on top of it all: it is INTENSE.  The term ""thriller"" for this plot is an understatement.  You will encounter situations and plot twists that will rack your brain, wrench your heart out, and even disturb you greatly.  Simultaneously, you will also find yourself getting rather attached to the characters you encounter and the relationships you develop with them is on point.  Gameplay - 8/10 - Controls are simple enough since this is a point-and-click game so you only need the mouse.  The downside is that sometimes things can get a little slow.  For one, there are a few glitches here and there that affect if you can interact with something.  Granted, I only encountered this with a figurine in the very last episode.  So, yes, there are glitches, but they are rare.  On top of that, it can get tedious getting around to different locations and picking up items from certain places, then taking them to other places, etc.  Other than that, the gameplay is very engaging and the puzzles are challenging but not impossible.  Overall, it's very excellent.Artwork - 10/10 - This is a bloody beautiful game in more ways than one.  The artwork ranges from beautiful, to disturbing, to frightening, to aesthetic, to calm, to intense, etc etc etc.  It's never boring visually with this game.Soundtrack - 10/10 - Very original soundtrack and it is very fitting for each situation you encounter.  Personally, I love it. Now, here's my regret.  I did not pay full price for this game.  In fact, I bought it on sale.  But even if I paid the full price, I definitely would have gotten my money's worth and Phoenix Online Studios would deserve every penny.  Trust me when I say, this game is definitely worth the price and I'm praying for a Season Two which I will definitely pay full price for if it is ever released!			"

												You play an FBI agent chasing down a serial killer, still haunted by her failure to save her brother three years ago.  It's pulpy stuff, but the atmosphere really brings it alive and makes it entertaining. It was more than enough for me to forgive the idiosyncrasies of the wonky game engine, like Erica occasionally walking strangely and some occasional tearing on the character models.Where the game really runs into trouble is in its second half. The third episode gets completely bogged down in exposition. The writing gets rather ambitious too, but just doesn't quite deliver. The fourth episode tried to bring back the pace, but feels rushed, closed-in, and is a bit of a mess. It was never so bad that I put it down, but it felt very much like they had stumbled en route to what could have been a legitimately great adventure game.Overall, I felt that Cognition's highs outshone its lows enough that I would suggest you pick it up - but only on sale.

												Overall, Cognition is a good game. The story is very compelling and the game play is pretty good. Episode 1 is very rough around the edges, and I almost gave up on the game, but things really start kicking in episode 2 and the game finds its groove. I definitely enjoyed it overall.Pros:+ Good story with lots of twists and turns+ Story has a ton of suspense and moves along at a good clip+ Most of the point and click puzzles are pretty good. And when they're not, there's a built-in hint system to keep the game moving.+ The character's psychic abilities give the game a unique feel.+ Pretty good music.Cons:- Graphics are really rough and buggy, especially in episode 1. I am not a person who ever complains about graphics, but the weird, creepy facial expressions and body language are downright distracting. Sometimes Erica gets weird lines on her face like the Joker, or sometimes a character might contort their body in ridiculous ways.- The voice acting is pretty hit and miss. People's accents come and go, and a couple characters are really bad--like the actor is reading their lines off of a piece of paper. Again, this is not something I normally complain about, but it can be pretty distracting.- A few game mechanics were swings and misses, like episode 4's half-hearted attempt to make dialog choices and relationships matter. Apparently there are two ending, so your choices matter a little, but not really.			"

												This game took a while for me to get into, it is quite slow, most of the characters are unlikable♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and the character animations are jerky, unnatural and prone to hilarious glitches. However by the time I got into the second episode I had been sucked into the story and couldn't wait to carry on. The use of the characters' paranormal abilities adds a nice twist to the usual point and click puzzles. In contrast to the terrible character models the background art work is excellent and rather reminiscent of Grey Matter, which is kind of a shame because this game really doesn't measure up to that game. So this is not the greatest point and click game but I'm giving it a thumbs up predominantly for the story.			"

												Having recently completed Grim Fandango (probably the most famous point and click ever), I was looking for something that would top the experience and this did! I absolutely loved this game. The characters are all extremely interesting and Erica Reed is a really likeable, relatable girl, who even has the power to see into the past. To me, the graphics and the animations are brilliant (even when you get the odd glitch, it's just funny!) and the soundtrack is second to none. I have never played a game that has been so addictive and the storyline is so immersive,that I was lost in this for a week, like a book I couldn't put down. At times, the gameplay was so intense I felt like I was going to have a heart attack, but in a fun way! I genuinely cared for the characters, which makes the game all the more shocking when you do make a wrong move. I'ts gory, intelligent and daring. The puzzles are logical and made sense to me (although I doubt I could have completed them without the hints - thanks Dad!). If you are considering buying this game, do it. It's so so so so good. Every decision you make will affect the future of the game and also the lives of the characters you will grow to love, ever so fondly. It's genius.			"

												I will recommend this detective/mystery game, with some reservations. Let´s get those out of the way first.Episode 1 isn´t that great. It´s bit meandering and more like an extended tutorial.Episode 2 is merely ok, and acts as a setup for the last act (3 and 4).UI can be clumsy at times and occasional small bugs crop up (no gamebreakers experienced).And then to good things:In general, game has this painted comic book style that works pretty well. Music is also definitely good enough and supports the action at hand.Episodes 3 and 4 are practically one long episode, and of pretty high quality at that. Puzzle quality goes up, game just flows more smoothly, extra background characters no longer interrupt the story. This is where the meat of the story actually lies. Like most stories, you can find missing things, gaps and perhaps some logical errors at closer examination... But not enough to stop me enjoying it till the end.Ending was pretty good as well. It has some variability based on your choices too. All in all, I was reasonably satisfied. Especially since I got this game with a discount price. Definitely can´t complain too much.			"

												It's hard to tell that Jane Jensen merely consulted on plot elements, because this feels like one of her games. That is a good thing. The story of a cop with psychic powers is a bit of a trope and I went into playing this thinking 'oh great, here's another Syfy crime drama', but they really took it further than I anticipated. It's actually really thrilling and good. As proof that I mean it, the same company did another game WITH Jane Jensen, my personal game development hero, and I think this one is stronger. Hurts to say, but I'm being honest. I crave a sequel.			"

												Episode Breakdown (95%, 90%, 70%, 80%):A point-and-click adventure that was surprisingly fun to play. I've played similar games on iOS before this (Pendulo Studios' Hollywood Monsters/The Next Big Thing & Yesterday and the Special Enquiry Detail series) but the postcognition was definitely a good addition to the usual point-and-click. Tedious and brain-racking at times, but still fun.Pros:Excellent voice acting (especially Raleigh Holmes as Erica Reed)Great musicDecent graphicsInteresting storyline and puzzlesCons:Animation glitches (my Erica model glitched in Kelsey's house, Ep 2, where she could walk through an invisible wall, and in the lakehouse, Ep 4, where basically her head was in the middle of her torso)Lack of keyboard input (forced to play the entire game with a mouse even though the settings launcher has default keyboard bindings)Looks like a straight port of the iOS version with the Unity engine; no remaster of graphics or sound for PC version.Could've had shooting and fight sequences (like The Wolf Among Us), hell, you're playing an FBI agent of all things and they kick down doors and shoot people all the time!All in all, I'm glad all the Kickstarters that funded the game managed to see it developed and completed. Bring on Season 2!			"

												At first glance, the game appears fairly unimpressive, and commits a number of Adventure Gaming's worst sins. You spend a lot of time in the first chapter driving back and forth to get items you COULD have picked up earlier, but Erica refused because she didn't know she needed them. It's frustrating, and boring, and worst of all, it means you may not stick around to experience the truly excellent later chapters!In chapters 2-4, the story really kicks into high gear, and there's some truly original and fun aspects of Erica's abilities to explore. The painted backgrounds are always pretty and the voice acting is very good. Story, character and dialog are all solid. Really, the game's only sin is the lackluster first chapter. I can't stress enough the leap in quality come chapter 2. Maybe just grab a Let's Play on youtube of chapter 1 and skip to the good parts!			"

												It has been a long time since I played a game, maybe even watched a film that captivated me as much as Cognition did. If like myself you're a fan of detective games then this is a must. I can't even compare any other games that match it in terms of how well thought out the story is. The twists, murders, story/skills development and style flow seamlessly from episode to episode. This is how episodic games should be done, full stop. The suspense and cliff hangers at the end of each episode have subtly been built up from the beginning of each ep, they're not just thrown at you in the last 5 minutes in hopes to keep you invested long enough to buy the next one.   The use of the cognition skill works really well in the game. You do equal amounts of normal detective work with a nice topping of physic abilities. You don't feel as Erica is over powered in anyway, even without the powers she makes a kick♥♥♥♥♥detective. With some top quality voice acting going on I might add.  The puzzles are original and unique the majority of times. So you don't run the chance of becoming immune to them, you can't just jump head first into them because there's a good chance you could get yourself killed. They're not gonna hold your hand either, there's a level of effort you got to put in.So negative point, I found the animations to be a bit jerky, and it would take Erica nearly 10 seconds to register how to  turn around and walk across the room. I don't know whether this was because I played most of the game on the ""Fastest"" setting (cause's some hilarious glitches in the character model) but for the last ep I did change the settings to beautiful and most of what I just mentioned above disappeared. So do yourself a favour and don't play on the fastest settings; your computer can handle it at peak quality! I was just an idiot. End mark, I give it a 9.5 out of 10. It's orginal, well made and worth every penny.			"

												WARNING: GAME NOT FOR KIDSI think the story is interesting enough to give this game a try, and really, that's the most important thing in an adventure game. The female protagonist should appeal to a female audience.The plot you could read about in the steam store, but you should know ahead of time that the victims are killed in sick and twisted ways that may not appeal to some. That's why i said not for kids. To give you an idea, think of the ""Saw"" series of movies.The in-game graphics are dated, characters models have a polygonal quality to them. movies are stylized still images. In various scenes, the faces/eyeballs are pointed at odd angles, and the necks are twist around oddly. I think (correct me if i'm wrong) the developpers are a small company/low budget, so I could forgive all graphical anomalies.I had some minor annoyances with it. Most notably, at the beginning of the game when you are investigating a crime scene, you go around the room touching all the evidence, unlike a real FBI agent, in order to put to use your psychic power. What stood out to me the most was one puzzle in episode 1. You need to extract information from a suspect and, to do so, you must use your psychic powers to enter his mind and reconstruct a lost memory. It was a beautiful puzzle combining regular detective work with the psychic power.Should you ever get stuck, follow a guide to get past those parts. I needed to do that multiple times.I did not bother with the director's commentary (yes there is that option). So no comment on that.Pros-interesting story-some may like soundtrack-one very very good puzzle in episode 1Minor complaints-slow character movement and tedious multiple clicks on some exit points (episode 1 elevator to leave your HQ)-some logical oddities-lapses in lead character's accent (you can hear her inner britishness) (more funny than complaint)-some puzzles/clues set-up by the serial killer require the use of psychic powers. How does the killer know you have those powers? By the end of the game you will understand why, but it just felt so strange solving those puzzles that way.Major complaints-the trial and error approach to some puzzles in episode 4-the ""remember every small detail of the story thus far that you never thought was important"" answer to some questions in episode 2.-Another end of episode 2  puzzle			"

												You're damn right I didn't see that coming!Very good game, some parts stressful and horrific but very good. The graphics and characters movement mechanics were jenky and glitchy - a couple of moments when Erica's head flipped out. Anyway, as an agent, it only felt right to write down EVERYTHING on Erica's phone.Be wary though about your laptop/computer space (or the technical term when it comes to computer games), I could only have one other Steam game installed at least or else Cognition would crash and stop working within minutes of starting up.

												Having recently completed Grim Fandango (probably the most famous point and click ever), I was looking for something that would top the experience and this did! I absolutely loved this game. The characters are all extremely interesting and Erica Reed is a really likeable, relatable girl, who even has the power to see into the past. To me, the graphics and the animations are brilliant (even when you get the odd glitch, it's just funny!) and the soundtrack is second to none. I have never played a game that has been so addictive and the storyline is so immersive,that I was lost in this for a week, like a book I couldn't put down. At times, the gameplay was so intense I felt like I was going to have a heart attack, but in a fun way! I genuinely cared for the characters, which makes the game all the more shocking when you do make a wrong move. I'ts gory, intelligent and daring. The puzzles are logical and made sense to me (although I doubt I could have completed them without the hints - thanks Dad!). If you are considering buying this game, do it. It's so so so so good. Every decision you make will affect the future of the game and also the lives of the characters you will grow to love, ever so fondly. It's genius.			"

												At first glance, the game appears fairly unimpressive, and commits a number of Adventure Gaming's worst sins. You spend a lot of time in the first chapter driving back and forth to get items you COULD have picked up earlier, but Erica refused because she didn't know she needed them. It's frustrating, and boring, and worst of all, it means you may not stick around to experience the truly excellent later chapters!In chapters 2-4, the story really kicks into high gear, and there's some truly original and fun aspects of Erica's abilities to explore. The painted backgrounds are always pretty and the voice acting is very good. Story, character and dialog are all solid. Really, the game's only sin is the lackluster first chapter. I can't stress enough the leap in quality come chapter 2. Maybe just grab a Let's Play on youtube of chapter 1 and skip to the good parts!			"

												Erica Reed is simply one of the best stories told about serial killers in games.Graphic is okay, the voiceovers are splendid (apart from Director Davies) and the idea of putting Psion powers into the gameplay (though not always executed well) freshens up the title.This game is for people who:- like the serial killer topic- don't mind some SAW references- can overlook technical problems (The game IS glitchy, yes, including some bugs, but no gamestoppers)- like a good game soundtrack including songsThis game is NOT for people who:- are impatient- dislike scary crime scenes- expect a technical AAA title (it's clearly not)- look for family friendly atmosphere (CLEARLY not for children)On a personal note I wished for another middle chapter, the pace speeds up during chapter 3 of 4 and I would have liked just another ""filler"".

												This is honestly one of the best point and click games I've played and thats having played a lot of Telltale's content. The story is very complex and interesting and one of the best I've seen in a mystery. Fair warning, it does start out a little slow so be prepared to have to play through the first and second episodes at least for the tutorial to stop and the overarching plot to pick upI say tutorial... It doesn't really have much for a designated tutorial. The beginning of the game serves as a basic tutorial that shows you stuff like how to move, how to operate the UI, and the follower system, which is only really used like 2 times after that so I really don't know why they bothered to introduce it.What really sets this game apart from other point and click games are the Cognition and Cell Phone features that provide a lot more options than your typical 'look' and 'use'. - The Cognition ability is the main characters psychic ability that serves an integral part in solving puzzles but is more than just touching an item and getting a vision. In fact, there are four different abilities that the game requires you to use that can be a lot more demanding whether they require you to analyze multiple items in the scene or look into someone's thoughts. - The Cell Phone has multiple features such as a ""web browser"" and other typical smart phone tropes that are integrated into puzzles pretty creatively but don't see much frequent use. The most used feature that I garuntee everyone will be using at least once is the hint system which is in the form of text messages. While there were some hints that werent very helpful, they always seemed to fit the difficulty of the situation. Ie. if the objective is just find something in a room and it turns out it's just on a shelf but I was to stupid to realize it, the hint might be something like ""Did you thoroughly check the room you idiot?"". On the flip side, if I'm stuck on an actually challenging puzzle it will give me something helpful. Looking at the puzzles, none of them seemed to far fetched if you actually take the time to absorb all the information the game gives you, unlike me. After asking the game for a hint, I often realized that the answer, though not easy to obtain, was never overly cryptic.Looking at this game from a purely spec standpoint is when people may start to judge it.- The voice acting is good in most cases but the main problem is the main voice actor trying to put on a bostonian accent that seems to come and go. Not to say that she's bad, she just seems a little confused. - The most glaring problem is with the animations which include wierd walking cycles and janky interactions with characters and items. Mouth movements are also extrememly limited and look like the people can barely move their lips. However, being the person I am, I did enjoy the couple weird glitches that caught me off gaurd. - The best thing in this aspect is the soundtrack which does a pretty good job setting the tone and even drove me look up some the songs youtube I liked them so much (Though to no evail sadly).OVERALL: If you are into story based games than you will be way into this but if you're someone who's set off by any technical problems then you may end up feeling buyers remorse 10 minutes in..

												The game has it's faults, but really engaging. I literally found myself gasping at times, my heart was racing at others and I felt legitimately sad and angry at certain events. Plus the whole pyschic element adds some really cool gameplay. The game was supper buggy for me which was irritating, I probably could have fixed it but I didn't and I still really enjoyed the game. The story's good overally, but as with all games like this the journey is more important than the destination.If you don't like point and clickers this one won't change your mind, but a very solid addition to the genre for us fans. Easily an 8/10, with or without the bugs.			"

												This game has gone down as one of my favorites. It's older now, and the animation shows that, but it's still worth your time and money. If you enjoy point-and-click murder mysteries as much as I do, you won't be dissapointed. This game has an interesting plot, fun puzzles and relatable characters, all wrapped up in a supernatural comicbook style. I feel that this game does a good job balancing between holding your hand and throwing you into the deep end: it makes you think but you shouldn't have to look up a guide to complete it.			"

												Super fun, except for the last chapter which was a little too convoluted but overall I enjoyed the character relationships and the little memory puzzles and games. The art style in the cutscenes was pleasant and the explanations on how to  Erica's powers were well explained. However the last chapter had a lot of unnecessary back and forth and if things weren't done in the right order it was a bit of a pain. Overall, I would recommend if you like emotionally driven story telling and puzzles as well as a female-heavy focus (which we need more of!).			"

												i really love this game for several reasons: the plot is super interesting, if you like to play an fbi agent (who is personally involved) and you love point & click. the game has a lot of specials to offer: every episode has a new feature in regard to the gameplay which makes it even more interesting (i don't wanna spoil anything, so i won't give examples here), altho i have to admit that sometimes i was a bit frustrated about all the skills erica has as i got the feeling the cutscenes take over the play. (you can skip them btw) but the atmosphere, the characters (why didn't terence get a bigger role?!) and the soundtrack kept me playing with enthusiasm. ^_^ (minor spoilers ahead in my last point):a negative aspect which needs to be adressed tho is that cognition reinforces racial stereotypes: there are only 3 people of color in the game and 1 of them is killed, 1 of them is corrupt and the 3rd one is into magic. this is so unnecessary. :( (and kind of typical for jane jensen games) that really bothered me tbh.

												I rarely comment on any games but as a fan of Point & Click adventure games I fell in love with Cognition so much I had to express my opinion on it. Complex characters, intriguing storyline, and the amazing talents of the protagonist keep gamer on edge all the time. To be honest I didn't think the episodic formula would fit into this kind of adventure game but I have to admit that I was wrong. When you finish the game it makes you want more but in a good way- the ending gives closure, and leaves the feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment.Loved each and every second of it. I would recommend this game to a fan of adventure and story-driven games.			"

												At first I was tempted to just uninstall this game and chalk this up to a bad purchase on my part.  The first episode crashed constantly and the graphical glithes were incredibly jarring making it difficult to immerse myslef in the game.  Pathing was frustrating as it seems to take forever for your character to navigate a room, it feels like she has to think where she wants to go, then debate whether it is the best path, then check her gps to make sure it's the best route, call a friend and ask if she should trust the gps, then finally move.  It's most noticable on areas that require you to move across the screen and have to give the move command multiple times.  Oddly enough, interacting with objects seems much quicker, even if the object requires the character to move as far or even further than a move command would.  The first episode is also filled with backtracking and driving all over boston which felt to me like filler rather than a necessary storytelling or game mechanic.  I did not, however, uninstall the game and stuck with it.  Beyond the first episode the crashes nearly dissapeared.  The graphical glitches remained but I began to actually enjoy them.  I laughed out loud when my character's torso turned around as she walked down stairs, leaving the top half of her looking behind her as the bottom half walked forwards.  The story begins to pick up in the second episode too, the first has a somewhat disjointed feeling that doesn't get explained or expanded on till the fourth episode or so.  By the third episode I was hooked and I was glad I gave this game a chance.  Sure it's filled with graphical bugs and a frustrating first episode.  But if you love a good narrative with clever story elements then I recommend gritting your teeth and working your way through the first episode as the rest of the game is worth it. Note:  I recommend saving before you leave each screen in the first episode.  Also, the continue button on the main screen will load the last room you walked in to so no need to save when you first enter.  Take lots of notes on your character's phone or irl.			"

												Decided to give a review since it’s not getting a lot of love/credit.The Good:It successfully creates that dark/thriller murder mystery atmosphere (a bit like se7en in a way). The serial killers cases are dark, gruesome and pretty interesting to follow. This is definitely the strong point of the game. Putting all clues together to discover the identity of the killer is done in an unconventional way. It enters into the Psychic world, looking into past and the future, tampering with memories and all that good stuff. The story does take a while to get going, and there are some obvious “fillers” (basically all the Rose scenes which serves as tutorials/progression) but overall it’s pretty good, dark, filled with twists and stakes definitely pick up much earlier on the other episodes.Oh and soundtrack is pretty good!The Bad:It does have some flaws. Some people point out bugs, but in my entire play through I only encountered one (when I failed one puzzle and had to reload a save) so can’t say much for that. But yes there will be character walking glitches but that’s nothing out of the ordinary and the voice acting can be weird (lack of emotion, delivery, and big pauses between lines in some cases) but it got better in the latter episodes (or maybe I got used to it?).Edit: Forgot to say the way character moves is pretty.... ridiculous. Yes It kinda looks bad, and when someone talks (cutscenes) it looks unpolished but the same could be said to the telltale series. So graphically expect the same as telltale games.The only thing I’d complain is the “delay” between actions, or inputs. Doing something like trying to open a locked door can take up to 10-12 seconds! Only to say it’s locked in the end. And then to take back control of your character can take another 5 seconds. And there are a lot of “locked doors”. This is my only complaint but the game was good enough for me to ignore that, and note that it doesn’t happen for everything but you definitely notice.			"

												The Pros: I like the storyline. I find it captivating and intriguing. Most of the puzzles are tough/complicated just in the right amount. The soundtrack and voice over is great. The Cons: Graphics could be improved. The games are somewhat too linear and you can get stuck searching for one small thing that is almost hidden for too long, and usually in the most uninteresting parts. Some of the puzzles are overly annoying and not as interesting as some of the rest. Overall an enjoyable game, with a fascinating story and I love how the heroine skills develop and evolve during each of the games. Also the different timelines/life stories and twists are pretty good. The game length overall is great.  "

												6/10The puzzles are passable, nothing very taxing and no cat hair mustache either. The occational order of opperation issue, where you must do things in series even when you have the soloution (or at least next step) crop up. The UI however is from the early 90s and acts up enough to be distracting. Voice acting is spotty, with Erica's fake Boston accent fading in and out like Miss Cleo. Backgrounds are beautiful, full of color and the comic book style works well for an adventure game in my opinion. The best of the background music is evocative of Gabriel Knight, while the worst is bland indy band. Worth snagging during a sale for 5 dollars, otherwise probably a pass.			"
