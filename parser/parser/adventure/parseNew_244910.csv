												The game is gorgeous.  Aesthetically, it feels a bit like a graphics card demo.  If you have a 3D monitor, you will want to use it here.In terms of gameplay, it manages to combine unique (and often challenging) puzzles with a powerful sense of tranquility and exploration.  The game has a very soft open, meaning that it is entirely up to you to discern what you're doing and why.  In a way, that leaves almost the entirety of the game vague, but more than anything this enhances the sense of immersion and discovery.  The game is NOT simple, and yet it never leaves you feeling pressured.  And, interestingly, long after you're likely to have forgiven the game's opening vagueness, it is compellingly explained.The story, which the game absolutely has, unfolds at an unusual pace that might have been created as a challenge to traditional story arc diagrams.  Without resorting to spoilers, I suggest you simply play and wait for it -- it works, and it works well.  Anyone who might claim that the game lacks a plot or makes dismissive comparisons to ""Dear Esther"" etc. didn't get very far.  The quiet, early game atmosphere counts for a lot.A beautiful, instant classic.			"

												Dang, this looked kinda cool. But I can't recommend buying it. Definitely not at 15 USD.I'm not even sure if I had fun. It felt a little tedious and the slowness of movement was padding for time, not atmosphere.The puzzles were a little fun, but a little on the easy side. The hardest aspect and quite fun at first was learning to read again.This game is GORGEOUS. Up there with the prettiest at the moment, like Ethan Carter. But the game is WAYYY too short, and there's little variance with the setting, and not much to explore. I beat this in two hours, and that was with getting stuck on the freaking drawers and spending a lot of time figuring out that one.Anyway, if you have doubts about buying this, probably don't. If you just love games with this sort of atmosphere and walking simulator puzzles/exploration, you might give it a try, but wait til it's on sale. The amount of content does not justify the price			"

												Pros: -Looks nice-The puzzles are entertaining first couple of times-The ending was okay.Cons:-Not well optimized. At times, slow and stuttering. I have GTX980 and the rest.-No customizable control-No running-No FOV adjustment. Gives me horrible headache after 15 minutes.-Puzzles are no longer puzzles very shortly. Repetitive.-It's not a complete game and more like a diploma work or demo or thereabouts.Overall: It's worth about $5, not $15. Not recommended at this price.Addition:Excuse me,  but for for $15 and as a FINAL release game, I should not have to use command line at all, to change common settings!			"

What is it?Homesick is a narrative-style indie game that sits somewhere between The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and Dear Esther (but with considerably more 'game' than the latter).  Your objective is no more than to find out what happened, why you are there and how to escape by a small amount of puzzle-solving and decyphering of cryptic code to reveal what happened.  Homesick is a short game and mostly entails you unlocking access to various areas that form one floor of an abandoned apartment block and eventually piecing together the story before finding your escape.  How long is it?The game will take no more than 3-5 hours if played thoroughly (that is: solving all the puzzles and then, after decyphering the remainder of the code, backtracking to read all the pages and letters you were unable to read earlier in the game in order to properly piece together what happened.  If you don't backtrack, you're probably looking at an hour less.  Whether or not it offers replayability is a tough one.  I can imagine I will play it again much further on in time, but of course will remember what needs solving and when, so will likely just play it just to repeat the experience in the same way I might reread a good book.Is it scary?No, but it is haunting atmospherically and can feel a little tense at times (in the nightmare sequences).  The bleakly beautiful music score creates a melancholy backdrop to your waking hours shuffling through decay and detritus of a building's former existence.  The visuals are superb as is the music.  Minor spoiler if you like to know about anything scaremongering at all: there is one minor jump-scare at the very end of the game, but it's not one of those where you scream and drop whatever happens to be in your hands at the time.  Even if you're a self-confessed gaming-wuss like me, you'll be fine.  Is it difficult?It's about on a par with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter in terms of difficulty, perhaps a little simpler.  The few non-code puzzles are easy enough to solve after a bit of thought and logic - especially if you use audio as well as visual clues.  The code decyphering is fun, and you will have decyphered it fully by the time you finish the game - even if you think you're struggling at the beginning (trust me on this one - you'll nail it).Anything not to like?Not really.  Anything I didn't like initially transpired to have a very good reason behind it.  These ranged from pace, to camera views and areas of accessibility - but ALL had reasons (ie deliberate by design), so if you find yourself grumbling about this or that, bear in mind that there is likely a very good reason for it.  The only gripes I had beyond these were the somewhat unwieldy inventory system (would have been easier to have a popup screen to click the required item rather than scroll through each until the correct item was equipped) and I missed the sound effects that might have accompanied my movements as I shuffled through debris, trod on papers and such (just scraping and crunching sounds - the usual stuff).  But they are minor and petty, and are no reason not to enjoy the game itself.In summaryIf you enjoy short, narrative driven games with a bit of mystery and puzzle-solving, and think exploring the ruins of abandoned buildings is a bleak but moving experience, then you will enjoy this game greatly.  I hope the developer gives us further, similar experiences in the future.  In the meantime, this little game deserves to occupy a small space in your library.			"

												(Based on a review code I got from the developers.)I have to say that this is one of the best games I've played in a long time: it's definitely the best new game I've played this year. Playing it filled me with a vague sense of trepidation, but also an overwhelming need to explore and to find out where I was, why I was there and what my purpose was in that place, if I even had one. The puzzles rely on real world logic, so they're quite straightforward and uncomplicated, and I didn't wish they presented a bigger challenge, because to me, it doesn't seem like Homesick is the kind of game that focuses on brain challenges: it's all about exploration, and the puzzles (and their solutions) are just a way of helping you better explore the place around you. The way most of them leave a mark on the environment was amazing to witness: it feels so satisfying to solve something and watch its result bloom around you, an explosion of colour in a landscape almost entirely devoid of all colours that aren't blinding white or washed out grey. The atmosphere in Homesick is exceptional, too, thanks largely to the soundtrack that impressed the pants off of me. It would be an entirely different game without it, which is easy to realise when you're solving one of the puzzles that requires almost complete silence, and you realise how much you miss the music. Some people have complained about the game being 'too short' - I think it's the perfect length, because the pacing is done just right and no part of the game feels too short or too long, but rather it lasts exactly as long as it needs to.No spoilers, but after playing through the game and reading all the documents etc. that I found on the way, the ending left such an emotional impact on me that I cried, not because I was sad, but because I felt sort of... at peace, perhaps, for the game ending the way it did. I can't describe it, it was a mixture of relief and happiness, but it was also bittersweet because of everything that I knew and everything that had preceeded it. I've felt a LOT of different emotions playing games, but never quite something like this. It was amazing. And yes, I think it does have replay value, despite being linear and short, because this is a story I'd like to experience more than once.			"

**Note: I love games like Vanishing of Ethan Carter and Gone Home, if you do not like these games, you will probably not like this one**The first thing I noticed about the game was how freaking beautiful it is. The last thing I noticed was also how beautiful it is. The game is just a joy to look at the entire time, I wanted to take a screenshot every  time I turned a corner (and often times I did) just because of how captivating each bit of environment was in the game. Whether it was the stark blasts of white light leaking through windows or it was the shocking amount of wallpaper peeling off the walls, everything is built with such detail and is the obvious result of a lot of effort from the developer. Environments are spectacular, and so are the bits and bobs of info and story you will find in them. I would go into the story more, but I would rather not spoil it, part of what makes this game worth playing is discovering the story for yourself, so I will let you do that.But before you do enter the halls of ""Homesick"" I must warn you that if you are not a fan of games like ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter"" or ""Gone Home"", this is not for you. Most of the game consists of simple puzzles that are solved with either very logical solutions or kind of out of the blue. But there is one paticular section towards the end of the game where the game gets the balance between mind numbingly simple and oddly aloof right, and it finally feels like you are doing something fantastic that also makes sense.The game has flaws, specifically the ""game"" part of ""Homesick"", but it gets so much stuff right. ""Homesick"" is a tour through a meticulously built set of rooms that have this oppresive sadness to them but I always had to turn the next corner. Play ""Homesick"" if you want to see a game made with a lot of heart and double the talent.			"

												Stunningly rendered, the waking world has a thick atmosphere of brooding and lingering dust.  Books, pages and photographic slides litter the defunct and decaying apartment building - hinting of history, of the people who once dwelled within these corridors of plaster and peeling wallpaper.   Somber music punctuates the melancholy as you explore the modern ruin seeking answers: what happened, where did everyone go, why am I still here, and why is the sunlight so painfully bright?   Some of the writings and pictures I found rummaging through the kippleized environment spoke of answers to come.   Asleep, the world is transformed into a shadowy nightmare version of itself.  The unconscious world is a place of frantic, terrorized sprinting as the darkness aggressively moves in to gobble you up in its hellish maw.   The puzzles are well-thought-out, logical, and fluid; meshing perfectly with the environment.   It’s feels less like coming to a “puzzle section” like in some games, and more like creatively seeking out ways to move around the environment.   This is what I liked about Homesick, the atmosphere, the mystery, the logical puzzles, the tip-of-the-iceberg world building that promised something more; a reward for pushing further into the game’s brooding depths.  The game didn’t deliver.   I’ve clocked about three hours in the game and I can tell you without exaggeration that 80% of that time was spent staring at books trying to decipher their script.   (I managed to work out most of the alphabet, the key I scribbled down in a notebook lacking only the ciphers for Q and X).   After about 30 minutes of actual gameplay and head-scratching, Homesick abruptly ends with no answers, no story, and what amounts to a cheap jump-scare and a vague sense of “paternal-ness”, for lack of a better word.   Homesick feels like a project that someone did a lot of work on, felt strongly about, and obsessed over for a while, but got tired of producing 10% of the way through, polished it up, and slapped a half-hearted ending on it.   I bought the game on sale, so I’m not upset that I spent money on it.  But the game is in no way worth the $15 USD price tag.  My recommendation is mixed.  But since I have to pick yes or no, at this price the answer is no, I would not recommend this title.   "

												Homesick is exploration, solving of environmental puzzles and learning about the background story of the game and the character you play. As promised it perfectly brings together the good things of the Point&Click Adventure genre with First-Person-3D-Graphics (where actually only The Vanishing of Ethan Carter did a decent job so far). The puzzles are logical, brooding yet not too difficult. It is at times a bit creepy (in nightmare mode), but you should't expect a horror adventure per definition. What you also shouldn't expect is interaction with other characters, as Homesick obviously plays in a solitude setting.There are some puzzles and other things that really impressed me, for example the piano you see in the screenshots that is operational (which I have never seen in a fully 3D game) and of course the extraordinary detailed and beautiful graphics (usually only known from real old-school First-Person-P&C Adventures in 2D, like Scratches or Dark Fall: Lost Souls), especially while keeping in mind that this game is essentially made by only one person. The soundtrack perfectly accentuates the mood of the game, while it isn't something I would like to listen to as stand alone. But that's absolutely not a bad thing, as music can either be very good background music (like here) or if it works too good for itself there is the risk that it works distracting from the actual game.The play time may be be relatively short (mine is not realistic, as I've been a tester since the first alpha) but Homesick is a true experience if you are into games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter or maybe Gone Home.

Posted: May 15, 2016
Overview:Homesick is an Indie first-person 3D puzzle-adventure title driven by exploratory gameplay, environmental interaction, and an emotionally sensible narrative. The game has a focus on atmospheric surrealism, and is the first game developed by Lucky Pause on the Unreal Engine after a successful Kickstarter campaign. It is a relatively short game, spanning about four hours. The game deals with sensitive themes, and manages to grasp everyday life in a way that is both foreboding yet serene.Story:You wake up, and your first and most important clue is half a drawing of a child next to some blue flowers. Homesick lacks anything close to a dialogue, what it doesn’t lack is information sprawled throughout the game’s world (a building), all there for you to decipher so that you can deduce what happened that left the inside of a building in such decay. Any text that you might come across -be it a book or a loose piece of paper- is in something that appears to be code or a foreign language; in the last puzzle you are able to decipher these and turn them all into proper letters. That progression encourages the player to turn back and revisit the previously explored places, and in doing so, revealing the lives of the people that resided in the building along with what catastrophic event left the building in its current shape.Gameplay:The gameplay consists of exploring a decaying building and interacting with various aspects of its environment. During the day you can go nearly everywhere you want, but cannot stand too close to the windows because you are hypersensitive to sunlight. When you go to sleep you have nightmares, these consist of darkness seeping and dripping upwards from the floor; you have to try to keep moving so that it doesn’t swallow you and wake you up, which prevents you from further progress. Parts of each puzzle are done during the day and other parts during the night. I will not mention the puzzles as to not spoil any of the story, but I will mention that they are satisfyingly challenging without being frustratingly difficult. To solve each puzzle you will have to explore and search, as well as interact with as many things as you can.As I mentioned above, a big part of the gameplay is picking up and reading texts laying around the building. There are books, letters, and newspapers from which to acquire information.Visual:Okay, this is where the game shines brightest (figuratively AND literally).This is one of the most photorealistic games I’ve had the pleasure to play. What little animations the game has are done well. All the environments and every object in them are modeled extremely well, but most of all it’s the textures that make this game a truly and strikingly impressive feat, and an absolute joy to look at. Here are some of the many screenshots I took of the game, the third of which is my personal favourite:

Something I’d like to add about the visuals, the game is relatively customizable for its genre. It has console commands, where you can change your FOV and how fast you move, to name a couple of its features. Another thing that is completely worth mentioning is the built-in camera; if you press ‘F4’ while playing it will save a screenshot that is double the resolution you’re playing at (this is the reason my screenshots are at 4K resolution).Sound:Homesick has a soundtrack that goes very well with the atmosphere and ambience that Lucky Pause is trying to achieve, courtesy of Heather Schmidt. The music has a little bit of a relaxed acoustic style to it, with a hint of classical. Other than the amazing soundtrack the environmental sounds -such as doors opening and closing, keys jingling, or file cabinets opening and closing (and falling over)- are also done very well. The true MVP in sound for this game though, is the soundtrack, hands down.Final Thoughts:I saw this game on the Humble Store[www.humblebundle.com] during its spring sale. I decided to buy it because the game looked particularly appealing, with its great visuals and almost-psychedelic nightmare scenes it was something I felt I couldn’t pass up. It was a good decision, I absolutely loved this game. The two most enjoyable parts of the game were the graphics and the underlying story behind the game. I felt that Lucky Pause conveyed a story about a man-made natural disaster that resulted in the end of many people’s lives extremely well. Not only that, but the experimentation with other themes such as people and their everyday lives, it moved me; the politically charged contents of the newspapers (which are central to the narrative) are also food for thought. There’s nothing more I could ask of this game, it absolutely blew my expectations out of the water and delivered a wonderfully emotional experience, with great puzzles to boot. Lucky Pause should pat themselves on the back for making such a positively melancholy game, and I give a standing ovation to Barrett Meeker and his dog.Liked this review?

												What a game. I was expecting a lot more similarities to Dear Esther when I started playing this but my god has it exceded my expectations. I thought Dear Esther was a nice concept but it lacked basic gameplay, which I found to be a bit of a shame.Sure, there is not a lot here, the puzzles are basic and simple and the focus lies heavily on your own interest in the world as a player and your love of exploring a mysterious world. Nevertheless, I enjoyed every minute of it because it is just creepy enough for me to enjoy it (Not a horror fan..) and the music and story makes this a very unique experience. Well balanced between the relaxing daytime explorations and the nighttime stress of running away from dark creepy sticky looking blobs. The ending was amazing and it surprised me even though I though I had it figured out completely. Also, because I know now what happens, I kind of want to play through again and discover all the little hints I missed! One of the best games I played all year. Great experience, great atmosphere, good game. I recorded me playing this for the first time, so if that is something you enjoy watch the series and let me know what you think :)Part 1:

												Well, that was absolutely fantastic.  It's not a super-long game, but it's also not super-short; it gives you just enough time and detail to piece together a lovely narrative without getting bogged down with too many red herrings.  There are a few diversions, mainly to be found in the ""bonus"" manuscripts, but they mainly provide a light palate cleanser in between stretches of growing dread.And yes, the game is creepy.  And it's creepy in a way that's engineered purely by scenery and mood.  Most of the game is actually rather peaceful; it's just that you KNOW something is terribly wrong (obviously), and you keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.  It's just a question of how and when that will happen.The puzzles, wonder of wonders, were all common sense.  There was not one instance of ""tie this string to that eggbeater while the moon is in the seventh house, and lo, the door will be opened.""  If at any point I said, ""Huh, I wonder if I can do this...?"" the answer was yes, yes I could.The music is just phenomenal.  I never got tired of it, and it was just eerie enough (those breathless gasps underscoring the strings!) that despite its tranquility, it completely fit.The only thing that I would list as a possible con is that, well, there's a Message behind the game.  And I have to say Message (with the capital M), though if it was a little less heavy-handed, it would have been merely a Plot Point.  Did you like Little Inferno in spite of its Message?  Then you'll like Homesick.  (And no, it's not the same Message.)All in all an absolutely enjoyable title and a great way to spend an evening!			"

												So just got the game mostly because it was one of those explorer indie games where you try to figure out whats going on by completing puzzles and paying attention to EVERYTHING. My bias for puzzle games will show, but I think it is really interesting. Without spoiling anything, you get thrust into everything and are forced to stumble a bit before you get the game makers logic. Little clunky at first but I soon got the hang of it and really started enjoying it. To put it simply the game has an odd, but neat way of making you enjoy the slow and pretty way of exploring everything.			"

												first off: i DO enjoy these kind of games. call them walking simulators, interactive pieces of art, experimental atmospheric demos,... whatever. homesick falls in line with games like ""dear esther"", ""gone home"" and even more so ""the vanishing of ethan carter"". even though this has more game-mechanics than most of the mentioned games, it's still all about the journey. you will have to be patient and let yourself get into the mood for something like this. if you can, then you are in for a treat. as the pictures show this is a beautiful game and the sound and music are just as great.you will spend your time wandering around in an abondoned appartment-block trying to figure out what is going on. the game gives you hints as what you should be doing, but rather subtlely so. you will have to take it slow (since you can't sprint that's easy) and make sure you pay attention to every detail. once you figure out how things are done you will be satisfied with solving the puzzles and advancing.i had 2 hours of gameplay out of this and even tho more content would have been appreciated i'm not dissappointed by the ending. admittedly: the game ends rather abruptly, but in a way that's fits the concept and will have you thinking about the world and characters presented for a bit after you are done playing.as for the pricetag: i got it for 10,- euros and i'm perfectly fine with that. it's basically like a movie - an enjoyable as well.if you are in for something different, slowpaced and artsy that will make you think about it: go ahead.if the above sounds like a waste of time: better safe your money.

												I loved this game. The thing most people will complain about is the length, but I don't think it could have been longer without a bunch of needless padding. I might be getting dumber, though, because some of these puzzles gave me a lot more trouble than they should have. The visuals in this game deserve someone more eloquent than me to praise them. They are just unreal. Anyway, interesting puzzles, some of them really good, a fascinating and well presented story, and unbelievably gorgeous environments. I paid full price, and I don't feel cheated at all. YMMV. You really should be able to tell if this is something you'll enjoy.			"

												Homesick doesn't seek to make you terrified by shaking you with ghosts, zombies, or storylines meant to shock and disturb you. Homesick just wants to entice you with pretty scenery, puzzles that are so simple that they WILL go over your head (three hours of ""I don't get it! What? OH! Wow I feel so stupid!"") and then kick you in the gut within the last five seconds you're playing this game.It's beautiful and I love it. It's wicked and I love it.Homesick forces you to go in blind and refuses to tell you any of the plot because the written language is so alien to you as the main character. This gets remedied later, but you're left looking at photos and faded books while pondering why you're the only one left in this abandoned place. It's beautiful and it is creepy. If you have a love of urban exploring or enjoy following people who do this, you'll immediately love the setting in this game. The way that light is suddenly your enemy and that nightmares can give you a startling sort of solace is something noted early on, because learning to manipulate your nightmares is what will help you solve some of the puzzles you face.The light as an enemy/puzzle to solve really is something I have to repeat as something I loved. When I'm on my worst days as someone who is disabled from a condition, I get photosensitive. While the lighting effects do hurt (take note gamers this could give you a migraine), it's enough to replicate that feeling I get when I'm just trying to open my blinds. The sun is suddenly blaring while I'm simply trying to function. A game was able to recreate that feeling, even in just a tiny way. Kudos, really. You've won me over.I honestly forgot that this was a walking simulator with how the puzzles were set up. Everything made sense. I wasn't listening to innane dialogue rattle on and on and on. I just got to take my time and enjoy a story that was hinted at to be heartbreaking and at some points, scary for the people who once lived in that building. Each clue and each puzzle were tasteful and everything meshed perfectly. I cared about these named people who were long gone by the time I had begun my journey.This was a game to just take one's time with and it was three hour's well spent. Sure I probably spent a little too much time reading over things in the library or staring at photos, but I wanted to know more. Homesick gives you just enough story, leaves you wanting more, and ends with beautiful imagery swirling around you.I have to admit, the decoding system made things difficult and if I could have solved that earlier, it would have made things less stressful on me, but that would have eliminated a lot of tension and the suspense of finding out why the building was there and what it was for. However, I'd be worried that other gamers would lose interest by then and wouldn't think to go back and check to see the stories and get more hints to what happened. If that is my only complaint, that's probably it.Get this on sale. It's pretty short and you'll finish it in an evening. But if you like games like Dear Esther, The Path, Gone Home, etc, you'll probably like this. If you like staring at pretty scenery and forgetting you're playing a game, this is a perfect choice. If you like puzzles? Decent game with some simple puzzles you'll hate yourself in the morning for not getting.It was so pretty it hurt my eyes!			"

												I've followed this game since I saw it back in early 2013, and now it's releasing on Steam, I feel it's proper to express my feelers towards it. It's a touching and atmospheric game filled with challenging puzzles and nightmares (it's not a scary game at the least). Barrett and Morgan (the game's developers) have really poured their all into this one, showing us that the industry still has room for games like this, when we all thought they were dead. Pros/Cons stuff:Pros:-Challenging puzzles-Super atmospheric, graphics are A++-Great story line-Great soundtrackCons: -Challenging puzzles with little to no explanation on how to solveThat's literally it on cons. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful.			"

												I bought this game because it looked pretty and promising.  Sadly this was not the case.  While the graphics and music do provide an excellent environment the actual story and puzzles in the game are terrible.  The story falls completely flat not only in content but also has no effective progression.  While the game has a lot of readable content after you decipher the correct letters, the content itself is very two dimensional and leaves much to be desired.  Having progressed through a total of 4 rooms and completed each of their ""puzzles"" , if you can call them that, the player is then treated to an abrupt and worthless ending.  The overall effect being that the player went nowhere and has arrived at their destination of nowhere.  Pros:- looks nice :3 :D >: OCons:-weak story-exceedingly short game-overly simplistic puzzles-no reward for extensive searching-abrupt ending lacking closure-overpriced game			"

												The opening to the game is so peaceful and calm, just exploring and figuring out the puzzles at your own pace. And then, BAM - the nightmares start and the game becomes really intense. The contrast between the two modes of the game is really well balanced; after the frantic pace of the nightmares you really appreciate the calm awake time. I really like that the game allows you to explore and figure things out on your own. No tutorials or hand-holding makes the atmosphere of the game really immersive.I'm so intrigued by the mystery of the game and i'm looking forward to working through the puzzles and figuring out the story.

												I nice combination of puzzles and exploration.  Lots of stuff to discover and read that fills in a kind of background as to why you're in this abandoned building and what happened.  If you just play to get through the stages of the game, you'll miss a lot.  Wander around and look at newspapers, letters, books.  And on top of that, the environment and the 3D art is great.

												HOMESICK IS AN AMAZING GAME!!! You will love it whether you are an avid gamer or a newbie. Homesick is more than just a first person exploration game. It is an emotional and sensory experience that touches on deep themes of identity, environmentalism, fear and hope. I was constantly enthralled and intrigued by the brilliantly crafted puzzles that drive the deeply personal storyline forward. Each new area of the game presents a unique character, with its own amazing score. Everything feels foreign, yet familiar; haunting, yet hopeful.			"

												This game is so beautiful you'll constantly catch yourself stopping in the middle of your puzzle to just admire ANOTHER beautiful part of the environment. The music is so ethereal and haunting at the same time seriously, this sound track is A-mazing. I love how you switch from this beautiful serene type of  environment which in itself is amazing that they did so in a broken abandoned building but then when you go to sleep you switch to this nightmarish world where you cannot stop moving or else this dark black ink will swallow you hole D: I do kind of wish there was a journal keeping track of progress and what your next task is only because it would help me personally from getting lost on puzzles, lol. That is the only thing that I wish had been different other than that this game is well worth the 15 to me. Its stunning, immersive, fun to play and super captivating. A++			"

Very smart but simple puzzles, not much of a narrative but you kind of understand the story as you go along, I kind of like the way it leaves it up to you to work out what has happened and not explain everything to you. The graphics left me stunned at times, they honestly look photo realistic to me and the lighting is fantastic. If you want a relaxing but engaging game to play for 2-3 hours then get this, honestly its well worth playing.			"

												Homesick is a point and click adventure game with a focus on minimal design and immersion. It is a story you have to dig through, in a world that presents subtle clues. You have to like methodical exploration to enjoy it. The slow pace and lack of “GO HERE, DO THIS” instructions will turn off a lot of players. I almost gave up on it, until I figured out what the game wanted me to do and sent me into a nightmare world of darkness. If you need to read a walkthrough to beat it, you might as well just skip it. The journey is the goal with this title. It’s slow, not always easy to understand, but has amazing atmosphere and is well done for what it is.

												I bought the game because I love the overall feeling of it. I am a big fan of modern ruins, reclaimed by nature. And this game gives me just that. The game overall feels like a Dream. You end up in a strange world that you have just woken up in. And you have no clue where you are but there are things around that look interesting. You find clues as to what to do and explore a modern ruin of a tall building, all by yourself.Why do I say that it feels like a dream? The overall setting already feels very much like a dream.- You open your eyes in a world you dont know, yet you go with it and just do what you can/want.- You take a look around and do what you can to get further into the building.- Somehow the light does not grant you acces to the path it shines upon which is intentional.- But when Night falls the light no longer blocks your way.- Now off to the next room to find out more about this strange and unknown place.One thing before I end the review.This game is not easy and it certainly does not hold your hand.The game gives you hints, clues and pictures as to what you are looking for. But what you are looking for is sometimes different. This means that the clue you just found has something to do with it and that is where your brain comes into play. Think. Think. Think. And think again. Search everywhere and think about ever logical and maybe not logical outcome. It will most certainly help you.For those that like the athmosphere of a modern ruin, reclaimed by nature, this game is certainly for you. Plus you get to uncover a mystery and solve, maybe not too simple, puzzles. I can say that after only playing for an hour, I have gotten what I wanted out of the game. I couldnt want more than what I wished for. A game, set in a modern building which became a ruin over time and was reclaimed by nature. That plus the feeling of a dream makes this game perfect and I still wish that we would get a full on game similar to this one, with open world similar to Fallout. Maybe this wish will be granted one day.			"

												I'd like to reccommend this game. I really would. But I can't.While the storyline is intriuging, the game is painfully short, even when taking your time to explore every nook and cranny and reading everything.In addition, there are several points where the soloution to a puzzle is very counter-intuitive or you have to do something that wouldn't have occured to you without reading a guide. (Like typing to interact with the letter blocks, or which direction to turn the valves in the gym.)My final complaint is that the ending needs serious work, both in storyline, and physical gameplay. (In particular, the poor design of the mirror scene really ruined the experience.)All in all, if this was an early beta of a game that would be further tested and expanded, I would really enjoy it. However, it's already finished, and quite frankly, so am I.TL;DR: The game doesn't justify the cost, and it still needs work that will never happen.			"

												I received a Steam key for Homesick after I forgot, I even backed it. I thought to myself 'well, I backed this game when this Kickstarter thing was still pretty new to me and I had too much money on my hands, so I backed every single project I though that looked pretty. Also, back in the day these ""Walking Simulators"" were trending so of course, indie developers try to hop on the success.' I even mixed it up with the similar sounding ""Gone Home"" a few time, a game (yes, I call it a game) I actually enjoyed.What I remember about Homesick were its beautiful visuals. I don't think, I have seen such astonishing realistically crafted surroundings in any game so far. Well, I expected this game to be mediocre, good at best. But what I got was an emotionally touching experience I haven't had so far in game coupled with the promised, excellent visuals.The game follows the footsteps of the aforementioned Gone Home or Dear Esther but with a bit more puzzle solving, that can get tricky some times. However, these gameplay elements are very basic and easy to solve. What's really important is, how you slowly unravel the past of the place where you live as well as your own. What I loved about this game is that you do everything yourself. One thing, I didn't particularly like about Gone Home for example were the seemingly randomly played audio diary entries. While these told the player what happened, they also totally broke the immersion of the what I though was the intended feeling.There is no such dialogue in Homesick. And that's for the better. If you, like me, enjoy emotional experiences, many downplay as ""walking simulators"" with a heart touching backstory and mysteries to be unraveled, this game is for you. Also, if you just like very, very pretty looking games, you might still like it.VERY highly recommended.			"

												Summary: A gorgeous unspoken narrative with solid puzzle gameplay undermined by technical flaws, slowness and especially how it asks too much of its player to fully appreciate it.It looks beautiful and intriguing, it's got decent reviews and those who like it are glowing in their appraisal. So why isn't everyone talking about Homesick? Well it's basically because games like Homesick can't afford to be too slow, technically flawed or in some way inaccessible, and unfortunately Homesick is all of those things. If you've ever looked at pictures of Pripyat and seen beauty in it, you'll probably dig the aesthetic a lot, and Homesick sticks to small environments so it can render in lush detail the cracked walls and fallout specks, to the tune of a somber, memorable piano theme. It almost completely works, but you can still see rooms load in front of you and the occasional graphical seam, which just shouldn't happen in a game like this. Regardless it's a joy to simply look at for a while, and then you have to set about finding out how to proceed. Most of the puzzles can be worked out from environmental clues and I wasn't stuck for too long with these, they were satisfying to do and didn't take much guesswork. The central issue of Homesick concerns the notes scattered everywhere written in a cipher. Most are optional and don't require your engagement, but one puzzle requires you to painstakingly work out the cipher and then apply it to a puzzle. Now, as someone interested in language I found this quite fun and satisfying, but as I was enjoying myself I knew that to many this would be a stopping point. It's not complicated, but it is a slow, slow process exacerbated by your character's subhuman gait. Once the cipher is cracked it's possible to go around translating all the notes in the game, but this asks FAR too much of the average player, especially since many of those notes are very dense. In fact, that such a wealth of actual written knowledge exists alongside Homesick's minimalist, environment-based narrative undermines the experience for the user.Homesick could have been a beautiful, self-contained, wordless experience that tells its story with feel and pictures, leaving its world with most of its questions unanswered. But the answers could be there, hidden under all that cipher; the price of translating it all and finding out more is simply too high, so the average gamer will cope with the 'unfinished' feeling the game leaves them with. That's not the feeling the game should be engendering.I actually enjoyed my time with Homesick and I'm glad I played it, which makes my conclusion complicated. Visually it's a game of rare beauty. It has some solid puzzling that makes you engage with your environment, and you might well enjoy it. But particularly at full price Homesick doesn't deliver on that satisfaction that it promises and simply won't please everyone.			"

												“For symmetry is not invariably demanded, as even ruins are still beautiful” - Schopenhauer The sublime beauty in somberness is an interesting tone that many games seem to have taken a liking to these days. And how they reach this somber tone by dilapidation is even more common, running the gamut from post-apocalyptic games adhering to more eschatological worldviews and the games like Homesick, that uses it as a symbol for something a little more personal. The world is as always, but uncannily in distress when in our sudden awakening from the slumber of ignorance we notice its despair. Such is the way Homesick presents itself, as a distressed world we have to manipulate to adapt to psychically and better. Or as stated in the history of the game's development on Lucky Pause's website: “figuring out how to continue to grow when the world is falling apart around you“.This is what constitutes the aesthetics and tone of Homesick. Degradation, dilapidation, disaster, world as inhabitable, world as impossible to come to terms with. Puzzles that you solve lead you into news articles in lost languages, but it being a newspaper and newspapers being what they usually are – fear-mongering, attention-grabbing, often elucidating the pain-stricken and the suffering – serves its purpose as pointing to the same type of cynical outlook on the world. This is further made clear by photos found in the game, picturing different natural disasters and industrial monstrosities. Is the world that bad? The corporate politics and industrialization of the world seem to worry the creator of this game. Progression and positives boils down to fulfilling the potential of germinal flora (watering plants), progression lies in moving on the obverse side of pollution and general destructiveness of our beloved, morally just nature. In reality the world is a lot more complex. Nature is not nature unless for the knowing subject. The knowing subject interjects moral into an indifferent nature and becomes outraged, reacting accordingly. . . but is this the right way to go about things, or better: to think about things? To revel in indifference, not making equivalent the flesh of man and animal, or even worse, of man and plant, is in a way more comfortable, less existentially terrifying, but at the same time impossible as a being of morality and poetry. Even though the game puts forth a rather naive ecological message, I appreciate it due to it being put in a quaint way, with some piquant moments of sheer beauty being emitted from every pore this game has.Moreover, the models and texture qualities are truly great. From the flaky paint on the walls, to the buckles of water-damaged ceilings, to the wallpaper's bleak and torn appearance, it all looks crisp and detailed enough to feel powerful, to feel like you are in a world truly on the verge of collapse. There is no glaring issue with the looks of the graphics or textures, as far as I am aware of. Although I did manage to get out on a balcony I wasn't supposed to get out on, which subsequently let me see a black textureless wall above. This also forced me to reload the game, since I got stuck out there. But the saves are frequent enough, and progress once made is easily enough retread, so that this was not too frustrating. I find it is always nice to see simple mechanics but complex puzzles in an absolutely beautiful setting. Where gamecreators find the balance aesthetics and mechanics, finding creative solutions to making puzzles interesting despite a lacking set of mechanics available. While the balance is good, I do find the walking to be tiny bit too slow for my taste, making especially some of the deciphering of the language in the game frustrating (it required a lot of walking to and fro between blocks and texts so to verify the correctness of your decoding). Beyond this, and in general, the puzzles are fairly logical and straight forward. Some boil down to trial and error, perhaps due to my stupidity, perhaps due to the design of the puzzle, but there are possibilities of such solutions being the only way forward. Other than that, there is an interesting contrasting of day and night, nightmare and waking life that through gameplay convey the same message the aesthetics and objects in the game do. Or at least plays into it slightly, according to my “reading” or interpretation. When a game has been made conscientiously enough for this mirroring between mechanic and aesthetic/setting to occur, you have to give kudos to that sort of effort. Which is what I am doing now. Some things could have been explained better as well, but were not too difficult to find out, and I would recommend reading some guides for the game just to get some hints as to what you are supposed to do. If you press escape you will see controls, but not all controls used in the game, or all the mechanics that are at play, so keep that in mind and don't feel discouraged to look at guides or whatever other source of information that would help you progress mechanically. In between these larger themes is a more direct story, that I more or less neglected in this “review”. I don't think it should be spoiled, but it is foreshadowed in a nice manner with obscured effects and perhaps through another interpretation of the game's look. They do both play into each other as well, but still distinct and operate on different planes, both in terms of scope and complexity. I am staying deliberately vague here to avoid spoiling anything, and with that in mind there is no real point in delving deeper into the story or symbolism at this moment.So Homesick is a good game, it is interesting, perhaps a bit shattered (not fittingly) in its scope or ambition, where social critique and personal story go not so much hand in hand as side by side, giving occasional glances each other's way just to make sure they are still there. But nonetheless, the game has substance, it is enjoyable and beautiful. It is worth the purchase and it is worth your time, it is worth thinking about; even if the things you'll think about are not necessarily as enjoyable or wonderful as the portrayal of them graphically.

												This game is beautiful. Down-right beautiful.I've been a tester for this game since the beginning, and I've had nothing but positive things to say about it since then. This is a wonderful example of storytelling without dialogue. I can tell you that you'll get lost in the scenery much too often! I find myself taking screenshots for personal wallpapers.As for the story, you're wondering around trying to figure out what happened to this institution you've been supposedly staying in. What kind of institution it is, however, is the question. You can get ideas of where you are through pictures you find in cabinets or reading documents. It really is a mystery up until the end, because they give you just enough information to give you ideas, but not enough until the end to know for sure.The puzzles are quite challenging, but very rewarding. I wouldn't say they're very difficult, but they definitely do make you go ""Aha!"" multiple times!Overall, this game makes you feel good all throughout the experience. It's not very long, but the bitter-sweet story is worth a play or two. I'd say playing through two or three times will give you the full experience due to so much reading material (in which you have to learn how to read in the game, so backtracking is a big part).I totally recommend this game to any Gone Home fans or fans of similar games. The developers are some of the nicest people I've ever spoken to, and they deserve every penny!			"

												Of all the walking simulators I've played this one is probably the silliest.It's incredibly beautiful and creates a consistent, enchanting atmosphere—which is indeed the baseline that's required of a walking simulator. The cryptography puzzle is a great idea that highlights the decently non-linear level design (for such a short game) with its shortcuts circling back; after deciphering the code, the player is encouraged to double back and explore the previous areas once again, this time being able to read and learn more about what went on. It's a great and inventive use of the game's limited resources....But this is also where Homesick fails, I'm afraid. Knowing that in gaming less is often more is a tough wisdom to accept; few developers do. As a result, they try to add more content to their games without realising that it actually leaves their creations emptier than they would have been without it. The texts in Homesick are boring and bland, somehow leaving the player with less story than they had before reading them; at least without those notes (that somehow completely evaded the fire that had destroyed everythng else, must be made of titanium or something) the player could imagine a story to their taste based on audio and visual cues.And it would probably be a better story than the boring one we ended up with. Not to mention the poorly-executed TWEEST at the end.I may sound nitpicky, but for such a short game with such a price tag, every aspect must be brilliant for it to be worth it. And I think Homesick would have been a much better game if it just mesmerized us with brilliant lighting and dilapidation—and left it at that.			"

												If you're looking for frenetic, fast-paced action, this game is not for you. In fact, if you don't know the meaning of ""frenetic,"" this game is not for you.In short, this game is gorgeous from start to finish, assuming you can even get to the finish. Keep in mind, this entire game -- in it's full state -- was programmed/designed by a single guy. ONE man made all of this. Not a team. That in and of itself is awe-inspiring.This is a game that gets poor reviews from people who mistake ""video game = 500+ hours of gameplay."" You're playing a totally-interactive movie with a blink-and-you-miss-it storyline (Yes, there's a story, if you pay attention to the lore scattered about every room.) Personally, I was glad to get a chance to sit down and discuss the game with it's creator, Barrett Meeker, which you can watch here at http://www.twitch.tv/opnoobsonline/b/666549999.For the purchase-price, here's what you get:The full soundtrack (standard MP3 album value, $8.99 - Check Amazon and you'll see this isn't a markup) and the game itself ($6.00) = $14.99Seriously. It's a frigging $6.00 experience with a haunting and well-worth-the-price soundtrack. Stop complaining, people, and just enjoy this piece of fiction. I'll have a full review in the coming days on http://www.opnoobs.com.			"

												Despite the lack of story there’s still a lot to make Homesick worth playing. The music is hauntingly beautiful and I could just sit there for hours listening to the soundtrack. It adds such a somber tone to an already depressing environment that it can’t help but invoke feelings of being alone in a harsh world. And the building itself is so realistic that I practically felt like I really was trying to get out of a bad situation. The ending itself also leaves lots of questions unanswered. Which in a way is a good thing as it’s got me thinking as to what all happened and why I was there to begin with.http://cliqist.com/2015/06/01/feeling-homesick-atmospheric-adventure-game/ "

												Homesick is not a game, per se, and it is not really even a story.  It's more of an old photograph or painting that needs some cleaning to reveal the full picture.  There are a couple puzzles to solve in order to go forward, but I found them to be fairly easy.  The biggest sticking point for me is the written language you see -- just know it will take a while and a little bit of work to figure it out (simple substitution code).  It's not until close to the end that it is spelled out for you (almost literally).I found this to be a very touching experience.  The rendering is beautiful in its decay.  Paired with the music and some visual hints, it tells a very personal melancholy cautionary tale.  But while I liked it very much, I'd recommend waiting for it to go on sale.			"

												EDIT: after sleeping on it, I would not recommend this unless you are both a fan of the genre and you like the aesthetic. It's got a fair few flaws and you'd probably be better off with another walking sim. Original review below.It's a very pretty walking sim. It is quite short, in terms of the (admittedly flawed) time/£ comparison, it's the same ratio as an actual film, if that matters to you. It is fairly understated, most things are alluded to obliquely until the final twist. It has a nice use of colour in the level layout, even if it is a bit drab to look at generally.Honestly, if the creators read this, I understand the reasons to set the walking speed so slow, but you have erred on the wrong side of the line there. Also how on earth is anyone supposed to get the final puzzle except by accident? Archimedes called and he's very disappointed in your grasp of displacement. And I'm all for not feeling like my hand is being held, but it could have done with more feedback for the incremental parts of the puzzles; label the valves and light switches open/close, on/off, little things like that. Everything being so far apart with the walking speed being so slow made trial and erroring the light switch and radiator puzzles a chore. I did love the cipher puzzle though, then going back and reading everything I'd missed. "

												I highly recommend Homesick. There is fantastic art work and music. It takes a little while to get the concept of the clues, and the day and night add another level to the puzzle. There are clues everywhere, and once you discover how to read the papers and books found in every room, you are told a compelling story as you find your way out.			"

												A highly enjoyable and beautiful to behold indie first person adventure game. It is similar to Dear Esther and it is relatively a short game, but it has solid gameplay (it's not a walking simulator) and a few very clever and challenging puzzles. It tells an interesting main story and a few side stories, that you'll have to discover as you explore the decrepit building switching between the real world and a nightmarish version of it. The music score which is included in the game's folder) is excellent and fits perfectly with the general mood of the game.  "

												Like Dear Ester, this game is more of a story than a game. However, it IS a game. The puzzles are pretty easy for the most part but they do require some intuition so they could turn challenging if you don't make the right ""leaps"". The graphics, music and story are all good. The story is a bit heavy handed but the message is certainly clear. My only real gripe is that the game is very short.In the end, if you like the atmospheric exploration I do recommend the experience, but due to the lack of length I would wait until it is under $10 dollars.

												I saw this game for the first time today. Looked awesome. Checked some vid's on it, got way exited and bought it! Started the game, LOVED IT!!, played some piano, fiddled with some mechanics (all fun!!) and then the game ended!! WTF?!? Where is the rest? What happend to the story? I had a real good feeling when I started this. I even made myself notes on the alphabet, so I could decipher the books, letters ect. If the price was half of what it is now, I would say it would be worth buying, even though it is very short. I got roughly 3 hours gameplay, with all my deciphering. But the pricetag as it is right now, it's not worth it. Sadly. I can only hope for future updates, so I can get a real ending for this storyline.			"

												I am the first to admit that I am a sucker for atmospheric games, Homesick is no exception. The setting is wonderfully realized, the music is soft and emotional, and the graphics are inspiring. The puzzles were intimidatingly difficult at first, but when I was eventually able to solve them it was all the more satisfying. The game is short, and while I did enjoy the story, I was left wanting to know more. If you like adventure games and are ok with playing a puzzle game without a sprint key give this game a shot.Pros:Setting, graphics, puzzlesCons:Short, somewhat stuttery(at all settings)8/10			"

												There are some pros and cons to this game but over all mostly pros. The biggest downside is other than wanting to see the gorgeous scenes again there is really no replay value. Once you've figured out most of the puzzles they don't change and a second run through can be accomplished in under an hour. However the game is very well put together and extremely atmospheric. The music fits well with the overall theme and the development of the story without any dialogue or outwright story telling it pretty great. I did not see the ending coming however and was plesantly suprised with how it wrapped up. Overall I'd say a short but sweet game that's worth playing but possibly better to buy on sale as it's not quite worth $15 USD with the current play time. 8.5/10			"

												Homesick is short (finished it in about 2.5 hours), narrative-driven, exploratory puzzle game taking place in a beautiful, detailed environment to a rich soundtrack. It puts you in the shoes of a man waking one day in a derelict building after what can only be assumed to have been some kind of destructive event. Explanations are light at first, as you must decypher the code used to read the notes, letters and newspaper clippings found in the area. It's a slow, pensive and (for the most part) peaceful journey to a bitter-sweet ending.			"

												I honestly don't recommend it.  This game plays exactly like Dear Esther (slow walking speed, no jump, and little in the way of useful interaction), except that it introduces nonsensical mechanics that take a while to understand.   You'll get stuck for minutes at a time, and every time you stumble upon what you're actually supposed to do, in retrospect it makes as little sense as it did before.  Why are there flowers?  Why do flowers allow you to progress forward?  There's no explanation for anything that happens (perhaps at the end, but I didn't get that far), and you don't feel adequately rewarded each time you figure something out.  Games like Amnesia will reward you with loot for figuring out a tough puzzle, but here, you're given nothing.  No story, no items, just ""proceed forward and get stuck on the next quirky puzzle"".Personally, if this game suits you, check out INFRA.  Also in the same vein.  Extremely slow plot progression, find keys, open doors, find more keys, open more doors, figure out where a thing is and put it in the slot, move on to the next area.  It can't even be compared to Myst.  At least in Myst you have those ""Aha"" moments when you finally solve a puzzle.  Here you just think ""wait, why did that work?  Why did I need to do that?""On the plus side, nice stylized graphics.  The screenshots will come out nice for sure.			"

This game is deeply imersive, beautifully polished in terms of graphics, oneiric while in light, nightmarish while in dark. You might notice that the darkness (world) is just a frame of reality, and the light (world) is just a sad remembrance of what happened after all those incidents. It's just sad, beautifully sad. And dead.The parts which you get stuck will be soon rewarded by the reading ability, if the game has a plot, it's in the notes. If you wanna to understand the history of this, read everything you may find scattered all around, yet will be a lot of questions, it's up to your imagination to conclude.The majority of people here crumbling about the game, of course, didn't manage to get past the puzzles (look for the hours on record). And of course didn't catch the idea of what is REALLY going on. Oh! A thing to say, as you enter the game and you see the blinding light and try to see what it has after it, you perceive you cannot go further, and there is an invisible wall hindering you of going through, and this is so frustating.. But wait for it, there is an explanation in the notes of why you cannot go any further into that light!The protagonist, he was. And he is not anymore. As soon as he discovers his true form - therefore - what happened to him, he can be free and walk into the real light. You play with nothing more than a lonely ghost wandering around trying to leave that building, probably the last place he was before demise.Just don't sink too much into the music and ambience, for it may cause you to cry.And yes, the name Homesick has EVERYTHING  to do with the game :')   "

The cube one in particular. The not so good:  When playing with a controller the elevator puzzle is almost impossible. The whole game is pretty short.  The conclusion: A very atmospheric first person puzzler. The graphics are gorgeous and some of the puzzle elements are very smart. Some people might say that the game is too short for its price, but I feel like it provides a very good and compelling experience, which, in the end, is what a good game is all about.You can see me playing here -

Very immersive.Cons:Puzzles are a little easy and the the game is bit too short.Overall:I really wish there were more games like this. This is a lovely piece of work. It would be nice to see some more content added or a sequel/prequel.			"

												I straight out loved this game. I'm the type of gamer who wants to do everything in a game, which is, in this game, quite important (I've actually gone through it all twice, just to pick up on everything). Unless you figure out not only the puzzles, but the things surrounding them, I don't think you can appreciate it fully. It is beautifully made, with lovely music and great atmosphere. Greatly recommended (but don't rush through it!).			"

												This little game is amazing in all points. Not only is this one of the most beautiful games I have ever played, but also a very touching and emotional deep experience. The whole environment will not tell, but really show you the story behind it and also leave some room for own interpretations. And hopefully it also might make you think about stuff around you a little different. The puzzles are neither too hard nor boring and very, very enjoyable. Even if you can finish it really quick, depending on how good you are with logic puzzles, it is more than worth the price. I have rather spend the amount Homesick asks for a short but enjoyable game than spend my money on a game twice as long I will not enjoy half as much. If you love puzzle games and want to explore a small but creative and detail rich world and story, please support the devs and buy it, you will not regret it.			"

Puzzles are entertaining and music is perfectly adjusted for mood and gameplay. The game is not long, but in a good way. There is a story here, an important story, and the developer doesn't waste any time telling it.			"

It has a gripping but very suddle story line and the puzzles are simple but complex at the same time. The graphics are stunning also. Overall I would very much reccomend getting it. The only issue I experienced was some motion sickness after playing for around an hour, but there are things you can do to fix that.			"

												What can I say about Homesick? That it is an exploration game? Yes, it is an exploration game. That it is a Puzzle game? Yep, that too. It is more than that though. It is a surreal environment heavy exploration puzzle game with a shade of horror. The need to make the waking and nightmare actions work together to pave a coherent path through to the end of each  ""level"".  I payed $16.99 Canadian and feel it was a good price. Highly recommended and can't wait to get the whole Let's Play up on my channel because I believe it's the perfect fit for me.			"

												Have you ever wondered why Disneyland is a better theme park than Six Flags? Why do people stand in line for 2.5 hours to sit in a floating boat for 5 minutes looking at animated pirates? Is not a fast rollercoaster with five loop de loops more exciting? Not necessarily. Herein lies the beauty of a game like Homesick. Anyone can cause an adrenaline dump in your brain by throwing a bunch of speed and action at you thus inducing a sense of excitement, but it takes a true artist to create a masterpiece that appeals to your intellect and emotions in such a way as to leave you breathless when the experience is over. It has been said several times that Homesick has stunning visuals. It certainly does, but in my experience, those stunning visuals served to immerse me into the story to the point that I do not even recognize them anymore. The puzzles are challenging enough to make you earn the ending, which I must say is quite a payoff! Homesick is a masterpiece of an experience. Breathtaking!			"

												Game took less than two hours to properly beat. There are no instructions, which usually I enjoy figuring things out on my own! But the walking mechanic is painfully slow so if you miss something, you can't run around and search for it. You crawl. Painfully slowly. The puzzles are somewhat repetitive, and the character decoder puzzle isn't until the very end so if you want backstory, you have to craaawl back through the game from the beginning to get all of the lore and vague backstory. Everything that happened before the game start is hinted at as opposed to outright explained. If the game was less than $5, I'd consider recommending it. But at $15, I cannot say it's worth the money.It's also a bit more creepy and unsettling than I was expecting, and there's a bit of  a jump scare at the very end. If you've heard of the uncanny valley when it comes to people, that was the other half of my issue with the scare. I'm still a bit unnerved from it.			"

												This is not a game you play and enjoy, this is more like art. It is relatively easy, the game is just 2-3 hours long. But I've enjoyed my journey through the game, not only because of the beautiful graphics (everything seems to be natural fitting, not placed or artifical) and the very nice piano play. Mostly, I've enjoyed the little stories told in the game.But some things weren't so good. First the movement. Why can't i walk a little bit faster? No sprinting required, I would miss everything of the game if I could run through it. But a little bit faster. And at some puzzles are little hint what to do. Only a little hint, I was very lucky with someones!All in all: If you want to see an other kind of games where the magic happens in your head and not on the screen, buy it.			"

												I like walking simulators and I would say that Gone Home and Firewatch are absolutely the best in the ""genre"", unfortunately I can't recommend Homesick.It is a pretty game with a nice although repetitive soundtrack, and some light puzzle solving.At first every piece of text is written in an unknown language, but halfway through the game there is a fun puzzle that allows you to be able to read everything. But when you go back and read all the text you passed by, you will be let down by what you find. The story is very minimal, and mostly relies on the player guessing what happened, and during the end there is a big reveal that is played as a shock, instead of used to further a story. Together with gameplay mechanics that make no sense in the world that the games takes place in, it feels half-finished.It is certainly not a bad game, but I would not recommend it at the current price of 9euro (40% off sale)			"

												This simply isn't worth the price of admission (I picked this up for $8.99). Most of the difficulty behind these 'puzzles' stems from a lack of opening context. However, once you've figured out the context and solved the first puzzle you're half way though finishing this very short game as each subsequent 'puzzle' isn't much more than a variation of the first. The story which is revealed as the game progresses just isn't that interesting or complex - this is nothing compared to something like the Talos Principle.  This game is pretty, but its also very short, hollow and unsatisfying.			"

http://www.luckypause.com/team/One of the best puzzle exploration art games for 2015, that statement itself speaks volumes since I have never found a art game which I have in fact particularly liked. But the three teamed developers down at Lucky Pause have really nailed it and delivered a highly polished, extremely rich in detail, emotional tugging, and thought inducing adventure.The objective of 'home sick' is at first vague other than the fact that you have awoken in a extremely run down building littered with books and torn pages filled with strange symbols. Eventually you realise that you need to unlock the secrets of what happened to everyone by finding solice in growing flowers, keeping the lights on in your nightmares and knocking down that next door that bars you from finding out those answers. You will need to teach yourself how to read again, if you are really to get to the core of the mystery.The game is mildly supernatural in that it attempts to explain what a ghost is, why they flicker breifly to the living, why they haunt or are confined to a location and what they need to do in order to move on. This side of the story is all told through graphical detailed art and by also using the art form to incorporate cleverly designed puzzles to convey hidden meaning and subtext.I say mildly supernatural, because it is only hinted and never spoken or conveyed through written language. On the other hand the accompanying main story of everyone in the apartment story and what eventuated to them all is clearly explained in the hundreds of written documents that showcase as a museum to a tragic event. Both stories somewhat tie in nicely in the end leaving you with a somewhat thought provoking and yet enjoyable experience.While the game is relatively short lasting only a few hours there is enough here to warrant a second play through and a solitary reflection of a time that was. It helps you understand how precious life is and how industrial dreams can quickly turn into nightmares as was demonstrated on Apr 26 1986 in the Ukraine.In final I would like to end this review with a simple 'Thankyou' to the developers. Who would have thought great inspirational games could have come from California? Where have you been all this time? The gaming art industry has been in a deep need of a great team like you for a long time!!! Look forward intently to your next work of great inspirational art. This game could do with achievements for those that like to get 100% and personally I would like to buy the truly magnificent musical score which accompanies this masterpiece. They are my only two critiques....

For me, the end was somewhat relieving and also scary in a way. Yet the game is too short which made me a little disappointed. I've completed the game in 3 hours period, it would have taken less if I hadn't double-checked some areas. So don't expect to have a long journey even lasting for a few days.			"

												**** Four StarsPros:I really enjoyed this game.  In spite of the pictures/videos it is NOT a horror game.  There are things (puzzles if you will) that you need to figure out how to do in order to progress.  They are challenging but not insurmountable.  You only get very subtle hints as to what you need to do.  There is no dialog but a hauntingly beautiful musical score.  It's hard to give you an idea of the game without giving away some of its secrets so I won't even try.    It's a fantastic feeling when you finally ""break the code.""Cons:The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars--this game is really short.  I finished it in 6.6 hours and most of that time was spent walking around trying out different ways to solve a puzzle.  And also ""reading"" a lot of things that weren't necessary to finish the game.  I'm not sure it has any re-play value.  Because it is so short, you're not going to forget what to do for very long.At the end of the day:I would buy this game again for its beauty, enjoyment and challenge . . . but I would probably wait for a sale.

												Homesick is a game where you explore an abandoned apartment building, and the story unfolds as you unearth new areas. While exploring you will uncover puzzles that are more logical than illogical, areas that have nearly photorealistic lighting and textures, and a story that will touch you. More than the player's story its the smaller stories covered in the game that are touching, and in some cases heartbreaking. To uncover the full story I would highly suggest solving all the puzzles, and while there isn't much help online this is a good thing. Once I got the back story of the aparment residents it all fell into a place, and it ended up being a touching exploration of lives past.Homesick is a game that needs to be experienced by gamers who are jaded, like most games that are coming out that get labeled ""walking simulators"" because there are things in these games that need to be seen and felt. While we have games that are AAA coming and going there are indie games like this... They spent hours and months working on this title that while short is full of heart and love to a story, to a fully realized world that is self contained, and great message.I know this is a kind of random review but its difficult to review it without spoiling it.

												Homesick is a hauntingly beautiful game where you explore the derelict and abandoned building you find yourself awaking in. You wander from room to room, searching for clues to the mystery of where everyone went, what happened, and who you are. Both the graphics and musical score are stunning and work together to convey the sadness of old, forgotten and abandoned places.The puzzles required to advance further in the building are well balanced, neither too simple nor too obnoxiously difficult. The pace of the game isn't rushed with combat or platformer-esque puzzles, instead you're free to meander and take in all the ambience (and Homesick has it by the bucket-load). The biggest drawback in the game would be the length: my playthrough took just over two hours to complete. Also, while the contrasting daytime/nightmare mechanism was well executed, I felt it could have been used to greater effect. In closing, Homesick was an incredibly enjoyable 2 hour distraction from reality. Lucky Pause did an impeccable job and I look forward to their next title(s).			"

The graphics are nice looking and the soundtrack could run forever.This is one of those games that will change your mood while you play it.If you like Dear Esther, as I do, then this ""game"" is definitely for you.The game is relatively short. I managed to play it through in 2.3 hoursBut it's worth the money. "

												All in all the game was very interesting and worth playing if you like puzzles and atmospheric games. There was also quite a bit of reading material Spoiler allert:  after you've completed most of the puzzles. + The graphics were beautiful and detailed as hell. I must say I was very impressed. The shiny thingies in the air made the game very cozy somehow. Also, the overwhelming light coming from windows made it interesting.+ The music was fantastic. Just the kind of music I enjoy, calm, beautiful and not too simple.+ The puzzles were challenging enough.+ Another spoiler:  I like when you can interact with a lot of things many of which have nothing to do with solving the puzzles. Otherwise you can just do anything that's possible and solve puzzles by chance. Good job guys! - I bought it on discount but I think it was still a bit short for the money.- There were a few glitches where light or parts of the outside graphics would appear indoors or through doors.Got stuck in one room with the piano and the switch board just because Spoiler allert:  I didn't realize you could put letters on those alphabet wooden blocks. I had already figured out a few letters from looking in the library and I got so frustrated that in the end I picked up one letter toy block and started shaking it like mad eventually pressing ""AWDSWASDWAS"" and solving the crazy mystery by chance. Wish there was some helpful tip about that somewhere.-Also, having to figure out that you need to lie on the bed with the picture in front of you was a bit silly..  "

Breathtaking!Gorgeous game, the graphics are amazing, the music is so immersive. The whole game is pretty darn breathtaking... but that ending was really unexpected :OI was hoping for a little more at the end or maybe a quick clip of a few months later and where the guy is now, but maybe there's going to be a HomeSick 2 and it'll carry on from where we left off?If you're interested or want to see how the game looks, then check out our let's play video.Love Danni xx

												Gorgeous, very intriguing story. I really enjoyed playing it. It's a very soothing atmosphere with puzzles that don't rush you but DO engage you. It's worth it before finishing the game to put together the final ""puzzle"" of deciphering the alphabet and then going back through the rooms to read up on what really happened.The only thing that ""frustrated"" me was how INCREDIBLY slow the character moves during the daytime. Made some backtracking to do something I missed a bit of a hassle.A little pricey for a game that can be completed in just an hour or two, but when considering how absolutely beautiful it is, a lot of hard work was obviously put into the game. You need to give it a try.			"

												Homesick is a pretty and interesting first person puzzle game. The ruined apartment building you explore is atmospheric and well-modeled, and despite your character being unable to read the written language, there's a surprising amount of backstory and information conveyed. The puzzles mostly don't break immersion and have good visual cues, though I had to look up answers for a couple of them. It's not a horror game, but there are definitely creepy and unnerving moments, which added to the experience for me. Homesick is cheap, not very long, and well worth the time and money.			"

												Homesick is extremely reliant on its atmosphere to conduct the story, as for much of the game it it's all you have to go on. They've done plenty of things right, but could have perhaps done some things better. The initial game gives almost no tutorial or introduction, which even I found somewhat daunting at first. After a few trial-and-errors, you begin to figure it out if you have the patience for it, which I'm afraid a lot of people might not have.If you can get over this hurdle, the game opens up rapidly. It does get bogged down in some areas with puzzles that, while the solutions usually make sense, can take a lot of patience to figure out. I have to admit, I needed to use some user hints on the forums because a game mechanic wasn't explained to me. The mechanic in particular was the block puzzle. I was not aware I could press a keyboard letter to change the symbol to that letter, despite looking at a dozen blocks, it never occured to me that you were able to do that. It's a great idea, but if you don't provide some context, people won't know what you want from them.The beautiful environment is a healthy balance between grey and green, and it sounds good to boot. The story even starts to come together at the end with a little twist. The walk speed during the day is a bit slow though and the ending scene was rather abstract and didn't fit.Great game, though it demands a lot of patience, but I felt it gave a just reward.			"

												I bought this game on SSS2016 for a 5.99$. I think it worth it. Would I bought it for a full price? I don't think so.But it has good graphic style and some interesting puzzles.Story is pretty usual, nothing special or unique. I didn't liked that I had to run through all rooms again after 2/3 of game to read the notes, that were crypted before.The only one jumpscare was not impressive and I don't understand it's value for this game. So, if you want to have some short puzzle game with pleasant graphics I recommend to buy this one on the sale, it's too short and don't have that much interesting story  or unique puzzles for it's full price.

												This is an exemplary ""walking simulator"" in most ways; the graphics, audio, mood, and pacing are tremendous. Unfortunately, when the story is rapidly uncovered towards the game's end, it's more cerebral than the haunting, wordless atmosphere that preceded it, and it sets up a conclusion that - although disturbing - doesn't match the ambitious poetry of the rest of the game. Still, the whole thing is peppered with the piercing, visceral moments that make this genre so great.			"

Full disclosure: I backed Homesick on Kickstarter for £7 for a copy of the game and my name listed in the credits.Homesick is a slow and low-key 'walking simulator', where beautiful music accompanies your journey through a gently serene and slightly eerie run-down building. You slowly gain access to new areas, and begin to build up an understanding of what happened in this house whilst solving some (mostly) simple puzzles.The game is interesting, although slow and the plot is relatively straight forward... however the message is a good one, and the scenery and music create a thoughtful tone.

												I was delighted and impressed with this game.  Spoiler-free thoughts follow:+ The music was just gorgeous.  I could've just sat and listened without even playing the game and I'd have considered it worth the price.  Very very well done.+ The atmosphere is haunting.  This isn't a horror game and there's nothing overtly ""scary"" involved, but there is some definite creepiness to the locale that is a marked contrast to the soothing music.  It's a fascinating juxtaposition.+ The puzzles are relatively straightforward if you're paying attention (which you should be!).  There are some spoiler-free guides available for people having trouble; I would greatly encourage trying everything you can think of first before going to a guide, and if you do need one, definitely use a spoiler-free one so you can experience everything firsthand.+ There's a point where you can go back and get some information you couldn't in the beginning.  I strongly recommending going back and reading anything you couldn't at first, because the backstory you gain is great.+ The game isn't overly long but the beautiful graphics and soundtrack combined with interesting gameplay, plus an overarching message that is important and yet not heavy-handed, make it worth the price in my opinion.  I picked it up on sale but would gladly have paid full price.+ The ending was short but fit perfectly.  I've seen some people say it was rushed and made no sense; I would like to respectfully disagree.  No spoilers here, but I did feel it made perfect sense in the context of all the information you're given throughout the game.  Make your own decision after you play; don't rely on us reviewers! :)Overall, very pleased to recommend this to anyone who likes exploration-based games with light puzzling.			"

												I'll keep this as spoiler-free as possible.Homesick is a visually impressive walking simulator that isn't entirely sure what it wants to be. Unfortunately, there are multiple reasons why I must give this game a negative review.While I was loving the graphics (and can easily see the VR potential), it needs some polishing. Some aspects seemed like they didn't fit in an otherwise stunning game, and some rooms felt overwhelmingly cluttered. Less is more.The controls worked alright, but were not entirely fluid. I found myself getting slightly dizzy or sick while moving, even though I haven't experienced it in other games (Firewatch, anyone?). Not to beat a dead horse here, but as many other players have said, your character moves painfully slow. The only explanation I can find for this is to add to the already short play time (currently two hours for a $15 game).The biggest grievance, however, is the irony that this game grapples with. While it is entirely a walking simulator with puzzle aspects (which are discouragingly difficult at times and counter-intuitive), it tries its hardest to hide the story from you. In fact, you can very easily go through the motions of this game without any explanation as to why things are the way they are! The reason being that you must decode symbols in the game before going all the way back to the beginning to read all sorts of burnt pages and books streen throughout the game. Then, you must try to piece together some sort of explanation for your adventure. Upon completion, it became painfully clear that the lack of story is because there isn't enough gravitasse in the one they've conceived, but rather they found a potentially sad idea and wanted to present it in an obscure way.It's important for your games to make you think. However, they probably shouldn't make you feel like you're working to haphazardly slap together why you just spent two hours walking around an abandoned building.TL;DRUnfortunately, the way the story is orchestrated suggests that the creators had a moderately dark story that they couldn't piece together themselves or couldn't afford to voice-cast.This game gets a 3/10.

												Such a beautiful game really. I can't begin to explain how awesome it is. So let me begin (cackle cackle) by saying the story of this game is amazing and very in depth. You have to want to know the story the find it. Without reading more into the game though, it's nothing more than a simple puzzle game. The story, MY GOD THE STORY, makes this game (in addition to the amazing graphics) makes this game worth the money and play time.

												While this game definitely fulfils its promise of being atmospheric, almost the entire game can be summed up in the images provided by Steam.  It's beautiful, and I thought the soundtrack was very fitting, but unless you really enjoy taking screenshots, this game has (in my opinion) little to no replay value.  I was lucky to have bought this game on sale, because even though it was an enjoyable experience, $8.99 is perhaps a little too much for a game with little replay value, and $14.99 is definitely excessive.That being said, the single playthrough was good, and I genuinely got emotional at a few points, but I think I figured out what the backstory/plot was before I was supposed to.  What was probably supposed to be a suspenseful series of hints felt like it was beating me over the head by the time I finished, and I wasn't shocked by a major moment of the game.  I was just... sad.I'm aware that the game is listed as short and averaging 2-4 hours, but I'm usually horrendously slow at puzzle games and eager to wander off-track and soak up the atmosphere.  In the bare minimum of that time frame, I had already looked at all of the paper materials, explored all of the rooms, and figured out all of the puzzles.In spite of the gorgeous graphics and one good (but quick) run through, this game fell short of what I expected for the price.  If it weren't so expensive, I would definitely recommend it, despite the lack of replay value.  In the end, if you're torn between this game and Ethan Carter, I would definitely choose Ethan Carter.  In my opinion, Ethan Carter is improved by a second run through, but I don't think this game would be.			"

												I started Homesick thinking it would be a fun n' quick puzzle game to enjoy for a couple hours. Little did I know....This game touched my soul on a level that I didn't expect it to. Superb story. I rate it up with Gone Home and Among the Sleep. It has excellent puzzles, but also lays out a backstory that leaves you guessing until the very end. Reflecting back on the experience, I realize now how much work the developers put into placing certain items of interest in specific areas, making sure you don't discover them too soon, or too late. It's such a bitersweet experience. The best way I can explain the experience without giving too much away is...a surreal thought provoking adventure that throws in a few surprises along the way. I would highly recommend to set aside a few hours to immerse yourself. Take your time, explore every nook and cranny, and backtrack occasionally. The puzzles take some trial and error, but leave you feeling rewarded for not giving up.  "

												To sum this game up in one word, it would have to be: desolation...Absolutely stunning graphics  help to immerse you fully in this grim visual novel.I feel reluctant to say more. This truly has to be experienced by yourself, so the relief of the ending will really hit home.+ puzzles are balanced enough so it's never too hard to figure out what to do, but getting the full story isn't exactly easy either+ beautifully rendered setting+ moody piano during the day, eerie sound FXs during the night- story is too short (but I guess it means I would have loved some more, so a bit of a twisted compliment)So Homesick gets an 8 out of 10 in my book...

												This game is gorgeous and immersive. It is also interesting how you tie each area between one another and then try to solve the letter puzzle. Until the end of the game, you are clueless as to what the messages tell you. The puzzles are quite difficult and exploration and attention is needed.The only con i could find is that the game is quite short if you realize what you have to do (which i did) and probably 15 euros is too much for this game. Don't get the wrong idea...it's still a great game with an amazing atmosphere. I simply think 10 euros would have been better a price for this game. Well, I appreciate a good game (and this certainly is one), so the price is not personally that important when you think the game was done by one person only (and a girl who wrote the texts).			"

												I really enjoyed playing Homesick. In the beginning I spent time just looking around at the amazing building where all the action takes place. The graphics made me think I was moving around inside a Hollywood movie. The music is relevant and seemed to fade in and out of my consciousness at the appropriate times.  The puzzles that had to be figured out  were both interesting and inventive. After completing each one I felt a sense of accomplishment and the positive reinforcement that kept me motivated to play  straight through. It was the same feeling I get when I pick up a great book and don't want to put it down, along with a hint of adrenaline. Since the whole game is played through ""your"" eyes, you have to figure out who you are and why you are in this place. I highly recommend  Homesick for its interesting play, amazing graphics and for the true sense of accomplishment you feel when you complete  it.			"

												I'm going to give Homesick a thumbs up, but this would be an excellent opportunity for a ""meh"" option.  On the plus side it's gorgeous and atmospheric, thoughtful and pensive, with some light puzzle solving.On the other hand, it's very short - even with the painfully slow walking speed and my desire to frequently backtrack it only took me 2.5 hrs to complete (which isn't even enough to unlock all three free Steam trading cards).I feel like it's worth a playthrough if those aren't massive turnoffs for you, but definitely wait for it to go on sale.

												Gameplay consists of using every item you have on every item in the environment. There is no context or overarching goal given to you, and there are no hints or any sense of direction aside from ""wander around until you make something happen, repeat"". I like some walking sims, but this is one of the ones where you wander around a very pretty environment completely unsure of what you're doing.Also locked at 30FPS if you play in 4K for some reason.

												Incredible. I used to do a bit of urban exploration, but the risk of getting charged with trespassing, and the other inherent dangers of navigating decaying structures outweighed the fun of it all. This game was a great substitute. It was so atmospheric I felt like I was really in an abandoned building; exploring and looking for clues as to what tragedy befell the previous tenants. Rather a sad little story. I'm still having fun decoding all the literature I found and took screen caps of.			"

												Even for 9 bucks, it's hard to recommend this game. Which is such a pity because it has such great potential. Excellent graphics and great atmosphere. I enjoyed the mechanics of the dual awake/asleep modes. It is just a woefully short game with only a few relatively easy puzzles to solve. The 2 hour time length is padded due to the slow movement of the character. I'm very disppointed.			"

												Very interesting ""game"".. actually, more like a puzzle walk. Loved the atmosphere created and the story lines told in different rooms.. At first, you have no idea what they are. Game ran very smoothly on my Win7 with Nvidia GTX650.Music at first was rellly nice and fit the surroundings, but after awhile it became tedious. Negatives: No way to turn the music down independentally of the sound effects. The textures were out of scale in many of the objects and I think are way over done.. everything is extremely deteriorated, but maybe that's just part of the dream feeling. The final scene was a bit of a let down for me and seemed sort of trite.. wish there could have been more of a story linking the character to one of the rooms that the player would have to discover and receive some sort of redeeming message at the end that would have made his life worth while. Something like ""The Vanashing of Ethan Carter"" had a more interesting story line and ending.Not a game for those wanting a shootem-up or run through environment.			"

												Mild spoilers ahead.What's interesting about Homesick is that you kinda play it twice in the same run: you get a sense of the place you're exploring just by the gorgeous atmosphere, and then you unlock a way to fully flesh out what happened. Some complain about ""having to backtrack"" when in essence the games provides you with a new layer of meaning near the end. But just with the music, the gorgeous environments, and the cryptic visual cues found throughout the game, even before the actual story is explained, the game stirred very strong emotions in me. A sense of loss pervades the experience, of real lives frozen by tragedy, and I even found myself projecting onto it unexpected emotional baggage that wasn't part of the game's storyline at all. Made me want to hug my loved ones. Made me think of what I have to lose, if I were to lose it all. It's a walking simulator, the puzzles can get obnoxious in a couple of instances, and it is a short game. But if you are receptive to it, it can also be an exceptional emotional experience.			"

												Beautiful, haunting and weirdly emotional. The very beginning required a bit of extra patience to get through, but once the block pieces fit (literally), backtracking through the story of the building was a rewarding experience. The music is very calming and melancholic and fits the atmosphere very well. It's certainly not a game for everyone, but it was an enjoyable experience for me.			"

												The real story and worth of Homesick lies between its dusty dreams and its corrupting nightmares.  You wake, lying among books and stories of lives once lived, unclear of what placed you here. Where you are. What to do. You move forward, finding what may be hints. A bucket, water, a flower. What makes sense? Homesick is, above all else, haunting. There's a profound sense of loss throughout the experience, and within that a failure of hope. There are hints of defeat all around you, but at the same time opportunities for little victories. The music and visuals combine beautifully to develop one of the best atmospheres in a long while. Gameplay is simple, with an appropiate amount of puzzles of good variety. Elaborating on what precisely is so great would only serve to ruin the experience, but if there's one thing that must be conveyed it is the beauty present.I wholeheartedly reccommend Homesick for those with patience, and urge that capability for those without.

												Visually, this game is outstanding. I played it with a friend right beside me and both him and myself figured out the puzzles together. We completed it in a little bit over an hour's time, and were quite interested by the puzzles and the last part of the game, leaving us both with goozebumps at the end.Both of us agreed that it should have been longer, I don't agree with the price, considering the length of the game. Personally, I feel the game should be sold for the €9.99 mark.Out of ten, I'd give it 9/10, my friend gives it 9.5/10, we don't agree with the price but other than that, this game is out of this world.

												Best way I can describe this game is Slow. It's slow paced, yet you'll still finish it within 4 hours, sooner if you don't bother to sit down and decipher the books and papers.The games content appears to be in the papers, and deciphering them can be headache inducing. I ended up screen capturing them to decipher later thinking there would be important info for later in the game, but then the game ended.I plan to read through the letters and books to see if there's more content however it just feels like the game ended with things unanswered, I'm not satisfied with the ending, it was an 'oh, there's the credits, but where's the rest of the game?' ending. I don't remember if I bought it at full price, but I certainly hope I didn't.			"

												A mere two and a half years after the Kickstarter was successfully funded, Andrew Hussie's ""Homestuck"" video game is finally released.  But does the game live up to the online comic's standards?As promised by the Kickstarter, the video game takes place in the same universe as the comic, but is otherwise its own separate story, so knowledge of the comic is not necessary to enjoy the game for what it is.  However, fans of the comic will still appreciate the occasional references to the comic's events, and they may have a better understading of the context of the plot.  For example, the protagonist is a player whose session has prematurely ended.  The game begins with the player waking up after successfully achieving god tier in spite of their limitations, and now they must learn to use their powers to navigate the deteriorating session, which has constricted them to a small building.Visually, the game is very much a departure for the series--or at least one would initially assume.  Given the setting, which resembles a colorless apartmentment complex, I believe Hussie is purposely recreating the stark, simple visuals of Problem Sleuth.  Even the puzzles are reminiscent of the puzzles the Problem Sleuth characters face; one moment, you're picking up keys to unlock a door.  The next moment, your keys have suddenly turned into an axe that you're using to chop down the doors instead.As you learn to properly navigate the world's dream bubbles and solve puzzles that impact the real world, you will come across writings left behind by other characters.  True to the Homestuck name, there are several characters involved with the story, and none of them really take the role of ""main character""--everyone is equally important.  One minor complaint, though: Those who have read the comic are already familiar with the fact that each character has a unique ""voice"", following different methods of punctuation, capitalization, and sometimes substituting letters for numbers according to their personality.  Apparently Hussie was REALLY desperate to continue this trend despite having already fully explored the concept, because in this game, every new character writes entirely in abstract symbols.  I appreciate a running joke as much as anyone, but sometimes you can take things too far.Overall, though, there are quite a few noticeable differences between the game and the comic.  The visuals are much more realistic and detailed, the music is slower-paced... Actually, the whole game in general is very slow-paced compared to the comic.  It makes me wonder what Hussie was thinking as he directed the game.  Maybe he's decided he wants to explore new methods of expression as he matures as an artist.  Or maybe he's just trolling all of us.  That's usually what I assume the explanation is whenever he does something confusing.In short: This is one of the more pleasant walking simulators that focuses on exploration and learning new things about your environment at a slow pace.  I suggest it to those who are interested in taking it easy.  Sometimes it is very important to relax and not take things seriously.P.S. Steam please revive Namco High.			"

												Gorgeous visuals, haunting environment, soul-crushing music, and a few engaging (but not difficult) puzzles to keep you entertained. The alphabet puzzle in particular was my favorite, and it's also the most important to the storyline. Homesick is a very clever game, and I did enjoy it. But I felt like it was a bit short, and the story lacked clear details. Sure, the ending and the overall cause is obvious, but I would've liked a bit more development in there. Even still, Homesick is worth playing for the beautiful setting, and the creepy shift between day and night is worth experiencing at least one. It's rare that secluded puzzle games have happy endings, but Homesick delivers. Even after you finish this game, you'll be thinking about it for weeks after.			"

												S/N: I have first discovered/demoed this game at PAX East 2015 and when the full game came out, I was not dissapointed. An absolutely beautiful game. And I'm not just talking about the graphics/art (which blew me away), but the actual story and gameplay itself. Such aspects reminded me of games like Gone Home and the Vanishing of Ethan Carter (like said from a previous review and both games which I truely adore and love) in which the narrative does NOT hold your hand, and your progress in the game (puzzles or stories) compeltely stands on your ability to observe and explore. Which is so much better than mainstream puzzle games in my opinion because they don't give you a lazy explanation for character/story development but leaves you thinking and wanting to find out what happened to your surroundings and keeps you in complete immersion. I highly recomment this game and you should buy it, and if you do, note that if you want to get the full experience of the game, you can't just stare at the screen aimlessly like you're a robot following instructions (hence that the narrative does not hold your hand), but you must continiously ask yourself questions of what happened, is happening, and what will happen.  Because when you do, every second of the game will feel as if you're there as you're no longer getting sidetracked and just staying with the game, making it more enjoyable to keep going, and after you finish, you will be left thinking about the game for days to come. An absolutely beautiful game.			"

The instrumentals were goregous, the ambience was eerie without being all-out frightening, it perfectly balanced the surprises, puzzles, and mystery with a constant feeling of progression. I've played plenty of puzzle games where you feel like, no matter how many puzzles you solve, you aren't actually making any progress in the story (*cough*Portal*cough*). But this game made you feel like you were getting closer as you went every step of the way! The fact that the dream and real worlds coincided so much was a real treat, and the story behind everything was shocking to the very end!

												This is the first game I'm leaving a review for, and I'm doing it so that you don't waste your money on it.Firstly, I can't believe how slowly you're forced to walk.  It's practically a crawl.  The entire game I was ready to throw my computer across the room because I didn't have a run button.Secondly, the puzzles are not rewarding, or at least I did not find them rewarding.  They're mostly frustrating, again MOSTLY because of how slowly you're forced to walk.  Probably the most annoying thing is the inventory system.  You're unable to simply select the item you'd like to use.  You're instead made to scroll through every item to get to the one you want.  I felt like I spent half the game walking, and half the game selecting items from my inventory.  The especially annoying part is that sometimes I would make a full rotation, while scrolling through my inventory, and STILL THE ITEM I WANTED WOULDN'T SHOW UP.  Meaning I had to make two full rotations through it before what I wanted would show up.Why do I have to keep picking my keys back up after I use them, but the proddy stick is in my inventory for the duration of the game, even though I only used it once?All in all, 10/10, what a beautiful game.Just kidding, this is the first game I've wanted my money back.  0/10 would not recommend. The puzzles are illogical, unsatisfying, and the game is glitchy.  I only beat it so I could be done with it.By the way, 2 hours of my playtime were spent watching a movie with the game running. The only reason it takes longer than 10 minutes to beat is how slowly you walk.			"

												Homesick immediately appealed to my inner detective. I purchased it instantly, hoping to relive the intense joy of playing The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, which in much ways seemed similar to this game.For those who played ""Ethan Carter"" as well, you will remember how the puzzles and gameplay were contributing to your comprehesion of the story. Slowly uncovering the truth was an incredibly rewarding experience.This is where Homesick vastly differs.Its puzzles remind you of that point-and-click adventure you once bought but barely played. Once again you'll find yourself revisiting every area, clicking on every object in the hope something will happen. You'll wonder why the game isn't progressing and finally discover it was waiting for you to -whatever- water a plant or something. While the dreams (interactive cutscenes) give away the story pretty quickly, discovering the solution to a puzzle won't help your comprehension at all.Homesick features a linear progressing story, invisible walls, simple yet tedious puzzles and slow gameplay,As such, I'm afraid I did not enjoy it.

												Pretentious artsy types will love this game.Ohh look how ''minimalistic'' and philosophical it is. Look how it conveys humanities neglect towards mother nature, and the nature of the human spirit and children are so innocent and blah blah blah.Look, if you want to make a game that is very artsy and has a philosophical or social statement sewn through it, fine, go for it bud. But can't the game within the pretentious poppycock be enjoyable at least?Most of the puzzle elements in this game are just tedious. A puzzle game should give you a sense of satisfaction once the puzzle is solved. Solving a puzzle in this game leads to you saying things like ''oh come on! really!? that's what I was meant to do!?''. Far from feeling satisfied, the player feels annoyed that they just wasted all that time, turning water valves or translating a fake language into English letter by letter.Couple that with boring visuals and monotonous background piano music, the overall experience is enough to either put you to sleep, or drive you mad.If this game was free, or maybe even just a couple of euros, it might be worth a look. But 15 euros is an outrageous price to put on something so unexceptional. "

												A good game, I liked it overall but will still give it a negative because it isn't worth $15 at all, it left me very disappointed. Around $5 I would say is fair, it is a very short and easy game. I initially bought it because the play times on the reviews I saw were 10-30 hours. I don't know what those people were doing all that time but there is 2, maybe 4 max hours of gameplay here.			"

												Heavy use of bloom filters and God rays does not a good game make. There's probably only about 16 minutes of actual content in this game. It manages to stretch that 16 minutes of content to around 2 to 5 hours via puzzles, but the puzzels themselves are so incredibly obtuse that there's no way you'll make it through the game without having to look at a walkthrough.Oh, and I encountered a progression blocking bug in the game, which ♥♥♥♥ing sucks because there are no manual saves. I lost an hour and a half of progress I made painstakingly deciphering the in-game alphabet. I just stopped playing at that point and watched the rest of the playthrough on YouTube.I hate giving this game a negative review because it's made by a small developer, but this totally isn't worth $11. If you're in it for the atmosphere/story, I would recommend ""The Old City: Leviathian""... it has much more than 16 minutes worth of content.If you're in it for obtuse puzzles, there are probably better games for that as well. Try ""Anna"".EDIT: Okay, so it turns out that you can manually save. You can do so by ""sleeping"". But once again, this isn't obvious. It isn't made clear to you that you can do this. Once you reach a new area, you can no longer sleep in the old sleeping locations, and the new sleeping location is not made clear to you. Sometimes it's a couch, sometimes its a matress on the floor, and sometimes its an actual bed. No indication is given to the player.			"

												Like a number of Kickstarted games, Homesick suffers from the lukewarm execution of an ok premise. The game is not bad per se, it just does not offer much.There are some interesting things in the way the game tries to stear the player without using text or cut scenes, but it is a bit hit or miss (there is a whole puzzle that remains a total mystery to me thanks to a lack of clues and feedbacks) and the puzzles themselves are not exactly awe inspiring. There is not much to chew on as far as story go and while the environement and music are commendable in their execution there is a total lack a variety.A bit of a shame, because I am absolutely in favor of this type of compact format for games. A 2 to 5 hours game requires a quantity of content that is managable for a small team, BUT the format also requires a very high level of quality and/or originality that simply is not there in Homesick.

												For full disclosure, I was an original backer for this game and was quite invested in the concept. So I came into this REALLY wanting to like it, and I did...for the first couple hours.The Good: This game is a much slower pace, and a much moodier atmosphere than most games you will find out here. I found that refreshing and distinct. I loved how without any words it was communicating so much (emotionally) about loneliness, nostalgia, and time. Also it is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.The Bad (SPOILER ALERT): But then the thought-provoking journey comes to a jarring halt. Towards the end, you get the ability to translate all of the gibberish text that you have seen before into standard English. I happily ancitipated finding some personal, intimate, tragic story laced throughout these pages, as that was what the whole tone of the game seemed to be. Instead what I found was a hodge podge of random, disjointed, distracted bits of text written by backers that killed any sense of cohesion, were filled with typos, and deflated the mood that the game had been working so hard to set up. Some of it was actually wittr and funny, but in an atmosphere like this it just made an extremely awkward juxtapose.To make matters worse, there actually was a plot written by the developers into the text as well. It's a piece of environmental-awareness propaganda that's about as subtle as a drunken Marilyn Manson skateboarding naked with conga drums through a library. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for taking care of our Earth, but stooping to hyperbole that would befit a Saturday morning cartoon just comes across as immature, not bold. Also, it is a far cry from the very personal, intimate, soulful atmosphere the entire environment previously alluded to.  Also also, the developer's writing is just plain stitled and awkward.So...there's a LOT to like on the surface and at first the game seems consistent with how it was advertised. It ultimately falls apart, though, and lives far beneath its potential. It's a real pity, and at $15 it's just not worth your money. I do want Lucky Pause to do more games in the future...I just think they ought to focus on what they're best at: enviroment and mood, and bring on someone else come help with the writing.			"

												I'm really into puzzle games, walking games, exploring games, and escape the room games, so this game should be perfect right? Sadly no. It's like having your hands tied and walking through treacle. I can't recommend this game I'm afraid.Problems:1) There is a use of glaring light to prevent you walking to the windows. This is obviously to save the developers having to do anything with the outside scenery. This would be fine except the shafts of light that appear are solid and prevent you walking!2) The walking speed is slow. You have to walk up and down the same damned corridor over and over, very very slowly.3) To save the game you have to go to a certain place in the house. Another slow walk down the corridor even when you've had enough and want to exit the game.4) The cursor is tiny and the same colour as the room - it gave me eyestrain trying to spot it. And you need to spot it, because it's the only visual clue that something can be interacted with.5) All the rooms are so similar (at the beginning at least. I haven't gone any further) it's like the same texture has been used everywhere.6) I've picked up many books and pieces of paper that are all written in a code, and put them down again as the key doesn't come until later in the game. What a massive waste of time. I can't even keep the papers in my inventory - I just pick up - and put straight down.I'm bored with it - it needs a considerable overhaul.Go and play firewatch or vanishing ethan.			"

												This game is utter garbage, save your money and time.This is one of those games which lives up to all the bad things about indie games. (not bashing indie games, only the negative aspects of some of them out there) 1. You have your classic ""overwhelmingly positive"" false votes by people who justify that ""anything can be art"" (their reasoning: why not consider a hunk of sh*t as a masterpiece? after all, anything is art, am I right?). These are usually hipsters who like to regard themselves as mentally superior, and think they have some superhuman emotions and perceptions which ""normal people"" don't (spoiler: they don't), so by calling a hump of flawed gameplay design a game they get the white card to say ""its not a bad game, its just that you can't understand it because you are not deep enough [like me]""2. Extremely short3. the puzzles are not hard, they are just impossible to solve out of using human reason and logic as they require you to stumble [by luck] on the key object in order to progress. There is no real puzzle solving, only interacting with every item you can find and hope that triggers the next part of the game.4. Story is completely absent. 5. Prepare your youtube apps for watching game walkthroughs when you get stuck because of the stupidity of game design. eg. find a piece of paper amid the hundreds out there with only gibberish written on them, yup thats right, one of them is the key to continue, which you must use in order to fall asleep. (if you are thinking ""lolwut"" that is because you are a healthy human being with a brain, and for this game that is a nono! shame on you!)6. Price. gee I don't know, seems more like the type of gift you would give to your enemy than your friends. If you are considering buying this as a means to mentally harm someone you dislike, then it is deffinitely worth the full price, but other than that, don't get it even on offer.7. Gfx. Ok the gfx are great. just look at the details of those rusty pipes! (srsly, that is all you will be seing, a ranshacked house interior throughout the whole game) tsk tsk... such potential, and for what?In a nutshell, we have a ""No Man's Sky"" situation here. Although I don't blame the developer(s) per se as it is probably one of their first games, can't be too harsh on them "

												My expirience with the game:-Bought it on sale for 8.99.-Started it with the thought,that i got a really cheap good game.-Was astonished by graphics at first,later not that much-played literaly two minutes before i was stuck in a puzzle.-had to watch a guide to find out,that i need to water flowers.-I get into a dream.A little creppy.-I get to a new area.Three minutes later,im stuck at a puzzle again.I watch a guide to find out the solution (i needed to type in the number of the safe as a code,how am i suppused to find that out?) -I water flowers and go into a creppy dream again.(this time i spend ten minutes to find out about light mechanics.)-I go to a new area,a gym.I have no idea what to do AGAIN.-I want to save,but it doesn't work.pros:-graphics,a little bit-Story-easy inventorycons:-solutions to puzzles are none sense.-Short game,way to overpriced.-It seems like the developers didn't had time when they did the invisible barriers.Light simply blocks you from going to the next area.-Light effects are bad.my decision:4/10 DONNOT buy this game if you don't just want to expirience a short story,or want to let's play it.

												Some of the most original puzzles I've ever seen. Paced with a light touch, but very effectively. Pretty short, as to be expected of an indie game in this neo-adventure/exploration genre, but I'd be happier about a $10 price tag rather than $15. Also, could do with a run button, or at least ""walk faster"" button. I get that it wants to encourage a languid pace, but later on there can be a fair amount of retracing steps up and down hallways. And, on a side note, while providing instructions for the piano melody is a cute idea, it probably induced panic amongst the musically impaired/people who hated the Selenitic Gate puzzle in Myst. It actually turns out to be more of an easter egg than a puzzle, but there's no reason the player would know that until after it goes nowhere, so the sheet music was probably an unwise diversion in an otherwise very focused game design. Anyway, other than that stuff, highly recommended.			"

												Probably it is worth getting the game for half the price. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend buying it. Though I would recommend playing it. The language was the best finding in the game. But I found this frustrating:1. The use of ""lay"" instead of ""lie"". It just hurted me every time I noticed it. However ""lie"" was properly used in one of the books.2. The story is meh, the ending didn't touch a single string. Even though I probably read everything.			"

												Story-based games always intrigue me, so I thought I would give this one a try. While I cannot say it is indeed a bad game in itself, Homesick did leave me feeling very disappointed. It felt like it had much more potential than the final product offered. So, where do I begin? Visually speaking, the game is quite lovely at times. Other visual aspects felt repetitive and lackluster. The game itself does not expand across a vast area, but rather small, intertwined rooms and areas. Many of the graphics were overused throughout different rooms. This building, which is now empty, was once occupied by many people, but their own personalities rarely show in their personal apartments. Most of the apartments consist of the same furniture rearranged in different ways, with maybe a few unique items on the wall. Every apartment has the same bathroom and when looking through the windows, the outside of the building itself looks sloppy and unappealing. I felt that with such little space and a high price, the creators could have gone the extra mile into the details to make sure every room in the game was unique. In terms of content, I felt the game was also lacking. Most of the (few) puzzles in the game are uninteresting and difficult to understand without any clear guide. There were very few times in the game where I could move forward without the help of one. I know there are some others who had an easier time getting through the puzzles, and I applaud them. I guess I don't have quite the same amount of ""logic"" to solve these puzzles. Some of the puzzles were either boring, too short, or unoriginal. One particular puzzle involving blocks was the one time in the game where I felt I was enjoying the experience other than the nice music. The story itself also did not unfold well for me. The first half of the game was simply solving puzzles in confusion and frustration as to what I was trying to achieve and why. This beginning half of the game did not give me enough story or instruction which made it feel tedious. By the time the story and my understanding of it began to unfold, I already had a bad taste in my mouth due to all the frustration and not as invested as I felt I could have been.Because of this, I do not feel that the game is worth the price, and that's why I cannot recommend it. It felt unpolished and the gameplay itself is nothing but tedious besides that one puzzle. This game is about 1-5 hours long depending on how well you do on the puzzles. I used a guide after trying to figure out the puzzles and it took me about 3 hours. If you still want to try it, I recommend buying it when it is cheap on sale and not at full price.			"

												Homesick is an adventure game that looked very promising at the start - and then it was suddenly over. I must say I'm a bit disappointed. You wake up in an abandoned house that looks and feels a bit Silent Hillish. Everything seems broken, like the house has been abandoned a long time ago, and yet you wake up there and got no idea what you are doing there. The light that shines in through the windows hurts you and blinds you so you gotta stay away from it. You find books and notes everywhere but you can't read them as they are written in glyphs. So far, an interesting start. Then you walk through the house in slow motion (yes, you walk pretty slow) and gather informations about what happened. Finding out how to read the books and notes took me the longest, and sadly this was the only slightly challenging part of the game. All the other ""riddles"" and tasks were quite obvious and way too easy for an adventure game. The story behind Homesick is not bad even, but the only way to really get it is by reading all the journals and notes that you find on your way. That's something that I enjoy doing, but a bit more in-game-storytelling wouldn't have hurt. The graphics are a pro of Homesick. They are solid for an adventure game, but not outstanding, and the engine needs to be optimized as in addition to the general slow motion, it also lagged way too much on my PC and nope, it definitely ain't my hardware. I would have ignored that if at least the story and puzzles entertained me well enough to make this a game to remember, but sadly, with the sudden and unsatisfying ending, it's rather a game that I'll soon have forgotten about. They could. and should have made more out of this.			"

												Homesick is one of the most interesting games I've played this year. It looks really nice, the sound effects have a high quality (especially when you play it with headphones), the puzzles are not too easy but if you take your time to find all the clues you need, you can solve them with a pretty satisfying feeling. Don't try to rush through the game as you might get frustrated at some points.To be honest the price is pretty high and given that it doesn't really have a replay value  - at least for me - you better wait until it's on sale for 5 - 10 €/$.

												Homesick was beautiful because it was simple. You wake up in a strange room, in a building that has obviously been neglected for some time. You walk around, trying to find clues, and trying to explore. Homesick is a peaceful game, even when you sleep and need to move quickly to prevent the darkness from getting you. I thought the graphics were stunning, and I really enjoyed playing the game. I also liked it because it was fairly quick - sometimes you want a game that's easy and quick instead of hundreds of hours of commitment. I would recommend this game to people who like puzzle games, and who enjoy ""walking games"". The graphics are great, the story is touching, and I am happy I played this.			"

												I don't normally consider leaving game reviews, but I felt compelled to do this one.Homesick was the perfect storm of indie production. The graphics were very impressive (even on my ancient GTX 260),the score was amazing, and the atmosphere engrossing.This is a more high-brow level of horror game. Not to give anything away, but it invokes the writing of H.P. Lovecraft.There aren't many modern games that can hold your interest when there's no dialogue.Although I finished it in one night, I was so hooked on the game, I didn't want to sleep until I experienced the entire game. Truth be told, I ended using a walkthrough on the final sections. I'd estimate it would have taken at least two more hours minimum to complete the game on my own. I do plan to play through the game again in the near future.Heather Schmidt and Shauna Rolston's score alone is worth the price. I was so relieved to recall that the OST comes with the game. This game will stick with me for quite some time.			"

												It's a great game. Awfully short and you can guess what happens once you're able to read all the papers. This game leaves a bit more to be desired in its puzzles. The first two were barely memorable, the gym was sort of random, but the alphabet puzzle was flawless. The last one took complex work and searching for clues that aren't obviously given out. The first two puzzles did that, too, but the alphabet puzzle was by far the most challenging one. The main point here, though, is that all of the puzzles weren't explicitly telling the player how to complete them, which is rare for any game today. However, I think more fine-tuning could be helpful.Beautiful environments, perfect lighting, and fitting noises and abiance. They nailed it with the admosphere. Like, Silent Hill 2 level nailed it with the atmosphere. I don't think I've played another game on steam that had me this engaged with just the atmosphere. It's just a beautiful game.Great game, but I wouldn't drop $15 on it. Wait for a sale. I can't wait to see what the guys who made this are gonna do next. I hope it's at least three times longer than this game.			"

												I wouldn't recommend buying this for the asking price, based primarily on the short length; I'd get it on sale, like I did. That being said, it is a worthwhile experience to play through, if a little disconnected in ways. The visual presentation is gorgeous and effective, although a little rough around the edges. Ambience is solid, and nothing feels too over or under. You can either take or leave the musical score; I personally enjoyed it, though I wouldn't write home about it.The interface is acceptable, generally speaking, but could use improvements. Inventory management is clunky; I'd rather be able to hit keys like 1-8 to get what I need, instead of having to slowly cycle through with the mouse wheel. Interactions aren't always smooth or obvious; I got stuck on the last level for a time, because I wasn't close enough to a certain object to see I could interact with it at first. Your movement speed is slow, which is grating when you have to trek back and forth between areas, and especially frustrating when you want to backtrack entirely once you figure out how to crack the game's alphabet (although, when you find out your character's current condition at the end of the game, it's easy to understand why your pace is the way it is).Really though, the roughness adds to the game in its own way, and it is an ultimately enjoyable experience. Like I said before, get it on sale; full price is asking a little too much.			"

												Don't get me wrong, I liked it. But I don't think it's something that most people would like.The game is very short and has a few easy problems for you to solve. The main aspect of the game is the atmosphere and trying to figure out what actually happened rather than just going through the game. At a certain point in the game you will be able to change the signs to letters and be able to go back and read the various notes and books. This is what adds depth to the game.If you're looking for a puzzle game, this isn't for you. This is a purely atmospheric game with a hidden story. You actually have to care enough to read the notes.In conclution: If you still want to try it out, wait for a sale. It's not worth the full prize.			"

												Recommended with a ""But..."". Great game, pretty graphics for UDK, engaging narrative and sub-stories, and fun puzzles. Interesting translation mechanic. Worth playing, but not worth the 15 euro price tag. Wait for a sale and get it for < 10 euros.			"

												Beautiful, captivating at times, and good at stirring the curiosity. However, the game is extremely short, arbitrarily cryptic at some points, and can be painfully tedious and slow. The story and ending leave much to be desired as well. Feels more like a proof-of-concept more than anything, I would certianly like to see something like this that's more fleshed out and more refined. As it stands I wouldn't really consider it fun game to play.			"

												I don't normally consider leaving game reviews, but I felt compelled to do this one.Homesick was the perfect storm of indie production. The graphics were very impressive (even on my ancient GTX 260),the score was amazing, and the atmosphere engrossing.This is a more high-brow level of horror game. Not to give anything away, but it invokes the writing of H.P. Lovecraft.There aren't many modern games that can hold your interest when there's no dialogue.Although I finished it in one night, I was so hooked on the game, I didn't want to sleep until I experienced the entire game. Truth be told, I ended using a walkthrough on the final sections. I'd estimate it would have taken at least two more hours minimum to complete the game on my own. I do plan to play through the game again in the near future.Heather Schmidt and Shauna Rolston's score alone is worth the price. I was so relieved to recall that the OST comes with the game. This game will stick with me for quite some time.			"

												Absolutely amazing! I participated in Beta testing for this ge and it was in remarkable condition for a beta. The graphics, sound track, gameplay, everything was outstanding. The devs kept in close contact with the testers to ensure a great gaming experience. I would recommend this game for a gamer with an eye for detail and a natural mind for puzzels. My only critique would be that the longevity of the game seemed to be short and there was no intent on adding material to the game. Definately worth the experience though.			"

												I wanted to love this game, really I did. I didn't even mind going into it knowing it would be short--sometimes a couple of hours is all you need for a really impactful, satisfying game experience (see: Vanishing of Ethan Carter; Journey). However, it was a lot of wandering around for what I felt was very little payoff, and what you do get feels like a lecture. What little backstory you manage to collect isn't compelling enough when put together to justify the swift ending. The whole thing ends up feeling swift and hollow. The fact that my game inexplicably crashes just before the very end (at the last ""save point"") with no apparent fix is also extremely frustrating given the purchase price. I experienced the last 2 minutes and credits courtesy of YouTube.On the upside, it does look nice.			"

												Pros: very atmospheric setting - the delapidated building is very well done. There's good sense of mystery and general weirdness. The puzzles are mostly quite intuitive (exception being the block one - took me a while to even realise it was a puzzle) and solvable just by paying attention to clues in the game.Cons: Very short - it almost feels like a demo for a longer game. I took me 2.7 hours apparently and that was a first playthrough with a fair bit of wondering what to do/how to do it. The ending is an ending I suppose, but it made little sense. There's not much replay value to it - maybe to take in the sights again, but once you know the puzzles there's no further challenge.It's very well done, so it gets a recommend, but it is very short so bare that in mind. Maybe get it in a sale.			"

												Whether you appreciate this game or not depends on what part of your brain you lead with when you play it.[SPOILER WARNING! SPOILER WARNING! SPOILER WARNING!]If you go with the mood and resist the urge to be analytic, it will be very good. Someone put a LOT of work into the settings. The entire game has an apocalyptic ambience that makes Fallout 3 look like a bridal boutique. It isn't scary. It's upsetting and unsettling. There is a difference. Something ghastly happened here, and the fact that there aren't skulls grinning at you from all the trash heaps makes it worse, not better. The effect that the light has on you is somewhat contrived (dizziness might have been better than just bodily forcing you away from the windows), but that's a minor point. The various actions that you have to take to move through the game seem natural in the context of the feeling established. In other words, if you go with your emotional reactions and sensations, it's horrifyingly good.If you turn on your analytic functions, even for a little bit, you're screwed.There is no reason for you being there in the first place (it's clearly a long time since the key disaster has struck). The way you end levels and level up is irrelevant to... well ANYTHING that can be handled rationally; absent the emotional context, it would be a flimsy tissue of absurdities. The game has none of the realism of ""Gone Home"" or even ""Dear Esther."" The texts in the game begin incomprehensible (at first I thought they'd been written in Inuit or Cherokee), and the way they are rendered readable is arbitrary to the point of absurdity. The reason given for the tragedy is banal in the extreme (note that I'm not saying it's unrealistic, just threadbare from over-use), and some of the supporting material is hamhanded in its bluntness. Okay. Companies are (or can be) evil. I learned that from the Doomguy many years ago, and even though it's true, the way the message is expressed in a number of the texts here is as subtle as a kick in the nuts. And the ending makes no logical sense and has no logical connection to what came before, whatsoever.The conclusion here is not that the game is bad. It isn't if you take it the right way. Decline to analyze and rely on your emotions, and it will be haunting. But the extent to which this is true is far greater than with other games of its kind, and I can't help thinking that a little more attention should have been paid to reducing or at least hiding its absurdities.(Approaching it purely through the emotions also renders it very replayable.)I'm changing my original ""no"" to a ""yes"" because there is a legitimate way to play through the game that makes it a very moving experience. But be warned -- start flipping the wrong switches in your mind and you'll feel that it was a silly waste of time. This is a risk it really should not have taken.			"

												While ultimately a quite pretty game with some very nice music, I never really felt that the game got going.  The number of puzzles you have to solve to complete the game are quite limited, what limited storytelling the world can provide kinda comes all at once towards the end, and when the reveal happened it had little impact.The game does have a pretty neat mechanic for decripting a cypher that I've not seen done before, so from a design perspective it's worth checking seeing that.  But I can't say that seeing a single cool bit of UX is worth playing through this game.			"

												Graphics and concept were beautiful. Game play was fun, but I wish there were more puzzles that gradually get harder. The only disappointing thing is going through the trouble of translating and reading for only snippets of character stories and the overall theme of pollution is bad. There so much potential for an exciting plot with big business conspire cover ups. I really hope this isn’t the final version of the game because I would love to see more of this world and see more of these characters in depths. This is a strong start to a really good game in progress.			"

Great-looking graphics and a really good sountrack too; perfect for people who like piecing together stories on their own without direction from the game. I would personaly wait for it to go on sale for around $10 or less, since I don't think it's worth the full $15 (especially since it was Kickstarter funded), but that's just my opinion.			"

A Good Game From Start To FinishBesides the facts that this  game has painstakingly slow walk speed without the ability to sprint. It's actually a fun game. There is a story in it somewhere you just got to get far enough into the game to see it. In the end your left with figuring out what happened yourself. The game never tells you ever exactly what happened. Yoiu're forced to draw you own conclusions. In the end it left me perplexed.

Likewise, the music is well-composed and fits the mood nicely.Design-wise, puzzles are satisfying and about average difficulty for a point-and-click.  Decoding the alphabet is a nice touch, but I wish it was more of a gradual through-line in the game. Overall, it's definitely a solid adventure game for those who are in the mood for a melancholic, atmospheric experience.			"

												I saw it and bought it in the afternoon, and now I have passed it for twice. For the fist time I explored and spent 2-3 hours but for the second time I just spent 15 min to pass it------yes it is actually a very short game.The world is really beautiful especially the colorful flowers. The music is great. But when I am walking, it feels like I am a ghost and I am flying through a very straight line, and it doesn't have sounds----if it has that will be great. Puzzles are interesting and not very hard. 15 dollars is a little bit expensive, 10 dollars will be better. In conclusion, if you don't play it, you will regret for that.第一遍用了两个小时多，第二遍只用了15分钟，所以说游戏还是太短了，15刀有点贵，不过景色是非常不错的，配上音乐在无人的房子里很有感觉。但是优化好像一般，不知道是我电脑不行还是怎样，有点小卡，不碍事买来收藏，15刀买个有特色风景很好的游戏，如果你没有收藏癖，还是去下D版的吧			"

My best suggestion to you is to buy it when on sales. The eerie experience might last few hours, but it will be forever etched in your mind. Warning: you will not get the same effect by simply watching a walkthrough; play the game to fully experience the magic.This game is for you if:-You love abandonned places and love to hear about their background stories.-You do not seek for very challenging puzzles, yet enjoy simple riddles.-You seek an unique experience based on the atmosphere and story instead on gameplay and mechanics.

												so first things first.. i really thought long about getting this game. read reviews every day but never watched any gameplay or stuff. Then i just did it and yeah like i knew before: it was worth it! So if you are thinkin about getting this game, does not matter which price, just buy it. But Only buy this if you are interested in getting in a world of clearly sadness and being alone for your own. You will like this game when you like to explore things for your own, getting behind secrets and why things are the way they are. Without any question this game is hearttaking, you are playing through a story about a life which has been forgotten, finding out where you are, what happened and especially who YOU are. The grey old but stunning atmosphere is amazingly sticking together with the melodic background music during the game and let's you feel the sadness and intensity of being alone in every single bone.It makes you think about what is really important when you have absolutely nothing left except a few flowers which you can let grow up by watering and get the very last things colorful in that grey world.Let this game take you in a new world completely apart from fighting, shooting and similiar. There are many discussions about the price, because you can finish this game in 3 hours, but the game is really worth its price			"

												The game was really nice and sad at times. The music draws you in and feels like there is no hope. Gameplay was easy movements does work with arrow keys but when your in an activity like entering the 4 digit number on the file bins and want to back out to open the drawer arrow keys wont work, you need to use the A-W-S-D keys to back out then you can continue with the arrow keys. This game had a CONSTANT BLACK SCREEN when starting on my newer PC with windows 10. I had to play this on a older PC to run perfect. Game is short and always Dark feeling. I personally didn't like the dark dream AXE scenes in the game.. That part could of been left out for me...solve puzzles and move forward. The errie dream AXE parts really made me almost not want to play. Puzzles are ok, some tough. I DID NOT LIKE THE ABC puzzles... took forever and was pointless.... But.... I'm a gamer and played the whole game and 10 being the best I would rate this a 7. Make the game longer, get rid of the AXE scenes and lower the price to $3.99 and this would be a bigger hit. Thanks for the fun game.			"

												Nice visuals, but that's all. You just walk around very slowly and that pretty much sums up this game, S-L-O-W, which gets boring very quickly. Bought it on sale for 8,99€ but absolutely not worth it. I don't recommend this game.			"

												Has merits but needed more time in the oven. Both design and Art has a special something but both fall short in implemenation. As a prototype of how to make a first game, this is passable, but eyes on the second attempt to see how the studio can grow. as a full priced game, it's an overreach, but if you see it one a sale for cheap, it's worth having a go.

												Firstly, don't buy this at full price, it really isn't worth it, but if you can get it at 50% off in a sale, then I wholeheartedly recomend it.The scenery is beautifully rendered, and just a little spooky.The first few levels are pretty basic, once you work out what to do, and the documents & books that you find will make absolutely no sense until you crack the code later on in the game.Go back then, and read all the documents you found for some enlightenment.First playthrough can be accomlished in 3 hours without pausing, and a replay can be done in less than an hour, although there really is little replay value in the game.Lovely relaxing soundtrack.80/100			"

												I absolutely loved playing this game, however due to it's length I would highly recommend waiting until it goes on sale. I loved the melancholy and eeriness of it. The soundtrack really is very relaxing. The puzzles aren't incredibly difficult to figure out, but aren't extremely easy either. I love exploration/puzzle games and highly recommend this for people looking for a more relaxing puzzle game.			"

												What a gorgeous game. A beautiful soundtrack along side stunning visuals with a story personal enough to bring tears to your eyes yet open-ended enough for personal interpretation. Homesick's ability to deliver powerful political and emotional ideas through simple puzzles and contrasting environments sets the perfect mood for empathizing with the main character as the storyline progresses. I cannot overstate how much of a masterpiece this game is.			"

												A perfect combination of the atmosphere of Dear Esther, the mechanics of Gone Home, and a third new element storytelling created by Lucky Pause. If you enjoy environmental games with 'escape the room'-esque elements, then this game is a guaranteed hit. It can seem frustrating at times as there are no real directions, but if you press on, you will eventually figure out each puzzle, and feel clever for doing so.			"

												At first I have to say the games graphics surprised me - this is a UDK game, not Unreal Engine 4, and so I was expecting less. But the graphics are just lovely, The graphic models, textures and lighting are so well put together.The game is a delight.The game is short - I finished in a little over 4 hours (and I'm usually a bit of a plodder, or even the type to give up on a game). But this is a wonderful game experience.You are given almost no help and that is 'by design' - the whole point is for you to discover what is going on and who you are and why you find yourself in this run down room, not knowing anything and seeing weird symbols all over the place...OK, if you are after danger or action only, then this might not be for you. You won't find them here.But if you'd like to do a few (relatively) simple puzzles that unfold a story, then you will be rewarded.I heartily recommend the game.			"

												I just finished Homesick, and I must say that I'm quite pleased with this gentle puzzler.  There is a hint of horror, but mostly it is an atmospheric walk throuh a contemporary, urban rruin.  I enjoy games that are based on the amnesia premise.  You wake up and don't know where you are or why. As you proceed, the word puzzles help you unlock the story and eventually solve the niggling questions of why you can't walk down a particular hall.  It all makes sense in the end. The puzzles are pretty straightforward with no races against the clock.  There are a couple of time-based features, but you get to keep trying those segments until you figure it out.   No pulse pounders here.The musical score is simple and  melodically repetitive in a beautiful way--very relaxing considering the stark setting and mild horror element.  I take a loooong time on games.  I spent a little under 5 hours on this one.  But then, I like to linger and relish the backstory, which  unfolded to give depth to what is at its core, a straightforward puzzle maze.  Very well done.  I recommend it.			"

												Not a bad game, but I don't think I can recommend for $15.  Finished in under 4 hours, reading all texts, and a decent amount of that seemed to be stretched by a lack of run function, although the inability to run does make a little sense in the final context.  Story wise, things start to unfold once you are able to decipher the texts.  It was a little underwhelming since I was able to guess the ending about halfway through.  The greatest strength of the game is the melancholy atmosphere which is aptly conveyed via the excellent, yet subdued soundtrack, and the reflective, somber, and sometimes entertaining letters and book excerpts.If you're desperate to kill a few hours, enjoy these ""walking simulator"" type atmospheric games, and have $15 to blow, go ahead.  Otherwise, wait until the game goes on sale.			"

												I wish Steam had a ""maybe"" for if I would recommend this game or not, simply because its something that defnitely should be explored but at the same time it's definitely not something the average person could pick up and appreciate. As always with any game I complete, here are some pros and cons to the game.Pros: 1) Aesthetically pleasing2) Soundrack is profound3) Great puzzles4) Easily lost in the beauty of the gameCons:1) Some of the puzzles might require you to google them (this probably isn't a con, but I have to be picky)2) The story can easily be found in the texts in the game, which makes you put in extra work to understand what's going on because nothing is explained to you (I enjoyed this personally, but you could argue that a game shouldn't make you read text in game to make you have an idea of what is going on, etc""			"

												Slow to start, but once it gets going, is thoroughly engrossing. While the core mechanics and storytelling are solid enough, the pacing never really hits a good rhythm. The environmental design and music are top-notch, but poor optimization detracts from the immersion; it's a solid and captivating puzzler, but may be best bought on sale.Overall: 6.5/10 "

												This game transcends into art and affected me on an emotional level. The lonely atmostphere is beautifully created with elements of great piano pieces,  floating blue flowers, desolate rooms, and a striking contrast of light and dark.   The puzzles made sense and didn't frustrate me like so many other games.  Great game on a cold rainy day. Though short, I Loved it.			"

Playing it is sort of a zen-like experience.  There was a little translation mini-game that I enjoyed.
